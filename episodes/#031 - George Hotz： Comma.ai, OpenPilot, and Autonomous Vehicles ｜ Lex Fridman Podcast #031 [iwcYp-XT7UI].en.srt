00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:02,969
my conversation with George Hotz do you
 

51
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,440
my conversation with George Hotz do you
think we're living in a simulation

52
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:06,450

 

53
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,260

yes but it may be unfalsifiable what do

54
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,270
yes but it may be unfalsifiable what do
 

55
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:12,930
yes but it may be unfalsifiable what do
you mean by unfalsifiable so if the

56
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:12,940
you mean by unfalsifiable so if the
 

57
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,070
you mean by unfalsifiable so if the
simulation is designed in such a way

58
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,080
simulation is designed in such a way
 

59
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,770
simulation is designed in such a way
that they did like a formal proof to

60
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:19,780
that they did like a formal proof to
 

61
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,750
that they did like a formal proof to
show that no information can get in and

62
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:21,760
show that no information can get in and
 

63
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,880
show that no information can get in and
out and if their hardware is designed to

64
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:23,890
out and if their hardware is designed to
 

65
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,040
out and if their hardware is designed to
for the anything in the simulation to

66
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,050
for the anything in the simulation to
 

67
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,080
for the anything in the simulation to
always keep the hardware in spec it may

68
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,090
always keep the hardware in spec it may
 

69
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,880
always keep the hardware in spec it may
be impossible to prove whether we're in

70
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:29,890
be impossible to prove whether we're in
 

71
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,700
be impossible to prove whether we're in
a simulation or not

72
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:31,710
a simulation or not
 

73
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,860
a simulation or not
so they've designed it such there's the

74
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:34,870
so they've designed it such there's the
 

75
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,540
so they've designed it such there's the
closed system you can't get outside of

76
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:36,550
closed system you can't get outside of
 

77
00:01:36,550 --> 00:01:37,080
closed system you can't get outside of
the system

78
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,090
the system
 

79
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:38,730
the system
well maybe it's one of three worlds

80
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:38,740
well maybe it's one of three worlds
 

81
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,380
well maybe it's one of three worlds
we're either in a simulation which can

82
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,390
we're either in a simulation which can
 

83
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,420
we're either in a simulation which can
be exploited we're in a simulation which

84
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:42,430
be exploited we're in a simulation which
 

85
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:44,760
be exploited we're in a simulation which
not only can't be exploited but like the

86
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:44,770
not only can't be exploited but like the
 

87
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,100
not only can't be exploited but like the
same things too about VMs I'm a really

88
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,110
same things too about VMs I'm a really
 

89
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:49,050
same things too about VMs I'm a really
well-designed VM you can't even detect

90
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:49,060
well-designed VM you can't even detect
 

91
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,450
well-designed VM you can't even detect
if you're in a VM or not that's

92
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:51,460
if you're in a VM or not that's
 

93
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,230
if you're in a VM or not that's
brilliant

94
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
brilliant
 

95
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,900
brilliant
so where it's yeah so the simulation is

96
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:54,910
so where it's yeah so the simulation is
 

97
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:57,359
so where it's yeah so the simulation is
running in a virtual machine but now in

98
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:57,369
running in a virtual machine but now in
 

99
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:58,980
running in a virtual machine but now in
reality all VMs have wasted the fact

100
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:58,990
reality all VMs have wasted the fact
 

101
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,200
reality all VMs have wasted the fact
that's the point I mean is it

102
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,210
that's the point I mean is it
 

103
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,300
that's the point I mean is it
yeah you've done quite a bit of hacking

104
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,310
yeah you've done quite a bit of hacking
 

105
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,990
yeah you've done quite a bit of hacking
yourself and so you should know that

106
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,000
yourself and so you should know that
 

107
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,940
yourself and so you should know that
really any complicated system will have

108
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:08,950
really any complicated system will have
 

109
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,180
really any complicated system will have
ways in and out so this isn't

110
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,190
ways in and out so this isn't
 

111
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,780
ways in and out so this isn't
necessarily true going forward I spent

112
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:15,790
necessarily true going forward I spent
 

113
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,140
necessarily true going forward I spent
my time away from comma I learned

114
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,150
my time away from comma I learned
 

115
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:22,110
my time away from comma I learned
and said dependently typed like it's a

116
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,120
and said dependently typed like it's a
 

117
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,690
and said dependently typed like it's a
language for writing math proofs and if

118
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:24,700
language for writing math proofs and if
 

119
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,910
language for writing math proofs and if
you write code that compiles in a

120
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:26,920
you write code that compiles in a
 

121
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:27,900
you write code that compiles in a
language like that

122
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:27,910
language like that
 

123
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,560
language like that
it is correct by definition the types

124
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:31,570
it is correct by definition the types
 

125
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,050
it is correct by definition the types
check it's correct and so it's possible

126
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,060
check it's correct and so it's possible
 

127
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,370
check it's correct and so it's possible
that the simulation is written in a

128
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:35,380
that the simulation is written in a
 

129
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,479
that the simulation is written in a
language like this in which case yeah

130
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:39,489
language like this in which case yeah
 

131
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,000
language like this in which case yeah
yeah but that can't be sufficiently

132
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,010
yeah but that can't be sufficiently
 

133
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,860
yeah but that can't be sufficiently
expressive a language like that all

134
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:43,870
expressive a language like that all
 

135
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,390
expressive a language like that all
weekend it can be yeah okay well so all

136
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
weekend it can be yeah okay well so all
 

137
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,890
weekend it can be yeah okay well so all
right so the simulation doesn't have to

138
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:49,900
right so the simulation doesn't have to
 

139
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,390
right so the simulation doesn't have to
be tiring complete if it has a scheduled

140
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:51,400
be tiring complete if it has a scheduled
 

141
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,160
be tiring complete if it has a scheduled
end date looks like it does actually

142
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:53,170
end date looks like it does actually
 

143
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:55,920
end date looks like it does actually
with entropy and you know I don't think

144
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:55,930
with entropy and you know I don't think
 

145
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,720
with entropy and you know I don't think
that a simulation that results in

146
00:02:59,720 --> 00:02:59,730
that a simulation that results in
 

147
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,050
that a simulation that results in
something as complicated in universe

148
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:03,060
something as complicated in universe
 

149
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,050
something as complicated in universe
would have a formal proof of correctness

150
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,060
would have a formal proof of correctness
 

151
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,199
would have a formal proof of correctness
right as as possible of course we have

152
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,209
right as as possible of course we have
 

153
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,020
right as as possible of course we have
no idea how good their tooling is and we

154
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,030
no idea how good their tooling is and we
 

155
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,729
no idea how good their tooling is and we
have no idea how complicated the

156
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:14,739
have no idea how complicated the
 

157
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,559
have no idea how complicated the
universe computer really is it may be

158
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:16,569
universe computer really is it may be
 

159
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:19,530
universe computer really is it may be
quite simple it's just very large right

160
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:19,540
quite simple it's just very large right
 

161
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,289
quite simple it's just very large right
it's very it's definitely very large but

162
00:03:22,289 --> 00:03:22,299
it's very it's definitely very large but
 

163
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:24,119
it's very it's definitely very large but
the fundamental rules might be super

164
00:03:24,119 --> 00:03:24,129
the fundamental rules might be super
 

165
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:25,619
the fundamental rules might be super
simple yeah Conway's gonna live kind of

166
00:03:25,619 --> 00:03:25,629
simple yeah Conway's gonna live kind of
 

167
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:30,449
simple yeah Conway's gonna live kind of
stuff right so if you could hack it so

168
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:30,459
stuff right so if you could hack it so
 

169
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:32,280
stuff right so if you could hack it so
imagine the simulation that is hackable

170
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:32,290
imagine the simulation that is hackable
 

171
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,660
imagine the simulation that is hackable
if you could hack it what would you

172
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:36,670
if you could hack it what would you
 

173
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,369
if you could hack it what would you
change about the you know like how would

174
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:38,379
change about the you know like how would
 

175
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:41,729
change about the you know like how would
you approach hacking a simulation the

176
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:41,739
you approach hacking a simulation the
 

177
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:45,119
you approach hacking a simulation the
reason I gave that talk I by the way I'm

178
00:03:45,119 --> 00:03:45,129
reason I gave that talk I by the way I'm
 

179
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,740
reason I gave that talk I by the way I'm
not familiar with the talk he gave I

180
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:46,750
not familiar with the talk he gave I
 

181
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:49,319
not familiar with the talk he gave I
just read that you talked about escaping

182
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:49,329
just read that you talked about escaping
 

183
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,599
just read that you talked about escaping
the simulation yeah like that so maybe

184
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:51,609
the simulation yeah like that so maybe
 

185
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:53,039
the simulation yeah like that so maybe
you can tell me a little bit about the

186
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:53,049
you can tell me a little bit about the
 

187
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,949
you can tell me a little bit about the
theme and the message there - it wasn't

188
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:55,959
theme and the message there - it wasn't
 

189
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,110
theme and the message there - it wasn't
a very practical talk about how to

190
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:58,120
a very practical talk about how to
 

191
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,199
a very practical talk about how to
actually escape a simulation it was more

192
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:01,209
actually escape a simulation it was more
 

193
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,420
actually escape a simulation it was more
about a way of restructuring an

194
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:03,430
about a way of restructuring an
 

195
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:09,180
about a way of restructuring an
us-versus-them narrative if we continue

196
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,190
us-versus-them narrative if we continue
 

197
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,699
us-versus-them narrative if we continue
on the path we're going with technology

198
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:11,709
on the path we're going with technology
 

199
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,710
on the path we're going with technology
I think we're in big trouble

200
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:13,720
I think we're in big trouble
 

201
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,379
I think we're in big trouble
like as a species and not just as a

202
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:16,389
like as a species and not just as a
 

203
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:17,939
like as a species and not just as a
species but even as me as an individual

204
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:17,949
species but even as me as an individual
 

205
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:20,969
species but even as me as an individual
member of the species so if we could

206
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:20,979
member of the species so if we could
 

207
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,000
member of the species so if we could
change rhetoric to be more like to think

208
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,010
change rhetoric to be more like to think
 

209
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,409
change rhetoric to be more like to think
upwards like to think about that we're

210
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:28,419
upwards like to think about that we're
 

211
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:29,790
upwards like to think about that we're
in a simulation and how we could get out

212
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:29,800
in a simulation and how we could get out
 

213
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,850
in a simulation and how we could get out
already we'd be on the right path what

214
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:32,860
already we'd be on the right path what
 

215
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,980
already we'd be on the right path what
you actually do once you do that while I

216
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:34,990
you actually do once you do that while I
 

217
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,689
you actually do once you do that while I
assume I would have acquired way more

218
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:36,699
assume I would have acquired way more
 

219
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:38,100
assume I would have acquired way more
intelligence in the process of doing

220
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,110
intelligence in the process of doing
 

221
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,290
intelligence in the process of doing
that so I'll just ask that so the the

222
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:40,300
that so I'll just ask that so the the
 

223
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,890
that so I'll just ask that so the the
thinking upwards what kind of ideas what

224
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:43,900
thinking upwards what kind of ideas what
 

225
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,180
thinking upwards what kind of ideas what
kind of breakthrough ideas do you think

226
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,190
kind of breakthrough ideas do you think
 

227
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,570
kind of breakthrough ideas do you think
thinking in that way could inspire and

228
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:47,580
thinking in that way could inspire and
 

229
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,490
thinking in that way could inspire and
what did you say upwards upwards into

230
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:50,500
what did you say upwards upwards into
 

231
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,110
what did you say upwards upwards into
space are you thinking sort of

232
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:52,120
space are you thinking sort of
 

233
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,010
space are you thinking sort of
exploration in all forms the space

narrative that held for the modernist
 

237
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,080
narrative that held for the modernist
generation doesn't hold as well for the

generation doesn't hold as well for the

what's the space narrator we're talking

242
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:05,770
what's the space narrator we're talking
 

243
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,170
what's the space narrator we're talking
about the same space the dimensional

244
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:07,180
about the same space the dimensional

and the narrative your friend was born

254
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:15,250
and the narrative your friend was born
 

255
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,529
and the narrative your friend was born
in the Soviet Union you're referring to

256
00:05:16,529 --> 00:05:16,539
in the Soviet Union you're referring to
 

257
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:18,390
in the Soviet Union you're referring to
the race to space the race to space

explore okay that was a great modernist

260
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:21,159
explore okay that was a great modernist

263
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,180

it doesn't seem to hold the same weight

264
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:25,190
it doesn't seem to hold the same weight
 

265
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:29,430
it doesn't seem to hold the same weight
in today's culture I'm hoping for good

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:29,440
in today's culture I'm hoping for good
 

267
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
in today's culture I'm hoping for good
postmodern narratives that replace it so

268
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,330
postmodern narratives that replace it so
 

269
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,659
postmodern narratives that replace it so
think let's think so you work a lot with

270
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:34,669
think let's think so you work a lot with
 

271
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:37,659
think let's think so you work a lot with
AI so the eyes one formulation of that

272
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:37,669
AI so the eyes one formulation of that
 

273
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,180
AI so the eyes one formulation of that
narrative there could be also I don't

274
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,190
narrative there could be also I don't
 

275
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,860
narrative there could be also I don't
know how much you do in VR and they are

276
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:41,870
know how much you do in VR and they are
 

277
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,620
know how much you do in VR and they are
yeah that's another eye I know less

278
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:44,630
yeah that's another eye I know less
 

279
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,420
yeah that's another eye I know less
about it but every time I play with it

280
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:46,430
about it but every time I play with it
 

281
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,550
about it but every time I play with it
and our research is fascinating that

virtual world are you are you interested
 

285
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,719
virtual world are you are you interested
in the virtual world I would like to

286
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:52,729
in the virtual world I would like to
 

287
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:55,779
in the virtual world I would like to
move to a virtual reality in terms of

00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:55,789
move to a virtual reality in terms of
 

289
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,350
move to a virtual reality in terms of
your work

290
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,360
your work
 

291
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,900
your work
no I would like to physically move there

292
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:57,910
no I would like to physically move there
 

293
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:00,310
no I would like to physically move there
the apartment I can rent in the cloud is

294
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:00,320
the apartment I can rent in the cloud is
 

295
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,480
the apartment I can rent in the cloud is
way better in the apartment I can rent

296
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,490
way better in the apartment I can rent
 

297
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,060
way better in the apartment I can rent
in the real world well it's all relative

298
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:04,070
in the real world well it's all relative
 

299
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,370
in the real world well it's all relative
isn't it because others will have very

300
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:06,380
isn't it because others will have very
 

301
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,779
isn't it because others will have very
nice departments too so you'll be

302
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:07,789
nice departments too so you'll be
 

303
00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:09,610
nice departments too so you'll be
inferior in the virtual world that's not

304
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:09,620
inferior in the virtual world that's not
 

305
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,740
inferior in the virtual world that's not
how I view the world right I don't view

306
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:11,750

307
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,360
how I view the world right I don't view
the world I mean it's very like like

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:13,370
the world I mean it's very like like
 

309
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,999
the world I mean it's very like like
almost zero-sum issue a to view the

almost zero-sum issue a to view the
world say like my great apartment isn't

312
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:18,410
world say like my great apartment isn't
 

313
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,529
world say like my great apartment isn't
great because my neighbor has one - no

314
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:20,539
great because my neighbor has one - no
 

315
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:21,939
great because my neighbor has one - no
my great apartment is great because like

316
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:21,949
my great apartment is great because like
 

317
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,400
my great apartment is great because like
look at this dishwasher man yeah you

318
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:24,410
look at this dishwasher man yeah you
 

319
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,540
look at this dishwasher man yeah you
just touch the dish and it's washed

320
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,550
just touch the dish and it's washed
 

321
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,600
just touch the dish and it's washed
right and that is great in and of itself

322
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:28,610
right and that is great in and of itself
 

323
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:30,279
right and that is great in and of itself
if I have the only apartment or if

324
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,289
if I have the only apartment or if
 

325
00:06:30,289 --> 00:06:31,899
if I have the only apartment or if
everybody had the apartment I don't care

326
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:31,909
everybody had the apartment I don't care
 

327
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:34,930
everybody had the apartment I don't care
so you have fundamental gratitude the

328
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:34,940
so you have fundamental gratitude the
 

329
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,500
so you have fundamental gratitude the
the world first learned of Geo ha George

330
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,510
the world first learned of Geo ha George

Hotz in August 2007 maybe before then

332
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:42,199
Hotz in August 2007 maybe before then
 

333
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,320
Hotz in August 2007 maybe before then
but certainly in August 2007 when you

334
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,330
but certainly in August 2007 when you
 

335
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,020
but certainly in August 2007 when you
were the first person to unlock carry

336
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,030
were the first person to unlock carry
 

337
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,960
were the first person to unlock carry
unlock an iPhone how did you get into

338
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:49,970
unlock an iPhone how did you get into
 

339
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,050
unlock an iPhone how did you get into
hacking what was the first system you

340
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,060
hacking what was the first system you
 

341
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,460
hacking what was the first system you
discovered vulnerabilities for and broke

342
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:54,470
discovered vulnerabilities for and broke
 

343
00:06:54,470 --> 00:07:00,249
discovered vulnerabilities for and broke
into so that was really kind of the

344
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:00,259
into so that was really kind of the
 

345
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:03,580
into so that was really kind of the
first thing I had I had a book in in

346
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:03,590
first thing I had I had a book in in
 

347
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:08,980
first thing I had I had a book in in
2006 called grey hat hacking and I guess

348
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:08,990
2006 called grey hat hacking and I guess
 

349
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,339
2006 called grey hat hacking and I guess
I realized that if you acquired these

350
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:12,349
I realized that if you acquired these
 

351
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:14,589
I realized that if you acquired these
sort of powers you could control the

352
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:14,599
sort of powers you could control the
 

353
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,670
sort of powers you could control the
world but I didn't really know that much

354
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:18,680
world but I didn't really know that much
 

355
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,010
world but I didn't really know that much
about computers back then I started with

356
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,020
about computers back then I started with
 

357
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,350
about computers back then I started with
electronics the first iPhone hack was

358
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:23,360
electronics the first iPhone hack was
 

359
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,839
electronics the first iPhone hack was
physical card work um you had to open it

360
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:25,849
physical card work um you had to open it
 

361
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:28,960
physical card work um you had to open it
up and pull an address line high and it

362
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:28,970
up and pull an address line high and it
 

363
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,010
up and pull an address line high and it
was because I didn't really know about

364
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:30,020
was because I didn't really know about
 

365
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,870
was because I didn't really know about
software exploitation I learned that all

366
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:31,880
software exploitation I learned that all
 

367
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,399
software exploitation I learned that all
in the next few years and I got very

368
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:33,409
in the next few years and I got very
 

369
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:36,129
in the next few years and I got very
good at it but back then I knew about

370
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:36,139
good at it but back then I knew about
 

371
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,090
good at it but back then I knew about
like how men

372
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,100
like how men
 

373
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,010
like how men

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,830
was physical was the most hard work
 

383
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,040
was physical was the most hard work
actually if you read the code that I

384
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,050
actually if you read the code that I
 

385
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,210
actually if you read the code that I
released with that

386
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:52,220
released with that
 

387
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,390
released with that
in August 2007 it's atrocious

388
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:55,400
in August 2007 it's atrocious
 

389
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,420
in August 2007 it's atrocious

know how to program man so how did you

394
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:04,880
know how to program man so how did you
 

395
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,540
know how to program man so how did you
learn to program

396
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:06,550
learn to program
 

397
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,220
learn to program
what was your journey cuz I mean we'll

398
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:09,230
what was your journey cuz I mean we'll
 

399
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,260
what was your journey cuz I mean we'll
talk about it you've live streams from

400
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:11,270
talk about it you've live streams from
 

401
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,270
talk about it you've live streams from
your programming man this is a chaotic

402
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
your programming man this is a chaotic
 

403
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,010
your programming man this is a chaotic
beautiful mess how did you arrive at

404
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,020
beautiful mess how did you arrive at
 

405
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,540
beautiful mess how did you arrive at
that years and years of practice I

406
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:18,550
that years and years of practice I
 

407
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:22,630
that years and years of practice I
interned at Google after the summer

408
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:22,640
interned at Google after the summer
 

409
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,480
interned at Google after the summer
after the iPhone unlock and I did a

410
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:25,490
after the iPhone unlock and I did a
 

411
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,850
after the iPhone unlock and I did a
contract for them where I built hardware

412
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:27,860
contract for them where I built hardware
 

413
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,620
contract for them where I built hardware
for for Street View and I wrote a

414
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:29,630
for for Street View and I wrote a
 

415
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,219
for for Street View and I wrote a
software library to interact with it and

416
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:32,229
software library to interact with it and
 

417
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,440
software library to interact with it and
it was terrible code and for the first

418
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,450
it was terrible code and for the first
 

419
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,060
it was terrible code and for the first
time I got feedback from people who I

420
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,070
time I got feedback from people who I
 

421
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,520
time I got feedback from people who I
respected saying you know like don't

422
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:39,530
respected saying you know like don't
 

423
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,240
respected saying you know like don't
write code like this now of course just

424
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,250
write code like this now of course just
 

425
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,820
write code like this now of course just
getting that feedback is not enough the

426
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:45,830
getting that feedback is not enough the
 

427
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:51,310
getting that feedback is not enough the
way that I really got good was I wanted

428
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,320
way that I really got good was I wanted
 

429
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,890
way that I really got good was I wanted
to write this thing like that could

430
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:52,900
to write this thing like that could
 

431
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,790
to write this thing like that could
emulate and then visualize like armed

432
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:57,800
emulate and then visualize like armed
 

433
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,080
emulate and then visualize like armed
binaries because I wanted to hack the

434
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,090
binaries because I wanted to hack the
 

435
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,760
binaries because I wanted to hack the
iPhone better and I didn't like that I

436
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:00,770
iPhone better and I didn't like that I
 

437
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:02,290
iPhone better and I didn't like that I
couldn't like see what that I couldn't

438
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:02,300
couldn't like see what that I couldn't
 

439
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,370
couldn't like see what that I couldn't
single step through the processor

440
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:03,380
single step through the processor
 

441
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,960
single step through the processor
because I had no debugger on there

442
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:04,970
because I had no debugger on there
 

443
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,250
because I had no debugger on there
especially for the low level things like

444
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:06,260
especially for the low level things like
 

445
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,630
especially for the low level things like
the boot ROM in the bootloader so I

446
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:07,640
the boot ROM in the bootloader so I
 

447
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,630
the boot ROM in the bootloader so I
tried to build this tool to do it

448
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:10,640
tried to build this tool to do it
 

449
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,030
tried to build this tool to do it
and I built the tool once and it was

450
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,040
and I built the tool once and it was
 

451
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,320
and I built the tool once and it was
terrible I built the tool second times

452
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,330
terrible I built the tool second times
 

453
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,040
terrible I built the tool second times
it was terrible

454
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,050
it was terrible
 

455
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,750
it was terrible
I built the tool third time this by the

456
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:16,760
I built the tool third time this by the
 

457
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
I built the tool third time this by the
time I was at Facebook it was kind of

458
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:17,930
time I was at Facebook it was kind of
 

459
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:18,430
time I was at Facebook it was kind of
okay

460
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:18,440
okay
 

461
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,080
okay
and then I built the tool fourth time

462
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,090
and then I built the tool fourth time
 

463
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,480
and then I built the tool fourth time
when I was a Google intern again in 2014

464
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:22,490
when I was a Google intern again in 2014
 

465
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,740
when I was a Google intern again in 2014
and that was the first time I was like

466
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:23,750
and that was the first time I was like
 

467
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,110
and that was the first time I was like
this is finally usable how do you

468
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,120
this is finally usable how do you
 

469
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,700
this is finally usable how do you
pronounce this kira-kira yeah

470
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:27,710
pronounce this kira-kira yeah
 

471
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,240
pronounce this kira-kira yeah
so it's essentially the most efficient

472
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,250
so it's essentially the most efficient
 

473
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,630
so it's essentially the most efficient
way to visualize the change of state of

474
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
way to visualize the change of state of
 

475
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,700
way to visualize the change of state of
the computer as the program is running

476
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:36,710
the computer as the program is running
 

477
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,760
the computer as the program is running
that's what I mean by debugger yeah it's

478
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:39,770
that's what I mean by debugger yeah it's
 

479
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,670
that's what I mean by debugger yeah it's
a timeless debugger so you can rewind

480
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:42,680
a timeless debugger so you can rewind
 

481
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,220
a timeless debugger so you can rewind
just as easily as going forward think

482
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:45,230
just as easily as going forward think
 

483
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,510
just as easily as going forward think
about if you're using gdb you have to

484
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:46,520
about if you're using gdb you have to
 

485
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,310
about if you're using gdb you have to
put a watch on a variable if you want to

486
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:48,320
put a watch on a variable if you want to
 

487
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,020
put a watch on a variable if you want to
see if that variable changes and Kure

488
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:50,030
see if that variable changes and Kure
 

489
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,430
see if that variable changes and Kure
you can just click on that variable and

490
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
you can just click on that variable and
 

491
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,980
you can just click on that variable and
then it shows every single time when

492
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:53,990
then it shows every single time when
 

493
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,810
then it shows every single time when
that variable was changed or accessed

494
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:55,820
that variable was changed or accessed
 

495
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,550
that variable was changed or accessed
think about it like get for your

496
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:57,560
think about it like get for your
 

497
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,010
think about it like get for your
computers uh the run lock so there's

498
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,020
computers uh the run lock so there's
 

499
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,230
computers uh the run lock so there's
like a deep log of of the state of the

500
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:05,240
like a deep log of of the state of the
 

501
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,820
like a deep log of of the state of the
computer as the program runs and you can

502
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:06,830
computer as the program runs and you can
 

503
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,570
computer as the program runs and you can
rewind why isn't that maybe it is maybe

504
00:10:10,570 --> 00:10:10,580
rewind why isn't that maybe it is maybe
 

505
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,310
rewind why isn't that maybe it is maybe
you can educate me what isn't that kind

506
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
you can educate me what isn't that kind
 

507
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,740
you can educate me what isn't that kind
of debugging used more often ah because

508
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:14,750
of debugging used more often ah because
 

509
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,610
of debugging used more often ah because
the tooling is bad

510
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:15,620
the tooling is bad
 

511
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,010
the tooling is bad
well two things one if you're trying to

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,020
well two things one if you're trying to
 

513
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,820
well two things one if you're trying to
debug chrome chrome is a 200 megabyte

binary that runs slowly on desktops so

516
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:25,580
binary that runs slowly on desktops so
 

517
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,770
binary that runs slowly on desktops so
that's going to be really hard to use

518
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:26,780
that's going to be really hard to use
 

519
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,720
that's going to be really hard to use
for that but it's really good to use for

520
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:28,730
for that but it's really good to use for
 

521
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,750
for that but it's really good to use for
like CTFs and for boot roms and for

522
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:31,760
like CTFs and for boot roms and for
 

523
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,150
like CTFs and for boot roms and for
small parts of code so it's it's hard if

524
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
small parts of code so it's it's hard if
 

525
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,590
small parts of code so it's it's hard if
you're trying to debug like massive

526
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
you're trying to debug like massive
 

527
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,540
you're trying to debug like massive

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,130
you learned about maybe at the high
 

547
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,800

00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,960
these competitions the like I feel like
like in the heyday of CTFs you had all

552
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:04,970
like in the heyday of CTFs you had all
 

553
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,830
like in the heyday of CTFs you had all
of the best security people in the world

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:16,580
break it and when you break it you get
 

563
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,890
break it and when you break it you get
like there's like a file on the server

like there's like a file on the server
 

565
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,470
like there's like a file on the server
called flag and then there's a program

566
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
called flag and then there's a program
 

567
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,880
called flag and then there's a program
running listening on a socket that's

running listening on a socket that's
 

569
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,249
running listening on a socket that's
vulnerable so you write an exploit you

570
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:24,259
vulnerable so you write an exploit you
 

571
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,139
vulnerable so you write an exploit you
she'll and then you cat flag and then

572
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,149
she'll and then you cat flag and then
 

573
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:27,789
she'll and then you cat flag and then
you type the flag into like a web-based

574
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:27,799
you type the flag into like a web-based
 

575
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:29,769
you type the flag into like a web-based
scoreboard and you get points so the

576
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:29,779
scoreboard and you get points so the
 

577
00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:32,439
scoreboard and you get points so the
goal is essentially to find an exploit

578
00:11:32,439 --> 00:11:32,449
goal is essentially to find an exploit
 

579
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,849
goal is essentially to find an exploit

because I'm Russian but maybe you can

598
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:57,889
because I'm Russian but maybe you can
 

599
00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:01,090
because I'm Russian but maybe you can
help educate me some video game like

600
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:01,100
help educate me some video game like
 

601
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,249
help educate me some video game like
misspell to own way back in the Mia and

602
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:03,259
misspell to own way back in the Mia and
 

603
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,679
misspell to own way back in the Mia and
there's just I wonder if there's a

604
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:05,689
there's just I wonder if there's a
 

605
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:06,969
there's just I wonder if there's a
definition I'll have to go to urban

606
00:12:06,969 --> 00:12:06,979
definition I'll have to go to urban
 

607
00:12:06,979 --> 00:12:10,809
definition I'll have to go to urban
dictionary for it okay so what was the

608
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:10,819
dictionary for it okay so what was the
 

609
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,359
dictionary for it okay so what was the
heyday seat yeah by the way but was it

610
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:13,369
heyday seat yeah by the way but was it
 

611
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,969
heyday seat yeah by the way but was it
what decade are we talking about I think

612
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:15,979
what decade are we talking about I think
 

613
00:12:15,979 --> 00:12:18,489
what decade are we talking about I think
like I mean maybe I'm biased because

614
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:18,499
like I mean maybe I'm biased because
 

615
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:21,539
like I mean maybe I'm biased because
it's the era that that that I played but

616
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:21,549
it's the era that that that I played but
 

617
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:29,619
it's the era that that that I played but
like 2011 to 2015 because the modern CTF

618
00:12:29,619 --> 00:12:29,629
like 2011 to 2015 because the modern CTF
 

619
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,329
like 2011 to 2015 because the modern CTF
scene is similar to the modern

620
00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:31,339
scene is similar to the modern
 

621
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:32,889
scene is similar to the modern
competitive programming scene you have

622
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:32,899
competitive programming scene you have
 

623
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:34,479
competitive programming scene you have
people who like do drills you have

624
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:34,489
people who like do drills you have
 

625
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:36,340
people who like do drills you have
people who practice and then once you've

626
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,350
people who practice and then once you've
 

627
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,259
people who practice and then once you've
done that you've turned it lesson to a

628
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:38,269
done that you've turned it lesson to a
 

629
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:40,269
done that you've turned it lesson to a
game of generic computer skill and more

630
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:40,279

drill on these five categories and then
 

635
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:49,389
drill on these five categories and then
before that it wasn't it didn't have

means I mean money's money but that
 

647
00:13:00,169 --> 00:13:02,049

means there was probably good people
 

649
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:05,019
means there was probably good people
there exactly yeah are the challenges

00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:05,029
there exactly yeah are the challenges
 

651
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:08,109
there exactly yeah are the challenges
human constructive or are they grounded

652
00:13:08,109 --> 00:13:08,119
human constructive or are they grounded
 

653
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,049
human constructive or are they grounded
in some real flaws and real systems

654
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:10,059
in some real flaws and real systems
 

655
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,119
in some real flaws and real systems
usually they're human constructed but

656
00:13:13,119 --> 00:13:13,129
usually they're human constructed but
 

657
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,939
usually they're human constructed but
they're usually inspired by real flaws

658
00:13:14,939 --> 00:13:14,949
they're usually inspired by real flaws
 

659
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:17,349
they're usually inspired by real flaws
what kind of systems are imagined is

660
00:13:17,349 --> 00:13:17,359
what kind of systems are imagined is
 

661
00:13:17,359 --> 00:13:19,509
what kind of systems are imagined is
really focused on mobile like what has

662
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:19,519
really focused on mobile like what has
 

663
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,519
really focused on mobile like what has
vulnerabilities these days is it does

664
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:21,529
vulnerabilities these days is it does
 

665
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:24,699
vulnerabilities these days is it does
primarily mobile systems like Android

666
00:13:24,699 --> 00:13:24,709
primarily mobile systems like Android
 

667
00:13:24,709 --> 00:13:28,179

671
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,869
price has kind of gone up because less
and less people can find them and what's

672
00:13:31,869 --> 00:13:31,879
and less people can find them and what's
 

673
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,429
and less people can find them and what's
happened in security is now if you want

674
00:13:33,429 --> 00:13:33,439
happened in security is now if you want
 

675
00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:34,749
happened in security is now if you want
to like jailbreak an iPhone you don't

676
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:34,759
to like jailbreak an iPhone you don't
 

677
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,880
to like jailbreak an iPhone you don't
need one exploit anymore you need nine

678
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:37,890
need one exploit anymore you need nine
 

679
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,769

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,110
Wow okay so it's really so what's the
 

683
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:45,829
Wow okay so it's really so what's the
but what's the benefit speaking higher

684
00:13:45,829 --> 00:13:45,839
but what's the benefit speaking higher
 

685
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,690
but what's the benefit speaking higher
level philosophically about hacking I

686
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:47,700
level philosophically about hacking I
 

687
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,790
level philosophically about hacking I
mean it sounds from everything I've seen

688
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:49,800
mean it sounds from everything I've seen
 

689
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,620
mean it sounds from everything I've seen
about you you just love the challenge

690
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,630
about you you just love the challenge
 

691
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,160
about you you just love the challenge
and you don't want to do anything you

692
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,170
and you don't want to do anything you
 

693
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,230
and you don't want to do anything you
don't want to bring that exploit out

694
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:57,240
don't want to bring that exploit out
 

695
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,980
don't want to bring that exploit out
into the world and doing the actual let

696
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:00,990
into the world and doing the actual let
 

697
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,720
into the world and doing the actual let
it run wild you just want to solve it

698
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:02,730
it run wild you just want to solve it
 

699
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,810
it run wild you just want to solve it
and then you go on to the next thing oh

700
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:04,820
and then you go on to the next thing oh
 

701
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,639
and then you go on to the next thing oh
yeah I mean doing criminal stuffs not

702
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:07,649
yeah I mean doing criminal stuffs not
 

703
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:09,590
yeah I mean doing criminal stuffs not
really worth it and I'll actually use

704
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600
really worth it and I'll actually use
 

705
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,540
really worth it and I'll actually use
the same argument for why I don't do

706
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:11,550
the same argument for why I don't do
 

707
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,830
the same argument for why I don't do
defense for why I don't do crime

708
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:14,840
defense for why I don't do crime
 

709
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,110
defense for why I don't do crime
if you want to defend a system say the

710
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
if you want to defend a system say the
 

711
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,900
if you want to defend a system say the
system has ten holes right if you find

712
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:19,910
system has ten holes right if you find
 

713
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,910
system has ten holes right if you find
nine of those holes as a defender you

714
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
nine of those holes as a defender you
 

715
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,190
nine of those holes as a defender you
still lose because the attacker gets in

716
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:24,200
still lose because the attacker gets in
 

717
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,840
still lose because the attacker gets in
through the last one if you're an

718
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:25,850
through the last one if you're an
 

719
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:27,310
through the last one if you're an
attacker you only have to find one out

720
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,320
attacker you only have to find one out
 

721
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,490
attacker you only have to find one out
of the ten but if you're a criminal if

722
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:30,500
of the ten but if you're a criminal if
 

723
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,060
of the ten but if you're a criminal if
you log on with a VPN nine out of the

724
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,070
you log on with a VPN nine out of the
 

725
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,610
you log on with a VPN nine out of the
ten times but one time you forget you're

726
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:36,620
ten times but one time you forget you're
 

727
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:39,460
ten times but one time you forget you're
done because you're caught okay because

728
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,470
done because you're caught okay because
 

729
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,380
done because you're caught okay because
you only have to mess up once to be

730
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:41,390
you only have to mess up once to be
 

731
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,120
you only have to mess up once to be
caught as a criminal yeah that's why I'm

732
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:43,130
caught as a criminal yeah that's why I'm
 

733
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,060
caught as a criminal yeah that's why I'm
not a criminal

734
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,070
not a criminal
 

735
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:48,040
not a criminal
but okay let me uh that's having a

736
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,050
but okay let me uh that's having a
 

737
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,380
but okay let me uh that's having a
discussion with somebody just at a high

738
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:50,390
discussion with somebody just at a high
 

739
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,900
discussion with somebody just at a high
level about nuclear weapons actually why

740
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:52,910
level about nuclear weapons actually why
 

741
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:55,870
level about nuclear weapons actually why
we're having blowing ourselves up yet

742
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:55,880
we're having blowing ourselves up yet
 

743
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,300
we're having blowing ourselves up yet
and my feeling is all the smart people

744
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:58,310
and my feeling is all the smart people
 

745
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,310
and my feeling is all the smart people
in the world look at the distribution of

746
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
in the world look at the distribution of
 

747
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,290
in the world look at the distribution of
smart people smart people are generally

748
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:05,300
smart people smart people are generally
 

749
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,750
smart people smart people are generally
good and then this other person I was

750
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:07,760
good and then this other person I was
 

751
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,100
good and then this other person I was
talking to Sean Carroll the physicist

752
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,110
talking to Sean Carroll the physicist
 

753
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,020
talking to Sean Carroll the physicist
and you were saying no good and bad

754
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,030
and you were saying no good and bad
 

755
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,760
and you were saying no good and bad
people are evenly distributed amongst

756
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:12,770
people are evenly distributed amongst
 

757
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:16,120
people are evenly distributed amongst
everybody my sense was good hackers are

758
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:16,130
everybody my sense was good hackers are
 

759
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,550
everybody my sense was good hackers are
in general good people and they don't

760
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:18,560
in general good people and they don't
 

761
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,800
in general good people and they don't
want to mess with the world what's your

762
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:20,810
want to mess with the world what's your
 

763
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:26,080
want to mess with the world what's your
sense I'm not even sure about that like

764
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,090
sense I'm not even sure about that like
 

765
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,450
sense I'm not even sure about that like
I have a nice life crime wouldn't get me

766
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:31,460
I have a nice life crime wouldn't get me
 

767

anything
 

769
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,680
anything
but if you're good and you have these

770
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:35,690
but if you're good and you have these
 

771
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,750
but if you're good and you have these
skills you probably have a nice life too

779
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,860
there a little voice in your head that
says well yeah if you could hack

780
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:47,870
says well yeah if you could hack
 

781
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,810
says well yeah if you could hack
something to where you could hurt people

782
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:51,820
something to where you could hurt people
 

783
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,360
something to where you could hurt people
and you could earn a lot of money doing

784
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:54,370
and you could earn a lot of money doing
 

785
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,100
and you could earn a lot of money doing
it though not hurt physically perhaps

786
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,110
it though not hurt physically perhaps

but disrupt her life in some kind of way

788
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:58,600
but disrupt her life in some kind of way
 

789
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,850
but disrupt her life in some kind of way
it is there a little voice that says um

790
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:02,860
it is there a little voice that says um
 

791
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:05,430
it is there a little voice that says um
what two things one I don't really care

792
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
what two things one I don't really care
 

793
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,000
what two things one I don't really care
about money

794
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,010
about money
 

795
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,800
about money
so like the money wouldn't be an

796
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:07,810
so like the money wouldn't be an
 

797
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,810
so like the money wouldn't be an
incentive the thrill might be an

798
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:09,820
incentive the thrill might be an
 

799
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,960
incentive the thrill might be an
incentive but when I was 19 I read crime

800
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:12,970
incentive but when I was 19 I read crime
 

801
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,910
incentive but when I was 19 I read crime
and punishment right that was another

802
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:14,920
and punishment right that was another
 

803
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,410
and punishment right that was another
that was another great one that talked

804
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:16,420
that was another great one that talked
 

805
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,500
that was another great one that talked
me out of ever really doing crime Oh cuz

806
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:19,510
me out of ever really doing crime Oh cuz
 

807
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,990
me out of ever really doing crime Oh cuz
it's like that's gonna be me I'd get

808
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
it's like that's gonna be me I'd get
 

809
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,610
it's like that's gonna be me I'd get
away with it whatever just went in my

810
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:23,620
away with it whatever just went in my
 

811
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,190
away with it whatever just went in my
head even if I got away with it you know

812
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:26,200
head even if I got away with it you know
 

813
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,540
head even if I got away with it you know
and then you do crime for long enough

814
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:27,550
and then you do crime for long enough
 

815
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,010
and then you do crime for long enough
you'll never get away with it that's

816
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:29,020
you'll never get away with it that's
 

817
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,200
you'll never get away with it that's
right in the end that's a good reason to

818
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:31,210
right in the end that's a good reason to
 

819
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:33,720
right in the end that's a good reason to
be good I wouldn't say good I just say

820
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:33,730
be good I wouldn't say good I just say
 

821
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,000
be good I wouldn't say good I just say
I'm not bad you're a talented programmer

822
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,010
I'm not bad you're a talented programmer
 

823
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:39,510
I'm not bad you're a talented programmer
and a hacker in a good positive sense of

824
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:39,520
and a hacker in a good positive sense of
 

825
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,880
and a hacker in a good positive sense of
the word award you've played around

826
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:41,890
the word award you've played around
 

827
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,100
the word award you've played around
found vulnerabilities in various systems

828
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,110
found vulnerabilities in various systems
 

829
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,130
found vulnerabilities in various systems
what have you learned broadly about the

830
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:47,140
what have you learned broadly about the
 

831
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,800
what have you learned broadly about the
design of systems and so on from that

832
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:49,810
design of systems and so on from that
 

833
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:57,080
design of systems and so on from that
from that whole process you learn to not

834
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,090
from that whole process you learn to not
 

835
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:01,590
from that whole process you learn to not
take things for what people say they are

836
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
take things for what people say they are
 

837
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,780
take things for what people say they are
but you look at things for what they

838
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:03,790
but you look at things for what they
 

839
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,200
but you look at things for what they
actually are

840
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,210
actually are
 

841
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,300
actually are
yeah I understand that's what you tell

842
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,310
yeah I understand that's what you tell
 

843
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,170
yeah I understand that's what you tell
me it is but what does it do man and you

844
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:13,180
me it is but what does it do man and you
 

845
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,940
me it is but what does it do man and you
have nice visualization tools to really

846
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:14,950
have nice visualization tools to really
 

847
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,130
have nice visualization tools to really
know what it's really doing oh I wish

848
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:17,140
know what it's really doing oh I wish
 

849
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,990
know what it's really doing oh I wish
I'm a better programmer now than I was

850
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:19,000
I'm a better programmer now than I was
 

851
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,330
I'm a better programmer now than I was
in 2014 I said Kira that was the first

852
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:21,340
in 2014 I said Kira that was the first
 

853
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,250
in 2014 I said Kira that was the first
tool that I wrote that was usable I

854
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:23,260
tool that I wrote that was usable I
 

855
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,590
tool that I wrote that was usable I
wouldn't say the code was great I still

856
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
wouldn't say the code was great I still
 

857
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,280
wouldn't say the code was great I still
wouldn't say my code is great so how was

858
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:29,290
wouldn't say my code is great so how was
 

859
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,990
wouldn't say my code is great so how was
your evolution as a programmer except

860
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,000
your evolution as a programmer except
 

861
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,870
your evolution as a programmer except
practice he went he started with C at

862
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:33,880
practice he went he started with C at
 

863
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,340
practice he went he started with C at
which point did you pick up Python

864
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:35,350
which point did you pick up Python
 

865
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,660
which point did you pick up Python
because you're pretty big and Python

866
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:36,670
because you're pretty big and Python
 

867
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:40,080
because you're pretty big and Python
though now yeah in uh in college I went

868
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:40,090
though now yeah in uh in college I went
 

869
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,480
though now yeah in uh in college I went
to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22 um I

870
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:42,490
to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22 um I
 

871
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:44,670
to Carnegie Mellon when I was 22 um I
went back I'm like I'm gonna take all

872
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:44,680
went back I'm like I'm gonna take all
 

873
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,980
went back I'm like I'm gonna take all
your hardest CS courses we'll see how I

874
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:46,990
your hardest CS courses we'll see how I
 

875
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:48,780
your hardest CS courses we'll see how I
do right like did I miss anything by not

876
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:48,790
do right like did I miss anything by not
 

877
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,910
do right like did I miss anything by not
having a real undergraduate education

878
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:50,920
having a real undergraduate education
 

879
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,330
having a real undergraduate education
took operating systems compilers AI and

880
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:54,340
took operating systems compilers AI and
 

881
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,130
took operating systems compilers AI and
they're like a freshman reader math

882
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:56,140
they're like a freshman reader math
 

883
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,410
they're like a freshman reader math
course and operating says some of these

884
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:01,420
course and operating says some of these
 

885
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,590
course and operating says some of these
some of those classes you mentioned

886
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:03,600
some of those classes you mentioned
 

887
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,890
some of those classes you mentioned
actually they're great at least one the

888
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:06,900
actually they're great at least one the
 

889
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,560
actually they're great at least one the
2012 circuit 2012 operating systems and

891
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,890

compilers we're two of the best classes

892
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:12,900
compilers we're two of the best classes
 

893
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,630

I've ever taken my life because you

894
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
I've ever taken my life because you
 

895
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,980
I've ever taken my life because you
write an operating system and you write

896
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:15,990
write an operating system and you write
 

897
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,860
write an operating system and you write
a compiler I wrote my operating system

898
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:18,870
a compiler I wrote my operating system
 

899
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,169
a compiler I wrote my operating system
in C and I wrote my compiler in Haskell

900
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:21,179
in C and I wrote my compiler in Haskell
 

901
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:24,049
in C and I wrote my compiler in Haskell
but classical well somehow I picked up

902
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:24,059
but classical well somehow I picked up
 

903
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,720
but classical well somehow I picked up
Python that semester as well I started

904
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:26,730
Python that semester as well I started
 

905
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,220
Python that semester as well I started
using it for the CTS actually that's

906
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:28,230
using it for the CTS actually that's
 

907
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,810
using it for the CTS actually that's
when I really started to get into CTF

908
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:29,820
when I really started to get into CTF
 

909
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,900
when I really started to get into CTF
and CTF you're all to race against the

910
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:32,910
and CTF you're all to race against the
 

911
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,880
and CTF you're all to race against the
clock so I can't write things and say oh

912
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:34,890
clock so I can't write things and say oh
 

913
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:36,649
clock so I can't write things and say oh
there's a clock component so you really

914
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:36,659
there's a clock component so you really
 

915
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:37,909
there's a clock component so you really
want to use the programming language you

916
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:37,919
want to use the programming language you
 

917
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,370
want to use the programming language you
can be fastest than 48 hours pone as

918
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:40,380
can be fastest than 48 hours pone as
 

919
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,659
can be fastest than 48 hours pone as
many of these challenges you can pone

920
00:18:41,659 --> 00:18:41,669
many of these challenges you can pone
 

921
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:43,310
many of these challenges you can pone
yeah you got like a hundred points a

922
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,320
yeah you got like a hundred points a
 

923
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,580
yeah you got like a hundred points a
challenge whatever team gets the most

it's C++ but easier it's it's strongly

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,160
typed it has a nice ecosystem erotic
when I first looked at it I was like

1180
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:01,170
when I first looked at it I was like
 

1181
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:03,410
when I first looked at it I was like
this is like Python but it takes twice

1182
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:03,420
this is like Python but it takes twice
 

1183
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,270
this is like Python but it takes twice
as long to do anything yeah

1184
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:05,280
as long to do anything yeah
 

1185
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:09,380
as long to do anything yeah
now that I've open pilot is migrating to

1186
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,390
now that I've open pilot is migrating to
 

1187
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,400
now that I've open pilot is migrating to
sea but it still has large Python

1188
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:10,410
sea but it still has large Python
 

1189
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,260
sea but it still has large Python
components I now understand why Python

1190
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,270
components I now understand why Python
 

1191
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,730
components I now understand why Python
doesn't work for large code bases and

1192
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:13,740
doesn't work for large code bases and
 

1193
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,040
doesn't work for large code bases and
why you want something like Oh

1194
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,050
why you want something like Oh
 

1195
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,780
why you want something like Oh
interesting so why why doesn't Python

1196
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:17,790
interesting so why why doesn't Python
 

1197
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,990
interesting so why why doesn't Python
work for so even most speaking for

1198
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,000
work for so even most speaking for
 

1199
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,280
work for so even most speaking for
myself at least like we do a lot of

1200
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,290
myself at least like we do a lot of
 

1201
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,070
myself at least like we do a lot of
stuff basically demo level work with

1202
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
stuff basically demo level work with
 

1203
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,350
stuff basically demo level work with
autonomous vehicles and most of the work

1204
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
autonomous vehicles and most of the work
 

1205
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,410
autonomous vehicles and most of the work
is Python yeah why doesn't Python work

1206
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:30,420
is Python yeah why doesn't Python work
 

1207
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,630
is Python yeah why doesn't Python work
for large code bases because well lack

1208
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:35,640
for large code bases because well lack
 

1209
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,240
for large code bases because well lack
of type checking is a big errors

1210
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:38,250
of type checking is a big errors
 

1211
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,080
of type checking is a big errors
creeping yeah and like you don't know

1212
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,090
creeping yeah and like you don't know
 

1213
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,240
creeping yeah and like you don't know
the compiler can tell you like nothing

1214
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,250
the compiler can tell you like nothing
 

1215
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:47,590
the compiler can tell you like nothing
right so everything is either you know

1216
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
right so everything is either you know
 

1217
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,090
right so everything is either you know
like like syntax errors fine but if you

1218
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,100
like like syntax errors fine but if you
 

1219
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,800
like like syntax errors fine but if you
misspell a variable and Python the

1220
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:51,810
misspell a variable and Python the
 

1221
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,360
misspell a variable and Python the
compiler won't catch that there's like

1222
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,370
compiler won't catch that there's like
 

1223
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,680
compiler won't catch that there's like
linters that can catch it some other

1224
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:54,690
linters that can catch it some other
 

1225
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:55,720
linters that can catch it some other
time

1226
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:55,730
time
 

1227
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,400
time
there's no types this is really the

1228
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:58,410
there's no types this is really the
 

1229
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:01,160
there's no types this is really the
biggest downside and then will Python

1230
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,170
biggest downside and then will Python
 

1231
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,750
biggest downside and then will Python
slow but that's not related to it well

1232
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:02,760
slow but that's not related to it well
 

1233
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,980
slow but that's not related to it well
maybe the kind of related to its that's

1234
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:03,990
maybe the kind of related to its that's
 

1235
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,020
maybe the kind of related to its that's
lacking so what's what's in your toolbox

1236
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,030
lacking so what's what's in your toolbox
 

1237
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,180
lacking so what's what's in your toolbox
these days is a Python what else go I

1238
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:08,190
these days is a Python what else go I

just have like syntax from the 80s what

1246
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:18,570
just have like syntax from the 80s what
 

1247
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,410
just have like syntax from the 80s what

you know the browser it's unclear what

1284
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:07,980
you know the browser it's unclear what
 

1285
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,470
you know the browser it's unclear what
the role the browser's in terms of

1286
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:09,480
the role the browser's in terms of
 

1287
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,000
the role the browser's in terms of
distributed computation in the future so

1288
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,010
distributed computation in the future so
 

1289
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,080
distributed computation in the future so
javascript is definitely here to stay

deliver it tomorrow and I would lose 1
 

1369
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,130
deliver it tomorrow and I would lose 1
million dollars for every month I didn't

1370
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:46,140
million dollars for every month I didn't
 

1371
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,530
million dollars for every month I didn't
deliver yeah so I was like ok this is a

great deal this is a super exciting

1374
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:50,040
great deal this is a super exciting
 

1375
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:53,330

1379
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,990
me 10 months I get two million dollars
it's good maybe I can finish up in five

1380
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:57,000
it's good maybe I can finish up in five
 

1381
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,340
it's good maybe I can finish up in five
maybe I don't finish it at all and I get

1382
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:58,350
maybe I don't finish it at all and I get
 

1383
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,390
maybe I don't finish it at all and I get
paid nothing and I'll work for twelve

1384
00:27:59,390 --> 00:27:59,400
paid nothing and I'll work for twelve
 

1385
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,880
paid nothing and I'll work for twelve
months for free so maybe I just take a

1386
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:01,890
months for free so maybe I just take a
 

1387
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,830
months for free so maybe I just take a
pause on that I'm also curious about

1388
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:03,840
pause on that I'm also curious about
 

1389
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,030
pause on that I'm also curious about
this because I've been working on

1390
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,040
this because I've been working on
 

1391
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,800
this because I've been working on
robotics for a long time and I'm curious

1392
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:06,810
robotics for a long time and I'm curious
 

1393
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,240
robotics for a long time and I'm curious
to see a person like you just step in

1394
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,250
to see a person like you just step in
 

1395
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,720
to see a person like you just step in
and sort of somewhat naive but brilliant

1396
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:11,730
and sort of somewhat naive but brilliant
 

1397
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,250
and sort of somewhat naive but brilliant
right so that's though that's the best

1398
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:13,260
right so that's though that's the best
 

1399
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,870
right so that's though that's the best
place to be because you basically

1400
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
place to be because you basically
 

1401
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,300
place to be because you basically
full-steam take on a problem how

1402
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:17,310
full-steam take on a problem how
 

1403
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:19,880
full-steam take on a problem how
confident how from that time because you

1404
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:19,890
confident how from that time because you
 

1405
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,430
confident how from that time because you
know a lot more now at that time how

1406
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:22,440
know a lot more now at that time how
 

1407
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,170
know a lot more now at that time how
hard do you think it is to solve all of

1408
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:24,180
hard do you think it is to solve all of
 

1409
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,130
hard do you think it is to solve all of
autonomous driving I remember I

1410
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,140
autonomous driving I remember I
 

1411
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,890
autonomous driving I remember I
suggested to Elon in the meeting I'm

1412
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:29,900
suggested to Elon in the meeting I'm
 

1413
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,120
suggested to Elon in the meeting I'm
putting

1414
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:31,130
putting
 

1415
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,490
putting
GPU behind each camera to keep the

1416
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:33,500
GPU behind each camera to keep the
 

1417
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,160
GPU behind each camera to keep the
compute local this is an incredibly

1418
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,170
compute local this is an incredibly
 

1419
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,860
compute local this is an incredibly
stupid idea I leave the meeting 10

1420
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:38,870
stupid idea I leave the meeting 10
 

1421
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:40,390
stupid idea I leave the meeting 10
minutes later and I'm like I could have

1422
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:40,400
minutes later and I'm like I could have
 

1423
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,740
minutes later and I'm like I could have
spent a little bit of time thinking

1424
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:41,750
spent a little bit of time thinking
 

1425
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,770
spent a little bit of time thinking
about this problem was I would just send

1426
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:44,780
about this problem was I would just send
 

1427
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,360
about this problem was I would just send
all your cameras to one big GPU you're

1428
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:46,370
all your cameras to one big GPU you're
 

1429
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,970
all your cameras to one big GPU you're
much better off doing that oh sorry you

1430
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:48,980
much better off doing that oh sorry you
 

1431
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,860
much better off doing that oh sorry you
said behind every camera you have a

1432
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:50,870
said behind every camera you have a
 

1433
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,030
said behind every camera you have a
small GPU I was like oh I'll put the

1434
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,040
small GPU I was like oh I'll put the
 

1435
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,650
small GPU I was like oh I'll put the
first few layers of my comm there Oh

1436
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:53,660
first few layers of my comm there Oh
 

1437
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,500
first few layers of my comm there Oh
like why did I say that that's possible

1438
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:56,510
like why did I say that that's possible
 

1439
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:59,110
like why did I say that that's possible
it's possible but it's a bad idea it's

1440
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,120
it's possible but it's a bad idea it's
 

1441
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,880
it's possible but it's a bad idea it's
not obviously a bad idea pretty obvious

1442
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:00,890
not obviously a bad idea pretty obvious
 

1443
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,530
not obviously a bad idea pretty obvious
but whether it's actually a bad idea or

1444
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:02,540
but whether it's actually a bad idea or
 

1445
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,390
but whether it's actually a bad idea or
not I left that meeting with Elon like

1446
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:04,400
not I left that meeting with Elon like
 

1447
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,190
not I left that meeting with Elon like
beating myself up I'm like why did I say

1448
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,200
beating myself up I'm like why did I say
 

1449
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,530
beating myself up I'm like why did I say
something stupid yeah you haven't given

1450
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:08,540
something stupid yeah you haven't given
 

1451
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:11,050
something stupid yeah you haven't given
I'm at least like thought through every

1452
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:11,060
I'm at least like thought through every
 

1453
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm at least like thought through every
aspect yes he's very sharp too like

1454
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:13,370
aspect yes he's very sharp too like
 

1455
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,070
aspect yes he's very sharp too like
usually in life I get away with saying

1456
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:15,080
usually in life I get away with saying
 

1457
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,810
usually in life I get away with saying
stupid things and then kind of course

1458
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:16,820
stupid things and then kind of course
 

1459
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,070
stupid things and then kind of course
alright right away he called me out

1460
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
alright right away he called me out
 

1461
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,960
alright right away he called me out
about it and like usually in life I get

1462
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:19,970
about it and like usually in life I get
 

1463
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:21,400
about it and like usually in life I get
away with saying stupid things and then

1464
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:21,410
away with saying stupid things and then
 

1465
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:24,790
away with saying stupid things and then
like people will you know people a lot

1466
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:24,800
like people will you know people a lot
 

1467
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,990
like people will you know people a lot
of times people don't even notice and

1468
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
of times people don't even notice and
 

1469
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,310
of times people don't even notice and
I'll like correct it and bring the

1470
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:27,320
I'll like correct it and bring the
 

1471
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,840
I'll like correct it and bring the
conversation back but with Elon it was

1472
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:28,850
conversation back but with Elon it was
 

1473
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,440
conversation back but with Elon it was
like nope like okay well that's not at

1474
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,450
like nope like okay well that's not at
 

1475
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,700
like nope like okay well that's not at
all why the contract fell through I was

1476
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:33,710
all why the contract fell through I was
 

1477
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,140
all why the contract fell through I was
much more prepared the second time I met

1478
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:35,150
much more prepared the second time I met
 

1479
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,960
much more prepared the second time I met
him yeah but in general huh how hard did

1480
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:37,970
him yeah but in general huh how hard did
 

1481
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,500
him yeah but in general huh how hard did
you think it is like 12 months is uh-oh

1482
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:41,510
you think it is like 12 months is uh-oh
 

1483
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:44,260
you think it is like 12 months is uh-oh
is it tough timeline oh I just thought

1484
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:44,270
is it tough timeline oh I just thought
 

1485
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,940
is it tough timeline oh I just thought
I'd clone mob like you three I didn't

1486
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:45,950
I'd clone mob like you three I didn't
 

1487
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,470
I'd clone mob like you three I didn't
think I'd solve level five self-driving

1488
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:47,480
think I'd solve level five self-driving
 

1489
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,630
think I'd solve level five self-driving
or anything so the goal there was to do

1490
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:49,640
or anything so the goal there was to do
 

1491
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:52,230
or anything so the goal there was to do
lane-keeping good good link keeping I

1492
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
lane-keeping good good link keeping I
 

1493
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,820
lane-keeping good good link keeping I
saw my friend showed me the outputs from

1494
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:54,830
saw my friend showed me the outputs from
 

1495
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,380
saw my friend showed me the outputs from
a mobile I in the office from a mobile I

1496
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,390
a mobile I in the office from a mobile I
 

1497
00:29:56,390 --> 00:29:57,730
a mobile I in the office from a mobile I
was just basically two lanes at a

1498
00:29:57,730 --> 00:29:57,740
was just basically two lanes at a
 

1499
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,290
was just basically two lanes at a
position of a lead car mm-hm

1500
00:29:59,290 --> 00:29:59,300
position of a lead car mm-hm
 

1501
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,510
position of a lead car mm-hm
like I can I can gather a dataset and

1502
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
like I can I can gather a dataset and
 

1503
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,990
like I can I can gather a dataset and
train this net in in weeks and I did

1504
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
train this net in in weeks and I did
 

1505
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,460
train this net in in weeks and I did
well first time I tried the

1506
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:06,470
well first time I tried the
 

1507
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,900
well first time I tried the
implementation of mobile I and the test

1508
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:07,910
implementation of mobile I and the test
 

1509
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,290
implementation of mobile I and the test
I was really surprised how good it is

1510
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:10,300
I was really surprised how good it is
 

1511
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,490
I was really surprised how good it is
it's quite incredibly good because I

1512
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:12,500
it's quite incredibly good because I
 

1513
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,050
it's quite incredibly good because I
thought it's just because I've done a

1514
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:14,060
thought it's just because I've done a
 

1515
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,420
thought it's just because I've done a
lot of computation I thought it'd be a

1516
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,430
lot of computation I thought it'd be a
 

1517
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,850
lot of computation I thought it'd be a
lot harder to create a system that

1518
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:18,860
lot harder to create a system that
 

1519
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,000
lot harder to create a system that
that's stable so I was personally

1520
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,010
that's stable so I was personally
 

1521
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,940
that's stable so I was personally
surprised you know have to admit it

1522
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:24,950
surprised you know have to admit it
 

1523
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,920
surprised you know have to admit it
because I was kind of skeptical before

1524
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:26,930
because I was kind of skeptical before
 

1525
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,800
because I was kind of skeptical before
trying it because I thought it would go

1526
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:29,810
trying it because I thought it would go
 

1527
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:31,510
trying it because I thought it would go
in and out a lot more it would get

1528
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:31,520
in and out a lot more it would get
 

1529
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,060
in and out a lot more it would get
disengaged a lot more and it's pretty

1530
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:34,070
disengaged a lot more and it's pretty
 

1531
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:39,430
disengaged a lot more and it's pretty
robust so what how how hard is the

1532
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440
robust so what how how hard is the
 

1533
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,990
robust so what how how hard is the
problem we need to when you tackled it

1534
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
problem we need to when you tackled it
 

1535
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,710
problem we need to when you tackled it
I think a p1 was great like Elon talked

1536
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:45,720
I think a p1 was great like Elon talked
 

1537
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,710
I think a p1 was great like Elon talked
about dis engagements on the 405 down in

1538
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:48,720
about dis engagements on the 405 down in
 

1539
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,150
about dis engagements on the 405 down in
LA we'd like the lane marks were kind of

1540
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,160
LA we'd like the lane marks were kind of
 

1541
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,220
LA we'd like the lane marks were kind of
faded and the mobile eye system would

1542
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,230
faded and the mobile eye system would
 

1543
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:56,720
faded and the mobile eye system would
drop out uh like I had something up and

1544
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:56,730
drop out uh like I had something up and
 

1545
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,340
drop out uh like I had something up and
working that I would say was like the

1546
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,350
working that I would say was like the
 

1547
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:02,720
working that I would say was like the
same quality in three months same

1548
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:02,730
same quality in three months same
 

1549
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,270
same quality in three months same
quality but how do you know you you say

1550
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,280
quality but how do you know you you say
 

1551
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,010
quality but how do you know you you say
stuff like that yeah confidently but you

1552
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,020
stuff like that yeah confidently but you
 

1553
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,590
stuff like that yeah confidently but you

1565
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,980
I would take ap one out for a drive yeah
and then I would take my system out for

1566
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:21,990
and then I would take my system out for
 

1567
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,210
and then I would take my system out for
a dry and seems reasonably like the same

you shouldn't ship things like autopilot

1630
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:46,110
you shouldn't ship things like autopilot

gonna touch a lane line human will touch

1638
00:32:57,169 --> 00:32:57,179
gonna touch a lane line human will touch
 

1639
00:32:57,179 --> 00:32:59,419
gonna touch a lane line human will touch
probably a lane line twice you just

1640
00:32:59,419 --> 00:32:59,429
probably a lane line twice you just
 

1641
00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:00,799
probably a lane line twice you just
inspired me I don't know if you're

1642
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:00,809
inspired me I don't know if you're
 

1643
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:02,690
inspired me I don't know if you're
grounded and data on that I read labor

1644
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:02,700
grounded and data on that I read labor
 

1645
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,130
grounded and data on that I read labor
okay but no but that's interesting uh I

1646
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:06,140
okay but no but that's interesting uh I
 

1647
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,990
okay but no but that's interesting uh I
wonder actually how often we touch Lane

1648
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:09,000
wonder actually how often we touch Lane
 

1649
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,080
wonder actually how often we touch Lane
lines in general like a little bit cuz

1650
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,090
lines in general like a little bit cuz
 

1651
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,090
lines in general like a little bit cuz
it is okay I could answer that question

1652
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,100
it is okay I could answer that question
 

1653
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,620
it is okay I could answer that question
pretty easily with the common data side

1654
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:15,630
pretty easily with the common data side
 

1655
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,630
pretty easily with the common data side
yeah I'm curious I've never answered it

1656
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:17,640
yeah I'm curious I've never answered it
 

1657
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,190
yeah I'm curious I've never answered it
I don't know yeah I just - is like my

1658
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
I don't know yeah I just - is like my
 

1659
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,310
I don't know yeah I just - is like my
person it feels right that's interesting

because every time you touch the lane

1662
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:23,640
because every time you touch the lane
 

1663
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,940
because every time you touch the lane
that's the source of a little bit of

1664
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:25,950
that's the source of a little bit of
 

1665
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,860
that's the source of a little bit of
stress and kind of lane-keeping is

1666
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:27,870
stress and kind of lane-keeping is
 

1667
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,779
stress and kind of lane-keeping is
removing that stress that's all to me

1668
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:29,789
removing that stress that's all to me
 

1669
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,240
removing that stress that's all to me
the big the biggest value-add honestly

1670
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,250
the big the biggest value-add honestly
 

1671
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,580
the big the biggest value-add honestly
is just removing the stress of having to

1672
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:34,590
is just removing the stress of having to
 

1673
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,590
is just removing the stress of having to
stay in lane and I think honestly I

1674
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:36,600
stay in lane and I think honestly I
 

1675
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,140
stay in lane and I think honestly I
don't think people fully realize first

1676

don't think people fully realize first
 

1677
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,080
don't think people fully realize first
of all that that's a big value add but

1678
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,090
of all that that's a big value add but
 

1679
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,180
of all that that's a big value add but
also that that's all it is

1680
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,190
also that that's all it is
 

1681
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,049
also that that's all it is
and that not only I find it a huge value

1682
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:48,059
and that not only I find it a huge value

00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,730
it's a more expensive lower slower uber
maybe someday it'll be this big cliff

1708
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:17,740
maybe someday it'll be this big cliff
 

1709
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,230
maybe someday it'll be this big cliff
where it adds value but I don't usually

1710
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:19,240
where it adds value but I don't usually
 

1711
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,149
where it adds value but I don't usually
do this vessei I haven't talked to is

1712
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:21,159
do this vessei I haven't talked to is
 

1713
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,049
do this vessei I haven't talked to is
that this is good because I haven't I

1714
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:24,059
that this is good because I haven't I
 

1715
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,309
that this is good because I haven't I
have intuitively but I think we're

1716
00:34:26,309 --> 00:34:26,319
have intuitively but I think we're
 

1717
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:29,309
have intuitively but I think we're
making it explicit now I I actually

1718
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:29,319
making it explicit now I I actually
 

1719
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:34,579
making it explicit now I I actually
believe that really good lane-keeping is

1720
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:34,589
believe that really good lane-keeping is
 

1721
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:37,889
believe that really good lane-keeping is
a reason to buy a car will be a reason

1722
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:37,899
a reason to buy a car will be a reason
 

1723
00:34:37,899 --> 00:34:39,750
a reason to buy a car will be a reason
to buy a car is a huge value add I've

1724
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:39,760
to buy a car is a huge value add I've
 

1725
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,309
to buy a car is a huge value add I've
never until we just started talking

1726
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:41,319
never until we just started talking
 

1727
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:42,899
never until we just started talking
about it haven't really quite realized

1728
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:42,909
about it haven't really quite realized
 

1729
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:47,730
about it haven't really quite realized
that that I've felt with elan chase of

1730
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:47,740
that that I've felt with elan chase of
 

1731
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:52,349
that that I've felt with elan chase of
level four is not the correct chase it

1732
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:52,359
level four is not the correct chase it
 

1733
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:55,020
level four is not the correct chase it
was on because you should just say Tesla

1734
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:55,030
was on because you should just say Tesla
 

1735
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:57,089
was on because you should just say Tesla
has the best as if from a testing

1736
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:57,099
has the best as if from a testing
 

1737
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:59,309
has the best as if from a testing
perspective say Tesla has the best

1738
00:34:59,309 --> 00:34:59,319
perspective say Tesla has the best
 

1739
00:34:59,319 --> 00:35:02,370
perspective say Tesla has the best
lane-keeping coming I should say coming

1740
00:35:02,370 --> 00:35:02,380
lane-keeping coming I should say coming
 

1741
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,980
lane-keeping coming I should say coming
I is the best link keeping and that is

1742
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:04,990
I is the best link keeping and that is
 

1743
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,099
I is the best link keeping and that is
it yeah yeah does do you think well you

1744
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:08,109
it yeah yeah does do you think well you
 

1745
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:09,480
it yeah yeah does do you think well you
have to do the longitudinal as well

1746
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:09,490
have to do the longitudinal as well
 

1747
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,490
have to do the longitudinal as well
you can't just Lane keep you have to do

1748
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:11,500
you can't just Lane keep you have to do
 

1749
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,430
you can't just Lane keep you have to do
a cc but a cc is much more forgiving

1750
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:14,440
a cc but a cc is much more forgiving
 

1751
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,740
a cc but a cc is much more forgiving
than lanky especially on the highway oh

1752
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:16,750
than lanky especially on the highway oh
 

1753
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:19,740

by the way are you uh calming eyes

1754
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:19,750
by the way are you uh calming eyes
 

1755
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,319
by the way are you uh calming eyes
camera only correct oh no we use the

1756
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:22,329
camera only correct oh no we use the
 

1757
00:35:22,329 --> 00:35:24,839
camera only correct oh no we use the
radar we from the car you were able to

1758
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:24,849
radar we from the car you were able to
 

1759
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:27,660
radar we from the car you were able to
get to open it um we can't do a camera

1760
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:27,670
get to open it um we can't do a camera
 

1761
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:29,849
get to open it um we can't do a camera
only now it's gotten to the point but we

1762
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:29,859
only now it's gotten to the point but we
 

1763
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,920
only now it's gotten to the point but we
leave the radar there is like a it's

1764
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:31,930
leave the radar there is like a it's
 

1765
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,069
leave the radar there is like a it's
it's fusion now okay so let's maybe talk

1766
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:35,079
it's fusion now okay so let's maybe talk
 

1767
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,690
it's fusion now okay so let's maybe talk
through some of the system specs on the

1768
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:36,700
through some of the system specs on the
 

1769
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,480
through some of the system specs on the
hardware or what it what's what's the

1770
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:39,490
hardware or what it what's what's the
 

1771
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:42,839
hardware or what it what's what's the
hardware side of what you're providing

1772
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:42,849
hardware side of what you're providing
 

1773
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:44,370
hardware side of what you're providing
what's the capabilities in the software

1774
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:44,380
what's the capabilities in the software
 

1775
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,549
what's the capabilities in the software
side would open pilot and so on so open

1776
00:35:47,549 --> 00:35:47,559
side would open pilot and so on so open
 

1777
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,630
side would open pilot and so on so open
pilot as the the box that we sell that

1778
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:51,640
pilot as the the box that we sell that
 

1779
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,339
pilot as the the box that we sell that
it runs on it's a phone in a plastic

1780
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:53,349
it runs on it's a phone in a plastic
 

1781
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,589
it runs on it's a phone in a plastic
case it's nothing special we sell it

1782
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
case it's nothing special we sell it
 

1783
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,450
case it's nothing special we sell it
without the software so you're like you

1784
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:57,460
without the software so you're like you
 

1785
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,859
without the software so you're like you
know you buy the phone it's just easy

1786
00:35:58,859 --> 00:35:58,869
know you buy the phone it's just easy
 

1787
00:35:58,869 --> 00:36:01,410
know you buy the phone it's just easy
it'll be easy setup but it's sold with

1788
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:01,420
it'll be easy setup but it's sold with
 

1789
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,410
it'll be easy setup but it's sold with
no software

1790
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:03,420
no software
 

1791
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:06,589
no software
open pilot right now is about to be 0.6

1792
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:06,599
open pilot right now is about to be 0.6
 

1793
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,720
open pilot right now is about to be 0.6
when it gets to 1.0 I think we'll be

1794
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:08,730
when it gets to 1.0 I think we'll be
 

1795
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,309
when it gets to 1.0 I think we'll be
ready for a consumer product we're not

1796
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:10,319
ready for a consumer product we're not
 

1797
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:11,809
ready for a consumer product we're not
gonna add any new features we're just

1798
00:36:11,809 --> 00:36:11,819
gonna add any new features we're just
 

1799
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:13,279
gonna add any new features we're just
gonna make the lane-keeping really

1800
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:13,289
gonna make the lane-keeping really
 

1801
00:36:13,289 --> 00:36:14,620
gonna make the lane-keeping really
really good

1802
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:14,630
really good
 

1803
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,970
really good
so what do we have right now it's a

1804
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:16,980
so what do we have right now it's a
 

1805

the phone and then they have three
 

1819
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:40,099
the phone and then they have three
canvases that they talk to the car one

of those campuses is the radar CANbus
 

1823
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,420
of those campuses is the radar CANbus
one of them is the main car CANbus and

we leave the existing camera in place so

1828
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:48,569
we leave the existing camera in place so
 

1829
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:51,289
we leave the existing camera in place so
we don't turn a DB off right now we

1830
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:51,299
we don't turn a DB off right now we
 

1831
00:36:51,299 --> 00:36:52,819
we don't turn a DB off right now we
still turn a TV off if you're using our

1832
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:52,829
still turn a TV off if you're using our
 

1833
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:54,289
still turn a TV off if you're using our
longitudinal but we're gonna fix that

1834
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:54,299
longitudinal but we're gonna fix that
 

1835
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:57,170
longitudinal but we're gonna fix that
before 1.0 you got it wow that's cool so

1836
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:57,180
before 1.0 you got it wow that's cool so
 

1837
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,890
before 1.0 you got it wow that's cool so
in its can both way so how are you able

1838
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:00,900
in its can both way so how are you able
 

1839
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,509
in its can both way so how are you able
to control vehicles so we proxy the

1840
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:05,519
to control vehicles so we proxy the
 

1841
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,460
to control vehicles so we proxy the
vehicles that we work with already have

1842
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:07,470
vehicles that we work with already have
 

1843
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,579
vehicles that we work with already have
Lane Keeping Assist system so Lane

1844

Keeping Assist can mean a huge variety
 

1847
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,950
Keeping Assist can mean a huge variety
of things it can mean it will apply a

00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,349
of things it can mean it will apply a
small torque to the wheel after you've

1850
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:18,359
small torque to the wheel after you've
 

1851
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:20,660
small torque to the wheel after you've
already crossed a lane line by a foot

which is the system in the older Toyotas

1854
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:23,390
which is the system in the older Toyotas
 

1855
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:26,450
which is the system in the older Toyotas
versus like I think Tesla still calls it

that as well with autonomy day they did
 

1941
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,940
that as well with autonomy day they did
reveal more than I mean of course

their usual safety driver during full
 

1989
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,380
their usual safety driver during full
autonomy kind of testing and then Tesla

1990
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,390
autonomy kind of testing and then Tesla
 

1991
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:12,170
autonomy kind of testing and then Tesla
does basically trying to go from

1992
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:12,180
does basically trying to go from
 

1993
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,829
does basically trying to go from
lane-keeping to full autonomy what do

1994
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
lane-keeping to full autonomy what do
 

1995
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,970
lane-keeping to full autonomy what do
you think about that approach how

1996
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:16,980
you think about that approach how
 

1997
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,250
you think about that approach how
successful would it be a ton better

1998
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:19,260
successful would it be a ton better
 

1999
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,640

approach because Tesla is gathering data

2000
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:22,650
approach because Tesla is gathering data
 

2001
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,370
approach because Tesla is gathering data
on a scale that none of them are they're

wheel of the car
 

2007
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:31,549
wheel of the car
it's I think the only strategy that

2008
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:31,559
it's I think the only strategy that
 

2009
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:35,240
it's I think the only strategy that
works the incremental well so there's a

2010
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:35,250
works the incremental well so there's a
 

2011
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,279
works the incremental well so there's a
few components to test approach that's

2012
00:40:37,279 --> 00:40:37,289
few components to test approach that's
 

2013
00:40:37,289 --> 00:40:39,260
few components to test approach that's
that's more than just incrementally you

2014
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:39,270
that's more than just incrementally you
 

2015
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,539
that's more than just incrementally you
spoke with is the one is the software so

2016
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:41,549
spoke with is the one is the software so
 

2017
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:44,480
spoke with is the one is the software so
over-the-air software updates necessity

2018

over-the-air software updates necessity
 

2019
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,549
over-the-air software updates necessity
I mean way more ease have those - those

2020
00:40:46,549 --> 00:40:46,559
I mean way more ease have those - those
 

2021
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:48,829
I mean way more ease have those - those
aren't but there was differentiating

awesome so you're basically saying the

2150
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:09,780
awesome so you're basically saying the

00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,170
awesome so you're basically saying the
driver monitoring will be the answer to

driver monitoring will be the answer to
 

2153
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,600
driver monitoring will be the answer to
that um I think the other point that the

2154
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:14,610
that um I think the other point that the
 

2155
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:17,210
that um I think the other point that the
original paper is is good as well you're

2156
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,220
original paper is is good as well you're
 

2157
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,430
original paper is is good as well you're
not asking a human to supervise a

00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:26,610
model you can take over we disengage on
 

2165
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,160
model you can take over we disengage on
both the gas or the brake we don't

2166
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:28,170
both the gas or the brake we don't
 

2167
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,270
both the gas or the brake we don't
disengage on steering I don't feel you

2168
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:29,280
disengage on steering I don't feel you
 

2169
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,430
disengage on steering I don't feel you
have to but we disengage on gas or brake

2170
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:31,440
have to but we disengage on gas or brake
 

2171
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,980
have to but we disengage on gas or brake
so it's very easy for you to take over

2172
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:33,990
so it's very easy for you to take over
 

2173
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,750
so it's very easy for you to take over
and it's very easy for you to re-engage

2174
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:35,760
and it's very easy for you to re-engage
 

2175
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,480
and it's very easy for you to re-engage
that switching should be super cheap

2176
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:38,490
that switching should be super cheap
 

2177
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,370
that switching should be super cheap
yeah the cars that require even

2178
00:43:40,370 --> 00:43:40,380
yeah the cars that require even
 

2179
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,560
yeah the cars that require even
autopilot requires a double press that's

2180
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:42,570
autopilot requires a double press that's
 

2181
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,660
autopilot requires a double press that's
almost I said I like that yeah and then

2182
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:44,670
almost I said I like that yeah and then
 

2183
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,300
almost I said I like that yeah and then
then the cancel um to cancel in

2184
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,310
then the cancel um to cancel in
 

2185
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,650
then the cancel um to cancel in
autopilot you either have to press

2186
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:48,660
autopilot you either have to press
 

2187
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:49,790
autopilot you either have to press
cancel which no one knows where that is

2188
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:49,800
cancel which no one knows where that is
 

2189
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,410
cancel which no one knows where that is
so they press the brake but a lot of

2190
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:51,420
so they press the brake but a lot of
 

2191
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,340
so they press the brake but a lot of
things you don't you want to press the

2192
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:52,350
things you don't you want to press the
 

2193
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,290
things you don't you want to press the
brake you want present ass

2194
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:54,300
brake you want present ass
 

2195
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,300
brake you want present ass
so you should cancel on gas or wiggle

2196
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:56,310
so you should cancel on gas or wiggle
 

2197
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:57,380
so you should cancel on gas or wiggle
the steering wheel which is bad as well

2198
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:57,390
the steering wheel which is bad as well
 

2199
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:59,630
the steering wheel which is bad as well
wow that's brilliant I haven't heard

2200
00:43:59,630 --> 00:43:59,640
wow that's brilliant I haven't heard
 

2201
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,610
wow that's brilliant I haven't heard
anyone articulate at that point I like

2202
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:01,620
anyone articulate at that point I like
 

2203
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,900
anyone articulate at that point I like
what this is all I think about

2204

what this is all I think about
 

2205
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:07,370
what this is all I think about
it's because I think I think actually

it's because I think I think actually
 

2207
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,070
it's because I think I think actually
Tesla has done a better job than most

2208
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:10,080
Tesla has done a better job than most
 

2209
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,290
Tesla has done a better job than most
automakers at making that frictionless

2210
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,300
automakers at making that frictionless
 

2211
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,690
automakers at making that frictionless
but you just described that it could be

2212
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:14,700
but you just described that it could be
 

2213
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:18,410
but you just described that it could be
even better I love super cruise as an

2214
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:18,420
even better I love super cruise as an
 

2215
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,170
even better I love super cruise as an
experience once it's engaged yeah I

2216
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:21,180
experience once it's engaged yeah I
 

2217
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:22,340
experience once it's engaged yeah I
don't know if you've used it but getting

2218
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:22,350
don't know if you've used it but getting
 

2219
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:25,250
don't know if you've used it but getting
the thing to try to engage him yeah I've

2220
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:25,260
the thing to try to engage him yeah I've
 

2221
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,170
the thing to try to engage him yeah I've
used this of Germany's super cruise a

2222
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:27,180
used this of Germany's super cruise a
 

2223
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,370
used this of Germany's super cruise a
lot so what's their thoughts on the

2224
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:28,380
lot so what's their thoughts on the
 

2225
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,290
lot so what's their thoughts on the
super Cruiser system in June disengage

2226
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:30,300
super Cruiser system in June disengage
 

2227
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:32,780
super Cruiser system in June disengage
super cruise and it falls back to ACC so

2228
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:32,790
super cruise and it falls back to ACC so
 

2229
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:34,700

my car's like still accelerating it
 

2231
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:37,550
my car's like still accelerating it
feels weird otherwise when you actually

2232
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:37,560
feels weird otherwise when you actually
 

2233
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:39,560
feels weird otherwise when you actually
have super cruise engaged on the highway

2234
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:39,570
have super cruise engaged on the highway
 

2235
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:42,080
have super cruise engaged on the highway
it is phenomenal we bought that Cadillac

2236
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:42,090
it is phenomenal we bought that Cadillac
 

2237
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,300

possibly for us we lost like by 25k the

2264
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:14,460
possibly for us we lost like by 25k the
 

2265
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,950
possibly for us we lost like by 25k the
deprecation but a Philips worth it

2266
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:15,960
deprecation but a Philips worth it
 

2267
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,850
deprecation but a Philips worth it

they're saying at least is going to be

2286
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:39,960
they're saying at least is going to be
 

2287

into their entire fleet so what do you
 

2289
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,330
into their entire fleet so what do you
think about it if as long as we're on

2290
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:44,340
think about it if as long as we're on
 

2291
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,910
think about it if as long as we're on

the driver monitoring what do you think
 

2293
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,090

gonna have his level five fleet by the
 

2303
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,470
gonna have his level five fleet by the
end of the year hopefully he's like okay

I was wrong I'm gonna add driver

2306
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
I was wrong I'm gonna add driver
 

2307
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,160
I was wrong I'm gonna add driver
monitoring because when these systems

2308
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:07,170
monitoring because when these systems
 

2309
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,660
monitoring because when these systems
get to the point that they're only

2310
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:08,670
get to the point that they're only
 

2311
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,160
get to the point that they're only
messing up once every thousand miles

2312
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:10,170
messing up once every thousand miles
 

2313
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:14,270
messing up once every thousand miles
you absolutely need driver monitor so

2314
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:14,280
you absolutely need driver monitor so
 

2315
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,770
you absolutely need driver monitor so
let me play Delta because I agree with

2316
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:15,780
let me play Delta because I agree with
 

2317
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,420
let me play Delta because I agree with
you but let me play devil's advocate so

2318
00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:17,430
you but let me play devil's advocate so
 

2319
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:21,890
you but let me play devil's advocate so
one possibility is that without driver

2320
00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:21,900
one possibility is that without driver
 

2321
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,280
one possibility is that without driver
monitoring people are able to monitor

2322
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,290
monitoring people are able to monitor
 

2323
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,430
monitoring people are able to monitor
the self-regulate monitor themselves you

2324
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:28,440
the self-regulate monitor themselves you
 

2325
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,010
the self-regulate monitor themselves you
know that so your idea is seeing all the

2326
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:31,020
know that so your idea is seeing all the
 

2327
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:35,540
know that so your idea is seeing all the
people sleeping in decimals uh yeah well

2328
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:35,550
people sleeping in decimals uh yeah well
 

2329
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,970
people sleeping in decimals uh yeah well
I'm a little skeptical of all the people

2330
00:46:37,970 --> 00:46:37,980
I'm a little skeptical of all the people
 

2331
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,560
I'm a little skeptical of all the people
sleeping in Tesla's because I have I've

2332
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:42,570
sleeping in Tesla's because I have I've
 

2333
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,030
sleeping in Tesla's because I have I've
stopped paying attention to that kind of

2334
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:44,040
stopped paying attention to that kind of
 

2335
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,620
stopped paying attention to that kind of
stuff because I want to see real data

2336
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:45,630
stuff because I want to see real data
 

2337
00:46:45,630 --> 00:46:47,840
stuff because I want to see real data
there's too much glorified it doesn't

2338
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:47,850
there's too much glorified it doesn't
 

2339
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,420
there's too much glorified it doesn't
feel scientific to me so I want to know

2340
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:49,430
feel scientific to me so I want to know
 

2341
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,950
feel scientific to me so I want to know
you know what how many people are really

2342
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:51,960
you know what how many people are really
 

2343
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,100
you know what how many people are really
sleeping in Tesla's vs. sleeping I've I

00:46:58,070 --> 00:46:58,080
was driving here sleep-deprived in a car
 

2347
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,200
was driving here sleep-deprived in a car
with no automation I was falling asleep

2348
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:00,210
with no automation I was falling asleep
 

2349
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,680

2352
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:05,700
you know what if you under I've am
 

2353

wondering I think I rented a my last

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
wondering I think I rented a my last
 

2355
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,050
wondering I think I rented a my last
autopilot experience was I rented a

2356
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:09,060
autopilot experience was I rented a
 

2357
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,410

wheel thing is annoying and the reason

2362
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:14,099
wheel thing is annoying and the reason
 

2363
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,799
wheel thing is annoying and the reason
the wheel thing is annoying we use the

2364
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:15,809
the wheel thing is annoying we use the
 

2365
00:47:15,809 --> 00:47:17,150
the wheel thing is annoying we use the
wheel thing as well but we don't

2366
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,160
wheel thing as well but we don't
 

2367
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,700
wheel thing as well but we don't
disengage on wheel for Tesla you have to

2368
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:19,710
disengage on wheel for Tesla you have to
 

2369
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,859
disengage on wheel for Tesla you have to
touch the wheel just enough you should

2370
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:21,869
touch the wheel just enough you should
 

2371
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:24,200
touch the wheel just enough you should
trigger the torque sensor to tell it

2372
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:24,210
trigger the torque sensor to tell it
 

2373
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,359
trigger the torque sensor to tell it
that you're there but not enough as to

2374
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:26,369
that you're there but not enough as to
 

2375
00:47:26,369 --> 00:47:29,960
that you're there but not enough as to
disengage it which don't use it for two

2376
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:29,970
disengage it which don't use it for two
 

2377
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:30,349
disengage it which don't use it for two
things

2378
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:30,359
things
 

2379
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:31,700
things
you disengage one wheel you don't have

2380
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:31,710
you disengage one wheel you don't have
 

2381
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,890
you disengage one wheel you don't have
to that whole experience Wow beautiful

2382
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:33,900
to that whole experience Wow beautiful
 

2383
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,740
to that whole experience Wow beautiful
put that all those elements even if you

2384
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:36,750
put that all those elements even if you
 

2385
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,839
put that all those elements even if you
don't have driver monitoring that whole

2386
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:38,849
don't have driver monitoring that whole
 

2387
00:47:38,849 --> 00:47:41,329
don't have driver monitoring that whole
experience needs to be better driver

2388
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:41,339
experience needs to be better driver
 

2389
00:47:41,339 --> 00:47:44,059
experience needs to be better driver
monitoring I think would make I mean I

2390
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:44,069
monitoring I think would make I mean I
 

2391
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,289
monitoring I think would make I mean I
think super cruise is a better

2392
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:45,299
think super cruise is a better
 

2393
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,329
think super cruise is a better
experience once it's engaged over

2394
00:47:47,329 --> 00:47:47,339
experience once it's engaged over
 

2395
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:48,200
experience once it's engaged over
autopilot

2396
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:48,210
autopilot
 

2397
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,240
autopilot
I think super cruise is our transition

2398
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:50,250
I think super cruise is our transition
 

2399
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,420
I think super cruise is our transition
to engagement and disengagement are

2400
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:52,430
to engagement and disengagement are
 

2401
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,430
to engagement and disengagement are
significantly worse yeah so there's a

2402
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
significantly worse yeah so there's a
 

2403
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,349
significantly worse yeah so there's a
tricky thing because if I were to

2404
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
tricky thing because if I were to
 

2405
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,900
tricky thing because if I were to
criticize super cruise is uh it's a

2406
00:47:59,900 --> 00:47:59,910
criticize super cruise is uh it's a
 

2407
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:01,579
criticize super cruise is uh it's a
little too crude and uh I think it's

2408
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:01,589
little too crude and uh I think it's
 

2409
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:03,770
little too crude and uh I think it's
like six seconds or something if you

2410
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:03,780
like six seconds or something if you
 

2411
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,480
like six seconds or something if you
look off-road you'll start warning you

2412
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:05,490
look off-road you'll start warning you
 

2413
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,880
look off-road you'll start warning you
it's some ridiculously long period of

2414
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:07,890
it's some ridiculously long period of
 

2415
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:13,579
it's some ridiculously long period of
time and just the way it I think it's

2416
00:48:13,579 --> 00:48:13,589
time and just the way it I think it's
 

2417
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,240
time and just the way it I think it's
basically it's a binary chili adapter it

2418
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:17,250
basically it's a binary chili adapter it
 

2419
00:48:17,250 --> 00:48:19,280
basically it's a binary chili adapter it
yeah it's it just needs to learn more

2420
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:19,290
yeah it's it just needs to learn more
 

2421
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:21,440
yeah it's it just needs to learn more
about you and used to communicate what

2422
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:21,450
about you and used to communicate what
 

2423
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:24,230
about you and used to communicate what
it sees about you more like I'm not you

2424
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
it sees about you more like I'm not you
 

2425
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,059
it sees about you more like I'm not you
know Tesla shows what it sees about the

2426
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:26,069
know Tesla shows what it sees about the
 

2427
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,890
know Tesla shows what it sees about the
external world it would be nice the

2428
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:27,900
external world it would be nice the
 

2429
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,510
external world it would be nice the
supercruise would tell us what it sees

2430
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:29,520
supercruise would tell us what it sees
 

2431
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,640
supercruise would tell us what it sees
about the internal world it's even worse

2432
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:31,650
about the internal world it's even worse
 

2433
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,140
about the internal world it's even worse
than that you press the button to engage

2434
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:33,150
than that you press the button to engage
 

2435
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,579
than that you press the button to engage
and it just says super cruise

2436
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:34,589
and it just says super cruise
 

2437
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:38,660
and it just says super cruise

00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:38,670
unavailable yeah why why yeah that
 

2439
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,260

transparency is good we've renamed the

2440
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:42,270
transparency is good we've renamed the
 

2441

2444
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
service state we have car state packet
 

2445
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,829
service state we have car state packet
which has the state of the car driver

2446

which has the state of the car driver
 

2447
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,140
which has the state of the car driver
state packet which I stay the driver so

what does itah make their BAC

2450
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:53,240
what does itah make their BAC
 

2451
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:58,190
what does itah make their BAC
must be do you think that's possible

2452
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:58,200
must be do you think that's possible
 

2453
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,620
must be do you think that's possible
with computer vision absolutely so to me

2454
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:03,630
with computer vision absolutely so to me
 

2455
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,000
with computer vision absolutely so to me
it's an open question I don't haven't

2456
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:05,010
it's an open question I don't haven't
 

2457
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:07,039
it's an open question I don't haven't
looked into too much they actually had

2458
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:07,049
looked into too much they actually had
 

2459
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:08,210
looked into too much they actually had
quite seriously looked at the literature

2460
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:08,220
quite seriously looked at the literature
 

2461
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,010
quite seriously looked at the literature
it's not obvious to me that from the

2462
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:10,020
it's not obvious to me that from the
 

2463
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,780
it's not obvious to me that from the
eyes and so on you can tell you might

2464
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:11,790
eyes and so on you can tell you might
 

2465
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,339
eyes and so on you can tell you might
need to stuff from the car as well yeah

2466
00:49:13,339 --> 00:49:13,349
need to stuff from the car as well yeah
 

2467
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:14,930
need to stuff from the car as well yeah
you might need how they're controlling

2468
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:14,940
you might need how they're controlling
 

2469
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,490
you might need how they're controlling
the car right and that's fundamentally

2470
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:16,500
the car right and that's fundamentally
 

2471
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,809
the car right and that's fundamentally
at the end of the day what you care

2472
00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:17,819
at the end of the day what you care
 

2473
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:21,020
at the end of the day what you care
about you but I think especially when

2474
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:21,030
about you but I think especially when
 

2475
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:21,920
about you but I think especially when
people are really drunk they're not

2476
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:21,930
people are really drunk they're not
 

2477
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:22,850
people are really drunk they're not
controlling the car nearly

2478
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:22,860
controlling the car nearly
 

2479
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,500
controlling the car nearly
smoothly as they would look at them

2480
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:24,510
smoothly as they would look at them
 

2481
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,120
smoothly as they would look at them
walking right there the car is like an

2482
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:26,130
walking right there the car is like an
 

2483
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,740
walking right there the car is like an
extension of the body so I think you

2484
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:27,750
extension of the body so I think you
 

2485
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,990
extension of the body so I think you
could totally detect and if you could

2486
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:30,000
could totally detect and if you could
 

2487
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,640
could totally detect and if you could
fix people who drunk distracted asleep

2488
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:31,650
fix people who drunk distracted asleep
 

2489
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,530
fix people who drunk distracted asleep
if you fix those three yeah this is

2490
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:33,540
if you fix those three yeah this is
 

2491
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,320
if you fix those three yeah this is
that's huge so what are the current

2492
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:36,330
that's huge so what are the current
 

2493
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,570
that's huge so what are the current
limitations of open pilot what are the

2494
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:38,580
limitations of open pilot what are the
 

2495
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,770
limitations of open pilot what are the
main problems that still need to be

2496
00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:39,780
main problems that still need to be
 

2497
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:44,090
main problems that still need to be
solved um we're hopefully fixing a few

2498
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:44,100
solved um we're hopefully fixing a few
 

2499
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:46,880
solved um we're hopefully fixing a few
of them in 0-6 we're not as good as auto

2500
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:46,890
of them in 0-6 we're not as good as auto
 

2501
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:50,330
of them in 0-6 we're not as good as auto
pilot at stop cars so if you're coming

2502
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:50,340
pilot at stop cars so if you're coming
 

2503
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:55,580
pilot at stop cars so if you're coming
up to a red light at like 55 so it's the

2504
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:55,590
up to a red light at like 55 so it's the
 

2505
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,200
up to a red light at like 55 so it's the
radar stopped car problem which is

2506
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,210
radar stopped car problem which is
 

2507
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:59,360
radar stopped car problem which is
responsible to auto pilot accidents it's

2508
00:49:59,360 --> 00:49:59,370
responsible to auto pilot accidents it's
 

2509
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:01,760
responsible to auto pilot accidents it's
hard to differentiate a stopped car from

2510
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:01,770
hard to differentiate a stopped car from
 

2511
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:05,480
hard to differentiate a stopped car from
a like signpost yes that ecology um so

2512
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:05,490
a like signpost yes that ecology um so
 

2513
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:06,980
a like signpost yes that ecology um so
you have to fuse you have to do this

2514
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:06,990
you have to fuse you have to do this
 

2515
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:08,630
you have to fuse you have to do this
visually there's no way from the radar

2516
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
visually there's no way from the radar
 

2517
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,980
visually there's no way from the radar
data to tell the difference maybe you

2518
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:09,990
data to tell the difference maybe you
 

2519
00:50:09,990 --> 00:50:11,900
data to tell the difference maybe you
could make a map but I really believe in

2520
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,910
could make a map but I really believe in
 

2521
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,720
could make a map but I really believe in
mapping at all anymore um really what

2522
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:14,730
mapping at all anymore um really what
 

2523
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:17,720
mapping at all anymore um really what
you don't believe in mapping no so you

2524
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:17,730
you don't believe in mapping no so you
 

2525
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,780
you don't believe in mapping no so you
basically the open pilot solution is

2526
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:20,790
basically the open pilot solution is
 

2527
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:22,220
basically the open pilot solution is
saying react to the environment is just

2528
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,230
saying react to the environment is just
 

2529
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:24,710
saying react to the environment is just
like human doing beings and then

2530
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
like human doing beings and then
 

2531
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,090
like human doing beings and then
eventually when you want to do navigate

2532
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:26,100
eventually when you want to do navigate
 

2533
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,180
eventually when you want to do navigate
on open pilot I'll train the net to look

2534
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,190
on open pilot I'll train the net to look
 

2535
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:31,340
on open pilot I'll train the net to look
at ways all runways in the background

2536
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:31,350
at ways all runways in the background
 

2537
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:34,850
at ways all runways in the background
I'll train a car using GPS at all we use

2538
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:34,860
I'll train a car using GPS at all we use
 

2539
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,680
I'll train a car using GPS at all we use
it to crown trees we use it to very

2540
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:36,690
it to crown trees we use it to very
 

2541
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:38,510
it to crown trees we use it to very
carefully ground treat the paths we have

2542
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:38,520
carefully ground treat the paths we have
 

2543
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,730
carefully ground treat the paths we have
a stack which can recover a relative to

2544
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:40,740
a stack which can recover a relative to
 

2545
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:43,130
a stack which can recover a relative to
10 centimeters over one minute and then

2546
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:43,140
10 centimeters over one minute and then
 

2547
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:44,480
10 centimeters over one minute and then
we use that to ground truth exactly

2548
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:44,490
we use that to ground truth exactly
 

2549
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:46,700
we use that to ground truth exactly
where the car went in that local part of

00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:46,710
where the car went in that local part of
 

2551
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,860
where the car went in that local part of
the environment but it's all local how

right were you were you located San

2558
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:55,170
right were you were you located San
 

2559
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,910
right were you were you located San
Diego San Diego yeah okay Oh what you

2560
00:50:58,910 --> 00:50:58,920
Diego San Diego yeah okay Oh what you
 

2561
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,620
Diego San Diego yeah okay Oh what you
basically drive around there then

2562
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:00,630
basically drive around there then
 

2563
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,900
basically drive around there then
collect some data and watch on Florence

2564
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:02,910
collect some data and watch on Florence
 

2565
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,910
collect some data and watch on Florence
we have a simulator now and we have our

00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:04,920
we have a simulator now and we have our
 

2567
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,310
we have a simulator now and we have our

2569
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,990

not it's not like a unity based

2570
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:09,000
not it's not like a unity based
 

2571
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,030
not it's not like a unity based
simulator our simulator lets us load in

00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:11,040
simulator our simulator lets us load in
 

2573
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:14,840
simulator our simulator lets us load in
real estate what I mean we can load in a

2574
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:14,850
real estate what I mean we can load in a
 

2575
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,050
real estate what I mean we can load in a
drive and simulate what the system would

2576
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:18,060
drive and simulate what the system would
 

2577
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,090

00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,680
have done on the historical data ooh
nice interesting so what yeah right now

00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:24,690
nice interesting so what yeah right now

00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:26,300
nice interesting so what yeah right now
we're only using it for testing but as

what's your feeling about the real world
 

2587
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:33,770
what's your feeling about the real world
versus simulation do you like simulation

2588
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:33,780
versus simulation do you like simulation
 

2589
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:35,690
versus simulation do you like simulation
for training if this moves to training

we have to distinguish two types of
 

2595
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,910
we have to distinguish two types of
simulators right there's a simulator

2596
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:40,920
simulators right there's a simulator
 

2597
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,990
simulators right there's a simulator
that light is completely fake I could

2598
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:45,000
that light is completely fake I could
 

2599
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,120
that light is completely fake I could
get my car to drive around in GTA mm-hmm

get my car to drive around in GTA mm-hmm
 

2601
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:50,120
get my car to drive around in GTA mm-hmm
um I feel that this kind of simulator is

2602
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:50,130
um I feel that this kind of simulator is
 

2603
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:54,830
um I feel that this kind of simulator is
useless you're never there's so many my

00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,110
useless you're never there's so many my
analogy here is like okay fine you're

2606
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:57,120
analogy here is like okay fine you're
 

2607
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,510
analogy here is like okay fine you're
not solving the computer vision problem

2608
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
not solving the computer vision problem
 

2609
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,340
not solving the computer vision problem
but you're solving the computer graphics

2610
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:01,350
but you're solving the computer graphics
 

2611
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:03,560
but you're solving the computer graphics
problem right and you don't think you

00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:03,570
problem right and you don't think you
 

2613
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:05,600
problem right and you don't think you
can get very far about creating ultra

can get very far about creating ultra
 

2615
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:09,080
can get very far about creating ultra
realistic graphics no because you can

2616
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:09,090
realistic graphics no because you can
 

2617
00:52:09,090 --> 00:52:10,520
realistic graphics no because you can
create ultra realistic graphics of the

00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:10,530
create ultra realistic graphics of the
 

2619
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,320
create ultra realistic graphics of the
road now create alter a realistic

2620
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:12,330
road now create alter a realistic

well I'll just use my self-driving no
you won't you need real you need actual

2626
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:20,100
you won't you need real you need actual
 

2627
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,310
you won't you need real you need actual
human behavior because that's what

2628
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:22,320
human behavior because that's what
 

2629
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:24,260
human behavior because that's what
you're trying to learn the dead driving

2630
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:24,270
you're trying to learn the dead driving
 

2631
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,690
you're trying to learn the dead driving
does not have a spec the definition of

2632
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,700
does not have a spec the definition of
 

2633
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,460
does not have a spec the definition of
driving is what humans do when they

2634
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:28,470
driving is what humans do when they
 

2635
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,340
driving is what humans do when they
drive whatever way mode does I don't

2636
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:31,350
drive whatever way mode does I don't
 

2637
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:34,520
drive whatever way mode does I don't
think it's driving right well I think if

2638
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:34,530
think it's driving right well I think if
 

2639
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,770
think it's driving right well I think if
you win more than others its if there's

2640
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:36,780
you win more than others its if there's
 

2641
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:38,990
you win more than others its if there's
any useful reinforcement learning I've

2642
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:39,000
any useful reinforcement learning I've
 

2643
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,640
any useful reinforcement learning I've
seen it used quite well I study

2644
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:40,650
seen it used quite well I study
 

2645
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:42,650
seen it used quite well I study
pedestrians a lot too is try to train

in human-like ways by that point you've

2654
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:51,240
in human-like ways by that point you've
 

2655
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:54,260
in human-like ways by that point you've
already gone so many layers you detected

vision before deep learning well okay

2664
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:05,400
vision before deep learning well okay
 

2665
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,340
vision before deep learning well okay
you know I feel like this is a

2666
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:07,350
you know I feel like this is a
 

2667
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,190
you know I feel like this is a
perception to you is the sticking point

2668
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
perception to you is the sticking point
 

2669
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,320
perception to you is the sticking point
does that mean what what's what's the

2670
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:12,330
does that mean what what's what's the
 

2671
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,300
does that mean what what's what's the
hardest part of the stack here there is

2672
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,310
hardest part of the stack here there is
 

2673
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:19,510
hardest part of the stack here there is
no human understandable feature vector

2674

separating perception and planning

2676
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:22,250
separating perception and planning
 

2677
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:24,620
separating perception and planning
that's the best way I can I can put that

2678
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:24,630
that's the best way I can I can put that
 

2679
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:26,930
that's the best way I can I can put that
there is no so it's all together and

2680
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:26,940
there is no so it's all together and
 

2681
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:29,750
there is no so it's all together and
it's it's a that's a joint problem so

2682
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
it's it's a that's a joint problem so
 

2683
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,240
it's it's a that's a joint problem so
you can take localization localization

2684
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,250
you can take localization localization
 

2685
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,650
you can take localization localization
and planning there is a human

2686
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:33,660
and planning there is a human
 

2687
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,880
and planning there is a human

these two things I mean okay so I have

2690
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:36,990
these two things I mean okay so I have
 

2691
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,810
these two things I mean okay so I have
like three degrees position three

2692
00:53:38,810 --> 00:53:38,820
like three degrees position three
 

2693
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,860
like three degrees position three
degrees orientation and those

2694
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:39,870
degrees orientation and those
 

2695
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,210
degrees orientation and those
derivatives maybe those second

2696
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:41,220
derivatives maybe those second
 

2697
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,590
derivatives maybe those second
derivatives right that's human

2698
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:42,600
derivatives right that's human
 

2699
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,860
derivatives right that's human
understandable that's physical the

2700
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:44,870
understandable that's physical the
 

2701
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:48,500
understandable that's physical the
between perception and planning

2702
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:48,510
between perception and planning
 

2703
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,410
between perception and planning
um so like way Moe has a perception

2704
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:51,420
um so like way Moe has a perception
 

2705
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,320
um so like way Moe has a perception
stack and then a planner um and one of

2706
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:54,330
stack and then a planner um and one of
 

2707
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:56,210
stack and then a planner um and one of
the things way matters right is they

2708
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:56,220
the things way matters right is they
 

2709
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:59,390
the things way matters right is they
have a simulator that can separate those

2710
00:53:59,390 --> 00:53:59,400
have a simulator that can separate those
 

2711
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,030
have a simulator that can separate those
two they can like replay their

2712
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:02,040
two they can like replay their
 

2713
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,740
two they can like replay their
perception data and test their system

2714
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:03,750
perception data and test their system
 

2715
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,000
perception data and test their system
which is what I'm talking about about

2716
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:05,010
which is what I'm talking about about
 

2717
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:05,870
which is what I'm talking about about
like the two different kinds of

2718
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:05,880
like the two different kinds of
 

2719
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,310
like the two different kinds of
simulators there's the kind that can

2720
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:07,320
simulators there's the kind that can
 

2721
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,810
simulators there's the kind that can
work on real data and is the kind of

2722
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:08,820
work on real data and is the kind of
 

2723
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,740
work on real data and is the kind of
can't work on real data now the problem

2724
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:12,750
can't work on real data now the problem
 

2725
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,780
can't work on real data now the problem
is that I don't think you can hand code

2726
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:14,790
is that I don't think you can hand code
 

2727
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:16,550
is that I don't think you can hand code
a feature vector right like like you

2728
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:16,560
a feature vector right like like you
 

2729
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,840
a feature vector right like like you
have some lists of like well here's my

2730
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:17,850
have some lists of like well here's my
 

2731
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:19,460
have some lists of like well here's my
list of cars on the scenes here's my

2732
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:19,470

isn't what humans are doing what are

2736
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:23,580
isn't what humans are doing what are
 

2737
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,740
isn't what humans are doing what are
humans doing global some something

humans doing global some something
 

2739
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:29,320
humans doing global some something
you're saying that's too difficult to

2740
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:29,330
you're saying that's too difficult to
 

2741
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:33,500
you're saying that's too difficult to
handle I'm saying that there is no state

2742
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:33,510

have to do is define the state vector

2752
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
have to do is define the state vector
 

2753
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,310
have to do is define the state vector
that separates those two I'm missing the

what do you mean so what is the output

2758
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:50,369
what do you mean so what is the output
 

2759
00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:53,050
what do you mean so what is the output
of your perception system

2760
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:53,060
of your perception system
 

2761
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:58,750
of your perception system
I'll put it the perception system it's

2762
00:54:58,750 --> 00:54:58,760
I'll put it the perception system it's
 

2763
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:01,070
I'll put it the perception system it's
theirs okay well there's several ways to

2764
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:01,080
theirs okay well there's several ways to
 

2765
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,080
theirs okay well there's several ways to
do it one is this lamp components

2766
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,090
do it one is this lamp components
 

2767
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:05,030
do it one is this lamp components
localization the other is drivable area

2768
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040

drivable space drivable space and then

2770
00:55:06,859 --> 00:55:06,869
drivable space drivable space and then
 

2771
00:55:06,869 --> 00:55:08,420
drivable space drivable space and then
there's the different objects in the

2772
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:08,430
there's the different objects in the
 

2773
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:14,720
there's the different objects in the

over time maybe to give you input to

2776
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:17,190
over time maybe to give you input to
 

2777
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,280
over time maybe to give you input to
then try to start modeling the

2778
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:19,290
then try to start modeling the
 

2779
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:21,680
then try to start modeling the
trajectories of those objects sure

2780
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:21,690
trajectories of those objects sure
 

2781
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:23,599
trajectories of those objects sure
that's it I can give you a concrete

2782
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:23,609
that's it I can give you a concrete
 

2783
00:55:23,609 --> 00:55:25,250
that's it I can give you a concrete
example of something you missed what's

2784
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:25,260
example of something you missed what's
 

2785
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:25,580
example of something you missed what's
that

2786
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:25,590
that
 

2787
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:28,030
that
so say there's a bush in the scene

2788
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:28,040
so say there's a bush in the scene
 

2789
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,200
so say there's a bush in the scene
humans understand that when they see

2790
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:30,210
humans understand that when they see
 

2791
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:32,570
humans understand that when they see
this bush that there may or may not be a

2792
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:32,580
this bush that there may or may not be a
 

2793
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:35,660
this bush that there may or may not be a
car behind that bush drivable area and a

2794
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:35,670
car behind that bush drivable area and a
 

2795
00:55:35,670 --> 00:55:36,859
car behind that bush drivable area and a
list of objects does not include that

2796
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:36,869
list of objects does not include that
 

2797
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:39,080
list of objects does not include that
humans are doing this constantly at the

2798
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,090
humans are doing this constantly at the
 

2799
00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:41,630
humans are doing this constantly at the
simplest intersections so now you have

2800
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:41,640
simplest intersections so now you have
 

2801
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,930
simplest intersections so now you have
to talk about occluded area right right

2802
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:44,940
to talk about occluded area right right
 

2803
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,910
to talk about occluded area right right
but even that what do you mean by

2804
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:46,920
but even that what do you mean by
 

2805
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:49,880
but even that what do you mean by
occluded okay so I can't see it well if

2806
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:49,890
occluded okay so I can't see it well if
 

2807
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:51,200
occluded okay so I can't see it well if
it's the other side of a house I don't

2808
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:51,210
it's the other side of a house I don't
 

2809
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,060
it's the other side of a house I don't
care what's the likelihood that there's

2810
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:53,070
care what's the likelihood that there's
 

2811
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,580
care what's the likelihood that there's
a car in that occluded area right and if

2812
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:55,590
a car in that occluded area right and if
 

2813
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:58,400
a car in that occluded area right and if
you say okay we'll add that I can come

2814
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,410
you say okay we'll add that I can come
 

2815
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,900
you say okay we'll add that I can come
up with 10 more examples that you can't

2816
00:55:59,900 --> 00:55:59,910
up with 10 more examples that you can't
 

2817
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,420
up with 10 more examples that you can't
add

2818
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:01,430
add
 

2819
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:03,130
add
certainly occluded area would be

2820
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:03,140
certainly occluded area would be
 

2821
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,260
certainly occluded area would be
something that simulator would have

2822
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:05,270
something that simulator would have
 

2823
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,750
something that simulator would have
because it's simulating the entire you

2824
00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:07,760
because it's simulating the entire you
 

2825
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,920
because it's simulating the entire you
know occlusion is part of it a part of a

2826
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:11,930
know occlusion is part of it a part of a

vision stack pleasures that what I'm

2828
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:13,370
vision stack pleasures that what I'm
 

2829
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,700
vision stack pleasures that what I'm
saying is if you have a hand engineered

2830
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:15,710
saying is if you have a hand engineered
 

2831
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:19,570
saying is if you have a hand engineered
if your perception system output can be

2832
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:19,580
if your perception system output can be
 

2833
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,520
if your perception system output can be
written in a spec document it is

2834
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:21,530
written in a spec document it is
 

2835
00:56:21,530 --> 00:56:24,520
written in a spec document it is
incomplete yeah idem you know certainly

2836
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:24,530
incomplete yeah idem you know certainly
 

2837
00:56:24,530 --> 00:56:27,490
incomplete yeah idem you know certainly
it's it's hard to argue with that

2838
00:56:27,490 --> 00:56:27,500
it's it's hard to argue with that
 

2839
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,620
it's it's hard to argue with that
because in the end that's going to be

2840
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:29,630
because in the end that's going to be
 

2841
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,660
because in the end that's going to be
true yes I'll tell you what the output

2842
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:31,670
true yes I'll tell you what the output
 

2843
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:33,040
true yes I'll tell you what the output
of our perception system is was that

2844
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:33,050
of our perception system is was that
 

2845
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:35,110
of our perception system is was that
it's a thousand it's a thousand twenty

00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:35,120
it's a thousand it's a thousand twenty

dimensions of who knows what because its
 

2855

operating on real data yeah yeah

2856
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:46,120
operating on real data yeah yeah
 

2857
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,880
operating on real data yeah yeah
and that's the perception that's the

2858
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:48,890
and that's the perception that's the
 

2859
00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:50,890
and that's the perception that's the
perception stake right think about a

2860
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:50,900
perception stake right think about a
 

2861
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:52,540
perception stake right think about a
think about an autoencoder four phases

2862
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:52,550
think about an autoencoder four phases
 

2863
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:54,370
think about an autoencoder four phases
alright if you have an autoencoder four

2864
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:54,380
alright if you have an autoencoder four
 

2865
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:59,140
alright if you have an autoencoder four
phases and you say it has 256 dimensions

2866
00:56:59,140 --> 00:56:59,150
phases and you say it has 256 dimensions
 

2867
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,550
phases and you say it has 256 dimensions
in middle and I'm taking a face over

2868
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:00,560
in middle and I'm taking a face over
 

2869
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,720
in middle and I'm taking a face over
here and projecting it to a face over

2870
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:01,730
here and projecting it to a face over
 

2871
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:04,600
here and projecting it to a face over
here yeah can you hand label all 256 of

2872
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:04,610
here yeah can you hand label all 256 of
 

2873
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:05,460
here yeah can you hand label all 256 of
those dimensions

2874
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:05,470
those dimensions
 

2875
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:07,900
those dimensions
well no but those are generated

2876
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:07,910
well no but those are generated
 

2877
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:10,030
well no but those are generated
automatically but they but even if you

2878
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:10,040
automatically but they but even if you
 

2879
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,100
automatically but they but even if you
tried to do it by hand could you come up

2880
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:12,110
tried to do it by hand could you come up
 

2881
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:15,160
tried to do it by hand could you come up
with a spec for your and between your

2882
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:15,170
with a spec for your and between your
 

2883
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,530
with a spec for your and between your
encoder and your decoder

2884
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:16,540
encoder and your decoder
 

2885
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,480
encoder and your decoder
no no because that's not it is it wasn't

2886
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:19,490
no no because that's not it is it wasn't
 

2887
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,550
no no because that's not it is it wasn't
designed but there no no but if you

2888
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:21,560
designed but there no no but if you
 

2889
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,460
designed but there no no but if you
could design it if you could design a

2890
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:24,470
could design it if you could design a
 

2891
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:27,070
could design it if you could design a
face Reconstructor system could you come

2892
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:27,080
face Reconstructor system could you come
 

2893
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:30,550
face Reconstructor system could you come
up with a spec no but I think we're

2894
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:30,560
up with a spec no but I think we're
 

2895
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,920
up with a spec no but I think we're
missing here a little bit I think the

2896
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:32,930
missing here a little bit I think the
 

2897
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:35,350
missing here a little bit I think the
the you're just being very poetic about

2898
00:57:35,350 --> 00:57:35,360
the you're just being very poetic about
 

2899
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,090
the you're just being very poetic about
expressing a fundamental problem of

2900
00:57:37,090 --> 00:57:37,100
expressing a fundamental problem of
 

2901
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,850
expressing a fundamental problem of
simulators that they're going to be

2902
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:39,860
simulators that they're going to be
 

2903
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,650
simulators that they're going to be
missing so much that the feature vector

2904
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:44,660
missing so much that the feature vector
 

2905
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,060
missing so much that the feature vector
would just look fundamentally different

2906
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:46,070
would just look fundamentally different
 

2907
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:49,660
would just look fundamentally different
from in the simulated world in the real

2908
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:49,670
from in the simulated world in the real
 

2909
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:52,660
from in the simulated world in the real
world I'm not making a claim about

2910
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:52,670
world I'm not making a claim about
 

2911
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:55,350

simulators I'm making a claim about the

2912
00:57:55,350 --> 00:57:55,360
simulators I'm making a claim about the
 

2913
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,150
simulators I'm making a claim about the
spec division between perception and

2914
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
spec division between perception and
 

2915
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,890

drivable areas
 

2935
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,380
drivable areas
insufficient and if you start to believe

2936
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:17,390
insufficient and if you start to believe
 

2937
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:19,270
insufficient and if you start to believe
that you realize that what Wayman crews

2938
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:19,280
that you realize that what Wayman crews
 

2939
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,490
that you realize that what Wayman crews
are doing is impossible currently what

2940
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:21,500
are doing is impossible currently what
 

2941
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,650
are doing is impossible currently what
we're doing is the perception problem

2942
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:23,660
we're doing is the perception problem
 

2943
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:26,620
we're doing is the perception problem
it's converting the scene into a

2944
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:26,630
it's converting the scene into a
 

2945
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,370
it's converting the scene into a
chessboard you yeah and then you reason

2946
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:30,380
chessboard you yeah and then you reason
 

2947
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,200
chessboard you yeah and then you reason
some basic reasoning around that

2948
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:32,210
some basic reasoning around that
 

2949
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,180
some basic reasoning around that
chessboard yeah and you're saying that

2950
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:34,190
chessboard yeah and you're saying that
 

2951
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,650
chessboard yeah and you're saying that
really there's a lot missing there first

2952
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:38,660
really there's a lot missing there first
 

2953
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,390
really there's a lot missing there first
of all why are we talking about this cuz

2954
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
of all why are we talking about this cuz
 

2955
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,090
of all why are we talking about this cuz
isn't this a full autonomy is this

2956
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:43,100
isn't this a full autonomy is this
 

2957
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:45,640
isn't this a full autonomy is this
something you think about oh I want to

2958
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:45,650
something you think about oh I want to
 

2959
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:48,220
something you think about oh I want to
win self-driving cars so you're really

2960
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,230
win self-driving cars so you're really
 

2961
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:52,330
win self-driving cars so you're really
your definition of win includes level of

2962
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:52,340
your definition of win includes level of
 

2963
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,370
your definition of win includes level of
fool five level five I don't think level

2964
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:54,380
fool five level five I don't think level
 

2965
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,800
fool five level five I don't think level
four is a real thing I want to build I

2966
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:56,810
four is a real thing I want to build I
 

2967
00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:01,240
four is a real thing I want to build I
want to build the alphago of driving so

2968
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:01,250
want to build the alphago of driving so
 

2969
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:06,460
want to build the alphago of driving so
so alphago is really end to end yeah is

2970
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,470
so alphago is really end to end yeah is
 

2971
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:10,750
so alphago is really end to end yeah is
uh yeah it's end to end and do you think

2972
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:10,760
uh yeah it's end to end and do you think
 

2973
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,420
uh yeah it's end to end and do you think
this whole problem is those that also

2974
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:13,430
this whole problem is those that also
 

2975
00:59:13,430 --> 00:59:14,920
this whole problem is those that also
kind of what you're getting at with the

2976
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:14,930
kind of what you're getting at with the
 

2977
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:17,110
kind of what you're getting at with the
perception and the planning is that this

2978
00:59:17,110 --> 00:59:17,120
perception and the planning is that this
 

2979
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,060
perception and the planning is that this
whole problem the right way to do it is

2980
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,070
whole problem the right way to do it is
 

2981
00:59:19,070 --> 00:59:21,610
whole problem the right way to do it is
really to learn the entire thing I'll

2982
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:21,620
really to learn the entire thing I'll
 

2983
00:59:21,620 --> 00:59:23,380
really to learn the entire thing I'll
argue that not only is it the right way

00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,390
argue that not only is it the right way
 

2985
00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:25,690

it's the only way that's going to exceed

it's the only way that's going to exceed
 

2987

2993
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:34,810
go things built human inferior things
and then someone came along and wrote

00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:34,820
and then someone came along and wrote
 

2995
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,610
and then someone came along and wrote
some 10,000 line thing that doesn't know

2996
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:36,620
some 10,000 line thing that doesn't know
 

2997
00:59:36,620 --> 00:59:38,910
some 10,000 line thing that doesn't know
anything about go that beat everybody

anything about go that beat everybody
 

2999
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:43,120
anything about go that beat everybody
it's 10,000 lines true in that sense the

3000
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,130
it's 10,000 lines true in that sense the
 

3001
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:47,050
it's 10,000 lines true in that sense the
the open question then that maybe I can

3002
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:47,060
the open question then that maybe I can
 

3003
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:52,360
the open question then that maybe I can
ask you is uh driving is much harder

3004
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:52,370
ask you is uh driving is much harder
 

3005
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,820
ask you is uh driving is much harder
than go the open question is how much

3006
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:54,830
than go the open question is how much
 

3007
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:58,420
than go the open question is how much
harder so how because I think the AH

3008
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:58,430
harder so how because I think the AH
 

3009
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:00,220
harder so how because I think the AH

really do formulate is a learning
 

3019
01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:12,130
really do formulate is a learning
problem and it solves a learning problem

3020
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:12,140
problem and it solves a learning problem
 

3021
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,960
problem and it solves a learning problem
of scale so how many years put one is

3022
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:16,970
of scale so how many years put one is
 

3023
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:18,400

how many years would it take to solve

3024
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:18,410
how many years would it take to solve
 

3025
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,140
how many years would it take to solve
this problem or just how hard is this

3026
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,150
this problem or just how hard is this
 

3027
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:25,370
this problem or just how hard is this
freaking problem well the cool thing is

3028
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:25,380
freaking problem well the cool thing is
 

3029
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:28,069
freaking problem well the cool thing is
I think there's a lot of value that we

3030
01:00:28,069 --> 01:00:28,079
I think there's a lot of value that we
 

3031
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:31,430
I think there's a lot of value that we
can deliver along the way I think that

3032
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
can deliver along the way I think that
 

3033
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,099
can deliver along the way I think that
you can build lane-keeping assist

3034
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:36,109
you can build lane-keeping assist
 

3035
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:39,219
you can build lane-keeping assist

so let's jump around with you you

3048
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:53,039
so let's jump around with you you
 

3049
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:54,650
so let's jump around with you you

an autopilot yeah

3052
01:00:55,759 --> 01:00:55,769
an autopilot yeah
 

3053
01:00:55,769 --> 01:00:57,650

01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:57,660
what advice how would you make it better
 

3055
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,630
what advice how would you make it better
do you think as a feature that if it's

do you think as a feature that if it's
 

3057
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:01,450
do you think as a feature that if it's
done really well it's a good feature I

3058
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:01,460
done really well it's a good feature I
 

3059
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:06,349
done really well it's a good feature I
think that it's too reliant on like hand

3060
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:06,359
think that it's too reliant on like hand
 

3061

still doesn't do a great job of creating
 

3089
01:01:37,289 --> 01:01:39,849
still doesn't do a great job of creating
a comfortable natural experience and

3090
01:01:39,849 --> 01:01:39,859
a comfortable natural experience and
 

3091
01:01:39,859 --> 01:01:42,559
a comfortable natural experience and
navigate on autopilot just lane changes

3092
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:42,569
navigate on autopilot just lane changes
 

3093
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:45,099
navigate on autopilot just lane changes
an extension of that so how do you learn

3094
01:01:45,099 --> 01:01:45,109
an extension of that so how do you learn
 

3095
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:51,200
an extension of that so how do you learn
to do natural lane change so we have it

3096
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:51,210
to do natural lane change so we have it
 

3097
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,709
to do natural lane change so we have it
and I can talk about how it works so I

3098
01:01:53,709 --> 01:01:53,719
and I can talk about how it works so I
 

3099
01:01:53,719 --> 01:01:57,259
and I can talk about how it works so I
feel that we have the solution for

3100
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:57,269
feel that we have the solution for
 

3101
01:01:57,269 --> 01:01:59,539
feel that we have the solution for
lateral but we don't yet have the

3102
01:01:59,539 --> 01:01:59,549
lateral but we don't yet have the
 

3103
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,190
lateral but we don't yet have the
solution for longitudinal there's a few

3104
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
solution for longitudinal there's a few
 

3105
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,779
solution for longitudinal there's a few
reasons longitudinal is harder than

3106
01:02:02,779 --> 01:02:02,789
reasons longitudinal is harder than
 

3107
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:05,329
reasons longitudinal is harder than
lateral the lane change component the

3108
01:02:05,329 --> 01:02:05,339
lateral the lane change component the
 

3109
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:07,849
lateral the lane change component the
way that we train on it very simply is

3110
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:07,859
way that we train on it very simply is
 

3111
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:11,390
way that we train on it very simply is
like our model has an input for whether

3112
01:02:11,390 --> 01:02:11,400
like our model has an input for whether
 

3113
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,390
like our model has an input for whether
it's doing a lane change or not and then

3114
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:14,400
it's doing a lane change or not and then
 

3115
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,609
it's doing a lane change or not and then
when we train the end-to-end model we

3116
01:02:16,609 --> 01:02:16,619
when we train the end-to-end model we
 

3117
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,589
when we train the end-to-end model we
hand label all the lane changes because

3118
01:02:18,589 --> 01:02:18,599
hand label all the lane changes because
 

3119
01:02:18,599 --> 01:02:21,289
hand label all the lane changes because
you have to I struggled a long time

3120
01:02:21,289 --> 01:02:21,299
you have to I struggled a long time
 

3121
01:02:21,299 --> 01:02:22,819
you have to I struggled a long time
about not wanting to do that but I think

3122
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:22,829
about not wanting to do that but I think
 

3123
01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:24,680
about not wanting to do that but I think
you have to because you order the

3124
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:24,690
you have to because you order the
 

3125
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,359
you have to because you order the
training data for the train data right

3126
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:26,369
training data for the train data right
 

3127
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:27,680
training data for the train data right
well we actually we have an automatic

3128
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:27,690
well we actually we have an automatic
 

3129
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:29,089
well we actually we have an automatic
ground truth or which automatically

3130
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:29,099
ground truth or which automatically
 

3131
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:30,950
ground truth or which automatically
labels all the lane changes was that

3132
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:30,960
labels all the lane changes was that
 

3133
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,779
labels all the lane changes was that
possible to automatically label interest

3134
01:02:32,779 --> 01:02:32,789
possible to automatically label interest
 

3135
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,309
possible to automatically label interest
yeah and detect the lane I see when it

3136
01:02:34,309 --> 01:02:34,319
yeah and detect the lane I see when it
 

3137
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,359
yeah and detect the lane I see when it
crosses it right I don't have to get

3138
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:35,369
crosses it right I don't have to get
 

3139
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:36,920
crosses it right I don't have to get
that that high percent accuracy but it's

3140
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:36,930
that that high percent accuracy but it's
 

3141
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,520
that that high percent accuracy but it's
like 95 good enough

3142
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:38,530
like 95 good enough
 

3143
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:42,690
like 95 good enough
now I set the bit when it's doing the

3144
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:42,700
now I set the bit when it's doing the
 

3145
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,099
now I set the bit when it's doing the
lane change in the end-to-end learning

3146
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:44,109
lane change in the end-to-end learning
 

3147
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:47,099
lane change in the end-to-end learning
and then I set it to zero when it's not

3148
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:47,109
and then I set it to zero when it's not
 

3149
01:02:47,109 --> 01:02:48,630
and then I set it to zero when it's not
doing a lane change so now if I wanted

3150
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:48,640
doing a lane change so now if I wanted
 

3151
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,950
doing a lane change so now if I wanted
to do a lane change a test time I just

3152
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:49,960
to do a lane change a test time I just
 

3153
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,560
to do a lane change a test time I just
put the bit to a 1 and I'll do later

3154
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:51,570
put the bit to a 1 and I'll do later
 

3155
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:54,060
put the bit to a 1 and I'll do later
yeah but so if you look at the space of

3156
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:54,070
yeah but so if you look at the space of
 

3157
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:56,160
yeah but so if you look at the space of
lane change you know some percentage not

3158
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:56,170
lane change you know some percentage not
 

3159
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:58,589
lane change you know some percentage not
a hundred percent that we make as humans

3160
01:02:58,589 --> 01:02:58,599
a hundred percent that we make as humans
 

3161
01:02:58,599 --> 01:03:01,440
a hundred percent that we make as humans
is not a pleasant experience because we

3162
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:01,450
is not a pleasant experience because we
 

3163
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:03,000
is not a pleasant experience because we
messed some part of it up yeah it's

3164
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:03,010
messed some part of it up yeah it's
 

3165
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:05,250
messed some part of it up yeah it's
nerve-racking to change even look at the

3166
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:05,260
nerve-racking to change even look at the
 

3167
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,710
nerve-racking to change even look at the
seizure des accelerate how do we label

3168
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:07,720
seizure des accelerate how do we label
 

3169
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,359
seizure des accelerate how do we label
the ones that are natural and feel good

3170
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:09,369
the ones that are natural and feel good
 

3171
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:12,060
the ones that are natural and feel good
you know that's the because that's your

3172
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:12,070
you know that's the because that's your
 

3173

01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:14,680
ultimate criticism the current Oh
 

3175
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,650
ultimate criticism the current Oh
navigate not apologies doesn't feel good

3176
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:16,660
navigate not apologies doesn't feel good
 

3177
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,359
navigate not apologies doesn't feel good
well the current navigator on autopilot

3178
01:03:18,359 --> 01:03:18,369
well the current navigator on autopilot
 

3179
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:20,760
well the current navigator on autopilot
is a hand coded policy written by an

3180
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:20,770
is a hand coded policy written by an
 

3181
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:22,320
is a hand coded policy written by an
engineer in a room who probably went out

3182
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:22,330
engineer in a room who probably went out
 

3183
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:24,620
engineer in a room who probably went out
and tested it a few times on the 280

3184
01:03:24,620 --> 01:03:24,630
and tested it a few times on the 280
 

3185
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:28,470
and tested it a few times on the 280
probably a more a better version of that

3186
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:28,480
probably a more a better version of that
 

3187
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,240
probably a more a better version of that
but yes that's how we would have written

3188
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:30,250
but yes that's how we would have written
 

3189
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:33,180
but yes that's how we would have written
it a comment yeah Tesla they tested it

3190
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:33,190
it a comment yeah Tesla they tested it
 

3191
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:34,880
it a comment yeah Tesla they tested it
and it might have been two engineers

3192
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:34,890
and it might have been two engineers
 

3193
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,690
and it might have been two engineers
yeah no but so if you learn the lane

3194
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:39,700
yeah no but so if you learn the lane
 

3195
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,400
yeah no but so if you learn the lane
change if you learn how to do a lane

3196
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:41,410
change if you learn how to do a lane
 

3197
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:43,349
change if you learn how to do a lane
change from data just like just like you

3198
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
change from data just like just like you
 

3199
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,790
change from data just like just like you
have a label that says lane change and

3200
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:44,800
have a label that says lane change and
 

3201
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,530
have a label that says lane change and
then you put it in when you want to do

3202
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:46,540
then you put it in when you want to do
 

3203
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,960
then you put it in when you want to do
the lane change it'll automatically do

3204
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:48,970
the lane change it'll automatically do
 

3205
01:03:48,970 --> 01:03:50,550
the lane change it'll automatically do
the lane change that's appropriate for

3206
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:50,560
the lane change that's appropriate for
 

3207
01:03:50,560 --> 01:03:53,579
the lane change that's appropriate for
the situation now to get it the problem

3208
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:53,589
the situation now to get it the problem
 

3209
01:03:53,589 --> 01:03:57,510
the situation now to get it the problem
of some humans do bad lane changes we

3210
01:03:57,510 --> 01:03:57,520
of some humans do bad lane changes we
 

3211
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,310
of some humans do bad lane changes we
haven't worked too much on this problem

3212
01:03:59,310 --> 01:03:59,320
haven't worked too much on this problem
 

3213
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:01,589
haven't worked too much on this problem
yet it's not that much of a problem in

3214
01:04:01,589 --> 01:04:01,599
yet it's not that much of a problem in
 

3215
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,770
yet it's not that much of a problem in
practice my theory is that all good

3216
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:04,780
practice my theory is that all good
 

3217
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,390
practice my theory is that all good
drivers are good in the same way and all

3218
01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:06,400
drivers are good in the same way and all
 

3219
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,420
drivers are good in the same way and all
bad drivers are bad in different ways

3220
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:08,430
bad drivers are bad in different ways
 

3221
01:04:08,430 --> 01:04:10,620
bad drivers are bad in different ways
and we've we've seen some data to back

3222
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:10,630
and we've we've seen some data to back
 

3223
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:12,870
and we've we've seen some data to back
this up well beautifully put so you just

3224
01:04:12,870 --> 01:04:12,880
this up well beautifully put so you just
 

3225
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:16,050
this up well beautifully put so you just
basically if that's true yeah hypothesis

3226
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:16,060
basically if that's true yeah hypothesis
 

3227
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,359
basically if that's true yeah hypothesis
then you know task is to discover the

3228
01:04:18,359 --> 01:04:18,369
then you know task is to discover the
 

3229
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:21,359
then you know task is to discover the
good drivers um the good drivers stand

3230
01:04:21,359 --> 01:04:21,369
good drivers um the good drivers stand
 

3231
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:23,280
good drivers um the good drivers stand
out because they're in one cluster and

3232
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:23,290
out because they're in one cluster and
 

3233
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,660
out because they're in one cluster and
the bad drivers are scattered all over

3234
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:24,670
the bad drivers are scattered all over
 

3235
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:25,770
the bad drivers are scattered all over
the place and your net learns the

3236
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:25,780
the place and your net learns the
 

3237
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,740
the place and your net learns the
cluster yeah that's uh

3238
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:28,750
cluster yeah that's uh
 

3239
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:29,880
cluster yeah that's uh
so you just learned from the good

3240
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:29,890
so you just learned from the good
 

3241
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:33,599
so you just learned from the good
drivers and they're easy to cluster we

3242
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:33,609
drivers and they're easy to cluster we
 

3243
01:04:33,609 --> 01:04:34,500
drivers and they're easy to cluster we
learned from all of them and that

3244
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:34,510
learned from all of them and that
 

3245
01:04:34,510 --> 01:04:35,970
learned from all of them and that
automatically learns the policy that's

3246
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:35,980
automatically learns the policy that's
 

3247
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,410
automatically learns the policy that's
like the majority but we'll eventually

3248
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:37,420
like the majority but we'll eventually
 

3249
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,150
like the majority but we'll eventually
probably afterthought so if that theory

3250
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:39,160
probably afterthought so if that theory
 

3251
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:42,150
probably afterthought so if that theory
is true I hope it's true because the the

3252
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160
is true I hope it's true because the the
 

3253
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:48,740
is true I hope it's true because the the
counter theory is there is many clusters

3254
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:48,750

 

3255
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,980

maybe

3256
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:50,990
maybe
 

3257
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,890
maybe
but rarely many clusters of good drivers

3258
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:52,900
but rarely many clusters of good drivers
 

3259
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,210
but rarely many clusters of good drivers
because if there's one cluster of good

3260
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:55,220
because if there's one cluster of good
 

3261
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,010
because if there's one cluster of good
drivers you can at least discover a set

3262
01:04:57,010 --> 01:04:57,020
drivers you can at least discover a set
 

3263
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:58,359
drivers you can at least discover a set
of policies you can learn a set of

3264
01:04:58,359 --> 01:04:58,369
of policies you can learn a set of
 

3265
01:04:58,369 --> 01:05:00,220
of policies you can learn a set of
policies which would be good universally

3266
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:00,230
policies which would be good universally
 

3267
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:03,580
policies which would be good universally
yeah that would be a nice that would be

3268
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:03,590
yeah that would be a nice that would be
 

3269
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:05,200
yeah that would be a nice that would be
nice if it's true and you're saying that

3270
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:05,210
nice if it's true and you're saying that
 

3271
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:07,060
nice if it's true and you're saying that
there are some evidence that let's say

3272
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:07,070
there are some evidence that let's say
 

3273
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:09,100
there are some evidence that let's say
lane changes can be clustered into four

3274
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,110
lane changes can be clustered into four
 

3275
01:05:09,110 --> 01:05:11,440
lane changes can be clustered into four
clusters right right there's this finite

3276
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:11,450
clusters right right there's this finite
 

3277
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,660
clusters right right there's this finite
level of I would argue that all four of

3278
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:13,670
level of I would argue that all four of
 

3279
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:15,790
level of I would argue that all four of
those are good clusters all the things

3280
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:15,800
those are good clusters all the things
 

3281
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,710
those are good clusters all the things
that are random are noise and probably

3282
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:17,720
that are random are noise and probably
 

3283
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,140
that are random are noise and probably
bad and which one of the four you pick

3284
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,150
bad and which one of the four you pick
 

3285
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:21,910
bad and which one of the four you pick
or maybe it's Tanner maybe it's twenty

3286
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:21,920
or maybe it's Tanner maybe it's twenty
 

3287
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,260
or maybe it's Tanner maybe it's twenty
you can learn them it's context

3288
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:23,270
you can learn them it's context
 

3289
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:26,650
you can learn them it's context
dependent it depends on the scene and

3290
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:26,660
dependent it depends on the scene and
 

3291
01:05:26,660 --> 01:05:29,560
dependent it depends on the scene and
the hope is it's not too dependent on

3292
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:29,570
the hope is it's not too dependent on
 

3293
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:30,840
the hope is it's not too dependent on
the driver

3294
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:30,850
the driver
 

3295
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:33,970
the driver
yeah the hope is that it all washes out

3296
01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:33,980
yeah the hope is that it all washes out
 

3297
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,620
yeah the hope is that it all washes out
the hope is that there's that the

3298
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:35,630
the hope is that there's that the
 

3299
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:37,300
the hope is that there's that the
distribution is not bimodal the hope is

3300
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,310
distribution is not bimodal the hope is
 

3301
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,640
distribution is not bimodal the hope is
that it's a nice gas man so what advice

3302
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:39,650
that it's a nice gas man so what advice
 

3303
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,580
that it's a nice gas man so what advice
would you give to Tessa how to fix how

3304
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:42,590
would you give to Tessa how to fix how
 

3305
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:45,130
would you give to Tessa how to fix how
to improve navigate an autopilot the

3306
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:45,140
to improve navigate an autopilot the
 

3307
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:47,340
to improve navigate an autopilot the
lessons you've learned from Kamiya

3308
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:47,350
lessons you've learned from Kamiya
 

3309
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:49,900
lessons you've learned from Kamiya
the only real advice I would give to

3310
01:05:49,900 --> 01:05:49,910
the only real advice I would give to
 

3311
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:52,300
the only real advice I would give to
Tesla is please put driver monitoring in

3312
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:52,310
Tesla is please put driver monitoring in
 

3313
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:55,090
Tesla is please put driver monitoring in
your cars with respect to improvement

3314
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:55,100
your cars with respect to improvement
 

3315
01:05:55,100 --> 01:05:56,410
your cars with respect to improvement
you can't do that anymore I said to

3316
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:56,420
you can't do that anymore I said to
 

3317
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:58,480
you can't do that anymore I said to
interrupt but you know there's a

3318
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:58,490
interrupt but you know there's a
 

3319
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,330
interrupt but you know there's a
practical nature of many of hundreds of

3320
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:01,340
practical nature of many of hundreds of
 

3321
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:02,980
practical nature of many of hundreds of
thousands of cars being produced that

3322
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:02,990
thousands of cars being produced that
 

3323
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,740
thousands of cars being produced that
don't have a good driver facing camera

3324
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:05,750
don't have a good driver facing camera
 

3325
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:07,870
don't have a good driver facing camera
the model 3 has a selfie cam is it not

3326
01:06:07,870 --> 01:06:07,880
the model 3 has a selfie cam is it not
 

3327
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,550
the model 3 has a selfie cam is it not
good enough did they not have put IR

3328
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:09,560
good enough did they not have put IR
 

3329
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,560
good enough did they not have put IR
LEDs for night that's a good question

3330
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:11,570
LEDs for night that's a good question
 

3331
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:13,660
LEDs for night that's a good question
but I do know that the is fisheye in its

3332
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:13,670
but I do know that the is fisheye in its
 

3333
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,120
but I do know that the is fisheye in its
relatively low resolution so it's really

3334
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:16,130
relatively low resolution so it's really
 

3335
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:17,410
relatively low resolution so it's really
not this I he wasn't

3336
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:17,420
not this I he wasn't
 

3337
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:19,090
not this I he wasn't
it wasn't designed for Arman you can

3338
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:19,100
it wasn't designed for Arman you can
 

3339
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,910
it wasn't designed for Arman you can
hope that you can kind of scrape up and

3340
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:21,920
hope that you can kind of scrape up and
 

3341
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,590
hope that you can kind of scrape up and
and and have something from it yeah but

3342
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:25,600
and and have something from it yeah but
 

3343
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:28,870
and and have something from it yeah but
put it in today put it in today today

3344
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:28,880
put it in today put it in today today
 

3345
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,880
put it in today put it in today today
every time I've heard Carpathia talk

3346
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:30,890
every time I've heard Carpathia talk
 

3347
01:06:30,890 --> 01:06:32,230
every time I've heard Carpathia talk
about the problem and talking about life

3348
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,240
about the problem and talking about life

learning is gobbling up everything I

3352
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:35,240
learning is gobbling up everything I
 

3353
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,730
learning is gobbling up everything I
think this is absolutely the right

3354
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:36,740
think this is absolutely the right
 

3355
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:38,740
think this is absolutely the right
strategy I think that he didn't write

navigate on autopilot I think somebody

3358
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:40,670
navigate on autopilot I think somebody
 

3359
01:06:40,670 --> 01:06:42,849
navigate on autopilot I think somebody
else did and kind of hacked it on top of

that stuff I think what Carpathia says
 

3363
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:46,690
that stuff I think what Carpathia says
wait a second why did we hand code this

3364
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:46,700
wait a second why did we hand code this
 

3365
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:48,040
wait a second why did we hand code this

job is to turn everything into a

3374
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:54,619
job is to turn everything into a
 

3375
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:56,500
job is to turn everything into a
learning problem and collect a huge

3376
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:56,510
learning problem and collect a huge
 

3377
01:06:56,510 --> 01:06:59,050
learning problem and collect a huge
amount of data the the reality is though

3378
01:06:59,050 --> 01:06:59,060
amount of data the the reality is though
 

3379
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,840
amount of data the the reality is though
not every problem could be turned into a

3380
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:01,850
not every problem could be turned into a
 

3381
01:07:01,850 --> 01:07:03,700
not every problem could be turned into a
learning problem in the short term in

3382
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:03,710
learning problem in the short term in
 

3383
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:05,029
learning problem in the short term in
the end

3384
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
the end
 

3385
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,769
the end
everything would be a learning problem

3386
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:06,779
everything would be a learning problem
 

3387
01:07:06,779 --> 01:07:10,939
everything would be a learning problem
the reality is like if you want to build

3388
01:07:10,939 --> 01:07:10,949
the reality is like if you want to build
 

3389
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:13,459
the reality is like if you want to build
alpha vehicles today it will likely

3390
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:13,469
alpha vehicles today it will likely
 

3391
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:16,249
alpha vehicles today it will likely
involve no learning and that's that's

3392
01:07:16,249 --> 01:07:16,259
involve no learning and that's that's
 

3393
01:07:16,259 --> 01:07:18,380
involve no learning and that's that's
the the reality is so at which point

3394
01:07:18,380 --> 01:07:18,390

01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:40,370
open pilot has gotten so much better in
the last two years we're gonna have a

3548
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:40,380
the last two years we're gonna have a
 

3549
01:10:40,380 --> 01:10:41,990
the last two years we're gonna have a
few a few features we're gonna have a

3550
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
few a few features we're gonna have a
 

3551
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,880
few a few features we're gonna have a
hundred percent driver monitoring we're

3552
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:43,890
hundred percent driver monitoring we're
 

3553
01:10:43,890 --> 01:10:45,500
hundred percent driver monitoring we're
gonna disable no safety features in the

3554
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:45,510
gonna disable no safety features in the
 

3555
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:47,870
gonna disable no safety features in the
car um actually I think it'd be really

3556
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:47,880
car um actually I think it'd be really
 

3557
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,580
car um actually I think it'd be really
cool we're doing right now our project

3558
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:49,590
cool we're doing right now our project
 

3559
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,290
cool we're doing right now our project
this week is we're analyzing the data

3560
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:51,300
this week is we're analyzing the data
 

3561
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:53,120
this week is we're analyzing the data
set and looking for all the AEP triggers

3562
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:53,130
set and looking for all the AEP triggers
 

3563
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:55,820
set and looking for all the AEP triggers
from the manufacturer systems we have a

3564
01:10:55,820 --> 01:10:55,830
from the manufacturer systems we have a
 

3565
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:57,740
from the manufacturer systems we have a
better data set on that than the

3566
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:57,750
better data set on that than the
 

3567
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:00,260
better data set on that than the
manufacturers how much does how many

3568
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:00,270
manufacturers how much does how many
 

3569
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,480
manufacturers how much does how many

real-world driving to know how many
times they're AUB triggered so let me

3574
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:05,850
times they're AUB triggered so let me
 

3575

3580
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:13,500
lot of automakers and one possible
 

3581
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:16,280
lot of automakers and one possible
source of money for you which I'll be

excited to see you take on is basically
 

3585
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:26,540
excited to see you take on is basically
selling the data so which is something

3586
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:26,550
selling the data so which is something
 

3587
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:30,020
selling the data so which is something
that most people are not selling in a

3588
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:30,030
that most people are not selling in a
 

3589
01:11:30,030 --> 01:11:32,270
that most people are not selling in a
way we're here here at automaker but

3590
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:32,280
way we're here here at automaker but
 

3591
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,010
way we're here here at automaker but
creating we've done this actually at MIT

3592
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:34,020
creating we've done this actually at MIT
 

3593
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,230
creating we've done this actually at MIT
not for money purposes but you could do

3594
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:36,240
not for money purposes but you could do
 

3595
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,850
not for money purposes but you could do
it for significant money purposes and

3596
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:37,860
it for significant money purposes and
 

3597
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,560
it for significant money purposes and
make the world a better place by

3598
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:39,570
make the world a better place by
 

3599
01:11:39,570 --> 01:11:42,740
make the world a better place by
creating a consortium where automakers

3600
01:11:42,740 --> 01:11:42,750
creating a consortium where automakers
 

3601
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:45,290
creating a consortium where automakers
would pay in and then they get to have

3602
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:45,300
would pay in and then they get to have
 

3603
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,900
would pay in and then they get to have
free access to the data and I I think a

3604
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:47,910
free access to the data and I I think a
 

3605
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:51,230
free access to the data and I I think a
lot of people are really hungry for that

3606
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:51,240
lot of people are really hungry for that
 

3607
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,570
lot of people are really hungry for that
and would pay significant amount of

3608
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:53,580
and would pay significant amount of
 

3609
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:54,950
and would pay significant amount of
money for it here's the problem with

3610
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
money for it here's the problem with
 

3611
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,870
money for it here's the problem with
that I like this idea all in theory he'd

3612
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:56,880
that I like this idea all in theory he'd
 

3613
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,700
that I like this idea all in theory he'd
be very easy for me to give them access

3614
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:58,710
be very easy for me to give them access
 

3615
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:00,740
be very easy for me to give them access
to my servers and we already have all

01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:00,750
to my servers and we already have all
 

3617
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:02,180
to my servers and we already have all
open source tools to access this data

3618
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:02,190
open source tools to access this data
 

3619
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:03,860
open source tools to access this data
it's in a great format we have a great

3620
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:03,870
it's in a great format we have a great

they don't man I'm happy to to set that

3714
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:45,870
they don't man I'm happy to to set that
 

3715
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:46,399
they don't man I'm happy to to set that
up that's what

3716
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:46,409
up that's what
 

3717
01:13:46,409 --> 01:13:48,800
up that's what
my engineering time but actually quite

3718
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:48,810
my engineering time but actually quite
 

3719
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:50,149
my engineering time but actually quite
insightful view you're right yeah

3720
01:13:50,149 --> 01:13:50,159
insightful view you're right yeah
 

3721
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:52,430
insightful view you're right yeah
probably because many of the automakers

3722
01:13:52,430 --> 01:13:52,440
probably because many of the automakers
 

3723
01:13:52,440 --> 01:13:54,470
probably because many of the automakers
are quite a bit of old-school yeah there

3724
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:54,480
are quite a bit of old-school yeah there
 

3725
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:57,410
are quite a bit of old-school yeah there
will be need to reach out and they want

3726
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:57,420
will be need to reach out and they want
 

3727
01:13:57,420 --> 01:13:59,240
will be need to reach out and they want
it but they they'll need to be some some

3728
01:13:59,240 --> 01:13:59,250
it but they they'll need to be some some
 

3729
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:00,800
it but they they'll need to be some some
communication you right mobile eye

3730
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:00,810
communication you right mobile eye
 

3731
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:04,580

circuit 2015 had the lowest R&D spend of

3732
01:14:04,580 --> 01:14:04,590
circuit 2015 had the lowest R&D spend of
 

3733
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:09,200
circuit 2015 had the lowest R&D spend of
any chip maker like purpur and you look

3734
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:09,210
any chip maker like purpur and you look
 

3735
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,610
any chip maker like purpur and you look
at all the people who work for them and

3736
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:10,620
at all the people who work for them and
 

3737
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,990
at all the people who work for them and
it's all business development people

3738
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
it's all business development people
 

3739
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,430
it's all business development people
because the car companies are impossible

3740
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
because the car companies are impossible
 

3741
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,970
because the car companies are impossible
to work with yeah so you're you have no

3742
01:14:16,970 --> 01:14:16,980
to work with yeah so you're you have no
 

3743
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,770

patience for that and you're you're

3744
01:14:18,770 --> 01:14:18,780
patience for that and you're you're
 

3745
01:14:18,780 --> 01:14:20,780
patience for that and you're you're
legit Android huh I have something to do

3746
01:14:20,780 --> 01:14:20,790
legit Android huh I have something to do
 

3747
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,340
legit Android huh I have something to do
right like like it's not like it's not

3748
01:14:22,340 --> 01:14:22,350
right like like it's not like it's not

patience for that but it's like that

3754
01:14:26,149 --> 01:14:26,159
patience for that but it's like that
 

3755
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:28,760
patience for that but it's like that
stuff doesn't help us with our goal of

3756
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:28,770
stuff doesn't help us with our goal of
 

3757
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,979
stuff doesn't help us with our goal of
winning self-driving cars if I want

3758
01:14:30,979 --> 01:14:30,989
winning self-driving cars if I want
 

3759
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:34,610
winning self-driving cars if I want
money in the short term if I showed off

3760
01:14:34,610 --> 01:14:34,620
money in the short term if I showed off
 

3761
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:37,100
money in the short term if I showed off
like the actual like the learning tech

3762
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:37,110
like the actual like the learning tech
 

3763
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,770
like the actual like the learning tech
that we have it's it's somewhat sad like

3764
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:39,780
that we have it's it's somewhat sad like
 

3765
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:41,930
that we have it's it's somewhat sad like
it's years and years ahead of everybody

3766
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:41,940
it's years and years ahead of everybody
 

3767
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,939
it's years and years ahead of everybody
else's not so maybe not Tesla's I think

3768
01:14:43,939 --> 01:14:43,949
else's not so maybe not Tesla's I think
 

3769
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:45,080
else's not so maybe not Tesla's I think
Tesla has similar stuff to us actually

3770
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:45,090
Tesla has similar stuff to us actually
 

3771
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,879
Tesla has similar stuff to us actually
yeah I think Tesla's similar stuff but

3772
01:14:46,879 --> 01:14:46,889
yeah I think Tesla's similar stuff but
 

3773
01:14:46,889 --> 01:14:48,200
yeah I think Tesla's similar stuff but
when you compare it to like what the

3774
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:48,210
when you compare it to like what the
 

3775
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:51,200
when you compare it to like what the
Toyota Research Institute has you're not

3776
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:51,210
Toyota Research Institute has you're not
 

3777
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,930
Toyota Research Institute has you're not
even close to what we have no comment

3778
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:53,940
even close to what we have no comment
 

3779
01:14:53,940 --> 01:14:56,780
even close to what we have no comment
but I also can't I have to take your

3780
01:14:56,780 --> 01:14:56,790
but I also can't I have to take your
 

3781
01:14:56,790 --> 01:15:01,399
but I also can't I have to take your
comments I ain't into ative Lee believe

3782
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:01,409
comments I ain't into ative Lee believe
 

3783
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:02,540
comments I ain't into ative Lee believe
you but I have to take it with a grain

3784
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:02,550
you but I have to take it with a grain
 

3785
01:15:02,550 --> 01:15:05,660
you but I have to take it with a grain
of salt because I mean you you are an

3786
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:05,670
of salt because I mean you you are an
 

3787
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:07,580
of salt because I mean you you are an
inspiration because you basically don't

3788
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:07,590
inspiration because you basically don't
 

3789
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:09,320
inspiration because you basically don't
care about a lot of things that other

3790
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:09,330
care about a lot of things that other
 

3791
01:15:09,330 --> 01:15:13,419
care about a lot of things that other
companies care about you don't try to

3792
01:15:13,419 --> 01:15:13,429
companies care about you don't try to
 

3793
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:16,520
companies care about you don't try to
 in a sense like make up stuff

3794
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:16,530
in a sense like make up stuff
 

3795
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:19,040
in a sense like make up stuff
so to drive a valuation you're really

3796
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:19,050
so to drive a valuation you're really
 

3797
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,570
so to drive a valuation you're really
very real and you're trying to solve the

3798
01:15:20,570 --> 01:15:20,580
very real and you're trying to solve the
 

3799
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:22,459
very real and you're trying to solve the
problem and admire that a lot what I

3800
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:22,469
problem and admire that a lot what I
 

3801
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:25,520
problem and admire that a lot what I
don't necessarily fully can't trust you

3802
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:25,530
don't necessarily fully can't trust you
 

3803
01:15:25,530 --> 01:15:27,800
don't necessarily fully can't trust you
on I do respect it's like how good it is

3804
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:27,810
on I do respect it's like how good it is
 

3805
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:28,189
on I do respect it's like how good it is
right

3806
01:15:28,189 --> 01:15:28,199
right
 

3807
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:31,129
right
I can only but I also know how bad

3808
01:15:31,129 --> 01:15:31,139
I can only but I also know how bad
 

3809
01:15:31,139 --> 01:15:34,220
I can only but I also know how bad
others are and so I'll say I'll say two

3810
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:34,230
others are and so I'll say I'll say two
 

3811
01:15:34,230 --> 01:15:35,959
others are and so I'll say I'll say two
things about don't trust but verify

3812
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:35,969
things about don't trust but verify
 

3813
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:38,300
things about don't trust but verify
right I'll say two things about that one

3814
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:38,310
right I'll say two things about that one
 

3815
01:15:38,310 --> 01:15:41,840
right I'll say two things about that one
is try get in a twenty twenty Corolla

3816
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:41,850
is try get in a twenty twenty Corolla
 

3817
01:15:41,850 --> 01:15:44,840
is try get in a twenty twenty Corolla
and try open pal 0.6 when it comes out

3818
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:44,850
and try open pal 0.6 when it comes out
 

3819
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:48,080
and try open pal 0.6 when it comes out
next month I think already you'll look

3820
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:48,090
next month I think already you'll look
 

3821
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:50,120
next month I think already you'll look
at this and you'll be like them this is

3822
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:50,130
at this and you'll be like them this is
 

3823
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,520
at this and you'll be like them this is
already really good and then I could be

3824
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:52,530
already really good and then I could be
 

3825
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:54,379
already really good and then I could be
doing that all with hand labelers and

3826
01:15:54,379 --> 01:15:54,389
doing that all with hand labelers and
 

3827
01:15:54,389 --> 01:15:55,669
doing that all with hand labelers and
all with with like like the same

3828
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
all with with like like the same
 

3829
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,280
all with with like like the same
approach that like Mobileye uses when we

3830
01:15:58,280 --> 01:15:58,290
approach that like Mobileye uses when we
 

3831
01:15:58,290 --> 01:15:59,899
approach that like Mobileye uses when we
release a model that no law

3832
01:15:59,899 --> 01:15:59,909
release a model that no law
 

3833
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:02,750
release a model that no law
has the lanes in it that only outputs a

3834
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:02,760
has the lanes in it that only outputs a
 

3835
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,179
has the lanes in it that only outputs a
path mm-hmm

3836
01:16:04,179 --> 01:16:04,189
path mm-hmm
 

3837
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:07,729
path mm-hmm
then think about how we did that machine

3838
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:07,739
then think about how we did that machine
 

3839
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:09,830
then think about how we did that machine
learning and then right away when you

3840
01:16:09,830 --> 01:16:09,840
learning and then right away when you
 

3841
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:11,209
learning and then right away when you
see and that's gonna be an open pilot

3842
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:11,219
see and that's gonna be an open pilot
 

3843
01:16:11,219 --> 01:16:12,979
see and that's gonna be an open pilot
that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0

3844
01:16:12,979 --> 01:16:12,989
that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0
 

3845
01:16:12,989 --> 01:16:14,390
that's gonna be an open pilot before 1.0
when you see that model you'll know that

3846
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:14,400
when you see that model you'll know that
 

3847
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:15,500

do you think about that how important is

4018
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:33,180
do you think about that how important is

provocative statement that lidar is a
 

4025
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:42,650

crutch see sometimes we'll say dumb

4026
01:19:42,650 --> 01:19:42,660

things like the driver monitoring thing
 

4029
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:45,530

4033
01:19:47,790 --> 01:19:50,840
completely 100% obviously true things
yeah of course lidar is a crutch it's

4034
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:50,850
yeah of course lidar is a crutch it's
 

4035
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:53,360
yeah of course lidar is a crutch it's
not even a good crutch you're not even

01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:53,370
not even a good crutch you're not even
 

4037
01:19:53,370 --> 01:19:54,740
not even a good crutch you're not even
using it they're using it for

4038
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:54,750
using it they're using it for
 

4039
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:57,590
using it they're using it for
localization yeah which isn't good in

4040
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
localization yeah which isn't good in
 

4041
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:59,060
localization yeah which isn't good in
the first place if you have to localize

4042
01:19:59,060 --> 01:19:59,070
the first place if you have to localize

your car to centimetres in order to
 

4045
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:04,250
your car to centimetres in order to
drive like yeah they're not drive it

4046
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:04,260
drive like yeah they're not drive it
 

4047
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,930

01:20:15,150 --> 01:20:17,390

I think is actually localization more

4058
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:17,400
I think is actually localization more
 

4059
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,340
I think is actually localization more
than perception or at least that's what

4060
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:19,350
than perception or at least that's what
 

4061
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:20,930
than perception or at least that's what
they use them for yeah that's true if

4062
01:20:20,930 --> 01:20:20,940
they use them for yeah that's true if
 

4063
01:20:20,940 --> 01:20:22,550
they use them for yeah that's true if
you want to localize two centimeters you

4064
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
you want to localize two centimeters you
 

4065
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,440
you want to localize two centimeters you
can't use GPS the fanciest GPS in the

01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:32,100
some research they're doing they're
 

4077
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:34,070
some research they're doing they're
using it for perception but and they're

4078
01:20:34,070 --> 01:20:34,080
using it for perception but and they're
 

4079
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:36,080
using it for perception but and they're
certainly not which sad they're not

4080
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:36,090
certainly not which sad they're not
 

4081
01:20:36,090 --> 01:20:39,590
certainly not which sad they're not
fusing it well lay vision they do use it

4082
01:20:39,590 --> 01:20:39,600
fusing it well lay vision they do use it
 

4083
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,210
fusing it well lay vision they do use it
for perception I'm not saying they don't

4084
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:41,220
for perception I'm not saying they don't
 

4085
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,210
for perception I'm not saying they don't
use it for perception but the thing that

4086
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:43,220
use it for perception but the thing that
 

4087
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:45,920
use it for perception but the thing that
they have vision based and radar based

4088
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:45,930
they have vision based and radar based
 

4089
01:20:45,930 --> 01:20:47,960
they have vision based and radar based
perception systems as well you could

4090
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:47,970
perception systems as well you could
 

4091
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:50,900
perception systems as well you could
remove the lidar and and and keep around

4092
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:50,910
remove the lidar and and and keep around
 

4093
01:20:50,910 --> 01:20:53,780
remove the lidar and and and keep around
a lot of the dynamic object perception

4094
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:53,790
a lot of the dynamic object perception
 

4095
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:55,250
a lot of the dynamic object perception
you want to get centimeter accurate

4096
01:20:55,250 --> 01:20:55,260
you want to get centimeter accurate
 

4097
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:57,140
you want to get centimeter accurate
localization good luck doing that with

4098
01:20:57,140 --> 01:20:57,150
localization good luck doing that with
 

4099
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:01,280
localization good luck doing that with
anything else so what should Cruz lame-o

4100
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:01,290
anything else so what should Cruz lame-o
 

4101
01:21:01,290 --> 01:21:04,610
anything else so what should Cruz lame-o
do like what would you be your advice to

4102
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:04,620
do like what would you be your advice to
 

4103
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:09,110
do like what would you be your advice to
them now anyway Mo's actually there's I

4104
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
them now anyway Mo's actually there's I
 

4105
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:11,750
them now anyway Mo's actually there's I
mean they're doing they're serious way

4106
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
mean they're doing they're serious way
 

4107
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,350
mean they're doing they're serious way
mo out of all of them equate so serious

4108
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
mo out of all of them equate so serious
 

4109
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:17,390
mo out of all of them equate so serious
about the long game if everybody fell

4110
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:17,400
about the long game if everybody fell
 

4111
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,750
about the long game if everybody fell
five is a lot is requires fifty years I

4112
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:20,760
five is a lot is requires fifty years I
 

4113
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:22,640
five is a lot is requires fifty years I
think when will be the only one left

4114
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:22,650

Google box um I'll say nice things about

4120
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:29,550
Google box um I'll say nice things about
 

4121
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:33,980
Google box um I'll say nice things about
both lame-o and Cruz let's do it nice is

4122
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:33,990
both lame-o and Cruz let's do it nice is
 

4123
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:37,760
both lame-o and Cruz let's do it nice is
good way mo is by far the furthest along

4124
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:37,770
good way mo is by far the furthest along
 

4125
01:21:37,770 --> 01:21:40,370
good way mo is by far the furthest along
with technology way mo has a three to

4126
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:40,380
with technology way mo has a three to
 

4127
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:43,640
with technology way mo has a three to
five year lead on all the competitors um

4128
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:43,650
five year lead on all the competitors um
 

4129
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:47,000
five year lead on all the competitors um
if that if the way mo looking stack

4130
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:47,010
if that if the way mo looking stack
 

4131
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:49,790
if that if the way mo looking stack
works mm-hmm maybe three year lead if

4132
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:49,800
works mm-hmm maybe three year lead if
 

4133
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:51,440
works mm-hmm maybe three year lead if
the way mo looking stack works they have

4134
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:51,450
the way mo looking stack works they have
 

4135
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,200
the way mo looking stack works they have
a three year lead now I argue that way

4136
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:54,210
a three year lead now I argue that way
 

4137
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:55,670
a three year lead now I argue that way

cars you have capital and you have
riders there's no network effect if I

4154
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:11,700
riders there's no network effect if I
 

4155
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:13,130
riders there's no network effect if I
want to blanket a new city in

want to blanket a new city in
 

4157
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:14,180
want to blanket a new city in
self-driving cars i buy the

4158
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:14,190
self-driving cars i buy the
 

4159
01:22:14,190 --> 01:22:15,260
self-driving cars i buy the
off-the-shelf Chinese knockoff

4160

off-the-shelf Chinese knockoff
 

4161
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:16,610
off-the-shelf Chinese knockoff
self-driving cars and I buy enough up

4162
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:16,620
self-driving cars and I buy enough up
 

4163
01:22:16,620 --> 01:22:17,840
self-driving cars and I buy enough up
from the city I can't do that with

4164
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:17,850
from the city I can't do that with
 

4165
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,030
from the city I can't do that with
drivers and that's why Ober has a first

4166
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:20,040
drivers and that's why Ober has a first
 

4167
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:21,740
drivers and that's why Ober has a first
mover advantage that no self-driving car

4168
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:21,750
mover advantage that no self-driving car
 

4169
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:25,790
mover advantage that no self-driving car
company will can you uh disentangle that

a little bit uber you're not talking
about uber the autonomous vehicle number

4174
01:22:29,150 --> 01:22:29,160
about uber the autonomous vehicle number
 

4175
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:31,220

sufficiently happy right riders aren't

4190
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:45,930
sufficiently happy right riders aren't
 

4191
01:22:45,930 --> 01:22:47,210
sufficiently happy right riders aren't
going to use it if it takes more than

4192
01:22:47,210 --> 01:22:47,220
going to use it if it takes more than
 

4193
01:22:47,220 --> 01:22:48,620
going to use it if it takes more than
five minutes for an uber to show up

great first mover advantage because

4206
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
great first mover advantage because
 

4207
01:22:58,560 --> 01:22:59,780
great first mover advantage because
there's a switching cost for everybody

there's a switching cost for everybody
right the drivers and the riders would

right the drivers and the riders would
 

4211
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:04,400
right the drivers and the riders would
have to switch at the same time let's

4212
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:04,410
have to switch at the same time let's
 

4213

only takes five percent of a cot instead

4224

only takes five percent of a cot instead
 

4225
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,830
only takes five percent of a cot instead
of the ten percent that Hooper takes no

4226

of the ten percent that Hooper takes no
 

4227
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:23,150
of the ten percent that Hooper takes no
one is gonna switch because the

4228
01:23:23,150 --> 01:23:23,160
one is gonna switch because the
 

4229
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:24,470
one is gonna switch because the
switching cost is higher than that five

4230
01:23:24,470 --> 01:23:24,480
switching cost is higher than that five
 

4231
01:23:24,480 --> 01:23:26,660
switching cost is higher than that five
percent so you actually can in markets

4232
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:26,670
percent so you actually can in markets
 

4233
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,010
percent so you actually can in markets
like that you have a first mover

4234
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:28,020
like that you have a first mover
 

4235
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,340
like that you have a first mover
advantage yeah autonomous vehicles of

a new city look at the scooters it's

4244
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:39,690
a new city look at the scooters it's
 

4245
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,930
a new city look at the scooters it's
gonna look a lot more like scooters

blanket a city in scooters and that's
 

4251
01:23:46,020 --> 01:23:47,000
blanket a city in scooters and that's
why you have 10 different scooter

4252
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:47,010
why you have 10 different scooter
 

4253
01:23:47,010 --> 01:23:48,590
why you have 10 different scooter
companies yeah which one's gonna win

01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:00,870
right so the yeah we're gonna entice the
 

4267

that's it doesn't it doesn't come back
 

4273
01:24:07,230 --> 01:24:09,890
that's it doesn't it doesn't come back
yeah that they can't be your main

4274

criticism over the way mo approach oh

4276
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:11,820
criticism over the way mo approach oh
 

4277
01:24:11,820 --> 01:24:13,940
criticism over the way mo approach oh
I'm saying even if it does technically

4278
01:24:13,940 --> 01:24:13,950
I'm saying even if it does technically
 

4279
01:24:13,950 --> 01:24:16,340
I'm saying even if it does technically
work even if it does technically work

4280
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:16,350
work even if it does technically work
 

4281
01:24:16,350 --> 01:24:19,550
work even if it does technically work
that's a problem yeah I don't know I if

4282
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:19,560
that's a problem yeah I don't know I if
 

4283
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,090
that's a problem yeah I don't know I if
I were to say I I would I would say

4284
01:24:22,090 --> 01:24:22,100
I were to say I I would I would say
 

4285
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:23,960
I were to say I I would I would say
you're already there I haven't even

4286
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:23,970
you're already there I haven't even
 

4287
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:25,970
you're already there I haven't even
thought about that but I would say the

4288
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:25,980
thought about that but I would say the
 

4289
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:27,260
thought about that but I would say the
bigger challenge is the technical

4290
01:24:27,260 --> 01:24:27,270
bigger challenge is the technical
 

4291
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:32,150
bigger challenge is the technical
approach so way most cruises and not

4292
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:32,160
approach so way most cruises and not
 

4293
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:33,380
approach so way most cruises and not
just the technical approach but of

4294
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:33,390
just the technical approach but of
 

4295
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:36,050
just the technical approach but of
creating value I still don't understand

4296
01:24:36,050 --> 01:24:36,060
creating value I still don't understand
 

4297
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:42,320
creating value I still don't understand
how you beat uber the the human driven

01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:42,330
how you beat uber the the human driven
 

4299
01:24:42,330 --> 01:24:45,530
how you beat uber the the human driven
cars in terms of financially it doesn't

4300

it doesn't make sense to me that people
 

4303
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,730
it doesn't make sense to me that people
want to want to get an autonomous

01:24:49,730 --> 01:24:49,740
want to want to get an autonomous
 

4305
01:24:49,740 --> 01:24:51,710
want to want to get an autonomous
vehicle I don't understand how you make

4306
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:51,720
vehicle I don't understand how you make
 

4307
01:24:51,720 --> 01:24:54,020
vehicle I don't understand how you make
money in the long term

4308
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:54,030
money in the long term
 

4309
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,500
money in the long term
like real long-term but it just feels

4310
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:57,510
like real long-term but it just feels
 

4311
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,450
like real long-term but it just feels
like there's too much capital investment

4312
01:24:59,450 --> 01:24:59,460
like there's too much capital investment
 

4313
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:00,770
like there's too much capital investment
needed oh and they're gonna be worse

4314
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:00,780
needed oh and they're gonna be worse
 

4315
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:01,910
needed oh and they're gonna be worse
than ubers because they're gonna they're

4316
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
than ubers because they're gonna they're
 

4317
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,710
than ubers because they're gonna they're
gonna stop for every little you know

4318
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:03,720
gonna stop for every little you know
 

4319
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,770
gonna stop for every little you know
thing everywhere um actually a nice

4320
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:06,780
thing everywhere um actually a nice
 

4321
01:25:06,780 --> 01:25:07,970
thing everywhere um actually a nice
thing about Cruz that was my nice thing

4322
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:07,980
thing about Cruz that was my nice thing
 

4323
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,050
thing about Cruz that was my nice thing
about wait another three years that it

4324
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:09,060
about wait another three years that it
 

4325
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:10,940
about wait another three years that it
wasn't nice oh that's three years

4326
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:10,950
wasn't nice oh that's three years
 

4327
01:25:10,950 --> 01:25:12,620
wasn't nice oh that's three years
technically ahead of everybody their

4328
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:12,630
technically ahead of everybody their
 

4329
01:25:12,630 --> 01:25:15,260
technically ahead of everybody their
tech stack is is great my nice thing

4330
01:25:15,260 --> 01:25:15,270
tech stack is is great my nice thing
 

4331
01:25:15,270 --> 01:25:18,380
tech stack is is great my nice thing
about Cruz is GM buying them was a great

4332
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:18,390
about Cruz is GM buying them was a great
 

4333
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:22,670
about Cruz is GM buying them was a great
move for GM for 1 billion dollars GM

4334
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:22,680
move for GM for 1 billion dollars GM
 

4335
01:25:22,680 --> 01:25:25,220
move for GM for 1 billion dollars GM
bought an insurance policy against way

4336
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:25,230
bought an insurance policy against way
 

4337
01:25:25,230 --> 01:25:29,330
bought an insurance policy against way
mo they put Cruz is three years behind

4338
01:25:29,330 --> 01:25:29,340
mo they put Cruz is three years behind
 

4339
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:32,120
mo they put Cruz is three years behind
way mo hmm that means Google will get a

4340
01:25:32,120 --> 01:25:32,130
way mo hmm that means Google will get a
 

4341
01:25:32,130 --> 01:25:33,980
way mo hmm that means Google will get a
monopoly on the technology for at most

4342
01:25:33,980 --> 01:25:33,990
monopoly on the technology for at most
 

4343
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:38,170
monopoly on the technology for at most
three years and technology works

4344
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:38,180
three years and technology works
 

4345
01:25:38,180 --> 01:25:40,370
three years and technology works
you might not even be right about the

4346
01:25:40,370 --> 01:25:40,380
you might not even be right about the
 

4347
01:25:40,380 --> 01:25:42,080
you might not even be right about the
three years it might be less might be

4348
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,090
three years it might be less might be
 

4349
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,460
three years it might be less might be
less crews actually might not be that

4350
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:43,470
less crews actually might not be that
 

4351
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:45,500
less crews actually might not be that
far behind I don't know how much way mo

4352
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:45,510
far behind I don't know how much way mo
 

4353
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:47,840
far behind I don't know how much way mo
has waffled around or how much of it

4354
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:47,850
has waffled around or how much of it
 

4355
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:49,910
has waffled around or how much of it
actually is just that long tail yeah

4356
01:25:49,910 --> 01:25:49,920
actually is just that long tail yeah
 

4357
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:51,710
actually is just that long tail yeah
okay if that's the best you could say

4358
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:51,720
okay if that's the best you could say
 

4359
01:25:51,720 --> 01:25:53,990
okay if that's the best you could say
there's some nice things it that's more

4360
01:25:53,990 --> 01:25:54,000
there's some nice things it that's more
 

4361
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,880
there's some nice things it that's more
of a nice thing for GM that that's a

4362
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:55,890
of a nice thing for GM that that's a
 

4363
01:25:55,890 --> 01:25:58,970
of a nice thing for GM that that's a
smart insurance policy it's just more

4364
01:25:58,970 --> 01:25:58,980
smart insurance policy it's just more
 

4365
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:00,320
smart insurance policy it's just more
insurance policy I mean I think that's

4366
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:00,330
insurance policy I mean I think that's
 

4367
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:04,250
insurance policy I mean I think that's
how I I can't see crews working out any

4368
01:26:04,250 --> 01:26:04,260
how I I can't see crews working out any
 

4369
01:26:04,260 --> 01:26:06,920
how I I can't see crews working out any
other for crews to leapfrog way mo would

4370
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:06,930
other for crews to leapfrog way mo would
 

4371
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:11,270
other for crews to leapfrog way mo would
really surprise me yeah so let's talk

4372
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
really surprise me yeah so let's talk
 

4373
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,070
really surprise me yeah so let's talk
about like the underlying assumptions of

4374
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:13,080
about like the underlying assumptions of
 

4375
01:26:13,080 --> 01:26:14,300
about like the underlying assumptions of
everything is we're not going to

4376
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:14,310
everything is we're not going to
 

4377
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:18,170
everything is we're not going to
leapfrog Tesla Tesla would have to

4378
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:18,180
leapfrog Tesla Tesla would have to
 

4379
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:20,000
leapfrog Tesla Tesla would have to
seriously mess up for us because you're

4380
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:20,010
seriously mess up for us because you're
 

4381
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,710
seriously mess up for us because you're
okay so the way you leapfrog right is

4382
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:23,720
okay so the way you leapfrog right is
 

4383
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,690
okay so the way you leapfrog right is
you come up with an idea or you take a

4384
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:26,700
you come up with an idea or you take a
 

4385
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:29,090
you come up with an idea or you take a
direction perhaps secretly that the

4386
01:26:29,090 --> 01:26:29,100
direction perhaps secretly that the
 

4387
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:33,020
direction perhaps secretly that the
other people aren't taking and so cruise

4388
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:33,030
other people aren't taking and so cruise
 

4389
01:26:33,030 --> 01:26:38,960
other people aren't taking and so cruise
way mo even Aurora no Aurora tzuke's is

4390
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:38,970
way mo even Aurora no Aurora tzuke's is
 

4391
01:26:38,970 --> 01:26:40,520
way mo even Aurora no Aurora tzuke's is
the same stack as well they're all the

4392
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:40,530
the same stack as well they're all the
 

4393
01:26:40,530 --> 01:26:42,260
the same stack as well they're all the
same codebase even and they're all the

4394
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:42,270
same codebase even and they're all the
 

4395
01:26:42,270 --> 01:26:45,140
same codebase even and they're all the
same DARPA urban challenge codebase

4396
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:45,150
same DARPA urban challenge codebase
 

4397
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:47,330
same DARPA urban challenge codebase
so the question is do you think there's

4398
01:26:47,330 --> 01:26:47,340
so the question is do you think there's
 

4399
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:48,590
so the question is do you think there's
a room for brilliance and innovation

4400
01:26:48,590 --> 01:26:48,600
a room for brilliance and innovation
 

4401
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,740
a room for brilliance and innovation
there that will change everything like

4402
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:51,750
there that will change everything like
 

4403
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:55,070
there that will change everything like
say okay so I'll give you examples it

4404
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:55,080
say okay so I'll give you examples it
 

4405
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:58,520
say okay so I'll give you examples it
could be if revolution and mapping for

4406
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:58,530
could be if revolution and mapping for
 

4407
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:03,230
could be if revolution and mapping for
example that allow you to map things do

4408
01:27:03,230 --> 01:27:03,240
example that allow you to map things do
 

4409
01:27:03,240 --> 01:27:06,320
example that allow you to map things do
HD maps of the whole world all weather

4410
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:06,330
HD maps of the whole world all weather
 

4411
01:27:06,330 --> 01:27:07,270
HD maps of the whole world all weather
conditions

4412
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280

really well or revolutionist simulation

4414
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:14,050
really well or revolutionist simulation
 

4415
01:27:14,050 --> 01:27:17,260
really well or revolutionist simulation
to where the the what you said before

4416
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:17,270
to where the the what you said before
 

4417
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:21,250
to where the the what you said before
becomes incorrect that kind of thing I

4418
01:27:21,250 --> 01:27:21,260
becomes incorrect that kind of thing I
 

4419
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:24,150
becomes incorrect that kind of thing I
knew room for breakthrough innovation um

4420
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:24,160
knew room for breakthrough innovation um
 

4421
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,200
knew room for breakthrough innovation um
what I said before about oh they

4422
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:26,210
what I said before about oh they
 

4423
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,510
what I said before about oh they
actually get the whole thing well I'll

4424
01:27:28,510 --> 01:27:28,520
actually get the whole thing well I'll
 

4425
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,960
actually get the whole thing well I'll
say this about we divide driving into

4426
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:31,970
say this about we divide driving into
 

4427
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:33,070
say this about we divide driving into
three problems and I actually haven't

4428
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:33,080
three problems and I actually haven't
 

4429
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,240
three problems and I actually haven't
solved the third yet but I have an idea

4430
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:34,250
solved the third yet but I have an idea
 

4431
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,860
solved the third yet but I have an idea
how to do it so there's the static the

4432
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:35,870
how to do it so there's the static the
 

4433
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,140
how to do it so there's the static the
static driving problem is assuming you

4434
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:38,150
static driving problem is assuming you
 

4435
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,000
static driving problem is assuming you
are the only car on the road right right

4436
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:40,010
are the only car on the road right right
 

4437
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:42,100
are the only car on the road right right
and this problem can be solved 100% with

4438
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:42,110
and this problem can be solved 100% with
 

4439
01:27:42,110 --> 01:27:44,350
and this problem can be solved 100% with
mapping and localization this is why

4440
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:44,360
mapping and localization this is why
 

4441
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:46,420
mapping and localization this is why
farms work the way they do if all you

4442
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:46,430
farms work the way they do if all you
 

4443
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,100
farms work the way they do if all you
have to deal with is the static problem

4444
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:48,110
have to deal with is the static problem
 

4445
01:27:48,110 --> 01:27:49,660
have to deal with is the static problem
and you can statically schedule your

4446
01:27:49,660 --> 01:27:49,670
and you can statically schedule your
 

4447
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:50,710
and you can statically schedule your
machines right it's the same as like

4448
01:27:50,710 --> 01:27:50,720
machines right it's the same as like
 

4449
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,780
machines right it's the same as like
statically scheduling processes you can

4450
01:27:52,780 --> 01:27:52,790
statically scheduling processes you can
 

4451
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:54,100
statically scheduling processes you can
statically schedule your tractors to

4452
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:54,110
statically schedule your tractors to
 

4453
01:27:54,110 --> 01:27:55,990
statically schedule your tractors to
never hit each other on their paths all

4454
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:56,000
never hit each other on their paths all
 

4455
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:56,800
never hit each other on their paths all
right because then you know the speed

4456
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:56,810
right because then you know the speed
 

4457
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:59,170
right because then you know the speed
they go at so so that's the static

4458
01:27:59,170 --> 01:27:59,180
they go at so so that's the static
 

4459
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,990
they go at so so that's the static
driving problem Maps only helps you with

01:28:01,990 --> 01:28:02,000
driving problem Maps only helps you with
 

4461
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,780
driving problem Maps only helps you with
the static driving problem yeah the

4462
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:04,790
the static driving problem yeah the
 

4463
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:07,060
the static driving problem yeah the
question about static driving yeah you

4464
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:07,070
question about static driving yeah you
 

4465
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,320
question about static driving yeah you
just made it sound like it's really easy

4466
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:08,330
just made it sound like it's really easy
 

4467
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:13,770
just made it sound like it's really easy
that was really easy how easy how well

4468
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:13,780
that was really easy how easy how well
 

4469
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:16,210
that was really easy how easy how well
because the whole drifting out of lane

4470
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:16,220
because the whole drifting out of lane
 

4471
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:18,520
because the whole drifting out of lane
when when Tesla drifts out of lane is

4472
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:18,530
when when Tesla drifts out of lane is
 

4473
01:28:18,530 --> 01:28:20,980
when when Tesla drifts out of lane is
failing on the fundamental static

4474
01:28:20,980 --> 01:28:20,990
failing on the fundamental static
 

4475
01:28:20,990 --> 01:28:23,410
failing on the fundamental static
driving problem Tesla is drifting out of

4476
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:23,420
driving problem Tesla is drifting out of
 

4477
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,170
driving problem Tesla is drifting out of
lane the static driving problem is not

4478
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:26,180
lane the static driving problem is not
 

4479
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:28,570
lane the static driving problem is not
easy for the world the static driving

4480
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:28,580
easy for the world the static driving
 

4481
01:28:28,580 --> 01:28:32,170
easy for the world the static driving
problem is easy for one route and one

4482
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:32,180
problem is easy for one route and one
 

4483
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:35,370
problem is easy for one route and one
route in one weather condition with one

4484
01:28:35,370 --> 01:28:35,380
route in one weather condition with one
 

4485
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,980
route in one weather condition with one
state of lane markings and like no

4486
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:38,990
state of lane markings and like no
 

4487
01:28:38,990 --> 01:28:41,020
state of lane markings and like no
deterioration no cracks in the road I'm

4488
01:28:41,020 --> 01:28:41,030
deterioration no cracks in the road I'm
 

4489
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:42,760
deterioration no cracks in the road I'm
assuming you have a perfect localizer so

4490
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:42,770
assuming you have a perfect localizer so
 

4491
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,380
assuming you have a perfect localizer so
that's all for the weather condition and

4492
01:28:44,380 --> 01:28:44,390
that's all for the weather condition and
 

4493
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:45,940
that's all for the weather condition and
me the lane marking condition that's the

4494
01:28:45,940 --> 01:28:45,950
me the lane marking condition that's the
 

4495
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:47,410
me the lane marking condition that's the
problem is how could you how do you have

4496
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:47,420
problem is how could you how do you have
 

4497
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:48,580
problem is how could you how do you have
a perfect you can build perfect

4498
01:28:48,580 --> 01:28:48,590
a perfect you can build perfect
 

4499
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:49,840
a perfect you can build perfect
localizers are not that hard to build

4500
01:28:49,840 --> 01:28:49,850
localizers are not that hard to build
 

4501
01:28:49,850 --> 01:28:52,990
localizers are not that hard to build
okay come on now with with wood lighter

4502
01:28:52,990 --> 01:28:53,000
okay come on now with with wood lighter
 

4503
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,420
okay come on now with with wood lighter
why don't ya wood lighter okay yeah but

4504
01:28:55,420 --> 01:28:55,430
why don't ya wood lighter okay yeah but
 

4505
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:56,920
why don't ya wood lighter okay yeah but
you use lighter right like use lidar

4506
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:56,930
you use lighter right like use lidar
 

4507
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:58,930
you use lighter right like use lidar
build a perfect localizer building a

4508
01:28:58,930 --> 01:28:58,940
build a perfect localizer building a
 

4509
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:03,100
build a perfect localizer building a
perfect localizer without lidar it's

4510
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:03,110
perfect localizer without lidar it's
 

4511
01:29:03,110 --> 01:29:04,600
perfect localizer without lidar it's
gonna be it's gonna be hard you can get

4512
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:04,610
gonna be it's gonna be hard you can get
 

4513
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:05,830
gonna be it's gonna be hard you can get
ten centimeters without liner you can

4514
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:05,840
ten centimeters without liner you can
 

4515
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,480
ten centimeters without liner you can
get one centimeter with lidar maybe

4516
01:29:07,480 --> 01:29:07,490
get one centimeter with lidar maybe
 

4517
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:09,250
get one centimeter with lidar maybe
concern about the one or ten centimeter

4518
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:09,260
concern about the one or ten centimeter
 

4519
01:29:09,260 --> 01:29:11,110
concern about the one or ten centimeter
I'm concerned if every once in a while

4520
01:29:11,110 --> 01:29:11,120
I'm concerned if every once in a while
 

4521
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,500
I'm concerned if every once in a while
you're just way off yeah so this is why

4522
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:14,510
you're just way off yeah so this is why
 

4523
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:18,100
you're just way off yeah so this is why
you have to carefully make sure you're

4524
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:18,110
you have to carefully make sure you're
 

4525
01:29:18,110 --> 01:29:20,320
you have to carefully make sure you're
always tracking your position you want

4526
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:20,330
always tracking your position you want
 

4527
01:29:20,330 --> 01:29:21,069
always tracking your position you want
to use light

4528
01:29:21,069 --> 01:29:21,079
to use light
 

4529
01:29:21,079 --> 01:29:22,509
to use light
camera fusion but you can get the

4530
01:29:22,509 --> 01:29:22,519
camera fusion but you can get the
 

4531
01:29:22,519 --> 01:29:26,159
camera fusion but you can get the
reliability of that system up to a

4532
01:29:26,159 --> 01:29:26,169
reliability of that system up to a
 

4533
01:29:26,169 --> 01:29:28,359
reliability of that system up to a
hundred thousand miles and then you

4534
01:29:28,359 --> 01:29:28,369
hundred thousand miles and then you
 

4535
01:29:28,369 --> 01:29:30,250
hundred thousand miles and then you
write some fallback condition where it's

4536
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:30,260
write some fallback condition where it's
 

4537
01:29:30,260 --> 01:29:31,989
write some fallback condition where it's
not that bad if you're way off right I

4538
01:29:31,989 --> 01:29:31,999
not that bad if you're way off right I
 

4539
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,639
not that bad if you're way off right I
think that you can get it to the point

4540
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:33,649
think that you can get it to the point
 

4541
01:29:33,649 --> 01:29:35,739
think that you can get it to the point
it's like özil D that you're you're

4542
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:35,749
it's like özil D that you're you're
 

4543
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:37,629
it's like özil D that you're you're
never in a case where you're way off and

4544
01:29:37,629 --> 01:29:37,639
never in a case where you're way off and
 

4545
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:39,520
never in a case where you're way off and
you don't know it yeah okay so this is

4546
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:39,530
you don't know it yeah okay so this is
 

4547
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:42,369
you don't know it yeah okay so this is
brilliant so that's the static static we

4548
01:29:42,369 --> 01:29:42,379
brilliant so that's the static static we
 

4549
01:29:42,379 --> 01:29:45,369
brilliant so that's the static static we
can especially with lidar and good HD

4550
01:29:45,369 --> 01:29:45,379
can especially with lidar and good HD
 

4551
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:47,290
can especially with lidar and good HD
maps you can solve that problem easy

4552
01:29:47,290 --> 01:29:47,300
maps you can solve that problem easy
 

4553
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:52,029
maps you can solve that problem easy
no you just the static static very

4554
01:29:52,029 --> 01:29:52,039
no you just the static static very
 

4555
01:29:52,039 --> 01:29:53,859
no you just the static static very
typical for you to say something's easy

4556
01:29:53,859 --> 01:29:53,869
typical for you to say something's easy
 

4557
01:29:53,869 --> 01:29:56,049
typical for you to say something's easy
I got it it's not as challenging as the

4558
01:29:56,049 --> 01:29:56,059
I got it it's not as challenging as the
 

4559
01:29:56,059 --> 01:29:57,969
I got it it's not as challenging as the
other ones okay well it's okay maybe

4560
01:29:57,969 --> 01:29:57,979
other ones okay well it's okay maybe
 

4561
01:29:57,979 --> 01:29:58,989
other ones okay well it's okay maybe
it's obvious how to solve it the third

4562
01:29:58,989 --> 01:29:58,999
it's obvious how to solve it the third
 

4563
01:29:58,999 --> 01:30:00,219
it's obvious how to solve it the third
one's the hardest well where do we get

4564
01:30:00,219 --> 01:30:00,229
one's the hardest well where do we get
 

4565
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:01,179
one's the hardest well where do we get
and a lot of people don't even think

4566
01:30:01,179 --> 01:30:01,189
and a lot of people don't even think
 

4567
01:30:01,189 --> 01:30:02,560
and a lot of people don't even think
about the third one and even I see it as

4568
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:02,570
about the third one and even I see it as
 

4569
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:03,849
about the third one and even I see it as
different from the second one so the

4570
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:03,859
different from the second one so the
 

4571
01:30:03,859 --> 01:30:06,489
different from the second one so the
second one is dynamic the second one is

4572
01:30:06,489 --> 01:30:06,499
second one is dynamic the second one is
 

4573
01:30:06,499 --> 01:30:08,589
second one is dynamic the second one is
like say there's an obvious examples

4574
01:30:08,589 --> 01:30:08,599
like say there's an obvious examples
 

4575
01:30:08,599 --> 01:30:10,060
like say there's an obvious examples
like a car stopped at a red light

4576
01:30:10,060 --> 01:30:10,070
like a car stopped at a red light
 

4577
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:11,529
like a car stopped at a red light
right you can't have that car in your

4578
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:11,539
right you can't have that car in your
 

4579
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,299
right you can't have that car in your
map yeah because you don't know whether

4580
01:30:13,299 --> 01:30:13,309
map yeah because you don't know whether
 

4581
01:30:13,309 --> 01:30:15,099
map yeah because you don't know whether
that car is gonna be there or not so you

4582
01:30:15,099 --> 01:30:15,109
that car is gonna be there or not so you
 

4583
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:17,379
that car is gonna be there or not so you
have to detect that car in real time and

4584
01:30:17,379 --> 01:30:17,389
have to detect that car in real time and
 

4585
01:30:17,389 --> 01:30:19,149
have to detect that car in real time and
then you have to you know do the

4586
01:30:19,149 --> 01:30:19,159
then you have to you know do the
 

4587
01:30:19,159 --> 01:30:22,869
then you have to you know do the
appropriate action right also that car

4588
01:30:22,869 --> 01:30:22,879
appropriate action right also that car
 

4589
01:30:22,879 --> 01:30:25,509
appropriate action right also that car
is not a fixed object that car may move

4590
01:30:25,509 --> 01:30:25,519
is not a fixed object that car may move
 

4591
01:30:25,519 --> 01:30:27,040
is not a fixed object that car may move
and you have to predict with that car

4592
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:27,050
and you have to predict with that car
 

4593
01:30:27,050 --> 01:30:29,259
and you have to predict with that car
will dim alright so this is the dynamic

4594
01:30:29,259 --> 01:30:29,269
will dim alright so this is the dynamic
 

4595
01:30:29,269 --> 01:30:31,959
will dim alright so this is the dynamic
problem yeah do you have to deal with

4596
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:31,969
problem yeah do you have to deal with
 

4597
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:35,439
problem yeah do you have to deal with
this um this involves again like you're

4598
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:35,449
this um this involves again like you're
 

4599
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:37,119
this um this involves again like you're
gonna need models of other people's

4600
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:37,129
gonna need models of other people's
 

4601
01:30:37,129 --> 01:30:39,849
gonna need models of other people's
behavior do you are you including in

4602
01:30:39,849 --> 01:30:39,859
behavior do you are you including in
 

4603
01:30:39,859 --> 01:30:41,859
behavior do you are you including in
that and I don't want to step on on the

4604
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:41,869
that and I don't want to step on on the
 

4605
01:30:41,869 --> 01:30:44,979
that and I don't want to step on on the
third one oh but if I are you including

4606
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:44,989
third one oh but if I are you including
 

4607
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:47,079
third one oh but if I are you including
in that you're influenced and people I

4608
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:47,089
in that you're influenced and people I
 

4609
01:30:47,089 --> 01:30:49,599
in that you're influenced and people I
guess the third okay that's the moon we

4610
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:49,609
guess the third okay that's the moon we
 

4611
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:52,329
guess the third okay that's the moon we
call it the counterfactual yeah I

4612
01:30:52,329 --> 01:30:52,339
call it the counterfactual yeah I
 

4613
01:30:52,339 --> 01:30:53,979
call it the counterfactual yeah I
believe that I just talked to Judea

4614
01:30:53,979 --> 01:30:53,989
believe that I just talked to Judea
 

4615
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:54,879
believe that I just talked to Judea
pearl who's obsessed with

4616
01:30:54,879 --> 01:30:54,889
pearl who's obsessed with
 

4617
01:30:54,889 --> 01:30:59,529
pearl who's obsessed with
counterfactuals oh yeah yeah so the

4618
01:30:59,529 --> 01:30:59,539
counterfactuals oh yeah yeah so the
 

4619
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:01,199
counterfactuals oh yeah yeah so the
static and the dynamic yeah

4620
01:31:01,199 --> 01:31:01,209
static and the dynamic yeah
 

4621
01:31:01,209 --> 01:31:04,869
static and the dynamic yeah
our approach right now for lateral will

4622
01:31:04,869 --> 01:31:04,879
our approach right now for lateral will
 

4623
01:31:04,879 --> 01:31:06,729
our approach right now for lateral will
scale completely to the static a dynamic

4624
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:06,739
scale completely to the static a dynamic
 

4625
01:31:06,739 --> 01:31:09,909
scale completely to the static a dynamic
the counterfactual the only way I have

4626
01:31:09,909 --> 01:31:09,919
the counterfactual the only way I have
 

4627
01:31:09,919 --> 01:31:11,679
the counterfactual the only way I have
to do it yet they don't give you thing

4628
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:11,689
to do it yet they don't give you thing
 

4629
01:31:11,689 --> 01:31:13,569
to do it yet they don't give you thing
that I want to do once we have all these

4630
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:13,579
that I want to do once we have all these
 

4631
01:31:13,579 --> 01:31:14,949
that I want to do once we have all these
cars is I want to do reinforcement

4632
01:31:14,949 --> 01:31:14,959
cars is I want to do reinforcement
 

4633
01:31:14,959 --> 01:31:17,349
cars is I want to do reinforcement
learning on the world I'm always gonna

4634
01:31:17,349 --> 01:31:17,359
learning on the world I'm always gonna
 

4635
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:19,060
learning on the world I'm always gonna
turn the exploiter up to max I'm not

4636
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:19,070
turn the exploiter up to max I'm not
 

4637
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:20,979
turn the exploiter up to max I'm not
gonna have them explore but the only

4638
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:20,989
gonna have them explore but the only
 

4639
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:22,839
gonna have them explore but the only
real way to get at the counterfactual is

4640
01:31:22,839 --> 01:31:22,849
real way to get at the counterfactual is
 

4641
01:31:22,849 --> 01:31:24,369
real way to get at the counterfactual is
to do reinforcement learning because the

4642
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:24,379
to do reinforcement learning because the
 

4643
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:28,569
to do reinforcement learning because the
other agents are humans so that's

4644
01:31:28,569 --> 01:31:28,579
other agents are humans so that's
 

4645
01:31:28,579 --> 01:31:29,679
other agents are humans so that's
fascinating that you break you down like

4646
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:29,689
fascinating that you break you down like
 

4647
01:31:29,689 --> 01:31:32,589
fascinating that you break you down like
that I agree completely I've set my life

4648
01:31:32,589 --> 01:31:32,599
that I agree completely I've set my life
 

4649
01:31:32,599 --> 01:31:34,510
that I agree completely I've set my life
thinking about this beautiful

4650
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:34,520
thinking about this beautiful
 

4651
01:31:34,520 --> 01:31:37,000
thinking about this beautiful
they're so and part of it because you're

4652
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,010
they're so and part of it because you're
 

4653
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:41,950
they're so and part of it because you're
slightly insane because not my life just

4654
01:31:41,950 --> 01:31:41,960
slightly insane because not my life just
 

4655
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:44,880
slightly insane because not my life just
the last four years no no you have like

4656
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:44,890
the last four years no no you have like
 

4657
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:48,610
the last four years no no you have like
some some nonzero percent of your brain

4658
01:31:48,610 --> 01:31:48,620
some some nonzero percent of your brain
 

4659
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,940
some some nonzero percent of your brain
has a madman in it which that's a really

4660
01:31:51,940 --> 01:31:51,950
has a madman in it which that's a really
 

4661
01:31:51,950 --> 01:31:54,730
has a madman in it which that's a really
good feature but there's a safety

4662
01:31:54,730 --> 01:31:54,740
good feature but there's a safety
 

4663
01:31:54,740 --> 01:31:56,890
good feature but there's a safety
component to it that I think when this

4664
01:31:56,890 --> 01:31:56,900
component to it that I think when this
 

4665
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,110
component to it that I think when this
sort of counterfactuals and so on that

4666
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120
sort of counterfactuals and so on that
 

4667
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,520
sort of counterfactuals and so on that
would just freak people out how do you

4668
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:00,530
would just freak people out how do you
 

4669
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:02,290
would just freak people out how do you
even start to think about just in

4670
01:32:02,290 --> 01:32:02,300
even start to think about just in
 

4671
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:04,950
even start to think about just in
general I mean you've you've had some

4672
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
general I mean you've you've had some
 

4673
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,640
general I mean you've you've had some
friction with Nitza and so on I am

4674
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:08,650
friction with Nitza and so on I am
 

4675
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:13,470
friction with Nitza and so on I am
frankly exhausted by safety engineers

4676
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:13,480
frankly exhausted by safety engineers
 

4677
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:20,170
frankly exhausted by safety engineers
the the prioritization on safety over

4678
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:20,180
the the prioritization on safety over
 

4679
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:22,840
the the prioritization on safety over
innovation to a degree where it kills in

4680
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:22,850
innovation to a degree where it kills in
 

4681
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:26,350
innovation to a degree where it kills in
my view kills safety in the long term so

4682
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:26,360
my view kills safety in the long term so
 

4683
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,890
my view kills safety in the long term so
the counterfactual thing they just just

4684
01:32:29,890 --> 01:32:29,900
the counterfactual thing they just just
 

4685
01:32:29,900 --> 01:32:31,810
the counterfactual thing they just just
actually exploring this world of how do

4686
01:32:31,810 --> 01:32:31,820
actually exploring this world of how do
 

4687
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:33,430
actually exploring this world of how do
you interact with dynamic objects and so

4688
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
you interact with dynamic objects and so
 

4689
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,510
you interact with dynamic objects and so
on how do you how do you think about

4690
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:34,520
on how do you how do you think about
 

4691
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,400
on how do you how do you think about
safety you can do reinforcement learning

4692
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:36,410
safety you can do reinforcement learning
 

4693
01:32:36,410 --> 01:32:38,620
safety you can do reinforcement learning
without ever exploring and I said that

4694
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:38,630
without ever exploring and I said that
 

4695
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:40,540
without ever exploring and I said that
like so you can think about you're in

4696
01:32:40,540 --> 01:32:40,550
like so you can think about you're in
 

4697
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,650
like so you can think about you're in
like a reinforcement learning it's

4698
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:41,660
like a reinforcement learning it's
 

4699
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:42,670
like a reinforcement learning it's
usually called like a temperature

4700
01:32:42,670 --> 01:32:42,680
usually called like a temperature
 

4701
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,010
usually called like a temperature
parameter and your temperature parameter

4702
01:32:45,010 --> 01:32:45,020
parameter and your temperature parameter
 

4703
01:32:45,020 --> 01:32:47,200
parameter and your temperature parameter
is how often you deviate from the Arg

4704
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:47,210
is how often you deviate from the Arg
 

4705
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:49,720
is how often you deviate from the Arg
max I could always set that to zero and

4706
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:49,730
max I could always set that to zero and
 

4707
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:51,700
max I could always set that to zero and
still learn and I feel that you'd always

4708
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:51,710
still learn and I feel that you'd always
 

4709
01:32:51,710 --> 01:32:53,260
still learn and I feel that you'd always
want that set to zero on your actual

4710
01:32:53,260 --> 01:32:53,270
want that set to zero on your actual
 

4711
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:56,200
want that set to zero on your actual
system got you but the problem is you

4712
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:56,210
system got you but the problem is you
 

4713
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,540
system got you but the problem is you
first don't know very much and so you're

4714
01:32:58,540 --> 01:32:58,550
first don't know very much and so you're
 

4715
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:00,160
first don't know very much and so you're
going to make mistakes so the learning

4716
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:00,170
going to make mistakes so the learning
 

4717
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:02,560
going to make mistakes so the learning
the exploration happens to ready yeah

4718
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:02,570
the exploration happens to ready yeah
 

4719
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,200
the exploration happens to ready yeah
but okay so the consequences of a

4720
01:33:05,200 --> 01:33:05,210
but okay so the consequences of a
 

4721
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:07,210
but okay so the consequences of a

01:33:58,510 --> 01:33:58,520
system better better I don't know I mean
 

4773
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:01,570
system better better I don't know I mean
but what's the messaging here I got a

4774
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:01,580
but what's the messaging here I got a
 

4775
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:05,680
but what's the messaging here I got a

01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:06,980
basically said that the human factor
 

4779
01:34:06,980 --> 01:34:09,940
basically said that the human factor
doesn't matter you know the human

4780
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:09,950
doesn't matter you know the human
 

4781
01:34:09,950 --> 01:34:11,320
doesn't matter you know the human
doesn't matter because the system will

4782
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:11,330
doesn't matter because the system will

and so the human it won't won't really

4790
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:19,760
and so the human it won't won't really
 

4791
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:22,450
and so the human it won't won't really
matter but it seems like that human

4792
01:34:22,450 --> 01:34:22,460
matter but it seems like that human
 

4793
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,200

5228
01:42:58,830 --> 01:42:58,840
huge one is how do we create value today
 

5229
01:42:58,840 --> 01:43:00,990

with some of this then the link keeping

5230
01:43:00,990 --> 01:43:01,000
with some of this then the link keeping
 

5231
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,120
with some of this then the link keeping
things huge and it sounds like you're

5232
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:03,130
things huge and it sounds like you're
 

5233
01:43:03,130 --> 01:43:05,190
things huge and it sounds like you're
creeping in or full steam ahead on the

01:43:05,190 --> 01:43:05,200
creeping in or full steam ahead on the
 

5235
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:07,260
creeping in or full steam ahead on the
driver monitoring - yeah which I think

5236
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:07,270
driver monitoring - yeah which I think
 

5237
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:09,300
driver monitoring - yeah which I think
actually were the short-term value if

5238
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:09,310
actually were the short-term value if
 

5239
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,060
actually were the short-term value if
you can get right I still I'm not a huge

fan of the statement that everything is
 

5243
01:43:13,420 --> 01:43:15,090
fan of the statement that everything is
to have driver monitoring but will I

5244
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:15,100
to have driver monitoring but will I
 

5245
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,220
to have driver monitoring but will I
agree with that completely but I'm that

5246
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:17,230
agree with that completely but I'm that
 

5247
01:43:17,230 --> 01:43:18,840
agree with that completely but I'm that
statement usually misses the point that

5248
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:18,850
statement usually misses the point that
 

5249
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:21,120
statement usually misses the point that
to get the experience of it right is not

5250
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:21,130
to get the experience of it right is not
 

5251
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:23,880
to get the experience of it right is not
trivial oh no not at all in fact like so

5252
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:23,890
trivial oh no not at all in fact like so
 

5253
01:43:23,890 --> 01:43:27,180
trivial oh no not at all in fact like so
right now we have I think the time out

5254
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:27,190
right now we have I think the time out
 

5255
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:30,120
right now we have I think the time out
depends on speed of the car but we want

5256
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:30,130
depends on speed of the car but we want
 

5257
01:43:30,130 --> 01:43:32,400
depends on speed of the car but we want
to depend on like the scenes day if

5258
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:32,410
to depend on like the scenes day if
 

5259
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,550

you're on like an empty Highway it's
 

5261
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,110
you're on like an empty Highway it's
very different if you don't pay

01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:37,120
very different if you don't pay
 

5263
01:43:37,120 --> 01:43:38,970
very different if you don't pay
attention then if light you're like

attention then if light you're like
 

5265
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:41,780
attention then if light you're like
coming up to a traffic light and

coming up to a traffic light and
 

5267
01:43:41,790 --> 01:43:44,760
coming up to a traffic light and
long-term it should probably learn from

5268
01:43:44,760 --> 01:43:44,770
long-term it should probably learn from
 

5269
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:46,650

it's not triggered yeah we don't we
 

5351
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:20,700
it's not triggered yeah we don't we
don't how you have to detect the ethical

5352
01:45:20,700 --> 01:45:20,710
don't how you have to detect the ethical
 

5353
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,410
don't how you have to detect the ethical
dilemmas but we're a level two system so

5354
01:45:22,410 --> 01:45:22,420
dilemmas but we're a level two system so
 

5355
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:23,819
dilemmas but we're a level two system so
we're going to disengage and leave that

5356
01:45:23,819 --> 01:45:23,829
we're going to disengage and leave that
 

5357

troll hey no but the trolley problem

5360
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:27,460
troll hey no but the trolley problem
 

5361
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:30,660
troll hey no but the trolley problem
deserves to be trolled yeah that's a

5362
01:45:30,660 --> 01:45:30,670
deserves to be trolled yeah that's a
 

5363

5382
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:48,489
use a sequal stack or no sequel stack if
 

5383
01:45:48,489 --> 01:45:49,919
use a sequal stack or no sequel stack if
they're not that technical they have no

5384
01:45:49,919 --> 01:45:49,929
they're not that technical they have no
 

5385
01:45:49,929 --> 01:45:51,359
they're not that technical they have no
opinion but if you ask them what color

5386
01:45:51,359 --> 01:45:51,369
opinion but if you ask them what color
 

5387
01:45:51,369 --> 01:45:52,620
opinion but if you ask them what color
they want to paint the office everyone

5388
01:45:52,620 --> 01:45:52,630
they want to paint the office everyone
 

5389
01:45:52,630 --> 01:45:54,359
they want to paint the office everyone
has an opinion on that and that's why

5390
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:54,369
has an opinion on that and that's why
 

5391
01:45:54,369 --> 01:45:56,129
has an opinion on that and that's why
the trolley problem is that's it I mean

5392
01:45:56,129 --> 01:45:56,139
the trolley problem is that's it I mean
 

5393
01:45:56,139 --> 01:45:57,089
the trolley problem is that's it I mean
it's a beautiful answer

5394
01:45:57,089 --> 01:45:57,099
it's a beautiful answer
 

5395
01:45:57,099 --> 01:45:59,100
it's a beautiful answer
yeah we're able to detect the problem

5396
01:45:59,100 --> 01:45:59,110
yeah we're able to detect the problem
 

5397
01:45:59,110 --> 01:46:01,439
yeah we're able to detect the problem
and were able to pass it on to the human

5398
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:01,449
and were able to pass it on to the human
 

5399
01:46:01,449 --> 01:46:03,330
and were able to pass it on to the human
yeah I've never never heard anyone say

5400
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:03,340
yeah I've never never heard anyone say
 

5401
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:07,439
yeah I've never never heard anyone say
it nice escape route okay but proud

5402
01:46:07,439 --> 01:46:07,449
it nice escape route okay but proud
 

5403
01:46:07,449 --> 01:46:10,709

the other thing that people cope you
 

5407
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:14,969
the other thing that people cope you

01:46:19,830 --> 01:46:19,840
general is hacking so how hard is it do
 

5411
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:21,270
general is hacking so how hard is it do
you think to hack a nataas vehicle

5412
01:46:21,270 --> 01:46:21,280
you think to hack a nataas vehicle
 

5413
01:46:21,280 --> 01:46:23,430
you think to hack a nataas vehicle
either through physical access or

these adversarial examples on the
 

5419
01:46:27,340 --> 01:46:30,750
these adversarial examples on the
sensors be adversarial examples one you

5420
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:30,760
sensors be adversarial examples one you
 

5421
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,279
sensors be adversarial examples one you
want to see some adversarial examples

5422
01:46:32,279 --> 01:46:32,289
want to see some adversarial examples
 

5423
01:46:32,289 --> 01:46:35,779
want to see some adversarial examples
that affect humans hmm right oh well

5424
01:46:35,779 --> 01:46:35,789
that affect humans hmm right oh well
 

5425
01:46:35,789 --> 01:46:38,160
that affect humans hmm right oh well
there used to be a stop sign here but I

5426
01:46:38,160 --> 01:46:38,170
there used to be a stop sign here but I
 

5427
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:40,049
there used to be a stop sign here but I
put a black bag over the stop sign and

5428
01:46:40,049 --> 01:46:40,059
put a black bag over the stop sign and
 

5429
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:42,000
put a black bag over the stop sign and
then people ran it all right adversarial

5430
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,010
then people ran it all right adversarial
 

5431
01:46:42,010 --> 01:46:44,819
then people ran it all right adversarial
yeah right like like like there's tons

5432
01:46:44,819 --> 01:46:44,829
yeah right like like like there's tons
 

5433
01:46:44,829 --> 01:46:48,450
yeah right like like like there's tons
of human adversarial examples - um the

5434
01:46:48,450 --> 01:46:48,460
of human adversarial examples - um the
 

5435
01:46:48,460 --> 01:46:51,330
of human adversarial examples - um the

01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,180
if you saw something something just came
out today I'm like there are always such

out today I'm like there are always such
 

5441
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:56,669
out today I'm like there are always such

on autopilot was fooled by a GPS spoof
 

5445
01:46:59,409 --> 01:47:01,979
on autopilot was fooled by a GPS spoof
to take an exit right at least that's

5446
01:47:01,979 --> 01:47:01,989
to take an exit right at least that's
 

5447
01:47:01,989 --> 01:47:03,629
to take an exit right at least that's
all they could do was take an exit if

all they could do was take an exit if
your car is relying on GPS in order to

5450
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:06,789
your car is relying on GPS in order to
 

5451
01:47:06,789 --> 01:47:09,330
your car is relying on GPS in order to
have a safe driving policy they're doing

5452
01:47:09,330 --> 01:47:09,340
have a safe driving policy they're doing
 

5453
01:47:09,340 --> 01:47:09,700
have a safe driving policy they're doing
something

5454
01:47:09,700 --> 01:47:09,710
something
 

5455
01:47:09,710 --> 01:47:12,580
something
if you're relying and this is why v2v is

5456
01:47:12,580 --> 01:47:12,590
if you're relying and this is why v2v is
 

5457
01:47:12,590 --> 01:47:14,200
if you're relying and this is why v2v is
such a terrible idea

5458
01:47:14,200 --> 01:47:14,210
such a terrible idea
 

5459
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:18,370
such a terrible idea
v2v now relies on both parties getting

5460
01:47:18,370 --> 01:47:18,380
v2v now relies on both parties getting

v2v now relies on both parties getting
communication right this is not even so

01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:21,170
communication right this is not even so
 

5463
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:26,740
communication right this is not even so
I think of safety security is like a

5464
01:47:26,740 --> 01:47:26,750
I think of safety security is like a
 

5465
01:47:26,750 --> 01:47:29,020
I think of safety security is like a
special case of safety right safety is

5466
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:29,030
special case of safety right safety is
 

5467
01:47:29,030 --> 01:47:32,140
special case of safety right safety is
like we put a little you know piece of

5468
01:47:32,140 --> 01:47:32,150
like we put a little you know piece of
 

5469
01:47:32,150 --> 01:47:33,610
like we put a little you know piece of
caution tape around the hole so that

5470
01:47:33,610 --> 01:47:33,620
caution tape around the hole so that
 

5471
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:35,380
caution tape around the hole so that
people won't walk into it by accident

5472
01:47:35,380 --> 01:47:35,390
people won't walk into it by accident
 

5473
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:37,540
people won't walk into it by accident
security is I put a 10 foot fence around

5474
01:47:37,540 --> 01:47:37,550
security is I put a 10 foot fence around
 

5475
01:47:37,550 --> 01:47:39,040
security is I put a 10 foot fence around
the hole so you actually physically

5476
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:39,050
the hole so you actually physically
 

5477
01:47:39,050 --> 01:47:40,660
the hole so you actually physically
cannot climb into it with barbed wire on

5478
01:47:40,660 --> 01:47:40,670
cannot climb into it with barbed wire on
 

5479
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:43,360
cannot climb into it with barbed wire on
the top and stuff right so like if

5480
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:43,370
the top and stuff right so like if
 

5481
01:47:43,370 --> 01:47:44,830
the top and stuff right so like if
you're designing systems that are like

5482
01:47:44,830 --> 01:47:44,840
you're designing systems that are like
 

5483
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,580
you're designing systems that are like
unreliable they're definitely not secure

5484
01:47:47,580 --> 01:47:47,590
unreliable they're definitely not secure
 

5485
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:50,770
unreliable they're definitely not secure
your car should always do something safe

5486
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:50,780
your car should always do something safe
 

5487
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:53,740
your car should always do something safe
using its local sensors and then the

5488
01:47:53,740 --> 01:47:53,750
using its local sensors and then the
 

5489
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:55,330
using its local sensors and then the
local sensor should be hardwired and

5490
01:47:55,330 --> 01:47:55,340
local sensor should be hardwired and
 

5491
01:47:55,340 --> 01:47:57,100
local sensor should be hardwired and
then could somebody hack into your can

5492
01:47:57,100 --> 01:47:57,110
then could somebody hack into your can
 

5493
01:47:57,110 --> 01:47:58,180
then could somebody hack into your can
boss and turn your steering wheel on

5494
01:47:58,180 --> 01:47:58,190
boss and turn your steering wheel on
 

5495
01:47:58,190 --> 01:47:58,630
boss and turn your steering wheel on
your brakes

5496
01:47:58,630 --> 01:47:58,640
your brakes
 

5497
01:47:58,640 --> 01:48:00,010
your brakes
yes but they could do it before common

5498
01:48:00,010 --> 01:48:00,020
yes but they could do it before common
 

5499
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:04,000
yes but they could do it before common
AI too so let's think out of the box and

5500
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:04,010
AI too so let's think out of the box and
 

5501
01:48:04,010 --> 01:48:06,610
AI too so let's think out of the box and
some things so do you think

5502
01:48:06,610 --> 01:48:06,620
some things so do you think
 

5503
01:48:06,620 --> 01:48:09,250
some things so do you think
teleoperation has a role in any of this

5504
01:48:09,250 --> 01:48:09,260
teleoperation has a role in any of this
 

5505
01:48:09,260 --> 01:48:12,520
teleoperation has a role in any of this
so remotely stepping in and controlling

5506
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:12,530
so remotely stepping in and controlling
 

5507
01:48:12,530 --> 01:48:18,340
so remotely stepping in and controlling
the cars no I think that if safety if

5508
01:48:18,340 --> 01:48:18,350
the cars no I think that if safety if
 

5509
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:22,840
the cars no I think that if safety if
the safety operation by design requires

5510
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:22,850
the safety operation by design requires
 

5511
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:26,680
the safety operation by design requires
a constant link to the cars I think it

5512
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:26,690
a constant link to the cars I think it
 

5513
01:48:26,690 --> 01:48:28,330
a constant link to the cars I think it
doesn't work so that's the same argument

5514
01:48:28,330 --> 01:48:28,340
doesn't work so that's the same argument
 

5515
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:32,410
doesn't work so that's the same argument
using for v2i VTV well there's a lot of

5516
01:48:32,410 --> 01:48:32,420
using for v2i VTV well there's a lot of
 

5517
01:48:32,420 --> 01:48:34,570
using for v2i VTV well there's a lot of
non safety critical stuff you can do

5518
01:48:34,570 --> 01:48:34,580
non safety critical stuff you can do
 

5519
01:48:34,580 --> 01:48:36,399
non safety critical stuff you can do
with v2 I like v2 I liked v2 I weigh

5520
01:48:36,399 --> 01:48:36,409
with v2 I like v2 I liked v2 I weigh
 

5521
01:48:36,409 --> 01:48:38,530
with v2 I like v2 I liked v2 I weigh
more than V B because Vita I is is

5522
01:48:38,530 --> 01:48:38,540
more than V B because Vita I is is
 

5523
01:48:38,540 --> 01:48:39,910
more than V B because Vita I is is
already like I already have internet in

5524
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
already like I already have internet in
 

5525
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,620
already like I already have internet in
the car right there's a lot of great

5526
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:41,630
the car right there's a lot of great
 

5527
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:44,680
the car right there's a lot of great
stuff you can do with v2 I um like for

5528
01:48:44,680 --> 01:48:44,690
stuff you can do with v2 I um like for
 

5529
01:48:44,690 --> 01:48:46,959
stuff you can do with v2 I um like for
example you can well where I already

5530
01:48:46,959 --> 01:48:46,969
example you can well where I already
 

5531
01:48:46,969 --> 01:48:49,270
example you can well where I already
have v2 Waze is V die right ways can

5532
01:48:49,270 --> 01:48:49,280
have v2 Waze is V die right ways can
 

5533
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,709
have v2 Waze is V die right ways can
route me around traffic jams that's a

5534
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
route me around traffic jams that's a

let's uh let's try my best you know like

5750
01:53:18,599 --> 01:53:18,609
let's uh let's try my best you know like
 

5751
01:53:18,609 --> 01:53:22,349
let's uh let's try my best you know like
what's the worst that happens but the

01:53:22,349 --> 01:53:22,359
what's the worst that happens but the
 

5753
01:53:22,359 --> 01:53:24,719
what's the worst that happens but the
best possible future I see is me sort of

5754
01:53:24,719 --> 01:53:24,729
best possible future I see is me sort of
 

5755
01:53:24,729 --> 01:53:27,419
best possible future I see is me sort of
merging with the Machine and the way

5756
01:53:27,419 --> 01:53:27,429
merging with the Machine and the way
 

5757
01:53:27,429 --> 01:53:29,790
merging with the Machine and the way
that I personify this is in a long-term

5758
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:29,800
that I personify this is in a long-term
 

5759
01:53:29,800 --> 01:53:31,290
that I personify this is in a long-term

oh you don't think there's room for

5762
01:53:33,989 --> 01:53:33,999
oh you don't think there's room for
 

5763
01:53:33,999 --> 01:53:36,419
oh you don't think there's room for
another human in your life if you really

5764
01:53:36,419 --> 01:53:36,429
another human in your life if you really
 

5765
01:53:36,429 --> 01:53:39,599
another human in your life if you really
truly merge with another machine I mean

5766
01:53:39,599 --> 01:53:39,609
truly merge with another machine I mean
 

5767
01:53:39,609 --> 01:53:42,079
truly merge with another machine I mean
I see merging I see like the best

5768
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:42,089
I see merging I see like the best
 

5769
01:53:42,089 --> 01:53:47,309
I see merging I see like the best
interface to my brain is like the same

5770
01:53:47,309 --> 01:53:47,319
interface to my brain is like the same
 

5771
01:53:47,319 --> 01:53:49,559
interface to my brain is like the same
relationship and to merge with an AI

5772
01:53:49,559 --> 01:53:49,569
relationship and to merge with an AI
 

5773
01:53:49,569 --> 01:53:50,040
relationship and to merge with an AI
right

5774
01:53:50,040 --> 01:53:50,050
right
 

5775
01:53:50,050 --> 01:53:53,250
right
does that merging feel like I see yeah

5776
01:53:53,250 --> 01:53:53,260
does that merging feel like I see yeah
 

5777
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:54,629
does that merging feel like I see yeah
I've seen couples who've been together

5778
01:53:54,629 --> 01:53:54,639
I've seen couples who've been together
 

5779
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:57,000
I've seen couples who've been together
for a long time and like I almost think

5780
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:57,010
for a long time and like I almost think
 

5781
01:53:57,010 --> 01:53:59,280
for a long time and like I almost think
of them as one person like couples who

5782
01:53:59,280 --> 01:53:59,290
of them as one person like couples who
 

5783
01:53:59,290 --> 01:54:01,979
of them as one person like couples who
spend all their time together and that's

5784
01:54:01,979 --> 01:54:01,989
spend all their time together and that's
 

5785
01:54:01,989 --> 01:54:04,020
spend all their time together and that's
that's how you're actually putting what

5786
01:54:04,020 --> 01:54:04,030
that's how you're actually putting what
 

5787
01:54:04,030 --> 01:54:05,339
that's how you're actually putting what
does that merging actually looks like

5788
01:54:05,339 --> 01:54:05,349
does that merging actually looks like
 

5789
01:54:05,349 --> 01:54:08,490
does that merging actually looks like
it's not just a nice channel like a lot

5790
01:54:08,490 --> 01:54:08,500
it's not just a nice channel like a lot

pretty uh I don't believe that link is

5808
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:25,270
pretty uh I don't believe that link is
 

5809
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:27,660
pretty uh I don't believe that link is
possible um I think that that link so

5810
01:54:27,660 --> 01:54:27,670
possible um I think that that link so
 

5811
01:54:27,670 --> 01:54:29,160
possible um I think that that link so
you're like oh me to download Wikipedia

you're like oh me to download Wikipedia
 

5813
01:54:29,170 --> 01:54:31,109
you're like oh me to download Wikipedia
right to my brain yeah my reading speed

5814
01:54:31,109 --> 01:54:31,119
right to my brain yeah my reading speed
 

5815
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:33,720
right to my brain yeah my reading speed
is not limited by my eyes my reading

5816
01:54:33,720 --> 01:54:33,730
is not limited by my eyes my reading
 

5817
01:54:33,730 --> 01:54:35,430

locally and to like bootstrap that

5820
01:54:38,189 --> 01:54:38,199
locally and to like bootstrap that
 

5821
01:54:38,199 --> 01:54:41,220
locally and to like bootstrap that
sounds kind of unclear how to do it and

5822
01:54:41,220 --> 01:54:41,230
sounds kind of unclear how to do it and
 

5823
01:54:41,230 --> 01:54:44,310
sounds kind of unclear how to do it and
horrify but if I am with somebody and

5824
01:54:44,310 --> 01:54:44,320
horrify but if I am with somebody and
 

5825
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:48,049
horrify but if I am with somebody and
I'll use a somebody who is making a

5826
01:54:48,049 --> 01:54:48,059
I'll use a somebody who is making a
 

5827
01:54:48,059 --> 01:54:51,629
I'll use a somebody who is making a
super sophisticated model of me and then

5828
01:54:51,629 --> 01:54:51,639
super sophisticated model of me and then
 

5829
01:54:51,639 --> 01:54:53,189
super sophisticated model of me and then
running simulations on that model I'm

5830
01:54:53,189 --> 01:54:53,199
running simulations on that model I'm
 

5831
01:54:53,199 --> 01:54:54,180
running simulations on that model I'm
not gonna get into the question whether

5832
01:54:54,180 --> 01:54:54,190
not gonna get into the question whether
 

5833
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:55,740
not gonna get into the question whether
the simulations are conscious or not I

5834
01:54:55,740 --> 01:54:55,750
the simulations are conscious or not I
 

5835
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:56,850
the simulations are conscious or not I
don't really want to know what it's

5836
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:56,860
don't really want to know what it's
 

5837
01:54:56,860 --> 01:54:57,120
don't really want to know what it's
doing

5838
01:54:57,120 --> 01:54:57,130
doing
 

5839
01:54:57,130 --> 01:55:00,419
doing
um but using those simulations to play

5840
01:55:00,419 --> 01:55:00,429
um but using those simulations to play
 

5841
01:55:00,429 --> 01:55:02,399
um but using those simulations to play
out hypothetical futures for me deciding

5842
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:02,409
out hypothetical futures for me deciding
 

5843
01:55:02,409 --> 01:55:05,370
out hypothetical futures for me deciding
what things to say to me to guide me

5844
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:05,380
what things to say to me to guide me
 

5845
01:55:05,380 --> 01:55:08,399
what things to say to me to guide me
along a path and that's how I envision

5846
01:55:08,399 --> 01:55:08,409
along a path and that's how I envision
 

5847
01:55:08,409 --> 01:55:08,669
along a path and that's how I envision
it

5848
01:55:08,669 --> 01:55:08,679
it
 

5849
01:55:08,679 --> 01:55:12,839
it
so on that path to AI of superhuman

5850
01:55:12,839 --> 01:55:12,849
so on that path to AI of superhuman
 

5851
01:55:12,849 --> 01:55:15,600
so on that path to AI of superhuman
level intelligence you've mentioned that

5852
01:55:15,600 --> 01:55:15,610
level intelligence you've mentioned that
 

5853
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:16,979
level intelligence you've mentioned that
you believe in the singularity that

5854
01:55:16,979 --> 01:55:16,989
you believe in the singularity that
 

5855
01:55:16,989 --> 01:55:19,200
you believe in the singularity that
singularity is coming yeah again could

5856
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:19,210
singularity is coming yeah again could
 

5857
01:55:19,210 --> 01:55:20,760
singularity is coming yeah again could
be trolling could be not could be part

5858
01:55:20,760 --> 01:55:20,770
be trolling could be not could be part
 

5859
01:55:20,770 --> 01:55:23,220
be trolling could be not could be part
I'm all trolling his truth in it I don't

5860
01:55:23,220 --> 01:55:23,230
I'm all trolling his truth in it I don't
 

5861
01:55:23,230 --> 01:55:24,419
I'm all trolling his truth in it I don't
know what that means anymore what is the

5862
01:55:24,419 --> 01:55:24,429
know what that means anymore what is the
 

5863
01:55:24,429 --> 01:55:26,970
know what that means anymore what is the
singularity yeah so that's that's really

5864
01:55:26,970 --> 01:55:26,980
singularity yeah so that's that's really
 

5865
01:55:26,980 --> 01:55:29,010
singularity yeah so that's that's really
the question how many years do you think

5866
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:29,020
the question how many years do you think
 

5867
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:31,049
the question how many years do you think
before the singularity what form do you

5868
01:55:31,049 --> 01:55:31,059
before the singularity what form do you
 

5869
01:55:31,059 --> 01:55:32,660
before the singularity what form do you
think it will take does that mean

5870
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:32,670
think it will take does that mean
 

5871
01:55:32,670 --> 01:55:35,010
think it will take does that mean
fundamental shifts and capabilities of

5872
01:55:35,010 --> 01:55:35,020
fundamental shifts and capabilities of
 

5873
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,589
fundamental shifts and capabilities of
AI does it mean some other kind of ideas

5874
01:55:37,589 --> 01:55:37,599
AI does it mean some other kind of ideas
 

5875
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:41,490
AI does it mean some other kind of ideas
um maybe this is just my roots but so I

5876
01:55:41,490 --> 01:55:41,500
um maybe this is just my roots but so I
 

5877
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:43,770
um maybe this is just my roots but so I
can buy a human beings worth of compute

5878
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:43,780
can buy a human beings worth of compute
 

5879
01:55:43,780 --> 01:55:46,020
can buy a human beings worth of compute
for like a million bucks that I it's

5880
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:46,030
for like a million bucks that I it's
 

5881
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:48,450
for like a million bucks that I it's
about one TPU pod v3 I want like I think

5882
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:48,460
about one TPU pod v3 I want like I think
 

5883
01:55:48,460 --> 01:55:50,280
about one TPU pod v3 I want like I think
they claim a hundred peda flops that's

5884
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:50,290
they claim a hundred peda flops that's
 

5885
01:55:50,290 --> 01:55:51,419
they claim a hundred peda flops that's
being generous I think humans are

5886
01:55:51,419 --> 01:55:51,429
being generous I think humans are
 

5887
01:55:51,429 --> 01:55:52,530
being generous I think humans are
actually more like twenty so that's like

5888
01:55:52,530 --> 01:55:52,540
actually more like twenty so that's like
 

5889
01:55:52,540 --> 01:55:53,669
actually more like twenty so that's like
five humans that's pretty good

5890
01:55:53,669 --> 01:55:53,679
five humans that's pretty good
 

5891
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:55,819
five humans that's pretty good
Google needs to sell their teepees um

5892
01:55:55,819 --> 01:55:55,829
Google needs to sell their teepees um
 

5893
01:55:55,829 --> 01:55:57,930
Google needs to sell their teepees um
but I could buy I could buy I could buy

5894
01:55:57,930 --> 01:55:57,940
but I could buy I could buy I could buy
 

5895
01:55:57,940 --> 01:56:00,959
but I could buy I could buy I could buy
GPUs I could buy a stack of like by 1080

5896
01:56:00,959 --> 01:56:00,969
GPUs I could buy a stack of like by 1080
 

5897
01:56:00,969 --> 01:56:04,049
GPUs I could buy a stack of like by 1080
tea eyes build data center full of them

5898
01:56:04,049 --> 01:56:04,059
tea eyes build data center full of them
 

5899
01:56:04,059 --> 01:56:06,089

four million box I can get a human worth

5900
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:06,099
four million box I can get a human worth
 

5901
01:56:06,099 --> 01:56:09,569
four million box I can get a human worth
of compute but when you look at the

5902
01:56:09,569 --> 01:56:09,579
of compute but when you look at the
 

5903
01:56:09,579 --> 01:56:12,299
of compute but when you look at the
total number of flops in the world when

5904
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:12,309
total number of flops in the world when
 

5905
01:56:12,309 --> 01:56:14,970
total number of flops in the world when
you look at human flops which goes up

5906
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:14,980
you look at human flops which goes up
 

5907
01:56:14,980 --> 01:56:16,709
you look at human flops which goes up
very very slowly with the population and

5908
01:56:16,709 --> 01:56:16,719
very very slowly with the population and
 

5909
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,720
very very slowly with the population and
machine flops which goes up

5910
01:56:18,720 --> 01:56:18,730
machine flops which goes up
 

5911
01:56:18,730 --> 01:56:21,270
machine flops which goes up
exponentially but it's still nowhere

5912
01:56:21,270 --> 01:56:21,280
exponentially but it's still nowhere
 

5913
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:24,120
exponentially but it's still nowhere
near I think that's the key thing to

5914
01:56:24,120 --> 01:56:24,130
near I think that's the key thing to
 

5915
01:56:24,130 --> 01:56:25,620
near I think that's the key thing to
talk about when the singularity happened

5916
01:56:25,620 --> 01:56:25,630
talk about when the singularity happened
 

5917
01:56:25,630 --> 01:56:28,379
talk about when the singularity happened
when most flops in the world are silicon

5918
01:56:28,379 --> 01:56:28,389
when most flops in the world are silicon
 

5919
01:56:28,389 --> 01:56:31,140
when most flops in the world are silicon
and not biological that's kind of the

5920
01:56:31,140 --> 01:56:31,150
and not biological that's kind of the
 

5921
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:32,970
and not biological that's kind of the
crossing point like they are now the

5922
01:56:32,970 --> 01:56:32,980
crossing point like they are now the
 

5923
01:56:32,980 --> 01:56:36,500
crossing point like they are now the
dominant species on the planet and just

5924
01:56:36,500 --> 01:56:36,510
dominant species on the planet and just
 

5925
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:38,700
dominant species on the planet and just
looking at how technology is progressing

5926
01:56:38,700 --> 01:56:38,710
looking at how technology is progressing
 

5927
01:56:38,710 --> 01:56:39,779
looking at how technology is progressing
when do you think that could possibly

5928
01:56:39,779 --> 01:56:39,789
when do you think that could possibly
 

5929
01:56:39,789 --> 01:56:40,169
when do you think that could possibly
happen

5930
01:56:40,169 --> 01:56:40,179
happen
 

5931
01:56:40,179 --> 01:56:41,370
happen
you think go to happen in your lifetime

5932
01:56:41,370 --> 01:56:41,380
you think go to happen in your lifetime
 

5933
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:43,799
you think go to happen in your lifetime
oh yeah definitely my lifetime I've done

5934
01:56:43,799 --> 01:56:43,809
oh yeah definitely my lifetime I've done
 

5935
01:56:43,809 --> 01:56:46,200
oh yeah definitely my lifetime I've done
the math I like 2038 because it's the

5936
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:46,210
the math I like 2038 because it's the
 

5937
01:56:46,210 --> 01:56:51,209
the math I like 2038 because it's the
UNIX timestamp rollover yeah beautifully

5938
01:56:51,209 --> 01:56:51,219
UNIX timestamp rollover yeah beautifully
 

5939
01:56:51,219 --> 01:56:52,319
UNIX timestamp rollover yeah beautifully
put

5940
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:52,329
put
 

5941
01:56:52,329 --> 01:56:56,279
put
so you've you said that the meaning of

5942
01:56:56,279 --> 01:56:56,289
so you've you said that the meaning of
 

5943
01:56:56,289 --> 01:56:58,500
so you've you said that the meaning of
life has to win if you look five years

5944
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:58,510
life has to win if you look five years
 

5945
01:56:58,510 --> 01:57:00,180
life has to win if you look five years
into the future what does winning look

5946
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:00,190
into the future what does winning look
 

5947
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:03,130
into the future what does winning look
like so

5948
01:57:03,130 --> 01:57:03,140
like so
 

5949
01:57:03,140 --> 01:57:07,040
like so

5951
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:11,000

hi there's a lot of I can go into like

5952
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:11,010
hi there's a lot of I can go into like
 

5953
01:57:11,010 --> 01:57:13,860
hi there's a lot of I can go into like
technical depth to what I mean by that

5954
01:57:13,860 --> 01:57:13,870
technical depth to what I mean by that
 

5955
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:17,010
technical depth to what I mean by that
to win um it may not mean I was

5956
01:57:17,010 --> 01:57:17,020
to win um it may not mean I was
 

5957
01:57:17,020 --> 01:57:18,330
to win um it may not mean I was
criticized for that in the comments like

5958
01:57:18,330 --> 01:57:18,340
criticized for that in the comments like
 

5959
01:57:18,340 --> 01:57:19,950
criticized for that in the comments like
doesn't this guy want to like save the

5960
01:57:19,950 --> 01:57:19,960
doesn't this guy want to like save the
 

5961
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:23,430
doesn't this guy want to like save the
penguins in Antarctica or like you know

5962
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:23,440
penguins in Antarctica or like you know
 

5963
01:57:23,440 --> 01:57:25,020
penguins in Antarctica or like you know
listen to what I'm saying I'm not

5964
01:57:25,020 --> 01:57:25,030
listen to what I'm saying I'm not
 

5965

01:57:31,180 --> 01:57:35,370
something I am an agent I am put into
this world and I don't really know what

5970
01:57:35,370 --> 01:57:35,380
this world and I don't really know what
 

5971
01:57:35,380 --> 01:57:38,220
this world and I don't really know what
my purpose is but if you're a

01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:38,230
my purpose is but if you're a
 

5973
01:57:38,230 --> 01:57:39,480
my purpose is but if you're a
reinforcement if you're if you're an

intelligent agent and you're put into a
 

5977
01:57:41,020 --> 01:57:43,350
intelligent agent and you're put into a
world what is the ideal thing to do well

5978
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
world what is the ideal thing to do well

world what is the ideal thing to do well
the ideal thing mathematically you go

5980
01:57:44,970 --> 01:57:44,980
the ideal thing mathematically you go
 

5981
01:57:44,980 --> 01:57:46,230
the ideal thing mathematically you go
back to like Schmitt Hoover theories

01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:49,480
about this is to build a compressive

01:57:49,480 --> 01:57:51,450
about this is to build a compressive

past mid Hoover has a paper about this

5994
01:58:00,090 --> 01:58:00,100
past mid Hoover has a paper about this
 

5995
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:02,340
past mid Hoover has a paper about this
and like I took that kind of as like a

5996
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:02,350
and like I took that kind of as like a
 

5997
01:58:02,350 --> 01:58:05,910
and like I took that kind of as like a
personal goal function so what I mean to

5998
01:58:05,910 --> 01:58:05,920
personal goal function so what I mean to
 

5999
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,610
personal goal function so what I mean to
win I mean like maybe maybe this is

6000
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:08,620
win I mean like maybe maybe this is
 

6001
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:10,680
win I mean like maybe maybe this is
religious but like I think that in the

6002
01:58:10,680 --> 01:58:10,690
religious but like I think that in the
 

6003
01:58:10,690 --> 01:58:12,810
religious but like I think that in the
future I might be given a real purpose

6004
01:58:12,810 --> 01:58:12,820
future I might be given a real purpose
 

6005
01:58:12,820 --> 01:58:14,580
future I might be given a real purpose
or I may decide this purpose myself and

6006
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:14,590
or I may decide this purpose myself and
 

6007
01:58:14,590 --> 01:58:16,950
or I may decide this purpose myself and
then at that point now I know what the

6008
01:58:16,950 --> 01:58:16,960
then at that point now I know what the
 

6009
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,600
then at that point now I know what the
game is and I know how to win I think

6010
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:18,610
game is and I know how to win I think
 

6011
01:58:18,610 --> 01:58:19,710
game is and I know how to win I think
right now I'm still just trying to

6012
01:58:19,710 --> 01:58:19,720
right now I'm still just trying to
 

6013
01:58:19,720 --> 01:58:21,240
right now I'm still just trying to
figure out what the game is but once I

6014
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:21,250
figure out what the game is but once I
 

6015
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:25,890
figure out what the game is but once I
know so you have you have imperfect

6016
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:25,900
know so you have you have imperfect
 

6017
01:58:25,900 --> 01:58:26,880
know so you have you have imperfect
information you have a lot of

6018
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:26,890
information you have a lot of
 

6019
01:58:26,890 --> 01:58:28,350
information you have a lot of
uncertainty about the reward function

6020
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:28,360
uncertainty about the reward function
 

6021
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,240
uncertainty about the reward function
and you're discovering it exactly the

6022
01:58:30,240 --> 01:58:30,250
and you're discovering it exactly the
 

6023
01:58:30,250 --> 01:58:31,470
and you're discovering it exactly the
purpose is that's that's the better way

6024
01:58:31,470 --> 01:58:31,480
purpose is that's that's the better way
 

6025
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,440
purpose is that's that's the better way
to put it the purpose is to maximize it

6026
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:34,450
to put it the purpose is to maximize it
 

6027
01:58:34,450 --> 01:58:37,350
to put it the purpose is to maximize it
while you have it a lot of uncertainty

6028
01:58:37,350 --> 01:58:37,360
while you have it a lot of uncertainty
 

6029
01:58:37,360 --> 01:58:38,940
while you have it a lot of uncertainty
around it and you're both reducing the

6030
01:58:38,940 --> 01:58:38,950
around it and you're both reducing the
 

6031
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:40,440
around it and you're both reducing the
uncertainty and maximizing at the same

6032
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:40,450
uncertainty and maximizing at the same
 

6033
01:58:40,450 --> 01:58:43,680
uncertainty and maximizing at the same
time yeah and so that's at the technical

6034
01:58:43,680 --> 01:58:43,690
time yeah and so that's at the technical
 

6035
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:45,960
time yeah and so that's at the technical
level what is the if you believe in the

6036
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:45,970
level what is the if you believe in the
 

6037
01:58:45,970 --> 01:58:47,490
level what is the if you believe in the
universal prior yeah

6038
01:58:47,490 --> 01:58:47,500
universal prior yeah
 

6039
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,930
universal prior yeah
what is the universal reward function

6040
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:48,940
what is the universal reward function
 

6041
01:58:48,940 --> 01:58:51,600
what is the universal reward function
that's the better way to put it so that

6042
01:58:51,600 --> 01:58:51,610
that's the better way to put it so that
 

6043
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:54,420
that's the better way to put it so that
when it's interesting I think I speak

6044
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:54,430
when it's interesting I think I speak
 

6045
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:57,750
when it's interesting I think I speak
for everyone in saying that I wonder

6046
01:58:57,750 --> 01:58:57,760
for everyone in saying that I wonder
 

6047
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,790
for everyone in saying that I wonder
what that reward function is for you and

6048
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:01,800
what that reward function is for you and
 

6049
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:05,610
what that reward function is for you and
I look forward to seeing that in five

6050
01:59:05,610 --> 01:59:05,620
I look forward to seeing that in five
 

6051
01:59:05,620 --> 01:59:07,590
I look forward to seeing that in five
years in ten years I think a lot of

6052
01:59:07,590 --> 01:59:07,600
years in ten years I think a lot of
 

6053
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:09,240
years in ten years I think a lot of
people who do myself right and cheering

6054
01:59:09,240 --> 01:59:09,250
people who do myself right and cheering
 

6055
01:59:09,250 --> 01:59:11,640
people who do myself right and cheering
you on man so I'm I'm a happy you exist

and I wish you the best of luck thanks
for talking today man

6060
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:15,310
for talking today man
 

6061
01:59:15,310 --> 01:59:23,870
for talking today man
thank you this is a lot of fun

6062
01:59:23,870 --> 01:59:23,880
