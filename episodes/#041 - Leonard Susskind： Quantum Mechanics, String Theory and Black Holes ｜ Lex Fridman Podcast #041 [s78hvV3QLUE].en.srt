but I saw somebody who was actually

intuitive and while I don't think he

90
00:01:56,929 --> 00:01:56,939
intuitive and while I don't think he
 

91
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:59,779
intuitive and while I don't think he
changed my way of thinking I do think he

92
00:01:59,779 --> 00:01:59,789
changed my way of thinking I do think he
 

93
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,570
changed my way of thinking I do think he
validated it he made me look at it and

94
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:02,580
validated it he made me look at it and
 

95
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,880

say yeah that's something you can do and

96
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:04,890

with it
so do you find yourself whether you're

102
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:11,730
so do you find yourself whether you're
 

103
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,220
so do you find yourself whether you're
thinking about quantum mechanics or

104
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:13,230
thinking about quantum mechanics or
 

105
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,460
thinking about quantum mechanics or
black holes or string theory using

106
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:16,470
black holes or string theory using
 

107
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,940

throughout using visualization yeah very

110
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,440
throughout using visualization yeah very
 

111
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,420
throughout using visualization yeah very
much so very much so I tend not to think

112
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:26,430
much so very much so I tend not to think
 

113
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,670
much so very much so I tend not to think
about the equations I tend not to think

114
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:28,680
about the equations I tend not to think
 

115
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,610
about the equations I tend not to think
about the symbols I tend to try to

116
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:31,620
about the symbols I tend to try to
 

117
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,069
about the symbols I tend to try to
visualize the phenomena themselves and

118
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:34,079
visualize the phenomena themselves and
 

119
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,099
visualize the phenomena themselves and
then when I get an insight that I think

120
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:37,109
then when I get an insight that I think
 

121
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:39,559
then when I get an insight that I think
is valid I might try to convert it to

122
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:39,569
is valid I might try to convert it to
 

123
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:42,020
is valid I might try to convert it to
mathematics but I'm not a math and then

124
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,030
mathematics but I'm not a math and then
 

125
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:44,690
mathematics but I'm not a math and then
a natural mathematician or I'm good

126
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:44,700
a natural mathematician or I'm good
 

127
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,300
a natural mathematician or I'm good
enough at it I'm good enough at it but

128
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,310
enough at it I'm good enough at it but
 

129
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,390
enough at it I'm good enough at it but
I'm not a great mathematician so for me

130
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm not a great mathematician so for me
 

131
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,520
I'm not a great mathematician so for me
the way of thinking about physics is

132
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:52,530
the way of thinking about physics is
 

133
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,160
the way of thinking about physics is
first intuitive first visualization

and yet you've worked very

144
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:09,420
and yet you've worked very
 

145
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,349
and yet you've worked very
counterintuitive ideas so how that's

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:12,359
counterintuitive ideas so how that's
 

147
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:14,629
counterintuitive ideas so how that's

I can't even visualize two dimensions or

if I want to visualize a line I think of
 

237
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,920
if I want to visualize a line I think of

the line as being aligned in three

the two dimension the four dimensions
 

253
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,490
the two dimension the four dimensions
the five dimensions and I don't think

the five dimensions and I don't think
 

255
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,010
the five dimensions and I don't think
that's ever gonna happen the reason is I

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,020
that's ever gonna happen the reason is I

00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,230
that's ever gonna happen the reason is I
think our neural wiring is just set up

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
think our neural wiring is just set up
 

259
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,220
think our neural wiring is just set up
for that on the other hand we do learn

260
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,230
for that on the other hand we do learn
 

261
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,250
for that on the other hand we do learn
ways to think about five six seven

262
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:51,260
ways to think about five six seven
 

263
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,150
ways to think about five six seven
dimensions and we learn ways we learn

264
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
dimensions and we learn ways we learn
 

265
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,310
dimensions and we learn ways we learn
mathematical ways and we learn ways to

266
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:57,320
mathematical ways and we learn ways to
 

267
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,040
mathematical ways and we learn ways to
visualize them but they're different and

268
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,050
visualize them but they're different and
 

269
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:04,090
visualize them but they're different and
so yeah I think I think we do rewire

270
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,100
so yeah I think I think we do rewire
 

271
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,650
so yeah I think I think we do rewire
ourselves whether we can ever completely

272
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:05,660
ourselves whether we can ever completely
 

273
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,990
ourselves whether we can ever completely
rewire ourselves to be completely

274
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
rewire ourselves to be completely
 

275
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,770
rewire ourselves to be completely
comfortable with these concepts I doubt

276
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:10,780
comfortable with these concepts I doubt
 

277
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,630
comfortable with these concepts I doubt
so that it's completely natural there

278
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:13,640
so that it's completely natural there
 

279
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,190
so that it's completely natural there
was a tour it's completely natural so

280
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,200
was a tour it's completely natural so
 

281
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,740
was a tour it's completely natural so
I'm sure there's some what you could

282
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:17,750
I'm sure there's some what you could
 

283
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm sure there's some what you could
argue creatures that live in it

284
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,180
argue creatures that live in it
 

285
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:23,580
argue creatures that live in it
two-dimensional space yeah and there are

286
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:23,590
two-dimensional space yeah and there are
 

287
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,880
two-dimensional space yeah and there are
and um well it's romanticizing the

288
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:27,890
and um well it's romanticizing the
 

289
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,560
and um well it's romanticizing the
notion of course we're all living as far

290
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:29,570
notion of course we're all living as far
 

291
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,030
notion of course we're all living as far
as we know in three-dimensional space

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,040
as we know in three-dimensional space
 

293
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,160
as we know in three-dimensional space
but how do you how do those creatures

294
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,170
but how do you how do those creatures
 

295
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:36,430
but how do you how do those creatures
imagine 3d space well probably the way

296
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:36,440
imagine 3d space well probably the way
 

297
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,890
imagine 3d space well probably the way
we imagined 4d by using some mathematics

298
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:38,900
we imagined 4d by using some mathematics
 

299
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:43,680
we imagined 4d by using some mathematics
and some equations and some some tricks

307
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,120

what do you think ego is powerful or

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,130
what do you think ego is powerful or
 

309
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:01,390
what do you think ego is powerful or
dangerous in science I think both both

humility to know that you're very likely

326
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,090
humility to know that you're very likely
 

327
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,620
humility to know that you're very likely
to be wrong on any given occasion

328
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:28,630
to be wrong on any given occasion
 

329
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,520
to be wrong on any given occasion
everything you're thinking could

330
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,530
everything you're thinking could

along and say things you won't
 

335
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,690
along and say things you won't
understand and you'll be lost and

336
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:37,700
understand and you'll be lost and
 

337
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,780
understand and you'll be lost and
flabbergasted so I think it's a

338
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:40,790
flabbergasted so I think it's a
 

339
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,470
flabbergasted so I think it's a
combination of both you better recognize

340
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:43,480
combination of both you better recognize
 

341
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,140
combination of both you better recognize
that you're very limited and you better

342
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,150
that you're very limited and you better
 

343
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:49,810
that you're very limited and you better
be able to say to yourself I'm not so

344
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:49,820
be able to say to yourself I'm not so
 

345
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,610
be able to say to yourself I'm not so
limited that I can't win this battle

346
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:51,620
limited that I can't win this battle

could speak a little bit to this sense
 

415
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:32,230
could speak a little bit to this sense
of what is academia for because I do

a lot of academia what how have you
 

429
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,990
a lot of academia what how have you
joined this Orchestra how do you think

430
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,000
joined this Orchestra how do you think
 

431
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,680
joined this Orchestra how do you think
about it

432

about it
I don't know that I thought about it as

I don't know that I thought about it as
 

435
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,170
I don't know that I thought about it as
much as I just felt it yeah you know

436
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,180
much as I just felt it yeah you know
 

437
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:01,780
much as I just felt it yeah you know
thinking is one thing feeling is another

442
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,120
certain age when I suddenly found myself
 

443
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,720
certain age when I suddenly found myself
the ultimate insider in academic physics

444
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:12,730
the ultimate insider in academic physics
 

445
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:18,400
the ultimate insider in academic physics
and that was a sharp transition in the

446
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:18,410
and that was a sharp transition in the
 

447
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,810
and that was a sharp transition in the

quite it was a phase transition you were
 

453
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,520
quite it was a phase transition you were
never quite free milk in the middle yeah

my approach to mathematics was different
 

465
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:47,290

very much the center of maybe not the
only one at the center but certainly one

only one at the center but certainly one
 

481
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,299
only one at the center but certainly one

the factoring problem in a short time so
 

751
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:35,720
the factoring problem in a short time so
though and those problems seem to be

00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:35,730
though and those problems seem to be
 

753
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,320
though and those problems seem to be
extremely special rare and it's not

754
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:39,330
extremely special rare and it's not
 

755
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:41,149
extremely special rare and it's not
clear to me that there's gonna be a lot

turning out to be Applied Sciences as
 

771
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,630
turning out to be Applied Sciences as
well as very fundamental Sciences so we

772
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
well as very fundamental Sciences so we
 

773
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,120
well as very fundamental Sciences so we
probably will run out of the ability to

774
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,130
probably will run out of the ability to
 

775
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:07,850
probably will run out of the ability to
solve equations for these things you

776
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:07,860
solve equations for these things you
 

777
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,440
solve equations for these things you
know solve equations by the standard

778
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:09,450
know solve equations by the standard
 

779
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,899

781
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:14,539

00:18:14,539 --> 00:18:14,549
the equations by the method of classical
 

783
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:17,720

computers and so what we'll do is we'll

784
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:17,730
computers and so what we'll do is we'll
 

785
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,200
computers and so what we'll do is we'll
build versions of these systems run them

786
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,210
build versions of these systems run them
 

787
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,330
build versions of these systems run them
and run them under controlled

788
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:23,340
and run them under controlled
 

789
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,250
and run them under controlled
circumstances or we can change them

790
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,260
circumstances or we can change them
 

791
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,680
circumstances or we can change them
manipulate them make measurements on

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:27,690
manipulate them make measurements on
 

793
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,510
manipulate them make measurements on
them and find out all the things we want

794
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
them and find out all the things we want
 

795
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:29,899
them and find out all the things we want
to know

to know
 

797
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,480
to know
so in finding out the things we want to

798
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:32,490
so in finding out the things we want to
 

799
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:36,620
so in finding out the things we want to
know about very small systems right now

800
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:36,630
know about very small systems right now
 

801
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:39,560
know about very small systems right now

as I said earlier I think when we do

1009
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:05,260
think we I think we get it wrong I'm
pretty sure we get it wrong everything

00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:05,270
pretty sure we get it wrong everything

I've heard about the way the brain

1012
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:06,590
I've heard about the way the brain
 

1013
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:09,910
I've heard about the way the brain
functions is so counterintuitive for

functions is so counterintuitive for
 

1015
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,820

1017
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,070

imagined that there were whole circuits

1024
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:21,740
imagined that there were whole circuits
 

1025
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,800
imagined that there were whole circuits
which were devoted to vertical lines in

the brain yeah doesn't seem to we where

1028
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:26,300
the brain yeah doesn't seem to we where
 

1029
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,810
the brain yeah doesn't seem to we where
when my brain works my brain seems to

1030
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:28,820
when my brain works my brain seems to
 

1031
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,300
when my brain works my brain seems to
work put my finger up vertically or if I

1032
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:31,310
work put my finger up vertically or if I
 

1033
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,710
work put my finger up vertically or if I
put it horizontally or if I put it this

1034
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
put it horizontally or if I put it this
 

1035
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,000
put it horizontally or if I put it this
way or that way it seems to me it's the

1036
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,010
way or that way it seems to me it's the
 

1037
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,550
way or that way it seems to me it's the
same the same circuits that are it's not

1038
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:36,560
same the same circuits that are it's not
 

1039
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,490

the way it works the way the brain is

1040
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:39,500
the way it works the way the brain is
 

1041
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,700
the way it works the way the brain is
compartmentalized seems to be very very

1042
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:42,710
compartmentalized seems to be very very
 

1043
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:44,650
compartmentalized seems to be very very
different than what I would have

1044
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:44,660
different than what I would have
 

1045
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,460
different than what I would have
imagined

1046
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:45,470
imagined
 

1047
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,610
imagined
if I were just doing psychological

1048
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:48,620
if I were just doing psychological

introspection about how things work my

1050
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,070
introspection about how things work my
 

1051
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,550
introspection about how things work my
conclusion is that we won't get it right

1052
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:54,560
conclusion is that we won't get it right
 

1053
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,950
conclusion is that we won't get it right
that way but how will we get it right I

1054
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
that way but how will we get it right I
 

1055
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,320
that way but how will we get it right I
think maybe computer scientists will get

1056
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,330
think maybe computer scientists will get
 

1057
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,640
think maybe computer scientists will get
it right eventually I don't think that

1058
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:03,650
it right eventually I don't think that
 

1059
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,840
it right eventually I don't think that
any ways near it I don't even think

1060
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:04,850
any ways near it I don't even think
 

1061
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:06,970
any ways near it I don't even think
they're thinking about it but by

1062
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:06,980
they're thinking about it but by
 

1063
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,980
they're thinking about it but by
computer eventually we will build

1064
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:08,990
computer eventually we will build
 

1065
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:12,550
computer eventually we will build
machines perhaps which are complicated

1066
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:12,560
machines perhaps which are complicated
 

1067
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,529
machines perhaps which are complicated
enough

1068
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:14,539
enough
 

1069
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:18,219
enough
and partly engineered partly evolved

1070
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:18,229
and partly engineered partly evolved
 

1071
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,680
and partly engineered partly evolved
maybe evolved by machine learning and so

1072
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:20,690
maybe evolved by machine learning and so
 

1073
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:21,939
maybe evolved by machine learning and so
forth this machine learning is very

1074
00:24:21,939 --> 00:24:21,949
forth this machine learning is very
 

1075
00:24:21,949 --> 00:24:24,699
forth this machine learning is very
interesting by machine learning will

1076
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:24,709
interesting by machine learning will
 

1077
00:24:24,709 --> 00:24:25,749
interesting by machine learning will
evolve systems

1078
00:24:25,749 --> 00:24:25,759
evolve systems
 

1079
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,519
evolve systems
and we may start to discover mechanisms

1080
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:29,529
and we may start to discover mechanisms
 

1081
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:34,659
and we may start to discover mechanisms
that that have implications for how we

1082
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:34,669
that that have implications for how we
 

1083
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,699
that that have implications for how we
think and for what what does

1084
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:36,709
think and for what what does
 

1085
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,129

consciousness thing is all about and

1086
00:24:39,129 --> 00:24:39,139
consciousness thing is all about and
 

1087
00:24:39,139 --> 00:24:41,379
consciousness thing is all about and
we'll be able to do experiments on them

1088
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:41,389
we'll be able to do experiments on them
 

1089
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:45,669
we'll be able to do experiments on them
and perhaps answer questions that we

1090
00:24:45,669 --> 00:24:45,679
and perhaps answer questions that we
 

1091
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,219
and perhaps answer questions that we
can't possibly answer by by

1092
00:24:48,219 --> 00:24:48,229
can't possibly answer by by
 

1093
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,349
can't possibly answer by by
introspection so that's a really

1094
00:24:50,349 --> 00:24:50,359
introspection so that's a really
 

1095
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,689
introspection so that's a really
interesting point you've in many cases

1096
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:52,699
interesting point you've in many cases
 

1097
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,359
interesting point you've in many cases
if you look even at string theory when

1098
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:55,369
if you look even at string theory when
 

1099
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,979
if you look even at string theory when
you first think about a system it seems

1100
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:56,989
you first think about a system it seems
 

1101
00:24:56,989 --> 00:24:58,689
you first think about a system it seems
really complicated like the human brain

1102
00:24:58,689 --> 00:24:58,699
really complicated like the human brain
 

1103
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:02,589
really complicated like the human brain
and through some basic reasoning then

1104
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:02,599
and through some basic reasoning then
 

1105
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:05,009
and through some basic reasoning then
trying to discover a fundamental

00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:05,019
trying to discover a fundamental
 

1107
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,629
trying to discover a fundamental
low-level behavior of the system you

1108
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:07,639
low-level behavior of the system you
 

1109
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:09,359
low-level behavior of the system you
find out that it's actually much simpler

1110
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:09,369
find out that it's actually much simpler
 

1111
00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:12,430
find out that it's actually much simpler
you one have you you know is that

1112
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,440
you one have you you know is that
 

1113
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,109
you one have you you know is that
generally the process and to do you have

that also hope for biological systems as

00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:17,539
that also hope for biological systems as

00:25:17,539 --> 00:25:20,079
that also hope for biological systems as
well for all the kinds of stuff we're

well for all the kinds of stuff we're

00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,969
well for all the kinds of stuff we're

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
system do that and and I am as puzzled
 

1673
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,010

as anybody there's echoes of it in the

1676
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:52,480
observer effect yeah so do you
 

1677
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,970
observer effect yeah so do you
understand what it means to be an

1678
00:37:53,970 --> 00:37:53,980
understand what it means to be an
 

1679
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,970
understand what it means to be an

00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,940
enough degrees of freedom that it can

just look at it it becomes physically

00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:20,230
just look at it it becomes physically
 

1699
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,930
just look at it it becomes physically
entangled with it and it's that

00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:21,940
entangled with it and it's that

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:29,030
now does that satisfy me personally as
 

1707
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:33,400
now does that satisfy me personally as
an observer hmm yes and no I find it

1708
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,410
an observer hmm yes and no I find it
 

1709
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:34,810
an observer hmm yes and no I find it
very satisfying that we have a

1712
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:37,010
mathematical representation of what it
 

1713
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:40,570
mathematical representation of what it
means to observe a system you are

1714
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:40,580
means to observe a system you are
 

1715
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,190
means to observe a system you are
observing stuff right now

1716
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,200
observing stuff right now
 

1717
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,470
observing stuff right now
yeah the conscious level right is you

1718
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:44,480
yeah the conscious level right is you
 

1719
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,410
yeah the conscious level right is you
think there's echoes of that kind of

00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,420
think there's echoes of that kind of
 

1721
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,600
think there's echoes of that kind of
entanglement in our macro scale yes

1722
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:49,610
entanglement in our macro scale yes
 

1723
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,410
entanglement in our macro scale yes
absolutely for sure we're entangled with

00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:32,320
comfortable with that arrow do you think
time is an emergent phenomena or is it's

1754
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:32,330
time is an emergent phenomena or is it's
 

1755
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,560
time is an emergent phenomena or is it's
fundamental to nature that is a big

1756
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:35,570
fundamental to nature that is a big
 

1757
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,960
fundamental to nature that is a big
question in physics right now all the

1758
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:37,970
question in physics right now all the
 

1759
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,290
question in physics right now all the
physics that we do or at least that the

00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:41,300
physics that we do or at least that the

00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:42,860
people that I am comfortable with
 

1763
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:48,540
people that I am comfortable with
talking to my my friends yeah my friends

1764
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:48,550
talking to my my friends yeah my friends
 

1765
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,830
talking to my my friends yeah my friends
no we all ask the same question that you

1766
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:50,840
no we all ask the same question that you
 

1767
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,230
no we all ask the same question that you
just asked in space we have a pretty

1768
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:53,240
just asked in space we have a pretty
 

1769
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,140
just asked in space we have a pretty
good idea is emergent and it emerges out

1770
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,150
good idea is emergent and it emerges out
 

1771
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,050
good idea is emergent and it emerges out
of tan tangle mint and other other

00:39:59,050 --> 00:39:59,060
of tan tangle mint and other other
 

1773

1779
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,020

bit by Einstein would have called time

1782
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:10,540
bit by Einstein would have called time
 

1783
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:16,150
bit by Einstein would have called time
and and mostly in our equations it is

1784
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:16,160
and and mostly in our equations it is
 

1785
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,350
and and mostly in our equations it is
not emergent time in physics is

1786
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:20,360
not emergent time in physics is
 

1787
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,060
not emergent time in physics is
completely symmetric forward and

00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,690
completely symmetric forward and
bathymetric so you don't really need to

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:25,700
bathymetric so you don't really need to
 

1791
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,670
bathymetric so you don't really need to
think about the area of time for most

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
think about the area of time for most

little sub structures okay so it's not
 

1821
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:09,299

we understand it yeah I think I think we
 

1827
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,559
we understand it yeah I think I think we
understand better than most people think

understand better than most people think
 

1829

it it's just a statistical idea the you

1834
00:41:23,999 --> 00:41:24,009
it it's just a statistical idea the you
 

1835
00:41:24,009 --> 00:41:25,710
it it's just a statistical idea the you
mean like second law thermodynamics

1836

1839
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:29,640

and you're flinging it in the air and

1840
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:29,650
and you're flinging it in the air and
 

1841
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,799
and you're flinging it in the air and
you look what happens to it yeah but

1842
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:31,809
you look what happens to it yeah but
 

1843
00:41:31,809 --> 00:41:33,779
you look what happens to it yeah but
what's random we understand it doesn't

1844
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:33,789
what's random we understand it doesn't

what's random we understand it doesn't
go from random to simple it goes from

00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:36,609
go from random to simple it goes from
 

1847
00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:39,690
go from random to simple it goes from
simple to random but do you think it

1848
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:39,700
simple to random but do you think it
 

1849
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:43,319
simple to random but do you think it
ever breaks down what I think you can do

1850
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:43,329
ever breaks down what I think you can do
 

1851
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:46,769
ever breaks down what I think you can do
is in a laboratory setting you can take

1852
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:46,779
is in a laboratory setting you can take
 

1853
00:41:46,779 --> 00:41:48,569
is in a laboratory setting you can take
a system which is somewhere intermediate

1854
00:41:48,569 --> 00:41:48,579
a system which is somewhere intermediate
 

1855
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:53,420
a system which is somewhere intermediate
between being small and being large and

00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:53,430
between being small and being large and
 

1857
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:56,609
between being small and being large and
make it go backward a thing which looks

1858
00:41:56,609 --> 00:41:56,619
make it go backward a thing which looks
 

1859
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,849
make it go backward a thing which looks
like it only wants to go forward because

1860
00:41:59,849 --> 00:41:59,859
like it only wants to go forward because
 

1861
00:41:59,859 --> 00:42:01,380
like it only wants to go forward because
of statistical mechanical reasons

1862
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:01,390
of statistical mechanical reasons
 

1863
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,739
of statistical mechanical reasons
because of the second law you can very

1864
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:04,749
because of the second law you can very
 

1865
00:42:04,749 --> 00:42:07,589
because of the second law you can very
very carefully manipulate it to make it

1866
00:42:07,589 --> 00:42:07,599
very carefully manipulate it to make it
 

1867
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,049
very carefully manipulate it to make it
run backward I don't think you can take

1868
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:10,059
run backward I don't think you can take
 

1869
00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:11,999
run backward I don't think you can take
an egg Humpty Dumpty who fell on the

an egg Humpty Dumpty who fell on the
 

1871
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,660
an egg Humpty Dumpty who fell on the
floor yeah and reverse that but you can

1872
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,670
floor yeah and reverse that but you can
 

1873
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:18,809
floor yeah and reverse that but you can
in a very controlled situation you can

1874
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:18,819
in a very controlled situation you can
 

1875
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,700
in a very controlled situation you can
take systems which appear to be evolving

1876
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:22,710
take systems which appear to be evolving
 

1877
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:25,799
take systems which appear to be evolving

what's the intuition behind that how do

1882
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:30,999
what's the intuition behind that how do
 

1883
00:42:30,999 --> 00:42:32,910
what's the intuition behind that how do
how do we do that how do we reverse it a

00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:32,920
how do we do that how do we reverse it a

how do we do that how do we reverse it a
clue you're saying closed system yeah

1886
00:42:35,729 --> 00:42:35,739
clue you're saying closed system yeah
 

1887
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:38,609
clue you're saying closed system yeah
pretty much closed system yes did you

1888
00:42:38,609 --> 00:42:38,619
pretty much closed system yes did you
 

1889
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:41,729
pretty much closed system yes did you
just say that time travel is possible no

1890
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:41,739
just say that time travel is possible no
 

1891
00:42:41,739 --> 00:42:43,680
just say that time travel is possible no
I didn't say time travel is possible I

1892
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:43,690
I didn't say time travel is possible I
 

1893
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:45,720
I didn't say time travel is possible I
said you can make a system go backward

1894
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:45,730
said you can make a system go backward
 

1895
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,789
said you can make a system go backward
in time and you don't like it go back

1896
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:47,799
in time and you don't like it go back
 

1897
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,680
in time and you don't like it go back
you can make it reverse it steps you can

1898
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:49,690
you can make it reverse it steps you can
 

1899
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,620
you can make it reverse it steps you can
make it reverse its trajectory yeah how

1900
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:52,630
make it reverse its trajectory yeah how
 

1901
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:54,779
make it reverse its trajectory yeah how
do we do what's the intuition there does

1902
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:54,789
do we do what's the intuition there does
 

1903
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:58,530
do we do what's the intuition there does
it have is it just a fluke thing

1904
00:42:58,530 --> 00:42:58,540
it have is it just a fluke thing
 

1905
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,150
it have is it just a fluke thing
that we can do at a small scale in the

1906
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:00,160
that we can do at a small scale in the
 

1907
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,130
that we can do at a small scale in the
lab that doesn't have what I'm saying is

00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:32,100
error because the tiniest errors will
get magnified and you'll simply not be

2064
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:32,110
get magnified and you'll simply not be
 

2065
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,460
get magnified and you'll simply not be
able to do the reversal so yeah you

2066
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:35,470
able to do the reversal so yeah you
 

2067
00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:37,470
able to do the reversal so yeah you
could that but I wouldn't call that time

2068
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:37,480
could that but I wouldn't call that time
 

2069
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,900
could that but I wouldn't call that time
travel yeah that's something else but if

2070
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:39,910
travel yeah that's something else but if
 

2071
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,870
travel yeah that's something else but if
you think think of it it just made me

2072
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:42,880
you think think of it it just made me
 

2073
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,200
you think think of it it just made me
think if we think the unrolling of state

2074
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:46,210
think if we think the unrolling of state
 

2075
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:51,930
think if we think the unrolling of state
that's happening as a program if we look

2076
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:51,940
that's happening as a program if we look
 

2077
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,870
that's happening as a program if we look
at the world so the idea of looking at

2078
00:46:54,870 --> 00:46:54,880
at the world so the idea of looking at
 

2079
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,250
at the world so the idea of looking at
the world as a simulation as a computer

2080
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:58,260
the world as a simulation as a computer
 

2081
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,810
the world as a simulation as a computer
but it's not a computer it's just a

2082
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:00,820
but it's not a computer it's just a
 

2083
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,830
but it's not a computer it's just a
single program a question arises that

2084
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:04,840
single program a question arises that
 

2085
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:07,970
single program a question arises that
might be useful how how hard is it to

2086
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:07,980
might be useful how how hard is it to
 

2087
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:10,680
might be useful how how hard is it to
have a computer that runs the universe

2088
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:10,690
have a computer that runs the universe
 

2089
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:16,260
have a computer that runs the universe
okay so there are mathematical universes

2090
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:16,270
okay so there are mathematical universes
 

2091
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,610
okay so there are mathematical universes
that we know about one of them is called

2092
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:20,620
that we know about one of them is called
 

2093
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,520
that we know about one of them is called
anti de sitter space where we

2094
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:25,530
anti de sitter space where we
 

2095
00:47:25,530 --> 00:47:28,700
anti de sitter space where we
and it's quantum mechanics well I think

2096
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:28,710
and it's quantum mechanics well I think
 

2097
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,360
and it's quantum mechanics well I think
we could simulate it in a computer and a

2098
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:32,370
we could simulate it in a computer and a
 

2099
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:35,090
we could simulate it in a computer and a
quantum computer classical computer all

2100
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:35,100
quantum computer classical computer all
 

2101
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,650
quantum computer classical computer all
you can do is solve its equations you

2102
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:36,660
you can do is solve its equations you
 

2103
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,210
you can do is solve its equations you
can't make it work like the real system

2104
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:38,220
can't make it work like the real system
 

2105
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,640
can't make it work like the real system
if we could build a quantum computer or

2106
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:40,650
if we could build a quantum computer or
 

2107
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:43,580
if we could build a quantum computer or
big enough one robust enough one we

2108
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:43,590
big enough one robust enough one we
 

2109
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:49,300
big enough one robust enough one we
could probably simulate a universe a

2110
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:49,310
could probably simulate a universe a
 

2111
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:52,040
could probably simulate a universe a
small version of an anti-de sitter

2112
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:52,050
small version of an anti-de sitter
 

2113
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:54,350
small version of an anti-de sitter
universe and that the sitter is a kind

2114
00:47:54,350 --> 00:47:54,360
universe and that the sitter is a kind
 

2115
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:58,550
universe and that the sitter is a kind
of cosmology so I think we know how to

2116
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
of cosmology so I think we know how to
 

2117
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,400
of cosmology so I think we know how to
do that the trouble is the universe that

2118
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:01,410
do that the trouble is the universe that
 

2119
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:03,860
do that the trouble is the universe that
we live in is not the anti-de sitter

2120
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:03,870
we live in is not the anti-de sitter
 

2121
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:07,340
we live in is not the anti-de sitter
geometry it's the decent or geometry and

2122
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:07,350
geometry it's the decent or geometry and
 

2123
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,350
geometry it's the decent or geometry and
we don't really understand the quantum

2124
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:09,360
we don't really understand the quantum
 

2125
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,990
we don't really understand the quantum
mechanics at all so at the present time

2126
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
mechanics at all so at the present time
 

2127
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,490
mechanics at all so at the present time
I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest

2128
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:13,500
I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest
 

2129
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,710
I would say we wouldn't have the vaguest
idea how to simulate a universe similar

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:15,720
idea how to simulate a universe similar
 

2131
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,710
idea how to simulate a universe similar
to our own you know we could ask oh we

2132
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
to our own you know we could ask oh we
 

2133
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,620
to our own you know we could ask oh we
could we build in the laboratory a small

2134
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:21,630
could we build in the laboratory a small
 

2135
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:27,770
could we build in the laboratory a small
version a quantum mechanical version the

2136
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:27,780

scale yes if you were anti de sitter

2146
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:41,760

2149
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:47,270

you a slightly describe the sitter space

2150
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:47,280
you a slightly describe the sitter space
 

2151
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,090
you a slightly describe the sitter space
and anti-de sitter space yeah what are

2152
00:48:50,090 --> 00:48:50,100
and anti-de sitter space yeah what are
 

2153
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,560
and anti-de sitter space yeah what are
the geometric properties of big

2154
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:51,570
the geometric properties of big
 

2155

the geometric properties of big
different they differ by a this is the

you can think of as an isolated system

2168
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:10,410
you can think of as an isolated system
 

2169
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,840
you can think of as an isolated system
in a box with reflecting walls you could

2170
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:14,850
in a box with reflecting walls you could
 

2171
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:16,820
in a box with reflecting walls you could
think of it as a system of quantum

2172

think of it as a system of quantum
 

2173
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,490
think of it as a system of quantum

00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:24,090
the one we really live in and that's the
 

2179
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:26,530
the one we really live in and that's the
one that's exponentially expanding

2185
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:36,020
whatever you want to call it and we
don't understand that mathematically do

don't understand that mathematically do
 

2187
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:37,640
don't understand that mathematically do
we understand not everybody would agree

00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:37,650
we understand not everybody would agree
 

2189
00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:39,349
we understand not everybody would agree
with me but I don't understand

2190
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:39,359
with me but I don't understand
 

2191
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,059
with me but I don't understand
they would agree with me they definitely

2192
00:49:41,059 --> 00:49:41,069
they would agree with me they definitely
 

2193
00:49:41,069 --> 00:49:42,259
they would agree with me they definitely
would agree with me that I don't

2194
00:49:42,259 --> 00:49:42,269
would agree with me that I don't
 

2195
00:49:42,269 --> 00:49:43,899
would agree with me that I don't
understand it

2196
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:43,909
understand it
 

2197
00:49:43,909 --> 00:49:47,299
understand it
what about their an understanding of the

2198
00:49:47,299 --> 00:49:47,309
what about their an understanding of the
 

2199
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:50,509
what about their an understanding of the
birth the origin no the bing bang so

2200
00:49:50,509 --> 00:49:50,519
birth the origin no the bing bang so
 

2201
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:53,359
birth the origin no the bing bang so
knows what normally theories there are

2202
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:53,369
knows what normally theories there are
 

2203
00:49:53,369 --> 00:49:57,079
knows what normally theories there are
theories my favorite is the one called

2204
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:57,089
theories my favorite is the one called
 

2205
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,079
theories my favorite is the one called
eternal inflation the infinity can be on

2206
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:00,089
eternal inflation the infinity can be on
 

2207
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:01,789
eternal inflation the infinity can be on
both sides on one of the sides and none

2208
00:50:01,789 --> 00:50:01,799
both sides on one of the sides and none
 

2209
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:04,870
both sides on one of the sides and none
of the sides so what my real opinion

2210
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:04,880
of the sides so what my real opinion
 

2211
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,030
of the sides so what my real opinion
okay

2212
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040

 

2213
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,260

infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah

2214
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:14,270
infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah
 

2215
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,600
infinity on both sides oh boy yeah yeah
that's why is that your favorite because

2216
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:16,610
that's why is that your favorite because
 

2217
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:21,670
that's why is that your favorite because
it's the the most just mind-blowing no

2218
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
it's the the most just mind-blowing no
 

2219
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,190
it's the the most just mind-blowing no
because we want a beginning no why do we

2220
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:24,200
because we want a beginning no why do we
 

2221
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:27,550
because we want a beginning no why do we
want a beginning I practiced it was the

2222
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:27,560
want a beginning I practiced it was the
 

2223
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,110
want a beginning I practiced it was the
beginning of course and practice it was

2224
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:29,120
beginning of course and practice it was
 

2225
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:34,740
beginning of course and practice it was
a beginning but could it have been a

2226
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:34,750
a beginning but could it have been a
 

2227
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:37,480
a beginning but could it have been a
random fluctuation in an otherwise

2228
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:37,490
random fluctuation in an otherwise
 

2229
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:42,100
random fluctuation in an otherwise
infinite time maybe in any case the the

2230
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,110
infinite time maybe in any case the the
 

2231
00:50:42,110 --> 00:50:44,890
infinite time maybe in any case the the
eternal inflation theory

2232
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:44,900
eternal inflation theory
 

2233
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:47,410
eternal inflation theory
I think if correctly understood it would

2234
00:50:47,410 --> 00:50:47,420
I think if correctly understood it would
 

2235
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,860
I think if correctly understood it would
be infinite in both directions how do

2236
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:50,870
be infinite in both directions how do
 

2237
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:53,500
be infinite in both directions how do
you think about infinity Oh God

2238
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:53,510
you think about infinity Oh God
 

2239
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:56,470
you think about infinity Oh God
so okay of course you can think about

2240
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:56,480
so okay of course you can think about
 

2241
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,390
so okay of course you can think about
mathematically I just finished this I

2242
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,400
mathematically I just finished this I
 

2243
00:50:58,400 --> 00:50:59,830
mathematically I just finished this I
just finished this discussion with my

2244
00:50:59,830 --> 00:50:59,840
just finished this discussion with my
 

2245
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,930
just finished this discussion with my
friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think

2246
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:01,940
friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think
 

2247
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,180
friend Sergey Brin yes how do you think
about infinity I say well Sergey Brin is

2248
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:04,190
about infinity I say well Sergey Brin is
 

2249
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,470
about infinity I say well Sergey Brin is
infinitely rich how do you test that

2250
00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:08,480
infinitely rich how do you test that
 

2251
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:13,300
infinitely rich how do you test that
hypothesis okay essential good lines all

2252
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:13,310
hypothesis okay essential good lines all
 

2253
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:16,570
hypothesis okay essential good lines all
right yeah so there's no there's really

2254
00:51:16,570 --> 00:51:16,580
right yeah so there's no there's really
 

2255
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:18,370
right yeah so there's no there's really
no way to visualize some of these things

2256
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:18,380
no way to visualize some of these things
 

2257
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:21,670
no way to visualize some of these things
like ya know this is a very good

2258
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:21,680
like ya know this is a very good
 

2259
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:24,790
like ya know this is a very good
question those physics have any is does

2260
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
question those physics have any is does
 

2261
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,520
question those physics have any is does
infinity have any place in physics right

2262
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:27,530
infinity have any place in physics right
 

2263
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,900
infinity have any place in physics right
right and well I can say is very good

2264
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:31,910
right and well I can say is very good
 

2265
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,040
right and well I can say is very good
question

2266
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:35,050

 

2267
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,740

so what do you think of the recent first

2268
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:38,750
so what do you think of the recent first
 

2269
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:40,750
so what do you think of the recent first
image of a black hole visualized from

2270
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:40,760
image of a black hole visualized from
 

2271
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,580
image of a black hole visualized from
the event horizon telescope it

2272
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:42,590
the event horizon telescope it
 

2273
00:51:42,590 --> 00:51:45,760
the event horizon telescope it
it's an incredible triumph of science in

2274
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:45,770
it's an incredible triumph of science in
 

2275
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,170
it's an incredible triumph of science in
itself the fact that there are black

2276
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:47,180
itself the fact that there are black
 

2277
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,330
itself the fact that there are black
holes which collide is not a surprise

2278
00:51:49,330 --> 00:51:49,340
holes which collide is not a surprise
 

2279
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:52,900
holes which collide is not a surprise
and they seem to work exactly the way

2280
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:52,910
and they seem to work exactly the way
 

2281
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:55,690
and they seem to work exactly the way
they're supposed to work will we learn a

2282
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:55,700
they're supposed to work will we learn a
 

2283
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,820
they're supposed to work will we learn a
great deal from it I don't know I can I

2284
00:51:57,820 --> 00:51:57,830
great deal from it I don't know I can I
 

2285
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,910
great deal from it I don't know I can I
I we might but the kind of things we

2286
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:00,920
I we might but the kind of things we
 

2287
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:05,260
I we might but the kind of things we
learn won't really be about black holes

2288
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:05,270

 

2289
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,610

why there are black holes in nature of

2290
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:09,620
why there are black holes in nature of
 

2291
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:11,380
why there are black holes in nature of
that particular mass scale and why

2292
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:11,390
that particular mass scale and why
 

2293
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:13,750
that particular mass scale and why
they're so common may tell us something

2294
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
they're so common may tell us something
 

2295
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,240
they're so common may tell us something
about the structure evolution of

2296
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:16,250
about the structure evolution of
 

2297
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,760
about the structure evolution of
structure in the universe but I don't

2298
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:18,770
structure in the universe but I don't
 

2299
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:19,900
structure in the universe but I don't
think it's going to tell us anything new

2300
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:19,910
think it's going to tell us anything new
 

2301
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:23,020
think it's going to tell us anything new
about black holes but it's a triumph in

2302
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:23,030
about black holes but it's a triumph in
 

2303
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,880
about black holes but it's a triumph in
the sense that you go back a hundred

2304
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:24,890
the sense that you go back a hundred
 

2305
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,680
the sense that you go back a hundred
years and it was a continuous

2306
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:26,690
years and it was a continuous
 

2307
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,110
years and it was a continuous

2310
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:32,510
discovery of black holes LIGO the
 

2311
00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:34,480

incredible technology that went into

2312
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,490
incredible technology that went into
 

2313
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:37,079
incredible technology that went into

2314
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:37,089
LIGO
 

2315
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:42,569
LIGO
it is something that I never would have

2316
00:52:42,569 --> 00:52:42,579
it is something that I never would have
 

2317
00:52:42,579 --> 00:52:45,779
it is something that I never would have
believed was gonna happen you know 30 40

2318
00:52:45,779 --> 00:52:45,789
believed was gonna happen you know 30 40
 

2319
00:52:45,789 --> 00:52:50,669
believed was gonna happen you know 30 40
years ago and I think it's a magnificent

2320
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:50,679
years ago and I think it's a magnificent
 

2321
00:52:50,679 --> 00:52:55,039
years ago and I think it's a magnificent
the structure magnificent thing this

you're just astonishing though we zoom
 

2331
00:53:11,529 --> 00:53:14,189
you're just astonishing though we zoom
all this just happy for us to this right

all this just happy for us to this right
picture is it different you know you've

2334
00:53:17,609 --> 00:53:17,619
picture is it different you know you've
 

2335
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:19,559
picture is it different you know you've
thought a lot about black holes is it

2336
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:19,569
thought a lot about black holes is it
 

2337
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:22,099

how did you visualize them in your mind

2338
00:53:22,099 --> 00:53:22,109
how did you visualize them in your mind
 

2339
00:53:22,109 --> 00:53:25,589
how did you visualize them in your mind
and is the picture different than you

2340
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
and is the picture different than you
 

2341
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,909
and is the picture different than you
know lies that no it simply confirmed

2342
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:28,919
know lies that no it simply confirmed
 

2343
00:53:28,919 --> 00:53:31,289
know lies that no it simply confirmed
you know it's a magnificent triumph to

2344
00:53:31,289 --> 00:53:31,299
you know it's a magnificent triumph to
 

2345
00:53:31,299 --> 00:53:33,269
you know it's a magnificent triumph to
have confirmed confirmed a direct

2346
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:33,279
have confirmed confirmed a direct
 

2347
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:36,659
have confirmed confirmed a direct
observation yeah that Einstein's theory

2348
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:36,669
observation yeah that Einstein's theory
 

2349
00:53:36,669 --> 00:53:38,999
observation yeah that Einstein's theory
of gravity at the level of black hole

collisions actually works is awesome and

2352
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
collisions actually works is awesome and
 

2353
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,079
collisions actually works is awesome and
it's really awesome you know I know some

2354
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:46,089
it's really awesome you know I know some
 

2355
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,429
it's really awesome you know I know some
of the people who were involved in that

2356
00:53:47,429 --> 00:53:47,439
of the people who were involved in that
 

2357
00:53:47,439 --> 00:53:49,620
of the people who were involved in that
they just thought married people yeah

2358
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:49,630
they just thought married people yeah
 

2359
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,829
they just thought married people yeah
and the idea that they could carry this

2360
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:52,839
and the idea that they could carry this
 

2361
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:57,509
and the idea that they could carry this
out I just don't I'm shocked yeah just

2362
00:53:57,509 --> 00:53:57,519
out I just don't I'm shocked yeah just
 

2363
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,219
out I just don't I'm shocked yeah just
these little Homo sapiens

2364

these little Homo sapiens
 

2365
00:53:59,229 --> 00:54:01,469
these little Homo sapiens
yeah just these little monkeys got

2366
00:54:01,469 --> 00:54:01,479
yeah just these little monkeys got
 

2367
00:54:01,479 --> 00:54:04,069
yeah just these little monkeys got
together right and took a picture of

2368
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
together right and took a picture of
 

2369
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,640
together right and took a picture of
slightly advanced lemurs I think what

2370
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:08,650
slightly advanced lemurs I think what
 

2371
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:10,289
slightly advanced lemurs I think what
kind of questions can science not

2372
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:10,299
kind of questions can science not
 

2373
00:54:10,299 --> 00:54:12,509
kind of questions can science not
currently answer but you hope might be

2374
00:54:12,509 --> 00:54:12,519
currently answer but you hope might be
 

2375
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,159
currently answer but you hope might be
able to soon well you you've already

2376
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:14,169
able to soon well you you've already
 

2377
00:54:14,169 --> 00:54:16,349
able to soon well you you've already
addressed them what is consciousness for

2378
00:54:16,349 --> 00:54:16,359
addressed them what is consciousness for
 

2379
00:54:16,359 --> 00:54:18,329
addressed them what is consciousness for
example do you think that's within the

2380
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:18,339
example do you think that's within the
 

2381
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:20,609
example do you think that's within the
reach of science I think it's somewhat

2382
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:20,619
reach of science I think it's somewhat
 

2383
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:22,079
reach of science I think it's somewhat
within the reach of science but I think

2384
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:22,089
within the reach of science but I think
 

2385
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:23,699
within the reach of science but I think
that now I think it's in the hands of

2386
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:23,709
that now I think it's in the hands of
 

2387
00:54:23,709 --> 00:54:25,069
that now I think it's in the hands of
the computer scientists and the

2388
00:54:25,069 --> 00:54:25,079
the computer scientists and the
 

2389
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,919
the computer scientists and the
neuroscientists I'm not a physicist

2390
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:27,929
neuroscientists I'm not a physicist
 

2391
00:54:27,929 --> 00:54:30,089
neuroscientists I'm not a physicist
perhaps with the helper haps at some

2392
00:54:30,089 --> 00:54:30,099
perhaps with the helper haps at some
 

2393
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:32,359
perhaps with the helper haps at some
point but I think physicists will try to

2394
00:54:32,359 --> 00:54:32,369
point but I think physicists will try to
 

2395
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,890
point but I think physicists will try to
simplify it down to something that they

2396
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:34,900
simplify it down to something that they
 

2397
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,989
simplify it down to something that they
can use their methods and maybe they're

2398
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:36,999
can use their methods and maybe they're
 

2399
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:40,199
can use their methods and maybe they're
not appropriate maybe we maybe we simply

2400
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:40,209
not appropriate maybe we maybe we simply
 

2401
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:43,739
not appropriate maybe we maybe we simply
need to do more machine learning on

2402
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:43,749
need to do more machine learning on
 

2403
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:47,939
need to do more machine learning on
bigger scales evolve machines machines

2404
00:54:47,939 --> 00:54:47,949
bigger scales evolve machines machines
 

2405
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:49,580
bigger scales evolve machines machines
not only that learn but

2406
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:49,590
not only that learn but
 

2407
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,590
not only that learn but
volve their own architecture as a

2408
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:51,600
volve their own architecture as a
 

2409
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,240
volve their own architecture as a
process of learning evolve in

2410
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:53,250
process of learning evolve in
 

2411
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:55,430
process of learning evolve in
architecture not under our control only

2412
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
architecture not under our control only
 

2413
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,320
architecture not under our control only
partially under our control but under

00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:57,330
partially under our control but under
 

2415
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:00,380
partially under our control but under
the control of a machine learning I'll

2416
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:00,390
the control of a machine learning I'll
 

2417
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:01,490
the control of a machine learning I'll
tell you another thing that I find

2418
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:01,500
tell you another thing that I find
 

2419
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,680
tell you another thing that I find
awesome

2420
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:02,690
awesome
 

2421
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,120
awesome
you know this Google thing that they

2422
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:05,130
you know this Google thing that they
 

2423
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:07,130
you know this Google thing that they
taught the computers how to play chess

2424
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:07,140
taught the computers how to play chess
 

2425
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:09,860
taught the computers how to play chess
yeah yeah okay they taught the computers

2426
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:09,870
yeah yeah okay they taught the computers
 

2427
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,390
yeah yeah okay they taught the computers
how to play chess not by teaching them

2428
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:11,400
how to play chess not by teaching them
 

2429
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,220
how to play chess not by teaching them
how to play chess but just having them

2430
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:13,230
how to play chess but just having them
 

2431
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,810
how to play chess but just having them
play against each other against each

2432
00:55:14,810 --> 00:55:14,820
play against each other against each
 

2433
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,460
play against each other against each
other itself against each other this is

2434
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:16,470
other itself against each other this is
 

2435
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,400
other itself against each other this is
a form of evolution these machines

2436
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:19,410
a form of evolution these machines
 

2437
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:25,020
a form of evolution these machines
evolved they evolved and intelligence

2438
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,030

 

2439
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,620

they evolved in intelligence without

2440
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:27,630
they evolved in intelligence without
 

2441
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,960
they evolved in intelligence without
anybody telling them how to do it and

2442
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:30,970
anybody telling them how to do it and
 

2443
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:33,150
anybody telling them how to do it and
we're not engineered they just played

2444
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:33,160
we're not engineered they just played
 

2445
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,650
we're not engineered they just played
against each other and got better and

2446
00:55:34,650 --> 00:55:34,660
against each other and got better and
 

2447
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,550
against each other and got better and
better and better

2448
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:37,560

 

2449
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,590

that makes me think that machines can

2450
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:39,600
that makes me think that machines can
 

2451
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:44,570
that makes me think that machines can
evolve intelligence what exact kind of

2452
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:44,580
evolve intelligence what exact kind of
 

2453
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:47,150
evolve intelligence what exact kind of
intelligence I don't know but in

2454
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:47,160
intelligence I don't know but in
 

2455
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:48,890
intelligence I don't know but in
understanding that better and better

2456
00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:48,900
understanding that better and better
 

2457
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:51,080
understanding that better and better
maybe we'll get better clues as to what

2458
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:51,090
maybe we'll get better clues as to what
 

2459
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:54,110
maybe we'll get better clues as to what
there goes on your life and intelligence

2460
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,120
there goes on your life and intelligence
 

2461
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,320
there goes on your life and intelligence
is last question what kind of questions

2462
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:57,330
is last question what kind of questions
 

2463
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:00,140
is last question what kind of questions
can science not currently answer and may

2464
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:00,150
can science not currently answer and may
 

2465
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:04,630
can science not currently answer and may
never be able to answer yeah

2466
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:04,640

 

2467
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,250

is there an intelligence out there

2468
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:07,260
is there an intelligence out there
 

2469
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,530
is there an intelligence out there
that's underlies the whole thing you can

2470
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:09,540
that's underlies the whole thing you can
 

2471
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,990
that's underlies the whole thing you can
call them with the G word if you want I

2472
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:12,000
call them with the G word if you want I
 

2473
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,320
call them with the G word if you want I
can say are we a computer simulation

2474
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:15,330
can say are we a computer simulation
 

2475
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:21,110
can say are we a computer simulation
with a purpose is there an agent an

2476
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:21,120
with a purpose is there an agent an
 

2477
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,230
with a purpose is there an agent an
intelligent agent that underlies or is

2478
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
intelligent agent that underlies or is
 

2479
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,480
intelligent agent that underlies or is
responsible for the whole thing

2480
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:26,490
responsible for the whole thing
 

2481
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,450
responsible for the whole thing
does that intelligent agent satisfy the

2482
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:29,460
does that intelligent agent satisfy the
 

2483
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,610
does that intelligent agent satisfy the
laws of physics does it satisfy the laws

2484
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:31,620
laws of physics does it satisfy the laws
 

2485
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:33,410
laws of physics does it satisfy the laws
of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms

2486
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:33,420
of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms
 

2487
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:35,120
of quantum mechanics is it made of atoms
and molecules yeah there's a lot of

2488
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,130
and molecules yeah there's a lot of
 

2489
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,290
and molecules yeah there's a lot of
questions and I don't see this it seems

2490
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:39,300
questions and I don't see this it seems
 

2491
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,140
questions and I don't see this it seems
to me a real question

2492
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,150
to me a real question
 

2493
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,090
to me a real question
it's an answerable question well it's

2494
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:44,100
it's an answerable question well it's
 

2495
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,710
it's an answerable question well it's
answerable the questions have to be

2496
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:45,720
answerable the questions have to be
 

2497
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,150
answerable the questions have to be
answerable to be real some philosophers

2498
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:50,160
answerable to be real some philosophers
 

2499
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,460
answerable to be real some philosophers
would say that a question is not a

2500
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:52,470
would say that a question is not a
 

2501
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,670
would say that a question is not a
question unless it's answerable this

2502
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
question unless it's answerable this
 

2503
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,220
question unless it's answerable this
question doesn't seem to me answerable

2504
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,230
question doesn't seem to me answerable
 

2505
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:02,660
question doesn't seem to me answerable
by any known method but it seems to me

2506
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:02,670
by any known method but it seems to me
 

2507
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,440
by any known method but it seems to me
real there's no better place to end

2508
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:06,450
real there's no better place to end
 

2509
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:08,240
real there's no better place to end
monitor thank you so much for talking
