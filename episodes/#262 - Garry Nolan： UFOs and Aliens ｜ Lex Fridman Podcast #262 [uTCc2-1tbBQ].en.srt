00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:56,640
is the most interesting
 

59
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,069
is the most interesting
the fact that you have this

00:01:00,069 --> 00:01:00,079
the fact that you have this
 

61
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,549
the fact that you have this
basically dynamic computer within every

basically dynamic computer within every
 

63
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,630
basically dynamic computer within every
cell that's constantly processing its

00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,840
environment
 

67
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,390
environment
and at the heart of it is dna

68
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,400
and at the heart of it is dna
 

69
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,030
and at the heart of it is dna
which is a dynamic machine a dynamic

computation process people think of the

72
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:14,080
computation process people think of the
 

73
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,469
computation process people think of the
dna as a linear code

74
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:16,479
dna as a linear code
 

75
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,030
dna as a linear code
it's codes within codes within codes and

76
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:19,040
it's codes within codes within codes and
 

77
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,749
it's codes within codes within codes and
it is the actually the epigenetic state

78
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:21,759
it is the actually the epigenetic state
 

79
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,749
it is the actually the epigenetic state
that's doing this amazing processing i

80
00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:23,759
that's doing this amazing processing i
 

81
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,270
that's doing this amazing processing i
mean if you ever wanted to believe in

82
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,280
mean if you ever wanted to believe in
 

83
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,070
mean if you ever wanted to believe in
god just look inside the cell

84
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
god just look inside the cell
 

85
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,710
god just look inside the cell
so dna is both information and computer

86
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
so dna is both information and computer
 

87
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,990
so dna is both information and computer
exactly

88
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
exactly
 

89
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,870
exactly
how did that computer come about

90
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:34,880
how did that computer come about
 

91
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,789
how did that computer come about
a big continuing the philosophical

question is this both scientific and
 

95
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,870
question is this both scientific and
philosophical how did life originate on

96
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:40,880
philosophical how did life originate on
 

97
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,350
philosophical how did life originate on
earth do you think how did this

98
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,360
earth do you think how did this
 

99
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,389
earth do you think how did this
at every level so the very first step

100
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:46,399
at every level so the very first step
 

101
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,030
at every level so the very first step
and the fascinating complex computer

102
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
and the fascinating complex computer
 

103
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,149
and the fascinating complex computer
that is

104
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
that is
 

105
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,469
that is
dna that is multicellular organism and

106
00:01:52,469 --> 00:01:52,479
dna that is multicellular organism and
 

107
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,550
dna that is multicellular organism and
then maybe the fascinating

108
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:54,560
then maybe the fascinating
 

109
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,270
then maybe the fascinating

well i think you have to take just one

114
00:01:59,910 --> 00:01:59,920
well i think you have to take just one
 

115
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,230
well i think you have to take just one
more step back to the complex computer

116
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
more step back to the complex computer
 

117
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,910
more step back to the complex computer
that is the universe

118
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
that is the universe
 

119
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,950
that is the universe
right all of the the so-called particles

120
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
right all of the the so-called particles
 

121
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,029
right all of the the so-called particles
or the waves that people think the

122
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
or the waves that people think the
 

123
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,150
or the waves that people think the
universe is made of and uh appears to me

124
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
universe is made of and uh appears to me
 

125
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,390
universe is made of and uh appears to me
at least to be a computational process

126
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
at least to be a computational process
 

127
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,229
at least to be a computational process
and embedded in that is biology right so

128
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:18,239
and embedded in that is biology right so
 

129
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,270
and embedded in that is biology right so
all the atoms of a protein etc sit in

130
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,280
all the atoms of a protein etc sit in
 

131
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,510
all the atoms of a protein etc sit in
that computational matrix

132
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
that computational matrix
 

133
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,589
that computational matrix
from my point of view it's computing

134
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:25,599
from my point of view it's computing
 

135
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,350
from my point of view it's computing
something it's computing towards

136
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
something it's computing towards
 

137
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,150
something it's computing towards
something it was created in some ways if

138
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
something it was created in some ways if
 

139
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,670
something it was created in some ways if
you want to believe in god and i don't

140
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:31,680
you want to believe in god and i don't
 

141
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,030
you want to believe in god and i don't
know that i do but if you want to

142
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,040
know that i do but if you want to
 

143
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,790
know that i do but if you want to
believe in something

144
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:34,800
believe in something
 

145
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,790
believe in something
the universe was created or at least

146
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
the universe was created or at least
 

147
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,910
the universe was created or at least
enabled

148
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:37,920
enabled
 

149
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,710
enabled
to allow for life to form

150
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:40,720
to allow for life to form
 

151
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,990
to allow for life to form
and so

152
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,000
and so
 

153
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,430
and so
the dna

154
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:43,440
the dna
 

155
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,190
the dna
if you ask where does dna come from and

156
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:45,200
if you ask where does dna come from and
 

157
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,390
if you ask where does dna come from and
you can go all the way back to richard

158
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:46,400
you can go all the way back to richard
 

159
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,750
you can go all the way back to richard
dawkins and

160
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:47,760
dawkins and
 

161
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,630
dawkins and
uh the selfish gene hypotheses

162
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:50,640
uh the selfish gene hypotheses
 

163
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,509
uh the selfish gene hypotheses
the way i look at dna though is

164
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
the way i look at dna though is
 

165
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,949
the way i look at dna though is
it is not a moment in time it assumes

166
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:56,959
it is not a moment in time it assumes
 

167
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,790
it is not a moment in time it assumes
the context of the body and the

168
00:02:58,790 --> 00:02:58,800
the context of the body and the
 

169
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,550
the context of the body and the

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
environment in which it's going to live
 

171
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,430
environment in which it's going to live
and so

172
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:01,440
and so
 

173
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,270
and so
if you if you want to ask a question of

174
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,280
if you if you want to ask a question of
 

175
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,149
if you if you want to ask a question of
where and how does information get

176
00:03:06,149 --> 00:03:06,159
where and how does information get
 

177
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:07,270
where and how does information get
stored

178
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
stored
 

179
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,350
stored
dna although it's only three billion

180
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,360
dna although it's only three billion
 

181
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,589
dna although it's only three billion
base pairs long contains more

182
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
base pairs long contains more
 

183
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,949
base pairs long contains more
information

184
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:12,959
information
 

185
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,190
information
than i think the entire

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,200
than i think the entire
 

187
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,949
than i think the entire
computational

188
00:03:16,949 --> 00:03:16,959
computational
 

189
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,190
computational
memory resources of our current

190
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
memory resources of our current
 

191
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,070
memory resources of our current
technology because who and what you are

192
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
technology because who and what you are
 

193
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,710
technology because who and what you are
is both what you were as an egg all the

194
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
is both what you were as an egg all the
 

195
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,430
is both what you were as an egg all the
way through to the day you die

196
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:27,440
way through to the day you die
 

197
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,190
way through to the day you die
and it embodies all the different cell

198
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
and it embodies all the different cell
 

199
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,430
and it embodies all the different cell
types and organs in your body

200
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
types and organs in your body
 

201
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,869
types and organs in your body
and so it's a computational

202
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:34,879
and so it's a computational
 

203
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,309
and so it's a computational
reservoir

204
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
reservoir
 

205
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,630
reservoir
of information and expectation

206
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:38,640
of information and expectation
 

207
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,830
of information and expectation
that

208
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
that
 

209
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,670
that
you will become so actually i would sort

210
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
you will become so actually i would sort
 

211
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,670
you will become so actually i would sort
of turn it around a different way and

212
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:43,680
of turn it around a different way and
 

213
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,509
of turn it around a different way and
say if you wanted to create the best

214
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
say if you wanted to create the best
 

215
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,789
say if you wanted to create the best
memory storage system possible

216
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
memory storage system possible
 

217
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,789
memory storage system possible
you could reverse engineer what a human

218
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:52,799
you could reverse engineer what a human
 

219
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,110
you could reverse engineer what a human
is and create a dna

220
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:55,120
is and create a dna
 

221
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,270
is and create a dna
memory system that is not just the

222
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
memory system that is not just the
 

223
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,110
memory system that is not just the
linear

224
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
linear
 

225
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,589
linear
version but is also

226
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
version but is also
 

227
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,270
version but is also
everything that it could become when

228
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:03,280
everything that it could become when
 

229
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,470
everything that it could become when
we're talking about dna we're talking

230
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
we're talking about dna we're talking
 

231
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,149
we're talking about dna we're talking
about earth and the environment creating

232
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
about earth and the environment creating
 

233
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,309
about earth and the environment creating
dna so this

234
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
dna so this
 

235
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,670
dna so this
you're talking about trying to come up

236
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
you're talking about trying to come up
 

237
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,589
you're talking about trying to come up
with a optimal computer for this

238
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:11,599
with a optimal computer for this
 

239
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,869
with a optimal computer for this
particular environment right

240
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
particular environment right
 

241
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,349
particular environment right
so if you reverse engineer that computer

242
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
so if you reverse engineer that computer
 

243
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:21,270
so if you reverse engineer that computer
what do you mean by considering all the

244
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:21,280
what do you mean by considering all the
 

245
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,430
what do you mean by considering all the
possible things it could become so who

246
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
possible things it could become so who
 

247
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,390
possible things it could become so who
you are today right so three billion

248
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:26,400
you are today right so three billion
 

249
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,710
you are today right so three billion
bits of information does not explain lex

250
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:28,720
bits of information does not explain lex
 

251
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,110
bits of information does not explain lex
friedman yeah doesn't explain me

252
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
friedman yeah doesn't explain me
 

253
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,790
friedman yeah doesn't explain me
right but

254
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:32,800
right but
 

255
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,510
right but
the dna embodies the expectation of the

256
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
the dna embodies the expectation of the
 

257
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,749
the dna embodies the expectation of the
environment in which you will

258
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
environment in which you will
 

259
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,629
environment in which you will
live

260
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
live
 

261
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,830
live
yes and grow and become so all the

262
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
yes and grow and become so all the
 

263
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,070
yes and grow and become so all the
information that is you

264
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
information that is you
 

265
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,790
information that is you
right is actually not only embedded in

266
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:46,800
right is actually not only embedded in
 

267
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,230
right is actually not only embedded in
the dna

268
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:48,240
the dna
 

269
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,230
the dna
but it's embedded in the context of the

270
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
but it's embedded in the context of the
 

271
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,070
but it's embedded in the context of the
world in which you

272
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
world in which you
 

273
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,990
world in which you
grow into

274
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
grow into
 

275
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,189
grow into
and develop

276
00:04:55,189 --> 00:04:55,199
and develop
 

277
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,350
and develop
right but so all that information though

278
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
right but so all that information though
 

279
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,510
right but so all that information though
is is packed in the expectation of what

280
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
is is packed in the expectation of what
 

281
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,590
is is packed in the expectation of what
the dna expects to see

282
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
the dna expects to see
 

283
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,029
the dna expects to see
interesting so like

284
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:03,039
interesting so like
 

285
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,710
interesting so like
some of the information

286
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:04,720
some of the information
 

287
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,110
some of the information
is that accurate to say is stored

288
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
is that accurate to say is stored
 

289
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,749
is that accurate to say is stored
outside the body exactly yeah the

290
00:05:09,749 --> 00:05:09,759
outside the body exactly yeah the
 

291
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,350
outside the body exactly yeah the
information is stored outside because

292
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
information is stored outside because
 

293
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,670
information is stored outside because
there's a context of expectation isn't

294
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
there's a context of expectation isn't
 

295
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,670
there's a context of expectation isn't
that interesting yeah it's fascinating i

296
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:15,680
that interesting yeah it's fascinating i
 

297
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,909
that interesting yeah it's fascinating i
mean

298
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:17,919

 

299
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,230

it to linger on this point

300
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
it to linger on this point
 

301
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,710
it to linger on this point
if we were to run earth over again a

302
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:22,720
if we were to run earth over again a
 

303
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,110
if we were to run earth over again a
million times how many different

304
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
million times how many different
 

305
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,270
million times how many different
versions of this type of computer would

306
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
versions of this type of computer would
 

307
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,110
versions of this type of computer would
we get i think it would be different

308
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,120
we get i think it would be different
 

309
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,950
we get i think it would be different
each time i mean if you assume there's

310
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:30,960
each time i mean if you assume there's
 

311
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,629
each time i mean if you assume there's
no such thing as fate

312
00:05:32,629 --> 00:05:32,639
no such thing as fate
 

313
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,870
no such thing as fate
right and it's not all pre-programmed

314
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
right and it's not all pre-programmed
 

315
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,230
right and it's not all pre-programmed
you know and that there is some sort of

316
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,240
you know and that there is some sort of
 

317
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,430
you know and that there is some sort of
let's say

318
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:37,440
let's say
 

319
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,310
let's say
variation or randomness at the beginning

320
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
variation or randomness at the beginning
 

321
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,790
variation or randomness at the beginning
you would get as many different versions

322
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
you would get as many different versions
 

323
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,590
you would get as many different versions
of life as you could imagine and i don't

324
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
of life as you could imagine and i don't
 

325
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,870
of life as you could imagine and i don't
think it would all be

326
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
think it would all be
 

327
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,189
think it would all be
unless there's something built into the

328
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
unless there's something built into the
 

329
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,629
unless there's something built into the
you know into the substrate of the

330
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
you know into the substrate of the
 

331
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,909
you know into the substrate of the
universe it wouldn't always be

332
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:51,919
universe it wouldn't always be
 

333
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,670
universe it wouldn't always be
left-handed

334
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:53,680
left-handed
 

335
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,950
left-handed
proteins

336
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:54,960
proteins
 

337
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,749
proteins

is uh

354
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
is uh

i think in terms of the rate of zero
 

413
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,870
i think in terms of the rate of zero
much greater than zero i mean i would

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
much greater than zero i mean i would
 

415
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,950
much greater than zero i mean i would
just be surprised what a waste right of

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:10,960
just be surprised what a waste right of
 

417
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,110
just be surprised what a waste right of
all that space just for us if we're

418
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,120
all that space just for us if we're
 

419
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,830
all that space just for us if we're
never going to get there

never going to get there
 

421
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,830
never going to get there
that would be my first

422
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:17,840
that would be my first
 

423
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,670
that would be my first
uh way to think about it

424
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
uh way to think about it
 

425
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,469
uh way to think about it
but

426
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:20,479
but
 

427
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,990

isn't that sad
that we know nothing about something so

stars as we can see
now how many are currently there i don't

560
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
now how many are currently there i don't
 

561
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,670
now how many are currently there i don't
know i mean that's the whole

that's the whole question of you know
 

565
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,990
that's the whole question of you know
how long can a civilization last before

it
 

569
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,910
it
runs out of steam and you

570
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
runs out of steam and you
 

571
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,990
runs out of steam and you
for instance does it just get bored or

572
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:02,000
for instance does it just get bored or
 

573
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,829
for instance does it just get bored or
does it transcend to something else or

574
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:03,839
does it transcend to something else or
 

575
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,430
does it transcend to something else or
does it say i've seen enough and i'm

576
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:05,440
does it say i've seen enough and i'm
 

577

what does running out of steam look like

580
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
what does running out of steam look like
 

581
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,150
what does running out of steam look like
it could be destroy itself or get bored

582
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:10,160
it could be destroy itself or get bored
 

583
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,310
it could be destroy itself or get bored
you know it said or we've we've done

584
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
you know it said or we've we've done

everything we can and
 

587
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,030
everything we can and
they just decide to stop i don't know

588
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
they just decide to stop i don't know
 

589
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,790
they just decide to stop i don't know
i just don't know it's the elon musk

590
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:18,800
i just don't know it's the elon musk
 

591

i just don't know it's the elon musk
worry that we stop reproducing or we

592
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
worry that we stop reproducing or we
 

593
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,590
worry that we stop reproducing or we
slow down the reproduction rate to where

594
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:23,600
slow down the reproduction rate to where
 

595
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,509
slow down the reproduction rate to where
uh the population can go to zero can go

596
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
uh the population can go to zero can go
 

597
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,509
uh the population can go to zero can go
to zero and and we can't and we collapse

598
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
to zero and and we can't and we collapse
 

599
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,269
to zero and and we can't and we collapse
i mean so the only way to

600
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:29,279
i mean so the only way to
 

601
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,710
i mean so the only way to
get around that is uh perhaps

602
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:32,720
get around that is uh perhaps
 

603
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,590
get around that is uh perhaps
create enough machines with ai to take

604

still raw data
 

651
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,590
still raw data
and you have to listen and once you

652
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
and you have to listen and once you
 

653
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,190
and you have to listen and once you
start to hear

these kids were seven to ten years old
 

761
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,269
these kids were seven to ten years old
you see them on video

762
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:33,279
you see them on video
 

763
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,190
you see them on video
seven to 10 year olds can't lie like

764
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
seven to 10 year olds can't lie like
 

765
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,150
seven to 10 year olds can't lie like
that

766
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
that
 

767
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,269
that
and so

768
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
and so
 

769
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,350
and so
you know whether it's real or not i

770
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
you know whether it's real or not i
 

771
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,750
you know whether it's real or not i
don't know but i find that fascinating

772
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
don't know but i find that fascinating
 

773
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,990
don't know but i find that fascinating
data and again it's the it's these

774
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
data and again it's the it's these
 

775
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,230
data and again it's the it's these
unconnected stories

776
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:46,240

with the same story
that is

782
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:53,279
that is
 

783
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,030
that is
worthy of

784
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
worthy of
 

785
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,189
worthy of
further inquiry

786
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
further inquiry
 

787
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,829
further inquiry
yeah so here we are humans with limited

788
00:13:59,829 --> 00:13:59,839
yeah so here we are humans with limited
 

789
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,670
yeah so here we are humans with limited
cognitive capacities trying to make

790
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
cognitive capacities trying to make
 

791
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,189
cognitive capacities trying to make
sense of the world trying to understand

792
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
sense of the world trying to understand
 

793
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,790
sense of the world trying to understand
what is real and not

794
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
what is real and not
 

795
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,990
what is real and not
we have this dna that somehow in complex

796
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000
we have this dna that somehow in complex
 

797
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,910
we have this dna that somehow in complex
ways is interacting with the environment

798
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
ways is interacting with the environment
 

799
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,509
ways is interacting with the environment
and then we get these uh

800
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519

 

801
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,949

803
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,389
novel
ideas

804
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:16,399
ideas
 

805
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,069
ideas
that come from

806
00:14:18,069 --> 00:14:18,079
that come from
 

807
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,750
that come from
the populace

808
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
the populace
 

809
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,269
the populace
and then

810
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:21,279
and then
 

811
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,629
and then
they make us wonder about what it all

812
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:24,639
they make us wonder about what it all
 

813
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:25,910
they make us wonder about what it all
means

814
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
means
 

815
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,829
means
and so how to interpret it if you think

816
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
and so how to interpret it if you think
 

817
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,150
and so how to interpret it if you think
from an alien perspective how would you

818
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
from an alien perspective how would you
 

819
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,269
from an alien perspective how would you
communicate

820
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
communicate
 

821
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,470
communicate
with other life-like organisms

822
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:34,480
with other life-like organisms
 

823
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,550
with other life-like organisms
you perhaps have to

824
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,560
you perhaps have to
 

825
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,829
you perhaps have to
find

826
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
find
 

827
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,069
find
endpoints on this interaction between

828
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:40,079
endpoints on this interaction between
 

829
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,069
endpoints on this interaction between
the the dna and its

830
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:42,079
the the dna and its
 

831
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,110
the the dna and its
manifestations in terms of the the the

832
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
manifestations in terms of the the the
 

833
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,350
manifestations in terms of the the the
human mind and the

834
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:47,360
human mind and the
 

835
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,269
human mind and the
how it interacts with the environment so

836
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:49,279
how it interacts with the environment so
 

837
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,430
how it interacts with the environment so
get some kind of all right what is this

838
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
get some kind of all right what is this
 

839
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,910
get some kind of all right what is this
dna what is this environment i have to

840
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:53,920
dna what is this environment i have to
 

841
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,710
dna what is this environment i have to
get in somehow right to like interact

842
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:56,720
get in somehow right to like interact
 

843
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,269
get in somehow right to like interact
with it to get to perturb the system to

844
00:14:59,269 --> 00:14:59,279
with it to get to perturb the system to
 

845
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,910
with it to get to perturb the system to
where these little ants human like

846
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:01,920
where these little ants human like
 

847
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,790
where these little ants human like
ants get like excited and figure and see

848
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:04,800
ants get like excited and figure and see
 

849
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,189
ants get like excited and figure and see
stuff out yeah yes and then and then

850
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:07,199
stuff out yeah yes and then and then
 

851
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,110
stuff out yeah yes and then and then
somehow steer them

852
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,120
somehow steer them
 

853
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,870
somehow steer them
uh first of all for investigative

854
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
uh first of all for investigative
 

855
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,949
uh first of all for investigative
purposes understand like

856
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
purposes understand like
 

857
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,710
purposes understand like
oftentimes to understand a system you

858
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
oftentimes to understand a system you
 

859
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,550
oftentimes to understand a system you
have to perturb it exactly it's like

860
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
have to perturb it exactly it's like
 

861
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,710
have to perturb it exactly it's like
poke at it you get they get excited or

862
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:18,720
poke at it you get they get excited or
 

863
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,069
poke at it you get they get excited or
not and then the the the other ways you

864
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:22,079
not and then the the the other ways you
 

865
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,590
not and then the the the other ways you
want to

866
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
want to
 

867
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,710
want to
if you worry about them you can steer in

868
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
if you worry about them you can steer in
 

869
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,629
if you worry about them you can steer in
one direction or another and this kind

870
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
one direction or another and this kind
 

871
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,110
one direction or another and this kind
of idea of that we're not taking care of

872
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:31,120
of idea of that we're not taking care of
 

873
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,389
of idea of that we're not taking care of
our world

874
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:32,399
our world
 

875
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,910
our world
um

876
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:33,920
um
 

877
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,189
um
that's interesting i mean that's

878
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
that's interesting i mean that's
 

879
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,030
that's interesting i mean that's
comforting that's hopeful because that

880
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,040
comforting that's hopeful because that
 

881
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,230
comforting that's hopeful because that
means

882
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:38,240
means
 

883
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,990
means
the greater intelligence which is what i

884
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:40,000
the greater intelligence which is what i
 

885
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,069
the greater intelligence which is what i
would hope would want to take care of us

886
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
would hope would want to take care of us
 

887
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,990
would hope would want to take care of us
look we want to take care of the

888
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
look we want to take care of the
 

889
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,030
look we want to take care of the
gorillas in the national parks in africa

890
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:47,040
gorillas in the national parks in africa
 

891
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,870
gorillas in the national parks in africa
yeah but we don't want to take care of

892
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
yeah but we don't want to take care of
 

893
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,509
yeah but we don't want to take care of
cockroaches so there's a line we draw so

894
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:51,519
cockroaches so there's a line we draw so
 

895
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,269
cockroaches so there's a line we draw so
you have to hope that

896
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
you have to hope that
 

897
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,590
you have to hope that
right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys

898
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys
 

899
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,590
right now we're a bunch of angry monkeys
and you know maybe whatever these

900
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
and you know maybe whatever these
 

901
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,189
and you know maybe whatever these
intelligences are

902
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
intelligences are
 

903
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,350
intelligences are
are also keeping an eye on us

904
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
are also keeping an eye on us
 

905
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,189
are also keeping an eye on us
you know that you don't want a bunch of

906
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
you know that you don't want a bunch of
 

907

troop
 

911
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,710
troop
stomping around the local galactic arm

912
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
stomping around the local galactic arm
 

913
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,550
stomping around the local galactic arm
do you think these folks are telling the

914
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
do you think these folks are telling the
 

915
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,509
do you think these folks are telling the
truth

916
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
truth
 

917
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,590
truth
do you think they saw

918
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
do you think they saw
 

919
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,509
do you think they saw
what they say they saw

what they say they saw
 

921
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,350
what they say they saw
i think they

saw what they said they saw but i also
 

925
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,230
saw what they said they saw but i also
think they saw what they were shown i

926
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
think they saw what they were shown i
 

927
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,069

mean if you go back to the

928
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
mean if you go back to the
 

929
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,670
mean if you go back to the
whole notion of

930
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:25,680
whole notion of
 

931
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,590
whole notion of
okay how long has this

932
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
okay how long has this
 

933
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,269
okay how long has this
been around it didn't just start showing

934
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
been around it didn't just start showing
 

935
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,949
been around it didn't just start showing
up in 1947

936
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
up in 1947
 

937
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,269
up in 1947
right there are stories going back

938
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
right there are stories going back
 

939
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,110
right there are stories going back
uh you know into the 1800s of people who

940
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
uh you know into the 1800s of people who
 

941
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,110
uh you know into the 1800s of people who
saw things in their farming in their

942
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
saw things in their farming in their
 

943
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,990
saw things in their farming in their
farm fields in the u.s it's it's in

944
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
farm fields in the u.s it's it's in
 

945
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:42,870
farm fields in the u.s it's it's in
it's in

946
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
it's in
 

947
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,870
it's in
local newspapers from the 1800s it's

948
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
local newspapers from the 1800s it's
 

949
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,150
local newspapers from the 1800s it's
fascinating

950
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
fascinating
 

951
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,389
fascinating
but if you can go even further back

952
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:48,399
but if you can go even further back
 

953
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,590
but if you can go even further back
you know so to your point of how are how

954
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:51,600
you know so to your point of how are how
 

955
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,990
you know so to your point of how are how
would you as a higher intelligence

956
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
would you as a higher intelligence
 

957
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,910
would you as a higher intelligence
represent yourself

958
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
represent yourself
 

959
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,069
represent yourself
to a lesser intelligence

960
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
to a lesser intelligence
 

961
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,749
to a lesser intelligence
well let's go back to pre-civilization

962
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:01,759
well let's go back to pre-civilization
 

963
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,670
well let's go back to pre-civilization
maybe you show yourself as the spirits

964
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
maybe you show yourself as the spirits
 

965
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,350
maybe you show yourself as the spirits
in the forest

966
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
in the forest
 

967
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,110
in the forest
and you give messages

968
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:07,120
and you give messages
 

969
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,390
and you give messages
through that

970
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:08,400
through that
 

971
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,069
through that
once you get a little bit more civilized

972
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
once you get a little bit more civilized
 

973
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,069
once you get a little bit more civilized
civilized then you show yourself as the

974
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,079
civilized then you show yourself as the
 

975
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,029
civilized then you show yourself as the
gods

976
00:17:13,029 --> 00:17:13,039
gods
 

977
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,470
gods
and then you're god well we don't

978
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
and then you're god well we don't
 

979
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,150
and then you're god well we don't
believe in god anymore necessarily not

980
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,160
believe in god anymore necessarily not
 

981
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,230
believe in god anymore necessarily not
everybody does so what do we believe in

982
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
everybody does so what do we believe in
 

983
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,669
everybody does so what do we believe in
we believe in technology so you show

984
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
we believe in technology so you show
 

985
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,150
we believe in technology so you show
yourself as a form of technology

986
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:22,160
yourself as a form of technology
 

987
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,549
yourself as a form of technology
right but the common thread is

988
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
right but the common thread is
 

989
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,470
right but the common thread is
you're not alone

990
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
you're not alone
 

991
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,630
you're not alone
and there's something else here with you

992
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
and there's something else here with you
 

993
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,230
and there's something else here with you
and there's something that's as you said

994
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
and there's something that's as you said
 

995
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,190
and there's something that's as you said
watching you and at least

996
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,200
watching you and at least
 

997
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,669
watching you and at least
watching over your shoulder

998
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
watching over your shoulder
 

999
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,630
watching over your shoulder
but i i think that like any good parent

1000

your student everything

1006
00:17:42,549 --> 00:17:42,559
your student everything
 

1007
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,230
your student everything
you make them learn

1008
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
you make them learn
 

1009
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,950
you make them learn
and learning requires mistakes because

1010
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
and learning requires mistakes because
 

1011
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,950
and learning requires mistakes because
if you tell them everything

1012
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
if you tell them everything
 

1013
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,270
if you tell them everything
then they get lazy

1014
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
then they get lazy
 

1015
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,430
then they get lazy
you've uh looked at the brains of um

1016
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
you've uh looked at the brains of um
 

1017
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,950
you've uh looked at the brains of um
or information coming from the brain of

1018
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:56,960
or information coming from the brain of
 

1019
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,270
or information coming from the brain of
some of the people that have had ufo

1020
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
some of the people that have had ufo
 

1021
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,190
some of the people that have had ufo
encounters what's common about the brain

1022
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
encounters what's common about the brain
 

1023
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,070
encounters what's common about the brain
of people who encounter ufos

1024
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
of people who encounter ufos
 

1025
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,750
of people who encounter ufos
so the the study started with a group of

1026
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
so the the study started with a group of
 

1027
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,750
so the the study started with a group of
let's say a cohort of individuals that

1028
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:09,760
let's say a cohort of individuals that
 

1029
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,350
let's say a cohort of individuals that
were brought to me

1030
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
were brought to me
 

1031
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,230
were brought to me
and their mris

1032
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:14,240
and their mris
 

1033
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,350
and their mris
to ask about the damage that had been

1034
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:17,360
to ask about the damage that had been
 

1035
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,510
to ask about the damage that had been
seen in these individuals it turns out

1036
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:19,520
seen in these individuals it turns out
 

1037
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,110
seen in these individuals it turns out
that the majority of those patients

1038
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
that the majority of those patients
 

1039
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,630
that the majority of those patients
ended up being as far as we can tell

1040
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:22,640
ended up being as far as we can tell
 

1041
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,110
ended up being as far as we can tell
havana syndrome and so

1042
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,120
havana syndrome and so
 

1043
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,110
havana syndrome and so
for me at least this you know that part

1044
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
for me at least this you know that part
 

1045
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,390
for me at least this you know that part
of the story

1046
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
of the story
 

1047
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,029
of the story
ends in terms of the injury it's likely

1048
00:18:31,029 --> 00:18:31,039
ends in terms of the injury it's likely
 

1049
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,270
ends in terms of the injury it's likely
almost all havana syndrome that's

1050
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
almost all havana syndrome that's
 

1051
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,669
almost all havana syndrome that's
somebody else's problem now that's not

1052
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:35,679
somebody else's problem now that's not
 

1053
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,190
somebody else's problem now that's not
my problem

1054
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
my problem
 

1055
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,630
my problem
um

1056
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
um
 

1057
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,350
um
but

1058
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:39,360
but
 

1059
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,029
but
when we were looking at the brains of

1060
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
when we were looking at the brains of
 

1061
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,789
when we were looking at the brains of
these individuals we noticed something

1062
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
these individuals we noticed something
 

1063
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,150
these individuals we noticed something
right in the center of the basal ganglia

1064
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:46,160
right in the center of the basal ganglia
 

1065
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,669
right in the center of the basal ganglia
in many of these individuals that at

1066
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
in many of these individuals that at
 

1067
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,510
in many of these individuals that at
first we thought was damage it was

1068
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:49,520
first we thought was damage it was
 

1069
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,390
first we thought was damage it was
basically an enriched patch

1070
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
basically an enriched patch
 

1071
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,350
basically an enriched patch
of mri dense

1072
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:55,360
of mri dense
 

1073
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,270
of mri dense
neurons that we thought was damage and

1074
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:57,280
neurons that we thought was damage and
 

1075
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,950
neurons that we thought was damage and
but then it was showing up in everybody

1076
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:58,960
but then it was showing up in everybody
 

1077
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,230
but then it was showing up in everybody
and then we looked and said oh it's

1078
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:00,240
and then we looked and said oh it's
 

1079
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,430
and then we looked and said oh it's
actually not

1080
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
actually not
 

1081
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,830
actually not
the other readings on these mris show

1082
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
the other readings on these mris show
 

1083
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,070
the other readings on these mris show
that actually that's living tissue

1084
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
that actually that's living tissue
 

1085
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,150
that actually that's living tissue
um that's actually the head of the

1086
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
um that's actually the head of the
 

1087
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,549
um that's actually the head of the
caudate in the potamin um and at the

1088
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
caudate in the potamin um and at the
 

1089
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,310
caudate in the potamin um and at the
time and i remember even asking a good

1090
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
time and i remember even asking a good
 

1091
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,350
time and i remember even asking a good
friend of mine uh at stanford who is a

1092
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
friend of mine uh at stanford who is a
 

1093
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,669
friend of mine uh at stanford who is a
psychiatrist what does the basal ganglia

1094
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
psychiatrist what does the basal ganglia
 

1095
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,590
psychiatrist what does the basal ganglia
do he said oh the basal ganglia is just

1096
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
do he said oh the basal ganglia is just
 

1097
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,110
do he said oh the basal ganglia is just
about uh movement and nerve and motor

1098
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
about uh movement and nerve and motor
 

1099
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,230
about uh movement and nerve and motor
control i said well that's odd because

1100
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,240
control i said well that's odd because
 

1101
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,990
control i said well that's odd because
uh you know these other papers that we

1102
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
uh you know these other papers that we
 

1103
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,430
uh you know these other papers that we
were reading at the time started to

1104
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
were reading at the time started to
 

1105
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,510
were reading at the time started to
suggest that it was involved

1106
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
suggest that it was involved
 

1107
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,390
suggest that it was involved
with

1108
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
with
 

1109
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,190
with
uh higher intelligence and is actually

1110
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
uh higher intelligence and is actually
 

1111
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,150
uh higher intelligence and is actually
downstream of the executive function

1112
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
downstream of the executive function
 

1113
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,870
downstream of the executive function
and involved with intuition

1114
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
and involved with intuition
 

1115
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,630
and involved with intuition
and planning

1116
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:42,640
and planning
 

1117
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,470
and planning
and if you think about it

1118
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:44,480
and if you think about it
 

1119
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,549
and if you think about it
if you're going to have motor control

1120
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
if you're going to have motor control
 

1121
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,710
if you're going to have motor control
which is centralized in one place

1122
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
which is centralized in one place
 

1123
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,870
which is centralized in one place
motor control requires knowledge of the

1124
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:50,880
motor control requires knowledge of the
 

1125
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,029
motor control requires knowledge of the
environment you know you you don't want

1126
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
environment you know you you don't want
 

1127
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,590
environment you know you you don't want
to move something in and hit the table

1128
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
to move something in and hit the table
 

1129
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,390
to move something in and hit the table
or if you're walking across a room you

1130
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
or if you're walking across a room you
 

1131
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,430
or if you're walking across a room you
want to

1132
00:19:59,430 --> 00:19:59,440
want to
 

1133
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,230
want to
be

1134
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:00,240
be
 

1135
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,390
be
aware and cognizant of what you might

1136
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:02,400
aware and cognizant of what you might
 

1137
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,590
aware and cognizant of what you might
bump into

1138
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
bump into
 

1139
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,310
bump into
so

1140
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:04,320
so
 

1141
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,430
so
obviously

1142
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
obviously
 

1143
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,430
obviously
all of that planning

1144
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
all of that planning
 

1145
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,870
all of that planning
is

1146
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
is
 

1147
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,230
is
requires access to all the senses

1148
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,240
requires access to all the senses
 

1149
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,789
requires access to all the senses
it requires access to your desires

1150
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:14,799
it requires access to your desires
 

1151
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,789
it requires access to your desires
memory knowledge of where and what you

1152
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:16,799
memory knowledge of where and what you
 

1153
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,830
memory knowledge of where and what you
want and desire to walk near or by like

1154
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:19,840
want and desire to walk near or by like
 

1155
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,590
want and desire to walk near or by like
i use the example of you're at a party

1156
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:21,600
i use the example of you're at a party
 

1157
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,190
i use the example of you're at a party
you want to avoid that person you like

1158
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
you want to avoid that person you like
 

1159
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,789
you want to avoid that person you like
that person the waiter is about to drop

1160
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:24,799
that person the waiter is about to drop
 

1161
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:25,990
that person the waiter is about to drop
something

1162
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
something
 

1163
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,830
something
all without thinking

1164
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
all without thinking
 

1165
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,350
all without thinking
you maneuver

1166
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
you maneuver
 

1167
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,510
you maneuver
so that actually all that planning is

1168
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
so that actually all that planning is
 

1169
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,310
so that actually all that planning is
done in the basal ganglia

1170
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:34,320
done in the basal ganglia
 

1171
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,750
done in the basal ganglia
and it's actually now called the brain

1172
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:35,760
and it's actually now called the brain
 

1173
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,510
and it's actually now called the brain
within the brain

1174
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:37,520
within the brain
 

1175
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,630
within the brain
it's a

1176
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
it's a
 

1177
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,350
it's a
it's a goal processing system

1178
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
it's a goal processing system
 

1179
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,230
it's a goal processing system
subservient to executive function

1180
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:44,240
subservient to executive function
 

1181
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,510
subservient to executive function
so

1182
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:45,520
so
 

1183
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,390
so
what we think we found there was

1184
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,400
what we think we found there was
 

1185
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,149
what we think we found there was
not something which allows people to

1186
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
not something which allows people to
 

1187
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,149
not something which allows people to
talk to ufos i mean i think the ufo

1188
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:52,159
talk to ufos i mean i think the ufo
 

1189
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,590
talk to ufos i mean i think the ufo
community

1190
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:53,600
community
 

1191
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,549
community
uh took it a step too far

1192
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:56,559
uh took it a step too far
 

1193
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,510
uh took it a step too far
what i think we found was a form of

1194
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
what i think we found was a form of
 

1195
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,789
what i think we found was a form of
higher

1196
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799
higher
 

1197
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,630
higher
functioning and processing

1198
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:02,640
functioning and processing
 

1199
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,630
functioning and processing
so what we then looked at and this was

1200
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
so what we then looked at and this was
 

1201
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,510
so what we then looked at and this was
the most fascinating part of it we

1202
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
the most fascinating part of it we
 

1203
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,830
the most fascinating part of it we
looked then at individuals in the

1204
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
looked then at individuals in the
 

1205
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,990
looked then at individuals in the
families of those

1206
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
families of those
 

1207
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,789
families of those
let's say the index case individuals

1208
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:14,799
let's say the index case individuals
 

1209
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:15,990
let's say the index case individuals
and we found that it was actually in

1210
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
and we found that it was actually in
 

1211
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,270
and we found that it was actually in
families

1212
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:17,280
families
 

1213
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,029
families
and more so

1214
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:19,039
and more so
 

1215
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,029
and more so
this is the most fascinating part we've

1216
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
this is the most fascinating part we've
 

1217
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,350
this is the most fascinating part we've
probably looked now at about 200

1218
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:23,360
probably looked now at about 200
 

1219
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,909
probably looked now at about 200

you're able i'm able to detect something
 

1345
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,110
you're able i'm able to detect something
about the environment

1346
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
about the environment
 

1347
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,269
about the environment
that uh maybe others don't i don't know

1348
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
that uh maybe others don't i don't know
 

1349
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,630
that uh maybe others don't i don't know
but like i seem to be over the top

1350
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
but like i seem to be over the top
 

1351

00:23:49,269 --> 00:23:49,279
lot of stupid reasons and that's in
 

1355
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,430
lot of stupid reasons and that's in
there somewhere i mean it's kind of

1356
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
there somewhere i mean it's kind of
 

1357
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,390
there somewhere i mean it's kind of
interesting because um

1358
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:54,400
interesting because um
 

1359

like
 

1397
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,470
like
there's this pattern happening over and

1398
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:34,480
there's this pattern happening over and
 

1399
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,909
there's this pattern happening over and
over and over and then something weird

1400
00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:35,919
over and over and then something weird
 

1401
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,630
over and over and then something weird
just happened and then you get

1402
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,640
just happened and then you get
 

1403
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,430
just happened and then you get
excited by that weirdness and start to

1404
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
excited by that weirdness and start to
 

1405
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,190
excited by that weirdness and start to
pull the string

1406

pull the string
 

1407
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,430
pull the string
and discover what is at the core of that

1408
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,440
and discover what is at the core of that
 

1409
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,430
and discover what is at the core of that
weirdness and perhaps

1410
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
weirdness and perhaps
 

1411
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,510
weirdness and perhaps
is that

1412
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:49,520
is that
 

1413
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,029
is that
you know maybe by way of question

how does the human perception system
deal with anomalous information do you

1418
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
deal with anomalous information do you

think well it first tries to classify it

1420
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
think well it first tries to classify it
 

1421
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,430
think well it first tries to classify it
and get it out of the way if it's not

1422
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
and get it out of the way if it's not
 

1423
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,750
and get it out of the way if it's not

right if it's not

1426
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
right if it's not

uh in the way of my desires

1428
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:08,240
uh in the way of my desires
 

1429
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,710
uh in the way of my desires
or if it is in the way of my desires

1430
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
or if it is in the way of my desires
 

1431
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,669
or if it is in the way of my desires
then

1432
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:11,679
then
 

1433
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,510
then
you focus on it

1434
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
you focus on it
 

1435
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,870
you focus on it
and so the i think the question is how

1436
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
and so the i think the question is how
 

1437
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,070
and so the i think the question is how

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,710
and then they get home
uh they look at the picture there's no

1498
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:24,720
uh they look at the picture there's no
 

1499
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,750
uh they look at the picture there's no
craft

1500
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:25,760
craft
 

1501
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,149
craft
but there's a little object

1502
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:28,159
but there's a little object
 

1503
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,390
but there's a little object
about 30 feet above their

1504
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:30,400
about 30 feet above their
 

1505
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,830
about 30 feet above their
car or so

1506
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
car or so
 

1507
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,110
car or so
probably about

1508
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
probably about
 

1509
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,149
probably about
three feet across kind of star-shaped

1510
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
three feet across kind of star-shaped
 

1511
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,710
three feet across kind of star-shaped
it's not the craft but it's something

1512
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:38,720
it's not the craft but it's something
 

1513
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,909
it's not the craft but it's something
else there's obviously there was

1514
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:39,919
else there's obviously there was
 

1515
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,190
else there's obviously there was
something there

1516
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,200
something there
 

1517
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,029
something there
and so what were they seeing were they

1518
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:43,039
and so what were they seeing were they
 

1519
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,190
and so what were they seeing were they
seeing a projection were they seeing

1520
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
seeing a projection were they seeing
 

1521
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,909
seeing a projection were they seeing
and why were only they seeing it

1522
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
and why were only they seeing it
 

1523
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,510
and why were only they seeing it
and the photograph

1524
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
and the photograph
 

1525
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,190
and the photograph
was capturing

1526
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
was capturing
 

1527
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,870
was capturing
something very different than we're

1528
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
something very different than we're
 

1529
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,510
something very different than we're
seeing there's still an object what can

1530
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:55,520
seeing there's still an object what can
 

1531
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,549
seeing there's still an object what can
you

1532
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:56,559
you
 

1533
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,630
you
give a little bit of context is this

1534
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
give a little bit of context is this
 

1535
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,310
give a little bit of context is this
from modern day it's modern day oh yeah

1536
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
from modern day it's modern day oh yeah
 

1537
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,830
from modern day it's modern day oh yeah
they had a camera i mean okay they had a

1538
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
they had a camera i mean okay they had a
 

1539
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,750
they had a camera i mean okay they had a
cell phone camera and this was like a

1540
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:03,760
cell phone camera and this was like a
 

1541
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,070
cell phone camera and this was like a
five years ago report provided by the

1542
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
five years ago report provided by the
 

1543
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,750
five years ago report provided by the
way where's like a central place to

1544
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
way where's like a central place to
 

1545
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,350
way where's like a central place to
provide a report is this oh there's a

1546
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
provide a report is this oh there's a
 

1547
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,669
provide a report is this oh there's a
mufon but this isn't public i've seen

1548
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
mufon but this isn't public i've seen
 

1549
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,430
mufon but this isn't public i've seen
the picture oh this is something you've

1550
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:13,440
the picture oh this is something you've
 

1551
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,669
the picture oh this is something you've
directly interacted with yeah yeah i've

1552
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
directly interacted with yeah yeah i've
 

1553
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,909
directly interacted with yeah yeah i've
seen the picture so those moments like

1554
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
seen the picture so those moments like
 

1555
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,149
seen the picture so those moments like
that

1556
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
that
 

1557
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,310
that
they captivate your uh

1558
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
they captivate your uh
 

1559
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,190
they captivate your uh
well

1560
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
well
 

1561
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,789
well
it's so different it doesn't fall into

1562
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:24,799
it's so different it doesn't fall into
 

1563
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,990
it's so different it doesn't fall into
the standard story at all but it also

1564
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,000
the standard story at all but it also
 

1565
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,950
the standard story at all but it also
but in another way it's kind of a

1566
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
but in another way it's kind of a
 

1567
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,669
but in another way it's kind of a
it's a clear enunciation of this notion

1568
00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:33,679
it's a clear enunciation of this notion
 

1569
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,549
it's a clear enunciation of this notion
that when people see events they don't

1570
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:36,559
that when people see events they don't
 

1571
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,389
that when people see events they don't
all see the same thing now we've heard

1572
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:38,399
all see the same thing now we've heard
 

1573
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,310
all see the same thing now we've heard
this about like traffic accidents

1574
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:40,320
this about like traffic accidents
 

1575
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,909
this about like traffic accidents
different people will see the color of

1576
00:27:41,909 --> 00:27:41,919
different people will see the color of
 

1577
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:43,510
different people will see the color of
the car differently or the chain of

1578
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:43,520
the car differently or the chain of
 

1579
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,350
the car differently or the chain of
events differently and just tells you

1580
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,360
events differently and just tells you
 

1581
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,590
events differently and just tells you
that memory isn't anywhere near what we

1582
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:47,600
that memory isn't anywhere near what we
 

1583
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,430
that memory isn't anywhere near what we
think it is but

1584
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:49,440
think it is but
 

1585
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,669
think it is but
the issue around these so-called ufo

1586
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
the issue around these so-called ufo
 

1587
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,669
the issue around these so-called ufo
reports is that

1588
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
reports is that
 

1589
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,590
reports is that
the same people will see a very

1590
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:55,600
the same people will see a very
 

1591
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,830
the same people will see a very
different thing almost as if whatever it

1592
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
different thing almost as if whatever it
 

1593
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,149
different thing almost as if whatever it
is is projecting

1594
00:28:00,149 --> 00:28:00,159
is is projecting
 

1595
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,590
is is projecting
a

1596
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:01,600
a
 

1597
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,230
a
is projecting something into the mind

1598
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
is projecting something into the mind
 

1599
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,110
is projecting something into the mind
rather than it being real right rather

1600
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
rather than it being real right rather
 

1601
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,110
rather than it being real right rather
than being a real manifestation

1602
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
than being a real manifestation
 

1603
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,590
than being a real manifestation
you know material in front of you it's

1604
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
you know material in front of you it's
 

1605
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,110
you know material in front of you it's
actually almost some sort of an altered

1606
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,120
actually almost some sort of an altered
 

1607
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,990
actually almost some sort of an altered
virtual reality that is imposed on you i

1608
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:18,000
virtual reality that is imposed on you i
 

1609
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,870
virtual reality that is imposed on you i
mean

1610
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:18,880
mean
 

1611
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,389
mean
you know i think

1612
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
you know i think
 

1613
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,909
you know i think
the company meta

1614
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:21,919
the company meta
 

1615
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:23,750
the company meta
and all the virtual reality companies

1616
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:23,760
and all the virtual reality companies
 

1617
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,149
and all the virtual reality companies
would love to have something like that

1618
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
would love to have something like that
 

1619
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,190
would love to have something like that
right well you don't have to actually

1620
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200
right well you don't have to actually
 

1621
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,950
right well you don't have to actually
wear something on your face

1622
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:28,960
wear something on your face
 

1623
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,430
wear something on your face
yes to experience a virtual reality what

1624
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
yes to experience a virtual reality what
 

1625
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,669
yes to experience a virtual reality what
happens if you could just project it

1626
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
happens if you could just project it
 

1627
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,029
happens if you could just project it
well that's the fundamental question

1628
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
well that's the fundamental question
 

1629
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,029
well that's the fundamental question
from an alien perspective

1630
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
from an alien perspective
 

1631
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,110
from an alien perspective
when you look at or as we humans look at

1632
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
when you look at or as we humans look at
 

1633
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,149
when you look at or as we humans look at
ants

1634
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
ants
 

1635
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,190
ants
how does this perception system operate

1636
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
how does this perception system operate
 

1637
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,190
how does this perception system operate
so not only how does this thing's mind

1638
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:45,200
so not only how does this thing's mind
 

1639
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,669
so not only how does this thing's mind
operate how does the human mind operate

1640
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
operate how does the human mind operate
 

1641
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,909
operate how does the human mind operate
but how does it their perception system

1642
00:28:49,909 --> 00:28:49,919
but how does it their perception system
 

1643
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,990
but how does it their perception system
operate so that we can like

1644
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
operate so that we can like
 

1645
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,470
operate so that we can like
stimulate the perception system

1646
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:54,480
stimulate the perception system
 

1647
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,870
stimulate the perception system
properly to get them to think certain

1648
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
properly to get them to think certain
 

1649
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,549
properly to get them to think certain
things and so uh you know

1650
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:00,559
things and so uh you know
 

1651
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,549
things and so uh you know
that's a really important question

1652
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:02,559
that's a really important question
 

1653
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,110
that's a really important question
humans think that

1654
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:05,120
humans think that
 

1655
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,029
humans think that
you know the only way to communicate is

1656
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
you know the only way to communicate is
 

1657
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,269
you know the only way to communicate is
in like 3d or 4d

1658
00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:09,279
in like 3d or 4d
 

1659
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,149
in like 3d or 4d
space time there's physical objects or

1660
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:12,159
space time there's physical objects or
 

1661
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,310
space time there's physical objects or
maybe you write things into some kind of

1662
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:14,320
maybe you write things into some kind of
 

1663
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,990
maybe you write things into some kind of
language but there could be just uh

1664
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
language but there could be just uh
 

1665
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,310
language but there could be just uh
so much

1666
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:20,320
so much
 

1667
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,870
so much
more um richness in how you can

1668
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:22,880
more um richness in how you can
 

1669
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,630
more um richness in how you can
communicate and so from an alien

1670
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
communicate and so from an alien
 

1671
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,310
communicate and so from an alien
perspective where somebody has much

1672
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:26,320
perspective where somebody has much
 

1673
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,990
perspective where somebody has much
greater technological capabilities you

1674
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
greater technological capabilities you
 

1675
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,070
greater technological capabilities you
have to figure out how do i use the

1676
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
have to figure out how do i use the
 

1677
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:32,950
have to figure out how do i use the
skills i have to stimulate

1678
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
skills i have to stimulate
 

1679
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,070
skills i have to stimulate
uh the human the limited humans right

1680
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
uh the human the limited humans right
 

1681
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,830
uh the human the limited humans right
well i mean let's take the ants exam

1682
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
well i mean let's take the ants exam
 

1683
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,669
well i mean let's take the ants exam
again as an example let's say that you

1684
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
again as an example let's say that you
 

1685
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,110
again as an example let's say that you
wanted to

1686
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
wanted to
 

1687
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,990
wanted to
make ants practical you wanted to use

1688
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
make ants practical you wanted to use
 

1689
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,510
make ants practical you wanted to use
them for something right you wanted to

1690
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
them for something right you wanted to
 

1691
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,510
them for something right you wanted to
use them as a form of biological robot

1692
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
use them as a form of biological robot
 

1693
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,470
use them as a form of biological robot
now darpa and other uh people have been

1694
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
now darpa and other uh people have been
 

1695
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,750
now darpa and other uh people have been
trying to

1696
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
trying to
 

1697
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,350
trying to
use insects for

1698
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
use insects for
 

1699
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,950
use insects for
you know and to turn them into

1700
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
you know and to turn them into
 

1701
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,350
you know and to turn them into
biological robots but if you wanted to

1702
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:57,360
biological robots but if you wanted to
 

1703
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,149
biological robots but if you wanted to
you would have to interact with their

1704
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
you would have to interact with their
 

1705
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,669
you would have to interact with their
sense of smell

1706
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
sense of smell
 

1707
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,750
sense of smell
right their pheromone system that they

1708
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:03,760
right their pheromone system that they
 

1709
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,950
right their pheromone system that they
use to

1710
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
use to
 

1711
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,549
use to
interact with each other

1712
00:30:06,549 --> 00:30:06,559
interact with each other
 

1713
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,269
interact with each other
so you would either create those

1714
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
so you would either create those
 

1715
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,669
so you would either create those
molecules to talk to them to make them

1716
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
molecules to talk to them to make them
 

1717
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,110
molecules to talk to them to make them
do not say talk to them as if they're

1718
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
do not say talk to them as if they're
 

1719
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,310
do not say talk to them as if they're
intelligent but talk to them to

1720
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
intelligent but talk to them to
 

1721
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,710
intelligent but talk to them to
manipulate them in ways that you want

1722
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:16,720
manipulate them in ways that you want
 

1723
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,389
manipulate them in ways that you want
or if you were

1724
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
or if you were
 

1725
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,549
or if you were
advanced enough you would

1726
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:20,559
advanced enough you would
 

1727
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,630
advanced enough you would
use some sort of electromagnetic or

1728
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:22,640
use some sort of electromagnetic or
 

1729
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,590
use some sort of electromagnetic or
other

1730
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
other
 

1731
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,710
other
means to stimulate their neurons in ways

1732
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
means to stimulate their neurons in ways
 

1733
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,269
means to stimulate their neurons in ways
that would accomplish the same goal

1734
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
that would accomplish the same goal
 

1735
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,350
that would accomplish the same goal
as the pheromones but by doing it in a

1736
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,360
as the pheromones but by doing it in a
 

1737
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,070
as the pheromones but by doing it in a
sort of a telefactoring way

1738
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
sort of a telefactoring way
 

1739
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,470
sort of a telefactoring way
so let's say you wanted to tell a factor

1740
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
so let's say you wanted to tell a factor
 

1741
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,909
so let's say you wanted to tell a factor
with humans

1742
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
with humans
 

1743
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,750
with humans
you would

1744
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:39,760
you would
 

1745
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,430
you would
interact with them and this is again

1746
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:41,440
interact with them and this is again
 

1747
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,950
interact with them and this is again
this is a technology which you could

1748
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
this is a technology which you could
 

1749
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,350
this is a technology which you could
imagine possible

1750
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
imagine possible
 

1751
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,510
imagine possible
you could telefactor information into

1752
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
you could telefactor information into
 

1753
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,630
you could telefactor information into
the sensory system of a human right but

1754
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
the sensory system of a human right but
 

1755
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,750
the sensory system of a human right but
then

1756
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
then
 

1757
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,269
then
each human is a little bit different so

1758
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
each human is a little bit different so
 

1759
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,430
each human is a little bit different so
either you know enough about them to

1760
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
either you know enough about them to
 

1761
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,509
either you know enough about them to
tailor it to that individual or you just

1762
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
tailor it to that individual or you just
 

1763
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,190
tailor it to that individual or you just
basically take advantage of whatever the

1764
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,200
basically take advantage of whatever the
 

1765
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,070
basically take advantage of whatever the
sensory net is that that individual has

1766
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
sensory net is that that individual has
 

1767
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,669
sensory net is that that individual has
so if you happen to be

1768
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
so if you happen to be
 

1769
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,230
so if you happen to be
good at sound or you happen to be a very

1770
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:06,240
good at sound or you happen to be a very
 

1771
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,230
good at sound or you happen to be a very
visually inclined individual

1772
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
visually inclined individual
 

1773
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,070
visually inclined individual
then maybe the sensory information that

1774
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
then maybe the sensory information that
 

1775
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,190
then maybe the sensory information that
you get

1776
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
you get
 

1777
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,590
you get
that's most effective

1778
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
that's most effective
 

1779
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,029
that's most effective
in terms of transmitting information

1780
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
in terms of transmitting information
 

1781
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,029
in terms of transmitting information
would come through that portal

1782
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:17,039
would come through that portal
 

1783
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,269
would come through that portal
i think the aliens would need to figure

1784
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:19,279
i think the aliens would need to figure
 

1785
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,750
i think the aliens would need to figure
out that humans value physical

1786
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
out that humans value physical
 

1787
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,110
out that humans value physical
consistency so we've discovered physics

1788
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,120
consistency so we've discovered physics
 

1789
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,310
consistency so we've discovered physics
so we want our perception to make sense

1790
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
so we want our perception to make sense
 

1791
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,389
so we want our perception to make sense
maybe they don't they haven't you know

1792
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
maybe they don't they haven't you know
 

1793
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,789
maybe they don't they haven't you know
that's not an obvious fact of perception

1794
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
that's not an obvious fact of perception
 

1795
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,909
that's not an obvious fact of perception
that

1796
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
that
 

1797
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,149
that
you have to figure out what kind of

1798
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
you have to figure out what kind of
 

1799
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,190
you have to figure out what kind of
things are humans used to observing in

1800
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:39,200
things are humans used to observing in
 

1801
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,430
things are humans used to observing in
this particular environment of earth

1802
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
this particular environment of earth
 

1803
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,750
this particular environment of earth
and how do we stimulate the perception

1804
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
and how do we stimulate the perception
 

1805
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,789
and how do we stimulate the perception
system

1806
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
system
 

1807
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,470
system
in a way that's uh not anomalous or not

1808
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
in a way that's uh not anomalous or not
 

1809
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,950
in a way that's uh not anomalous or not
too doesn't cross the threshold of just

1810
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
too doesn't cross the threshold of just
 

1811
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,590
too doesn't cross the threshold of just
like well that's way too weird right so

1812
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
like well that's way too weird right so
 

1813
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,909
like well that's way too weird right so
they have to i mean that's not obvious

1814
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
they have to i mean that's not obvious
 

1815
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,830
they have to i mean that's not obvious
that that should be important

1816
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
that that should be important
 

1817
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,590
that that should be important
you know maybe you want to err on the

1818
00:31:59,590 --> 00:31:59,600
you know maybe you want to err on the
 

1819
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,269
you know maybe you want to err on the

becoming in some distant future so is

1850
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:34,320
becoming in some distant future so is
 

1851
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,750

that a purposeful representation

1852
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:37,760
that a purposeful representation

00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:39,679
i i don't know i mean i don't believe in
 

1855
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,710
i i don't know i mean i don't believe in
the grays for instance but i believe

1856
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:42,720
the grays for instance but i believe
 

1857
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,470
the grays for instance but i believe
that people think that they see it

so if we're talking about a
 

1861
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,230
so if we're talking about a
communication strategy that says

1862
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
communication strategy that says
 

1863
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,350
communication strategy that says
you know we're we're like you but not

1864

that you represent
 

1871
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,630
that you represent
in terms of a communication strategy

1981
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,829
nice to remove
some of the stigma about this topic

1982
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
some of the stigma about this topic
 

1983
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,710
some of the stigma about this topic
because it's all just data and

1984
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:56,720
because it's all just data and
 

1985
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,069
because it's all just data and
uh and

1986
00:34:58,069 --> 00:34:58,079
uh and
 

1987
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,990
uh and
anomalous events

1988
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
anomalous events
 

1989
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,550
anomalous events
are such that there's going to be

1990
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
are such that there's going to be
 

1991
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,069
are such that there's going to be
they're going to be rare in terms of how

1992
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
they're going to be rare in terms of how
 

1993
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,150
they're going to be rare in terms of how
much data they represent but we have to

1994
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,160
much data they represent but we have to
 

1995
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,550
much data they represent but we have to
consider the full range of data to

1996
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
consider the full range of data to
 

1997
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,310
consider the full range of data to
discover the things that actually

1998
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:10,320
discover the things that actually
 

1999
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,630
discover the things that actually
represent something that's um

2000
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:12,640
represent something that's um
 

2001
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,230
represent something that's um
if we pull at it we'll discover

2002
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
if we pull at it we'll discover
 

2003
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,310
if we pull at it we'll discover
something that's extraterrestrial or

2004
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
something that's extraterrestrial or
 

2005
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,670
something that's extraterrestrial or
something

2006
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:17,680
something
 

2007
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,550
something
deep about the phenomena on earth that

2008
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
deep about the phenomena on earth that
 

2009
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,589
deep about the phenomena on earth that
we don't yet understand right well if it

2010
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:23,599
we don't yet understand right well if it
 

2011
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,390
we don't yet understand right well if it
only stimulates people for instance to

2012
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
only stimulates people for instance to
 

2013
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,790
only stimulates people for instance to
think okay well what happens if we could

2014
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:28,800
think okay well what happens if we could
 

2015
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,790
think okay well what happens if we could
move like that with momentum-less

2016
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:30,800
move like that with momentum-less
 

2017
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,150
move like that with momentum-less
movement

2018
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:32,160
movement
 

2019
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,190
movement
and

2020
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:33,200
and
 

2021
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,270
and
and it stimulates

2022
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:35,280
and it stimulates
 

2023
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,349
and it stimulates
young individuals to go into the

2024
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:37,359
young individuals to go into the
 

2025
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:38,470
young individuals to go into the
sciences

2026
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:38,480
sciences
 

2027
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,670
sciences
to

2028
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:39,680
to
 

2029
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,349
to
ask those questions that to me is

2030
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
ask those questions that to me is
 

2031
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,109
ask those questions that to me is
fascinating i mean after i've been

2032
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
fascinating i mean after i've been
 

2033
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,870
fascinating i mean after i've been
openly talking about this in the last

2034
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:44,880
openly talking about this in the last
 

2035
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,310
openly talking about this in the last
year especially

2036
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
year especially
 

2037
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,790
year especially
i've had a number of

2038
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
i've had a number of
 

2039
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,589
i've had a number of
students from top schools who aren't my

2040
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
students from top schools who aren't my
 

2041
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,230
students from top schools who aren't my
students come to me and say

2042
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
students come to me and say
 

2043
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,310
students come to me and say
if i can help

2044
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:56,320
if i can help
 

2045
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,550
if i can help
let me how can i help i never had

2046
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
let me how can i help i never had
 

2047
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,870
let me how can i help i never had
thought about this before but you opened

2048
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880
thought about this before but you opened
 

2049
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,790
thought about this before but you opened
you and others not just you and others

2050
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:02,800
you and others not just you and others
 

2051
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,030
you and others not just you and others
have opened my mind to thinking about

2052
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,040
have opened my mind to thinking about
 

2053
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,870
have opened my mind to thinking about
this matter yeah that's why it's

2054
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:06,880
this matter yeah that's why it's
 

2055
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,550
this matter yeah that's why it's
actually funny that uh

2056
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:08,560
actually funny that uh
 

2057
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,790
actually funny that uh
elon musk doesn't think too much about

2058
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
elon musk doesn't think too much about
 

2059
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:13,190
elon musk doesn't think too much about
this

2060
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,200
this
 

2061
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,710
this
these kinds of propulsion systems that

2062
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
these kinds of propulsion systems that
 

2063
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,710
these kinds of propulsion systems that
could defy the laws of physics as we

2064
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
could defy the laws of physics as we
 

2065
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,550
could defy the laws of physics as we
currently understand them

2066
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:18,560
currently understand them
 

2067
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,670
currently understand them
to me

2068
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
to me
 

2069
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,829
to me
it's a powerful way to think what is

2070
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:21,839
it's a powerful way to think what is
 

2071
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,510
it's a powerful way to think what is
possible

2072
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
possible
 

2073
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,550
possible
it's uh it's inspiring even if somebody

2074
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:26,560
it's uh it's inspiring even if somebody
 

2075
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,470
it's uh it's inspiring even if somebody
doesn't represent uh

2076
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:28,480
doesn't represent uh
 

2077
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,870
doesn't represent uh
uh extraterrestrial vehicles i think the

2078
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:30,880
uh extraterrestrial vehicles i think the
 

2079
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,510
uh extraterrestrial vehicles i think the
the observation itself it's like uh

2080
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:33,520
the observation itself it's like uh
 

2081
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,870
the observation itself it's like uh
something you mentioned

2082
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
something you mentioned
 

2083
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,430
something you mentioned
which is uh you know hypothesizing

2084
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
which is uh you know hypothesizing
 

2085
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,950
which is uh you know hypothesizing
imagining

2086
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
imagining
 

2087
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,470
imagining
these things

2088
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
these things
 

2089
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,310
these things

things
 

2093
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,190
things
i think opens up your mind

2094
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,200
i think opens up your mind
 

2095
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,270
i think opens up your mind
in a way that uh

2096
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
in a way that uh
 

2097
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,270
in a way that uh
ultimately can create the technology

2098
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
ultimately can create the technology
 

2099
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,870
ultimately can create the technology
first you have to believe the

2100
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
first you have to believe the
 

2101
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,550
first you have to believe the
technologies possible before you can

2102
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:52,560
technologies possible before you can
 

2103
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,910
technologies possible before you can
create it right

2104
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:53,920
create it right
 

2105
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,030
create it right
in my own lab you know we always look

2106
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:57,040
in my own lab you know we always look
 

2107
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:57,829
in my own lab you know we always look
for

2108
00:36:57,829 --> 00:36:57,839
for
 

2109
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,790
for
as i've said before what is inevitable

2110
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
as i've said before what is inevitable
 

2111
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,430
as i've said before what is inevitable
and you know saying inevitably this is

2112
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:03,440
and you know saying inevitably this is
 

2113
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,589
and you know saying inevitably this is
the kind of data we need but if we need

2114
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
the kind of data we need but if we need
 

2115
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,390
the kind of data we need but if we need
that kind of data the instrument we want

2116
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
that kind of data the instrument we want
 

2117
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,430
that kind of data the instrument we want
isn't

2118
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:09,440
isn't
 

2119
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,710
isn't
doesn't exist

2120
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
doesn't exist
 

2121
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,349
doesn't exist
okay so i imagine the perfect instrument

2122
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
okay so i imagine the perfect instrument
 

2123
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:14,790
okay so i imagine the perfect instrument
i can't make it

2124
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:14,800
i can't make it
 

2125
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,990
i can't make it
and you back

2126
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:16,000
and you back
 

2127
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,230
and you back
into something which is practical

2128
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
into something which is practical
 

2129
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,270
into something which is practical
and then you in a sense reverse engineer

2130
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
and then you in a sense reverse engineer
 

2131
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,390
and then you in a sense reverse engineer
the future

2132
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
the future
 

2133
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,470
the future
of what it is that you want to make

2134
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:24,480
of what it is that you want to make
 

2135
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,510
of what it is that you want to make
and i've started and sold like

2136
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:27,520
and i've started and sold like
 

2137
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,990
and i've started and sold like
at least half a dozen or more companies

2138
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
at least half a dozen or more companies
 

2139
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,310
at least half a dozen or more companies
using that basic premise

2140
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320
using that basic premise
 

2141
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,510
using that basic premise
and so

2142
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
and so
 

2143
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,030
and so
it was always something that didn't

2144
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,040
it was always something that didn't
 

2145
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,270
it was always something that didn't
exist today but we imagined what we

2146
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
exist today but we imagined what we
 

2147
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,630
exist today but we imagined what we
wanted

2148
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
wanted
 

2149
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,710
wanted
and at the time many people said it

2150
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
and at the time many people said it
 

2151
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,710
and at the time many people said it
couldn't be done i mean for instance all

2152
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:42,720
couldn't be done i mean for instance all
 

2153
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,390
couldn't be done i mean for instance all
the gene therapy that's done today with

2154
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
the gene therapy that's done today with
 

2155
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,069
the gene therapy that's done today with
retroviruses

2156
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
retroviruses
 

2157
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,349
retroviruses
came from

2158
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
came from
 

2159
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,829
came from
a group meeting in david baltimore's lab

2160
00:37:49,829 --> 00:37:49,839
a group meeting in david baltimore's lab
 

2161
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,990
a group meeting in david baltimore's lab
i was a postdoc with him

2162
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:52,000
i was a postdoc with him
 

2163
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,790
i was a postdoc with him
and one of the other postdocs

2164
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:54,800
and one of the other postdocs
 

2165
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,190
and one of the other postdocs
wasn't able to you make retroviruses in

2166
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,200
wasn't able to you make retroviruses in
 

2167
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,670
wasn't able to you make retroviruses in
a way that he wanted to and i realized i

2168
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
a way that he wanted to and i realized i
 

2169
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,349
a way that he wanted to and i realized i
had a cell line that would allow us to

2170
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
had a cell line that would allow us to
 

2171
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,670
had a cell line that would allow us to
make retroviruses in two days rather

2172
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:03,680
make retroviruses in two days rather
 

2173
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,510
make retroviruses in two days rather
than two months

2174
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
than two months
 

2175
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,069
than two months
and so he and i then worked together to

2176
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
and so he and i then worked together to
 

2177
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,230
and so he and i then worked together to
make that system and now all gene

2178
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:10,240
make that system and now all gene
 

2179
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,990
make that system and now all gene
therapy with retroviruses is done using

2180
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
therapy with retroviruses is done using
 

2181
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,750
therapy with retroviruses is done using
this basic approach around the whole

2182
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
this basic approach around the whole
 

2183
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,190
this basic approach around the whole
world because something couldn't be done

2184
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
world because something couldn't be done
 

2185
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,190
world because something couldn't be done
and we wanted to do it better

2186
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
and we wanted to do it better
 

2187
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,910
and we wanted to do it better
and we imagined the future

2188
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:21,920
and we imagined the future
 

2189
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,390
and we imagined the future
and so that's i think

2190
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,400
and so that's i think
 

2191
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,430
and so that's i think
what the whole ufo phenomenon is doing

2192
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440
what the whole ufo phenomenon is doing
 

2193
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,030
what the whole ufo phenomenon is doing
for people it's like well let's imagine

2194
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
for people it's like well let's imagine
 

2195
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,870
for people it's like well let's imagine
a future

2196
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
a future
 

2197
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,870
a future
where these kinds of technologies are

2198
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:32,880
where these kinds of technologies are
 

2199
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,310
where these kinds of technologies are
but also let's imagine a future where we

2200
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:34,320
but also let's imagine a future where we
 

2201
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,390
but also let's imagine a future where we
don't blow ourselves up right so if

2202
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:36,400
don't blow ourselves up right so if
 

2203
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,150
don't blow ourselves up right so if
these things are there they manage to

2204
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
these things are there they manage to
 

2205
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,390
these things are there they manage to
not blow themselves up

2206
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:40,400
not blow themselves up
 

2207
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,030
not blow themselves up
so it means that at least

2208
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
so it means that at least
 

2209
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,589
so it means that at least
one other civilization got past the

2210
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
one other civilization got past the
 

2211
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:47,030
one other civilization got past the
inflection point

2212
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:47,040
inflection point
 

2213
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,710
inflection point
so if some of the encounters are

2214
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:48,720
so if some of the encounters are
 

2215
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,150
so if some of the encounters are
actually representing

2216
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,160
actually representing
 

2217
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,550
actually representing
alien civilizations visiting us

2218
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:52,560
alien civilizations visiting us
 

2219
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,230
alien civilizations visiting us
why do you think

2220
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:54,240
why do you think
 

2221
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,349
why do you think
they're doing so

2222
00:38:57,349 --> 00:38:57,359

 

2223
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,589

you suggested that perhaps it's this

2224
00:38:59,589 --> 00:38:59,599
you suggested that perhaps it's this
 

2225
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,069
you suggested that perhaps it's this
study understand their own past

2226
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:02,079
study understand their own past
 

2227
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,829
study understand their own past
right right what what are some of the

2228
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
right right what what are some of the
 

2229
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,470
right right what what are some of the
motivations do you think and

2230
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:06,480
motivations do you think and
 

2231
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,710
motivations do you think and
again from from our perspective us as

2232
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:08,720
again from from our perspective us as
 

2233
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,950
again from from our perspective us as
humans what motivations would we have

2234
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:10,960
humans what motivations would we have
 

2235
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,950
humans what motivations would we have
when we approach other civilizations we

2236
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
when we approach other civilizations we
 

2237
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,870
when we approach other civilizations we
may discover in the future

2238
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
may discover in the future
 

2239
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,470
may discover in the future
well i think one motivation might be to

2240
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
well i think one motivation might be to
 

2241
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,750
well i think one motivation might be to
steer us away from the precipice

2242
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:21,760
steer us away from the precipice
 

2243
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,349
steer us away from the precipice
right or on the assumption that you know

2244
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
right or on the assumption that you know
 

2245
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,589
right or on the assumption that you know
even if we make it past the precipice at

2246
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:27,599
even if we make it past the precipice at
 

2247
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,550
even if we make it past the precipice at
least

2248
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:28,560
least
 

2249
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,349
least
uh we're not a bunch of psychopaths you

2250
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
uh we're not a bunch of psychopaths you
 

2251
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,750
uh we're not a bunch of psychopaths you
know running around so maybe there's a

2252
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
know running around so maybe there's a
 

2253
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,510
know running around so maybe there's a
little bit of motivation there to make

2254
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:35,520
little bit of motivation there to make
 

2255
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,109
little bit of motivation there to make
sure that your the neighbor that's

2256
00:39:37,109 --> 00:39:37,119
sure that your the neighbor that's
 

2257
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,190
sure that your the neighbor that's
growing up next to you is not

2258
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
growing up next to you is not
 

2259
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,109
growing up next to you is not
you know unruly

2260
00:39:41,109 --> 00:39:41,119
you know unruly
 

2261
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,390
you know unruly
um

2262
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:42,400
um
 

2263
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,790
um
you know but i mean maybe it's sort of a

2264
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:44,800
you know but i mean maybe it's sort of a
 

2265
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,470
you know but i mean maybe it's sort of a
moral imperative

2266
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:46,480
moral imperative
 

2267
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,310
moral imperative
like what we have with you know creating

2268
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:50,320
like what we have with you know creating
 

2269
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,750
like what we have with you know creating
uh

2270
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:51,760
uh
 

2271
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,230
uh
national parks where animals can

2272
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,240
national parks where animals can
 

2273
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,710
national parks where animals can
continue to live out their lives in a

2274
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
continue to live out their lives in a
 

2275
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,870
continue to live out their lives in a
natural way

2276
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,880
natural way
 

2277
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,030
natural way
i don't know i mean that would be

2278
00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:01,040
i don't know i mean that would be
 

2279
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,309
i don't know i mean that would be
i mean the problem is we're imagining

2280
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
i mean the problem is we're imagining
 

2281
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,750
i mean the problem is we're imagining
from a

2282
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
from a
 

2283
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,430
from a
anthropomorphic

2284
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
anthropomorphic
 

2285
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,630
anthropomorphic
viewpoint what an alien might think and

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:10,640
viewpoint what an alien might think and
 

2287
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,390
viewpoint what an alien might think and
as i've said before

2288
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
as i've said before
 

2289
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,589
as i've said before
alien means alien right i mean not

2290
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
alien means alien right i mean not
 

2291
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,510
alien means alien right i mean not
hollywood aliens

2292
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:17,520
hollywood aliens
 

2293
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,550
hollywood aliens
but

2294
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
but
 

2295
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,190
but
a whole different way of thinking

2296
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
a whole different way of thinking
 

2297
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,710
a whole different way of thinking
and a whole different level of

2298
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
and a whole different level of
 

2299
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,190
and a whole different level of
experience and let's say wisdom

2300
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,200
experience and let's say wisdom
 

2301
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,950
experience and let's say wisdom
hopefully

2302
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
hopefully
 

2303
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,150
hopefully
that we could only hope to understand

2304
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,160
that we could only hope to understand
 

2305
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,309
that we could only hope to understand
now but if we ever get out there if we

2306
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
now but if we ever get out there if we
 

2307
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,950
now but if we ever get out there if we
ever make it past our

2308
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
ever make it past our
 

2309
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,550
ever make it past our
current problems

2310
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
current problems
 

2311
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,390
current problems
uh and even if we don't have faster than

2312
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:38,400
uh and even if we don't have faster than
 

2313
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,550
uh and even if we don't have faster than
light travel and even if we're only

2314
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:40,560
light travel and even if we're only
 

2315
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,990
light travel and even if we're only
using

2316
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
using
 

2317
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,910
using
ram scoops or

2318
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
ram scoops or
 

2319
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,630
ram scoops or
light sails to get where we want to go

2320
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,640
light sails to get where we want to go
 

2321
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,150
light sails to get where we want to go
uh and it takes us

2322
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
uh and it takes us
 

2323
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,870
uh and it takes us
10 000 years to get somewhere or to

2324
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:50,880
10 000 years to get somewhere or to
 

2325
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,510
10 000 years to get somewhere or to
spread out um we might encounter such

2326
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:53,520
spread out um we might encounter such
 

2327
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,790
spread out um we might encounter such
things and are we just going to stomp

2328
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
things and are we just going to stomp
 

2329
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,230
things and are we just going to stomp
all over it

2330
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,240
all over it
 

2331
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,829
all over it
like we did in colonial south america or

2332
00:40:59,829 --> 00:40:59,839
like we did in colonial south america or
 

2333
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:01,990
like we did in colonial south america or
africa or all the rest

2334
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,000
africa or all the rest
 

2335
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,230
africa or all the rest
on our current path likely

2336
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:04,240
on our current path likely
 

2337
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,510
on our current path likely
you know and so what are we going to

2338
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:05,520
you know and so what are we going to
 

2339
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,470
you know and so what are we going to
learn

2340
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
learn
 

2341
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,630
learn
well we're getting better and better at

2342
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:08,640
well we're getting better and better at
 

2343
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,829
well we're getting better and better at
understanding what is life

2344
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
understanding what is life
 

2345
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,430
understanding what is life
and i think we're getting better and

2346
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
and i think we're getting better and
 

2347
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,829
and i think we're getting better and
better being careful not to step on it

2348
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
better being careful not to step on it
 

2349
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,790
better being careful not to step on it
when we when we see it and i i this is

2350
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
when we when we see it and i i this is
 

2351
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,150
when we when we see it and i i this is
one of the nice things about talking

2352
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
one of the nice things about talking
 

2353
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,510
one of the nice things about talking
about ufos

2354
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
about ufos
 

2355
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,470
about ufos
is it expands the overton window it

2356
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:24,480
is it expands the overton window it
 

2357
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,230
is it expands the overton window it
expands our understanding of what

2358
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:26,240
expands our understanding of what
 

2359
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,309
expands our understanding of what
possibly could be life

2360
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
possibly could be life
 

2361
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,069
possibly could be life
it gets us to think it gets the

2362
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:30,079
it gets us to think it gets the
 

2363
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,390
it gets us to think it gets the
scientific community to think when we go

2364
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:32,400
scientific community to think when we go
 

2365
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,390
scientific community to think when we go
to mars go and we go to these different

2366
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
to mars go and we go to these different
 

2367
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,630
to mars go and we go to these different
moons that possibly have life

2368
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:36,640
moons that possibly have life
 

2369
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,870
moons that possibly have life
you know we're not looking at uh legged

2370
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
you know we're not looking at uh legged
 

2371
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,150
you know we're not looking at uh legged
organisms

2372
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
organisms
 

2373
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:43,030
organisms
we're looking at some kind of

2374
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,040
we're looking at some kind of
 

2375
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,270
we're looking at some kind of
complexity

2376
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
complexity
 

2377
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,670
complexity
that uh

2378
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:47,680
that uh
 

2379
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,470
that uh
arises in resistance to the natural

2380
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:50,480
arises in resistance to the natural
 

2381
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,829
arises in resistance to the natural
world

2382
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
world
 

2383
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,030
world
and um

2384
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,040
and um
 

2385
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,550
and um
there's a lot of instruments like that

2386
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
there's a lot of instruments like that
 

2387
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,510
there's a lot of instruments like that
resistance to the natural world yeah so

2388
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
resistance to the natural world yeah so
 

2389
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,630
resistance to the natural world yeah so
somehow

2390
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:58,640
somehow
 

2391
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,430
somehow
there's a rebellious process complex

2392
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
there's a rebellious process complex
 

2393
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,190
there's a rebellious process complex
system going on here

2394
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:03,200
system going on here
 

2395
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,270
system going on here
and i don't know you know the many ways

2396
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
and i don't know you know the many ways
 

2397
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,069
and i don't know you know the many ways
it could take form and there's a sense

2398
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
it could take form and there's a sense
 

2399
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:10,870
it could take form and there's a sense
you know for aliens that

2400
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
you know for aliens that
 

2401
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,109
you know for aliens that
as the technology develops they take

2402
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:13,119
as the technology develops they take
 

2403
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,630
as the technology develops they take
form more and more

2404
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:14,640
form more and more
 

2405
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,710
form more and more
in as information

2406
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:16,720
in as information
 

2407
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,710
in as information
as something that can influence the

of ideas of the
 

2413
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,670
of ideas of the
processing of data itself so i just uh

2414
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
processing of data itself so i just uh
 

2415
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,150
processing of data itself so i just uh
this idea of embodiment that we humans

2416
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:28,160
this idea of embodiment that we humans
 

2417
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,230
this idea of embodiment that we humans
so admire

2418
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
so admire
 

2419
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,950
so admire
physically visible perceivable

2420
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:32,960
physically visible perceivable
 

2421
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,309
physically visible perceivable
embodiment

2422
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
embodiment
 

2423
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:36,790
embodiment
may be a very

2424
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:36,800
may be a very
 

2425
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,950
may be a very
uh inefficient thing

2426
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:38,960
uh inefficient thing
 

2427
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,190
uh inefficient thing
right if you think just about

2428
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,200
right if you think just about
 

2429
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,470
right if you think just about
you know your area ai you know we're

2430
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:44,480
you know your area ai you know we're
 

2431
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,430
you know your area ai you know we're
we're

2432
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:45,440
we're
 

2433
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:47,190
we're
trying to make smaller and smaller and

2434
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
trying to make smaller and smaller and
 

2435
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,470
trying to make smaller and smaller and
smaller

2436
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,480
smaller
 

2437
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,470
smaller
uh circuitry

2438
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
uh circuitry
 

2439
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,109
uh circuitry
that is uh

2440
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
that is uh
 

2441
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,550
that is uh
basically

2442
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:54,560
basically
 

2443
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,230
basically
closer and closer to the physics of how

2444
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,240
closer and closer to the physics of how
 

2445
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,069
closer and closer to the physics of how
the universe operates

2446
00:43:00,069 --> 00:43:00,079
the universe operates
 

2447
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,750
the universe operates
right right down at the level of i mean

2448
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:01,760
right right down at the level of i mean
 

2449
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,270
right right down at the level of i mean
quantum computers are basically write

2450
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
quantum computers are basically write
 

2451
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,670
quantum computers are basically write
down about quantum information storage

2452
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
down about quantum information storage
 

2453
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,109
down about quantum information storage
so

2454
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
so
 

2455
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,030
so
fast forward ten thousand a hundred

2456
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
fast forward ten thousand a hundred
 

2457
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,470
fast forward ten thousand a hundred
thousand years

2458
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:10,480
thousand years
 

2459
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,790
thousand years
maybe somebody found a way to embody ai

2460
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
maybe somebody found a way to embody ai
 

2461
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,470
maybe somebody found a way to embody ai
directly into the physics of the

2462
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:14,480
directly into the physics of the
 

2463
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,430
directly into the physics of the
universe

2464
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:15,440
universe
 

2465
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,309
universe
right

2466
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:16,319
right
 

2467
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,150
right
and it doesn't require a physical

2468
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:18,160
and it doesn't require a physical
 

2469
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,589
and it doesn't require a physical
manifestation it just it just sits in

2470
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
manifestation it just it just sits in
 

2471
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:22,710
manifestation it just it just sits in
space-time

2472
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
space-time
 

2473
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,430
space-time
it's just a locally ordered space we're

2474
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
it's just a locally ordered space we're
 

2475
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,589
it's just a locally ordered space we're
just locally ordered space time

2476
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599
just locally ordered space time
 

2477
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:28,710
just locally ordered space time
right

2478
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
right
 

2479
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,309
right
you know i mean people

2480
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
you know i mean people
 

2481
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,910
you know i mean people
but maybe they just they found a way to

2482
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:31,920
but maybe they just they found a way to
 

2483
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,750
but maybe they just they found a way to
embody it there

2484
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:33,760
embody it there
 

2485
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,510
embody it there
they probably have to get really good at

2486
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
they probably have to get really good at
 

2487
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,790
they probably have to get really good at
not you know trampling on the ants

2488
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
not you know trampling on the ants
 

2489
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,390
not you know trampling on the ants
the the better your technology gets the

2490
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
the the better your technology gets the
 

2491
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,150
the the better your technology gets the
easier it is to accidentally like oops

2492
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,160
easier it is to accidentally like oops
 

2493
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,870
easier it is to accidentally like oops
just destroy these simpleton biological

2494
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:46,880
just destroy these simpleton biological
 

2495
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,910
just destroy these simpleton biological
systems

2496
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:47,920
systems
 

2497
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,589
systems
we constantly think about whatever these

2498
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
we constantly think about whatever these
 

2499
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,670
we constantly think about whatever these
things might be we think

2500
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
things might be we think
 

2501
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,710
things might be we think
that they are some sort of a unified

2502
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
that they are some sort of a unified
 

2503
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:55,990
that they are some sort of a unified
force

2504
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,000
force
 

2505
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,710
force
well maybe they're not unified

2506
00:43:58,710 --> 00:43:58,720
well maybe they're not unified
 

2507
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,870
well maybe they're not unified
maybe they are as disparate

2508
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
maybe they are as disparate
 

2509
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,870
maybe they are as disparate
as you and i are

2510
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:02,880
as you and i are
 

2511
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,109
as you and i are
and maybe what keeps them

2512
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
and maybe what keeps them
 

2513
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,870
and maybe what keeps them
from stomping all over the ants is each

2514
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
from stomping all over the ants is each
 

2515
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,790
from stomping all over the ants is each
other

2516
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:08,800
other
 

2517
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,510
other
right that they are in a self tension

2518
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:11,520
right that they are in a self tension
 

2519
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,390
right that they are in a self tension
to

2520
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:12,400
to
 

2521
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,990
to
prevent

2522
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:14,000
prevent
 

2523
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,750
prevent
one or more of them from running amok

2524
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:17,760
one or more of them from running amok
 

2525
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,750
one or more of them from running amok
oh yeah i mean that's kind of the

2526
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:19,760
oh yeah i mean that's kind of the
 

2527
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,670
oh yeah i mean that's kind of the
anarchy of nations that we have on earth

2528
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:21,680
anarchy of nations that we have on earth
 

2529
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,390
anarchy of nations that we have on earth
so

2530
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
so
 

2531
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,030
so
there's there's always

2532
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,040
there's there's always
 

2533
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,109
there's there's always
there's always going to be this um

2534
00:44:27,109 --> 00:44:27,119
there's always going to be this um
 

2535
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,710
there's always going to be this um
there's a hierarchy this hierarchy

2536
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
there's a hierarchy this hierarchy
 

2537
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,390
there's a hierarchy this hierarchy
that's formed of greater and greater

2538
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
that's formed of greater and greater
 

2539
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,150
that's formed of greater and greater
intelligences right and they're all

2540
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
intelligences right and they're all
 

2541
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,309
intelligences right and they're all
probably also wondering

2542
00:44:34,309 --> 00:44:34,319
probably also wondering
 

2543
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,550
probably also wondering
wait what's bigger than me exactly

2544
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:36,560
wait what's bigger than me exactly
 

2545
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,150
wait what's bigger than me exactly
that's what i always wonder is that

2546
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:38,160
that's what i always wonder is that
 

2547
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,069
that's what i always wonder is that
maybe that they're what keeps them in

2548
00:44:40,069 --> 00:44:40,079
maybe that they're what keeps them in
 

2549
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,030
maybe that they're what keeps them in
line

2550
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
line
 

2551
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,829

is something that is beyond them like

2552
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
is something that is beyond them like
 

2553
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,750
is something that is beyond them like
what created the universe i mean that

2554
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:45,760
what created the universe i mean that
 

2555
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,349
what created the universe i mean that
and that's probably a question that

2556
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
and that's probably a question that
 

2557
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,349
and that's probably a question that
bothers them too

2558
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:49,359
bothers them too
 

2559
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,750
bothers them too
um what about the communication task

2560
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:51,760
um what about the communication task
 

2561
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:52,950
um what about the communication task
itself

2562
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:52,960
itself
 

2563
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,630
itself
how hard do you think it is for aliens

2564
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:54,640
how hard do you think it is for aliens
 

2565
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,109
how hard do you think it is for aliens
to communicate with humans so is this

2566
00:44:57,109 --> 00:44:57,119
to communicate with humans so is this
 

2567
00:44:57,119 --> 00:44:59,510
to communicate with humans so is this
something you um

2568
00:44:59,510 --> 00:44:59,520
something you um
 

2569
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,270
something you um
think about about this barrier of

2570
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
think about about this barrier of
 

2571
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,270
think about about this barrier of
communication between biological systems

2572
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
communication between biological systems
 

2573
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,870
communication between biological systems
and something else

2574
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
and something else
 

2575
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:06,710
and something else
how difficult is it to find a common

2576
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
how difficult is it to find a common
 

2577
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,470
how difficult is it to find a common
language

2578
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
language
 

2579
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:11,109
language
well i think if you're smart enough

2580
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
well i think if you're smart enough
 

2581
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:14,630
well i think if you're smart enough
or technologically enabled enough it's

2582
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:14,640
or technologically enabled enough it's
 

2583
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,109
or technologically enabled enough it's
relatively straightforward

2584
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
relatively straightforward
 

2585
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,270
relatively straightforward
um now

2586
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
um now
 

2587
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,510
um now
whether your concepts

2588
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520

 

2589
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,270

can ever be dumbed down to us

2590
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
can ever be dumbed down to us
 

2591
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,910
can ever be dumbed down to us
that might be hard

2592
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
that might be hard
 

2593
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,470
that might be hard
i mean again talking to the ants talking

2594
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
i mean again talking to the ants talking
 

2595
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,190
i mean again talking to the ants talking
to the ants i mean on instagram

2596
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
to the ants i mean on instagram
 

2597
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,510
to the ants i mean on instagram
so

2598
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:36,520
so
 

2599
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:38,150
so
[Laughter]

2600
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:38,160
[Laughter]
 

2601
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,589
[Laughter]
you want to look good in this picture

2602
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
you want to look good in this picture
 

2603
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,829
you want to look good in this picture
let me explain let me explain to you why

2604
00:45:41,829 --> 00:45:41,839
let me explain let me explain to you why
 

2605
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:44,069
let me explain let me explain to you why
yeah

2606
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079

 

2607
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:44,950

so

2608
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:44,960
so
 

2609
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,270
so
that's the essential problem of

2610
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
that's the essential problem of
 

2611
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,109
that's the essential problem of
you know

2612
00:45:49,109 --> 00:45:49,119
you know
 

2613
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,589
you know
perhaps they realize

2614
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
perhaps they realize
 

2615
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,150
perhaps they realize
who it is that they're talking to

2616
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:54,160
who it is that they're talking to
 

2617
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,470
who it is that they're talking to
and they say we're

2618
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:56,480
and they say we're
 

2619
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,150
and they say we're
rather than muddy the picture we're only

2620
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:58,160
rather than muddy the picture we're only
 

2621
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,790
rather than muddy the picture we're only
going to give them limited information

2622
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
going to give them limited information
 

2623
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,510
going to give them limited information
yeah right and yeah maybe we could sit

2624
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
yeah right and yeah maybe we could sit
 

2625
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,270
yeah right and yeah maybe we could sit
down like you and i and have a

2626
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,280
down like you and i and have a
 

2627
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,430
down like you and i and have a
conversation but then they would make

2628
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:07,440
conversation but then they would make
 

2629
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,870
conversation but then they would make
assumptions

2630
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:08,880
assumptions
 

2631
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,309
assumptions
the humans would then make assumptions

2632
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
the humans would then make assumptions
 

2633
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,829
the humans would then make assumptions
about us that aren't true

2634
00:46:11,829 --> 00:46:11,839
about us that aren't true
 

2635
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,430
about us that aren't true
because we're not humans

2636
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
because we're not humans
 

2637
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,470
because we're not humans
right so

2638
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
right so
 

2639
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:17,430
right so
let's stay at arm's length

2640
00:46:17,430 --> 00:46:17,440
let's stay at arm's length
 

2641
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,910
let's stay at arm's length
let's just let them know that

2642
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
let's just let them know that
 

2643
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,270
let's just let them know that
we're here

2644
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
we're here
 

2645
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,950
we're here
right and here's the limited amount of

2646
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:22,960
right and here's the limited amount of
 

2647
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:24,710
right and here's the limited amount of
communication again this this notion

2648
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
communication again this this notion
 

2649
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,470
communication again this this notion
that

2650
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:26,480
that
 

2651
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,390
that
if you give somebody everything they'll

2652
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:28,400
if you give somebody everything they'll
 

2653
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,390
if you give somebody everything they'll
get lazy

2654
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
get lazy
 

2655
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,870
get lazy
and you know if if they've been around

2656
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:32,880
and you know if if they've been around
 

2657
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,950
and you know if if they've been around
as long as they have they've seen every

2658
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
as long as they have they've seen every
 

2659
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,510
as long as they have they've seen every
kind of thing that can go wrong

2660
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:37,520
kind of thing that can go wrong
 

2661
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,230
kind of thing that can go wrong
and so it's it's they know as much as

2662
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:40,240
and so it's it's they know as much as
 

2663
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,950
and so it's it's they know as much as
they might want to step in

2664
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:42,960
they might want to step in
 

2665
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,510
they might want to step in
that would be a wrong thing

2666
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:45,520
that would be a wrong thing
 

2667
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,190
that would be a wrong thing
yeah you have to also understand that

2668
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:47,200
yeah you have to also understand that
 

2669
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:50,150
yeah you have to also understand that
the the amount of wisdom they carry

2670
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
the the amount of wisdom they carry
 

2671
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,150
the the amount of wisdom they carry
yeah

2672
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,160
yeah
 

2673
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,150
yeah
you know and so it's it's very easy as

2674
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,160
you know and so it's it's very easy as
 

2675
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,950
you know and so it's it's very easy as
well for religions to i don't want i

2676
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:56,960
well for religions to i don't want i
 

2677
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,150
well for religions to i don't want i
don't want to get into a whole religious

2678
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:58,160
don't want to get into a whole religious
 

2679
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,309
don't want to get into a whole religious
conversation but you could very easy for

2680
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:00,319
conversation but you could very easy for
 

2681
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:02,550
conversation but you could very easy for
rel you could see how religions

2682
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:02,560
rel you could see how religions
 

2683
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,910
rel you could see how religions
could call them angels or devils or

2684
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:05,920
could call them angels or devils or
 

2685
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:07,829
could call them angels or devils or
what have you because

2686
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
what have you because
 

2687
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,190
what have you because
again if you're trying to fit it into a

2688
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
again if you're trying to fit it into a
 

2689
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,750
again if you're trying to fit it into a
framework of cultural understanding

2690
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:11,760
framework of cultural understanding
 

2691
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:14,150
framework of cultural understanding
um the first thing you reach for

2692
00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:14,160
um the first thing you reach for
 

2693
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,910
um the first thing you reach for
is god

2694
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:15,920
is god
 

2695
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,510
is god
and so

2696
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:17,520
and so
 

2697
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,710
and so
it

2698
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
it
 

2699
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,150
it
when you when you look at what these

2700
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:20,160
when you when you look at what these
 

2701
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,790
when you when you look at what these
things are and again with the angels and

2702
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
things are and again with the angels and
 

2703
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,790
things are and again with the angels and
the devils in a similar sort of way

2704
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
the devils in a similar sort of way
 

2705
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,270
the devils in a similar sort of way
their communication is limited

2706
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:29,280
their communication is limited
 

2707
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,109
their communication is limited
they just kind of give little

2708
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:31,119
they just kind of give little
 

2709
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,270
they just kind of give little
what's the the oracle of delphi they

2710
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:33,280
what's the the oracle of delphi they
 

2711
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,349
what's the the oracle of delphi they
kind of give these delphic

2712
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
kind of give these delphic
 

2713
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,270
kind of give these delphic
pronouncements and then it's up to you

2714
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
pronouncements and then it's up to you
 

2715
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,309
pronouncements and then it's up to you
to figure out what it is that they

2716
00:47:38,309 --> 00:47:38,319
to figure out what it is that they
 

2717
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,950
to figure out what it is that they
really mean

the students do the work and figured out
 

2775
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,670
the students do the work and figured out
the answer

2776
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:43,680
the answer
 

2777
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,750
the answer
uh and then we help them put together

2778
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
uh and then we help them put together
 

2779
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,430
uh and then we help them put together
the story

uh
 

2783
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,470
uh
and the story was simply that uh it was

2784
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
and the story was simply that uh it was
 

2785
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,069
and the story was simply that uh it was
human a hundred percent

i went into it thinking it was

00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:55,359
i went into it thinking it was
 

2789
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,109
i went into it thinking it was
originally a monkey

right can you describe some of the
characteristics of the skeleton that

2804
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:08,800
characteristics of the skeleton that
 

2805
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,309
characteristics of the skeleton that
makes it unique and interesting

2806
00:49:10,309 --> 00:49:10,319
makes it unique and interesting
 

2807
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:12,710
makes it unique and interesting
primarily it had dysmorphias of the of

2808
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
primarily it had dysmorphias of the of
 

2809
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,829
primarily it had dysmorphias of the of
the brain

2810
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:13,839
the brain
 

2811
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,270
the brain
um and so the first thing i did actually

2812
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:15,280
um and so the first thing i did actually
 

2813
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,069
um and so the first thing i did actually
when i got pictures of it i took it to a

2814
00:49:18,069 --> 00:49:18,079
when i got pictures of it i took it to a
 

2815
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,630
when i got pictures of it i took it to a
local expert at stanford

2816
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:20,640
local expert at stanford
 

2817
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,230
local expert at stanford
uh and uh he was um on the paper

2818
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:24,240
uh and uh he was um on the paper
 

2819
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,349
uh and uh he was um on the paper
and uh

2820
00:49:25,349 --> 00:49:25,359
and uh
 

2821
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,549
and uh
he was the world expert in pediatric

2822
00:49:28,549 --> 00:49:28,559
he was the world expert in pediatric
 

2823
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:30,390
he was the world expert in pediatric
bone dysmorphias

2824
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
bone dysmorphias
 

2825
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,109
bone dysmorphias
though he literally wrote the book

2826
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
though he literally wrote the book
 

2827
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:33,990
though he literally wrote the book
and

2828
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,000
and
 

2829
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,510
and
on this because that's what you do you

2830
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:35,520
on this because that's what you do you
 

2831
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,109
on this because that's what you do you
go to an expert when it's outside of

2832
00:49:37,109 --> 00:49:37,119
go to an expert when it's outside of
 

2833
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:39,589
go to an expert when it's outside of
your field of interest and he said well

2834
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:39,599
your field of interest and he said well
 

2835
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,750
your field of interest and he said well
i haven't seen this particular

2836
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
i haven't seen this particular
 

2837
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,870
i haven't seen this particular
collection of mutations before uh or

2838
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:44,880
collection of mutations before uh or
 

2839
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,910
collection of mutations before uh or
this uh this physiology before but

2840
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
this uh this physiology before but
 

2841
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,990
this uh this physiology before but
here's what i think it might be

2842
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:50,000
here's what i think it might be
 

2843
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,190
here's what i think it might be
um and he said but based on the size of

2844
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:53,200
um and he said but based on the size of
 

2845
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,630
um and he said but based on the size of
the of the

2846
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:54,640
the of the
 

2847
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:58,150
the of the
thing and the bone density

2848
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:58,160
thing and the bone density
 

2849
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,630
thing and the bone density
it would appear to be

2850
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
it would appear to be
 

2851
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,790
it would appear to be
like six or seven years old

2852
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:02,800
like six or seven years old
 

2853
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,630
like six or seven years old
now again that's the

2854
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:04,640
now again that's the
 

2855
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,870
now again that's the
that's the thing where i think the lay

2856
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
that's the thing where i think the lay
 

2857
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,790
that's the thing where i think the lay

takes a speculation like that and turns

2862
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:13,520
takes a speculation like that and turns
 

2863
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,270
takes a speculation like that and turns
it into a fact

2864
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,280
it into a fact
 

2865
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,670
it into a fact
no one ever said that it was that age

2866
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:17,680
no one ever said that it was that age
 

2867
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,589
no one ever said that it was that age
we only said that the bones made it look

2868
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
we only said that the bones made it look
 

2869
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,510
we only said that the bones made it look
like it was that age

2870
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:21,520
like it was that age
 

2871
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,309
like it was that age
but then we went back and looked for

2872
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
but then we went back and looked for
 

2873
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,109
but then we went back and looked for
uh

2874
00:50:25,109 --> 00:50:25,119
uh
 

2875
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:27,270
uh
genetic explanations of why things might

2876
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:27,280
genetic explanations of why things might
 

2877
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,870
genetic explanations of why things might
look the way they did

2878
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:28,880
look the way they did
 

2879
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:29,910
look the way they did
and

2880
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
and
 

2881
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,829
and
if you again read the paper it's very

2882
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:31,839
if you again read the paper it's very
 

2883
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:33,750
if you again read the paper it's very
carefully caveated

2884
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:33,760
carefully caveated
 

2885
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:37,109
carefully caveated
to say that these mutations might

2886
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:37,119
to say that these mutations might
 

2887
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,510
to say that these mutations might
result in this but what we did find was

2888
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:39,520
result in this but what we did find was
 

2889
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,829
result in this but what we did find was
an unexpectedly

2890
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
an unexpectedly
 

2891
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,270
an unexpectedly
large number

large number

large number
of mutations associated with bone growth

of mutations associated with bone growth
 

2895
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,910
of mutations associated with bone growth
in this individual and it was just

2896
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
in this individual and it was just
 

2897
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,309
in this individual and it was just
a bad roll of the dice right you roll

2898
00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:52,319
a bad roll of the dice right you roll
 

2899
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,470
a bad roll of the dice right you roll
the dice enough times with enough

2900
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:54,480
the dice enough times with enough
 

2901
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,150

people born every year
 

2903
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,670
people born every year
and someone will

2904
00:50:57,670 --> 00:50:57,680
and someone will
 

2905
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,030
and someone will
roll

2906
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,040
roll
 

2907
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,589
roll
the wrong dice

2908
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:01,599
the wrong dice
 

2909
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,349
the wrong dice
all at once so the sad part about it was

2910
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:05,359
all at once so the sad part about it was
 

2911
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,069
all at once so the sad part about it was
individuals in the ufo community who

2912
00:51:08,069 --> 00:51:08,079
individuals in the ufo community who
 

2913
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,430
individuals in the ufo community who
wanted to think

2914
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:09,440
wanted to think
 

2915
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:12,390
wanted to think
that there was some sort of conspiracy

2916
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:12,400
that there was some sort of conspiracy
 

2917
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,510
that there was some sort of conspiracy
around it

2918
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:13,520
around it
 

2919
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,630
around it
right that

2920
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:14,640
right that
 

2921
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,190
right that
somebody had somehow convinced all of my

2922

somebody had somehow convinced all of my
 

2923

uh to lie

2926
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:19,839
uh to lie
 

2927
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,430
uh to lie
right i mean come on

2928
00:51:21,430 --> 00:51:21,440
right i mean come on
 

2929
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:23,589
right i mean come on
you know i i would lose my i would lose

2930
00:51:23,589 --> 00:51:23,599
you know i i would lose my i would lose
 

2931
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:25,430
you know i i would lose my i would lose
my job first of all

2932
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
my job first of all
 

2933
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,470
my job first of all
uh and they would all be

2934
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:28,480
uh and they would all be
 

2935
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,190
uh and they would all be
uh you know in trouble forever

2936
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
uh you know in trouble forever
 

2937
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,190
uh you know in trouble forever
yeah but also it's just projecting

2938
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:33,200
yeah but also it's just projecting
 

2939
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,510
yeah but also it's just projecting
malevolence onto people that

2940
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
malevolence onto people that
 

2941
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,549
malevolence onto people that
doesn't i don't think exist in normal

the scientific community the kind of

the scientific community the kind of
 

2947
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,829
the scientific community the kind of
people that go into science i mean this

2948
00:51:43,829 --> 00:51:43,839
people that go into science i mean this
 

2949
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:45,430
people that go into science i mean this
is what bothers me with the current

2950
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:45,440
is what bothers me with the current
 

2951
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,349
is what bothers me with the current
distrust of science

2952
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:47,359
distrust of science
 

2953
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:50,870
distrust of science
is there they might be naive they might

2954
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:50,880
is there they might be naive they might
 

2955
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,349
is there they might be naive they might
they might not especially modern science

2956
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:53,359
they might not especially modern science
 

2957
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:55,030
they might not especially modern science
look at the big picture philosophical

2958
00:51:55,030 --> 00:51:55,040
look at the big picture philosophical
 

2959
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,190
look at the big picture philosophical
ethical questions all that kind of stuff

2960
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:57,200
ethical questions all that kind of stuff
 

2961
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,270
ethical questions all that kind of stuff
but ultimately they're

2962
00:51:59,270 --> 00:51:59,280
but ultimately they're
 

2963
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,109
but ultimately they're
uh people with integrity and just a deep

2964
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
uh people with integrity and just a deep
 

2965
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,990
uh people with integrity and just a deep
curiosity for the discovery of cool

2966
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,000
curiosity for the discovery of cool

curiosity for the discovery of cool
little things and there's no

2968
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:08,960
little things and there's no
 

2969
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,390
little things and there's no
um

2970
00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:10,400
um
 

2971
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,870
um
there's no malevolence

2972
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
there's no malevolence
 

2973
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,630
there's no malevolence
broadly speaking in the scientific

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
broadly speaking in the scientific
 

2975
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,670

community
 

2977
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,510
community
so i mean there's a bigger story here

2978
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
so i mean there's a bigger story here
 

2979
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,230
so i mean there's a bigger story here
which is

2980
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240

 

2981
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,670

you know there's a hunger in the

2982
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:21,680
you know there's a hunger in the
 

2983
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,150
you know there's a hunger in the
populace to discover something anomalous

2984
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
populace to discover something anomalous
 

2985
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,589
populace to discover something anomalous
something new

2986
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:25,599
something new
 

2987
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,190
something new
and um you know science has to

2988
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
and um you know science has to
 

2989
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,069
and um you know science has to
be

2990
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
be
 

2991
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,950
be
both open to the anomalous but also

00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:32,960
both open to the anomalous but also
 

2993
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,470
both open to the anomalous but also

00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,480
to reject
 

2995
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,150
to reject
the anomalous when the data doesn't

00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,160
the anomalous when the data doesn't
 

2997
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,510
the anomalous when the data doesn't
support it right

2998
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:37,520
support it right
 

2999
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,349
support it right
what do you make of that you know

3000
00:52:39,349 --> 00:52:39,359
what do you make of that you know

well debunking is a loaded term sort of

the star child skull i said you know i
looked at it i looked at the dna

00:53:16,390 --> 00:53:16,400
looked at it i looked at the dna
 

3041
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,069
looked at it i looked at the dna

another group came in and proved that i

another group came in and proved that i

was right
 

3059
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,790
was right
and it's not about debunking it's about

and it's not about debunking it's about
 

3061
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,589
and it's not about debunking it's about

3065
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,630
cases
off the table i mean the reason i got

00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:38,640
off the table i mean the reason i got
 

3067
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:39,910
off the table i mean the reason i got
interested in is because somebody was

3068
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:39,920
interested in is because somebody was
 

3069
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:40,950
interested in is because somebody was
hyping it

3070
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960
hyping it
 

3071
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,630
hyping it
and not because i wanted to disprove it

3072
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
and not because i wanted to disprove it
 

3073
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,549
and not because i wanted to disprove it
but because i just wanted to know and

3074
00:53:44,549 --> 00:53:44,559
but because i just wanted to know and
 

3075
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:46,069
but because i just wanted to know and
let's get it off the table because it's

3076
00:53:46,069 --> 00:53:46,079
let's get it off the table because it's
 

3077
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:48,309
let's get it off the table because it's
usually the most

3078
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:48,319
usually the most
 

3079
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,790
usually the most
extravagant things that are most likely

3080
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
extravagant things that are most likely
 

3081
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,630
extravagant things that are most likely
to be wrong

3082
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:52,640
to be wrong
 

3083
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:53,990
to be wrong
somewhere

3084
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:54,000
somewhere
 

3085
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,910
somewhere
in the rubble will be something

3086
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
in the rubble will be something
 

3087
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,190
in the rubble will be something
interesting

3088
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,200
interesting
 

3089
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,109
interesting
and so that's what you do you get the

3090
00:53:59,109 --> 00:53:59,119
and so that's what you do you get the
 

3091
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:00,230
and so that's what you do you get the
you get the

3092
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:00,240
you get the
 

3093
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,230
you get the
the dross off the table

3094
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:02,240
the dross off the table
 

3095
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:03,670
the dross off the table
and then somewhere

3096
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
and then somewhere
 

3097
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,750
and then somewhere
in the data will be something worth

3098
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
in the data will be something worth
 

3099
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,430
in the data will be something worth
real inquiry

3100
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
real inquiry
 

3101
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:10,470
real inquiry
and that

3102
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:10,480
and that
 

3103
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,710
and that
if you inquire deeply enough will be

3104
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,720
if you inquire deeply enough will be
 

3105
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,430
if you inquire deeply enough will be
extravagant yes exactly and that's what

3106
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,440
extravagant yes exactly and that's what
 

3107
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,230
extravagant yes exactly and that's what
actually excites scientists is to i mean

3108
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:18,240
actually excites scientists is to i mean
 

3109
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,270
actually excites scientists is to i mean
you want with the rigor of science to

3110
00:54:21,270 --> 00:54:21,280
you want with the rigor of science to
 

3111
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,309
you want with the rigor of science to
actually reveal the extravagant and so

3112
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:24,319
actually reveal the extravagant and so
 

3113
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:26,230
actually reveal the extravagant and so
look at crispr as probably the most

3114
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:26,240
look at crispr as probably the most
 

3115
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,510
look at crispr as probably the most
perfect example of that these weird

3116
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
perfect example of that these weird
 

3117
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,870
perfect example of that these weird
sequences in bacterial genomes all

3118
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:32,880
sequences in bacterial genomes all
 

3119
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,950
sequences in bacterial genomes all
arrayed one after the other with these

3120
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:34,960
arrayed one after the other with these
 

3121
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:37,349
arrayed one after the other with these
strange sequences around them but when

3122
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
strange sequences around them but when
 

3123
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:38,870
strange sequences around them but when
you looked at the sequences they looked

3124
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:38,880
you looked at the sequences they looked
 

3125
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,950
you looked at the sequences they looked
like viruses

3126
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:40,960
like viruses
 

3127
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,030
like viruses
and so how did they get there and lo and

3128
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:43,040
and so how did they get there and lo and
 

3129
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,589
and so how did they get there and lo and
behold after you know a lot of effort

3130
00:54:45,589 --> 00:54:45,599
behold after you know a lot of effort
 

3131
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,270
behold after you know a lot of effort
and work well a couple of nobel prizes

00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:47,280
and work well a couple of nobel prizes
 

3133
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,950
and work well a couple of nobel prizes
went out the door

3134
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
went out the door
 

3135
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,430
went out the door
but these strange

3136
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
but these strange
 

3137
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,549
but these strange
things ended up having extraordinarily

3138
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
things ended up having extraordinarily
 

3139
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,750
things ended up having extraordinarily
extravagant possibilities

3140
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:57,760
extravagant possibilities
 

3141
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,390
extravagant possibilities
you've also looked at ufo materials you

3142
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
you've also looked at ufo materials you
 

3143
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,630
you've also looked at ufo materials you
are in possession of ufo materials

alleged geophone materials that's right

3150
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
alleged geophone materials that's right
 

3151
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,230
alleged geophone materials that's right
some

3152
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
some
 

3153
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,710
some
what's another term weird materials that

00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
what's another term weird materials that
 

3155
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,870
what's another term weird materials that
don't seem to uh

uh
 

3159
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,349
uh
have a story

3160
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:17,359
have a story
 

3161
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:18,710
have a story
they have a story that doesn't seem to

3162
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:18,720
they have a story that doesn't seem to
 

3163
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,270
they have a story that doesn't seem to
be of natural origins but

3164
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:21,280
be of natural origins but
 

3165
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,950
be of natural origins but
it's not

3166
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
it's not
 

3167
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,910
it's not
you know

3168
00:55:23,910 --> 00:55:23,920
you know
 

3169
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,230
you know
there's a process to proving that and

3170
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
there's a process to proving that and
 

3171
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,230
there's a process to proving that and
that process may

3172
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
that process may
 

3173
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,789
that process may
uh take decades if not centuries because

3174
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
uh take decades if not centuries because
 

3175
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,549
uh take decades if not centuries because
you have to keep pulling it

3176
00:55:32,549 --> 00:55:32,559
you have to keep pulling it
 

3177
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,069
you have to keep pulling it
at the string and discover where they

3178
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,079
at the string and discover where they
 

3179
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,710
at the string and discover where they
could possibly come from but anyway you

3180
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:36,720
could possibly come from but anyway you
 

3181
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,349
could possibly come from but anyway you
you're in possession of some

3182
00:55:39,349 --> 00:55:39,359
you're in possession of some
 

3183
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:41,430
you're in possession of some
materials of this kind

3184
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
materials of this kind
 

3185
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,030
materials of this kind
can you um

3186
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
can you um
 

3187
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,750
can you um
describe some of them and maybe also

3188
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
describe some of them and maybe also
 

3189
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,589
describe some of them and maybe also
talk to the process of how you

3190
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
talk to the process of how you
 

3191
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,990
talk to the process of how you
investigate them how do you analyze them

3192
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:50,000
investigate them how do you analyze them
 

3193
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,390
investigate them how do you analyze them
right so let's say that there's two

3194
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:52,400
right so let's say that there's two
 

3195
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,950
right so let's say that there's two
classes of materials that i've

3196
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
classes of materials that i've
 

3197
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,710
classes of materials that i've
been given by people and they're not

3198
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:56,720
been given by people and they're not
 

3199
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,230
been given by people and they're not
given by like the government or anything

3200
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
given by like the government or anything
 

3201
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,069
given by like the government or anything
just given people who've collected them

3202
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
just given people who've collected them
 

3203
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:01,190
just given people who've collected them
and there's a

3204
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
and there's a
 

3205
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,030
and there's a
reasonable chain of evidence associated

3206
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
reasonable chain of evidence associated
 

3207
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,030
reasonable chain of evidence associated
with them that you believe it's not just

3208
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:05,040
with them that you believe it's not just
 

3209
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,430
with them that you believe it's not just
a pebble somebody picked up off a road

3210
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:07,440
a pebble somebody picked up off a road
 

3211
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,349
a pebble somebody picked up off a road
um

3212
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:09,359
um
 

3213
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:10,950
um
there are almost always things that

3214
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:10,960
there are almost always things that
 

3215
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,510
there are almost always things that
people have claimed have either been

3216
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
people have claimed have either been
 

3217
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,230
people have claimed have either been
dropped off as like some sort of a

3218
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
dropped off as like some sort of a
 

3219
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,190
dropped off as like some sort of a
leftover material molten metals

3220
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:19,200
leftover material molten metals
 

3221
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,030
leftover material molten metals
or um

3222
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:21,040
or um
 

3223
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,230
or um
they are

3224
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
they are
 

3225
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,589
they are
from

3226
00:56:23,589 --> 00:56:23,599
from
 

3227
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,549
from
an object that was released from this so

3228
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:26,559
an object that was released from this so
 

3229
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:27,990
an object that was released from this so
that kind of

3230
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,000
that kind of
 

3231
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,270
that kind of
exploded

3232
00:56:29,270 --> 00:56:29,280
exploded
 

3233
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,109
exploded
they're almost always metals

3234
00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:31,119
they're almost always metals
 

3235
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,549
they're almost always metals
i have some couple of things that might

3236
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
i have some couple of things that might
 

3237
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,230
i have some couple of things that might
be biological that are interesting that

3238
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:34,240
be biological that are interesting that
 

3239
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,589
be biological that are interesting that
i haven't really spent a lot of time on

3240
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
i haven't really spent a lot of time on
 

3241
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:36,549
i haven't really spent a lot of time on
yet

3242
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
yet
 

3243
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,349
yet
when you look at a metal you basically

3244
00:56:39,349 --> 00:56:39,359
when you look at a metal you basically
 

3245
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,230
when you look at a metal you basically
well okay what are the elements in it

3246
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
well okay what are the elements in it
 

3247
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,270
well okay what are the elements in it
and what's it made of and so there's

3248
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:45,280
and what's it made of and so there's
 

3249
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:47,750
and what's it made of and so there's
pretty standard approaches to doing that

3250
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
pretty standard approaches to doing that
 

3251
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,589
pretty standard approaches to doing that
most of them involve a technology called

3252
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
most of them involve a technology called
 

3253
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,670
most of them involve a technology called
mass spectrometry uh and there's

3254
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:51,680
mass spectrometry uh and there's
 

3255
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:52,950
mass spectrometry uh and there's
probably about five or six different

3256
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:52,960
probably about five or six different
 

3257
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:54,390
probably about five or six different
kinds of mass spectrometry that you

3258
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
kinds of mass spectrometry that you
 

3259
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,589
kinds of mass spectrometry that you
could bring to bear on answering it

3260
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
could bring to bear on answering it
 

3261
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,589
could bring to bear on answering it
and they either tell you depending upon

3262
00:56:59,589 --> 00:56:59,599
and they either tell you depending upon
 

3263
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,109
and they either tell you depending upon
the limit of the resolution of the

3264
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:01,119
the limit of the resolution of the
 

3265
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:02,069
the limit of the resolution of the
instrument

3266
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:02,079
instrument
 

3267
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,069
instrument
they either tell you the elements that

3268
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
they either tell you the elements that
 

3269
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,030
they either tell you the elements that
are there

3270
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
are there
 

3271
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,789
are there
or they tell you the isotopes that are

3272
00:57:06,789 --> 00:57:06,799
or they tell you the isotopes that are
 

3273
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,309
or they tell you the isotopes that are
there and you're interested not just in

3274
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:08,319
there and you're interested not just in
 

3275
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,230
there and you're interested not just in
knowing whether something is there or

3276
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:10,240
knowing whether something is there or
 

3277
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:12,549
knowing whether something is there or
not you're interested in knowing

3278
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
not you're interested in knowing
 

3279
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,230
not you're interested in knowing
whether they're uh

3280
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
whether they're uh
 

3281
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,750
whether they're uh
you know the

3282
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:15,760
you know the
 

3283
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,990
you know the
the amounts of it the the and in the

3284
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:18,000
the amounts of it the the and in the
 

3285
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,270
the amounts of it the the and in the
case of

3286
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
case of
 

3287
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,870
case of
elements

3288
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
elements
 

3289
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,430
elements
how many different isotopes are there

3290
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
how many different isotopes are there
 

3291
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,190
how many different isotopes are there
and and that's kind of where in some of

and and that's kind of where in some of
 

3293
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,190
and and that's kind of where in some of
these cases it gets interesting

3294
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:27,200
these cases it gets interesting
 

3295
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,349
these cases it gets interesting
right because on in at least one of the

3296

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:30,549
right because on in at least one of the
materials

materials
 

3299
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,950
materials
as we first studied it the isotope

3300
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960
as we first studied it the isotope
 

3301
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,270
as we first studied it the isotope
ratios of in this case it was magnesium

3302
00:57:35,270 --> 00:57:35,280
ratios of in this case it was magnesium
 

3303
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,349
ratios of in this case it was magnesium
are way off normal

3304
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
are way off normal
 

3305
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:38,390
are way off normal
and

3306
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,400
and
 

3307
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,789
and
i just don't know why it doesn't it

3308
00:57:40,789 --> 00:57:40,799
i just don't know why it doesn't it
 

3309
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:43,510
i just don't know why it doesn't it
doesn't prove anything it just all it

3310
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
doesn't prove anything it just all it
 

3311
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,950
doesn't prove anything it just all it
proves is

3312
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
proves is
 

3313
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:45,829
proves is
that

3314
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
that
 

3315
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,670
that
it was probably

3316
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:47,680
it was probably
 

3317
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,349
it was probably
accomplished by some kind of an

3318
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
accomplished by some kind of an
 

3319
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,109
accomplished by some kind of an
industrial process

3320
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:51,119
industrial process
 

3321
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:53,190
industrial process
whether it's the result

3322
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:53,200
whether it's the result
 

3323
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,589
whether it's the result
of a process or whether and and this is

3324
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
of a process or whether and and this is
 

3325
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,270
of a process or whether and and this is
sort of the leftover

3326
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:57,280
sort of the leftover
 

3327
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,910
sort of the leftover
or whether it was made that way for a

3328
00:57:59,910 --> 00:57:59,920
or whether it was made that way for a
 

3329
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,670
or whether it was made that way for a
particular purpose

3330
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
particular purpose
 

3331
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,390
particular purpose
i don't know all i know is that

3332
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
i don't know all i know is that
 

3333
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,549
i don't know all i know is that
it it was

3334
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:06,559
it it was
 

3335
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,750
it it was
engineered

3336
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760

 

3337
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:10,710

that's it

3338
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:10,720
that's it
 

3339
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,510
that's it
right but then it's

3340
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:13,520
right but then it's
 

3341
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,190
right but then it's
the question is

3342
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:15,200
the question is
 

3343
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,589
the question is
sort of you go one step deeper why would

3344
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:17,599
sort of you go one step deeper why would
 

3345
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,230
sort of you go one step deeper why would
you engineer it

3346
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:20,240
you engineer it
 

3347
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:21,349
you engineer it
right

3348
00:58:21,349 --> 00:58:21,359
right
 

3349
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,150
right
why and what is the engineered means

3350
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
why and what is the engineered means
 

3351
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,829
why and what is the engineered means
there's all kinds of

3352
00:58:25,829 --> 00:58:25,839
there's all kinds of
 

3353
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:28,950
there's all kinds of
it could be a byproduct it could be

3354
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
it could be a byproduct it could be
 

3355
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,870
it could be a byproduct it could be
um

3356
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:30,880
um
 

3357
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,950
um
the main result of an engineering

3358
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
the main result of an engineering
 

3359
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,990
the main result of an engineering
process

3360
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:34,000
process
 

3361
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,670
process
it would be a small part of the

3362
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
it would be a small part of the
 

3363
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,990
it would be a small part of the
engineering process that is the main

3364
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:38,000
engineering process that is the main
 

3365
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,030
engineering process that is the main
part

3366
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:39,040
part
 

3367
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,309
part
well so

3368
00:58:40,309 --> 00:58:40,319
well so
 

3369
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,270
well so
the ratios of isotopes for any given

3370
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:43,280
the ratios of isotopes for any given
 

3371
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,430
the ratios of isotopes for any given
element are basically the result of

3372
00:58:45,430 --> 00:58:45,440
element are basically the result of
 

3373
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,349
element are basically the result of
stellar processes

3374
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:47,359
stellar processes
 

3375
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,309
stellar processes
uh

3376
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
uh
 

3377
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:50,390
uh
a supernova blew up

3378
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
a supernova blew up
 

3379
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,870
a supernova blew up
sometime several tens you know several

3380
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
sometime several tens you know several
 

3381
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,470
sometime several tens you know several
billion years ago

3382
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
billion years ago
 

3383
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,430
billion years ago
uh

3384
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:55,440
uh
 

3385
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,030
uh
that became a cloud

3386
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:57,040
that became a cloud
 

3387
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,630
that became a cloud
those atoms coalesced gravitationally to

3388
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
those atoms coalesced gravitationally to
 

3389
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,710
those atoms coalesced gravitationally to
form another sun

3390
00:59:02,710 --> 00:59:02,720
form another sun
 

3391
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,309
form another sun
and a ring that became a rocky planet

3392
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:06,319
and a ring that became a rocky planet
 

3393
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:10,390
and a ring that became a rocky planet
uh and the ratios of the isotopes were

3394
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
uh and the ratios of the isotopes were
 

3395
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,789
uh and the ratios of the isotopes were
determined at the time of that

3396
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:12,799
determined at the time of that
 

3397
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,309
determined at the time of that
explosion

3398
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:14,319
explosion
 

3399
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:16,309
explosion
and so everything in the local

3400
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:16,319
and so everything in the local
 

3401
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,030
and so everything in the local
solar system is more or less of that

3402
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
solar system is more or less of that
 

3403
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,630
solar system is more or less of that
ratio depending upon certain

3404
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:20,640
ratio depending upon certain
 

3405
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,270
ratio depending upon certain
gravitational diff but but

3406
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:23,280
gravitational diff but but
 

3407
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,870
gravitational diff but but
by

3408
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880

3409
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,030
by
fragments of a percent not

whole tens of percent difference
 

3413
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,470
whole tens of percent difference
so what do humans use isotopes for

3414
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:32,480
so what do humans use isotopes for
 

3415
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,030
so what do humans use isotopes for
mostly to blow stuff up i mean the vast

3416
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:35,040
mostly to blow stuff up i mean the vast
 

3417
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,789
mostly to blow stuff up i mean the vast
majority of the isotopes that have been

made in in the per pound or ton
 

3421
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:41,829
made in in the per pound or ton
are things like

3422
00:59:41,829 --> 00:59:41,839
are things like
 

3423
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,309
are things like
certain ratios of plutonium and uranium

certain ratios of plutonium and uranium
 

3425
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:47,829
certain ratios of plutonium and uranium
to blow stuff up we don't make

3426
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:47,839
to blow stuff up we don't make
 

3427
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,789
to blow stuff up we don't make
or engineer isotopes which it's it's

3428
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:50,799
or engineer isotopes which it's it's
 

3429
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:52,549

today is relatively easy to do but it's

3430
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:52,559
today is relatively easy to do but it's
 

3431
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,990
today is relatively easy to do but it's
still expensive

3432
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:54,000
still expensive
 

3433
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,150
still expensive
for any other reason apart from let's

3434
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:56,160
for any other reason apart from let's
 

3435
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:56,950
for any other reason apart from let's
say

3436
00:59:56,950 --> 00:59:56,960
say
 

3437
00:59:56,960 --> 00:59:58,829
say
uh as uh

tool you basically embed certain ratios

3444
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
tool you basically embed certain ratios
 

3445
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,750
tool you basically embed certain ratios
of isotopes in to make it harder for

01:00:09,750 --> 01:00:09,760
of isotopes in to make it harder for
 

3447
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,470

um

3450
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:13,440
um
 

3451
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,750
um
and so but other than that we don't do

3452
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:15,760
and so but other than that we don't do
 

3453
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,630
and so but other than that we don't do
anything with that so why would you make

3454
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:18,640
anything with that so why would you make
 

3455
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,750
anything with that so why would you make
grams of such material in this one case

and drop it around on a beach in brazil

3458
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
and drop it around on a beach in brazil
 

3459
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:26,950
and drop it around on a beach in brazil
so which case we're talking about this

3460
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
so which case we're talking about this
 

3461
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,470
so which case we're talking about this
is this is the ubertuba case

3462
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:30,480
is this is the ubertuba case
 

3463
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,069
is this is the ubertuba case
can you describe this case a little bit

3464
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:32,079
can you describe this case a little bit
 

3465
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,150
can you describe this case a little bit
further like what material we're talking

3466
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,160
further like what material we're talking
 

3467
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,470
further like what material we're talking
about just the full story of the case so

3468
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
about just the full story of the case so
 

3469
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,670
about just the full story of the case so
it's an interesting one it's an

3470
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
it's an interesting one it's an
 

3471
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,910
it's an interesting one it's an
interesting one so a fisherman saw an

3472
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
interesting one so a fisherman saw an
 

3473
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:40,950
interesting one so a fisherman saw an
object

3474
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:40,960
object
 

3475
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:44,549
object
that uh released something or it it

3476
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:44,559
that uh released something or it it
 

3477
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:45,670
that uh released something or it it
exploded

3478
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
exploded
 

3479
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,670
exploded
and it was this

3480
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
and it was this
 

3481
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,430
and it was this
relative you know i've got some big

3482
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
relative you know i've got some big
 

3483
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,549
relative you know i've got some big
chunks of it

3484
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
chunks of it
 

3485
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,910
chunks of it
uh relatively pure magnesium

3486
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:53,920
uh relatively pure magnesium
 

3487
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,109
uh relatively pure magnesium
with obviously something else in it

3488
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:55,119
with obviously something else in it
 

3489
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,750
with obviously something else in it
because magnesium burns so it had

3490
01:00:57,750 --> 01:00:57,760
because magnesium burns so it had
 

3491
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,470
because magnesium burns so it had
something in it that would other metals

3492
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:00,480
something in it that would other metals
 

3493
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,030
something in it that would other metals
simple alloy that would prevent it from

3494
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
simple alloy that would prevent it from
 

3495
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,470
simple alloy that would prevent it from
from uh basically burning up

3496
01:01:06,470 --> 01:01:06,480
from uh basically burning up
 

3497
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,750
from uh basically burning up
um

3498
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:07,760
um
 

3499
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,589
um
and so the question is

3500
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:09,599
and so the question is
 

3501
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:11,750
and so the question is
and so then we had we had two pieces

3502
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:11,760
and so then we had we had two pieces
 

3503
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,349
and so then we had we had two pieces
that came from

3504
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
that came from
 

3505
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,630
that came from
um two different chains of custody both

3506
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:16,640
um two different chains of custody both
 

3507
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,349
um two different chains of custody both
claimed to be from the same object

3508
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:19,359
claimed to be from the same object
 

3509
01:01:19,359 --> 01:01:20,789
claimed to be from the same object
at least

3510
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:20,799
at least
 

3511
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:21,589
at least
uh

3512
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
uh
 

3513
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:22,789
uh
physically when you look at the two

3514
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:22,799
physically when you look at the two
 

3515
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:24,789
physically when you look at the two
things they look

3516
01:01:24,789 --> 01:01:24,799
things they look
 

3517
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:25,910
things they look
the same

3518
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
the same
 

3519
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,870
the same
right

3520
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
right
 

3521
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,270
right
so we took small fragments of each of

3522
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
so we took small fragments of each of
 

3523
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,030
so we took small fragments of each of
them we put them in an instrument called

3524
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
them we put them in an instrument called
 

3525
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,349
them we put them in an instrument called
a secondary ion mass spec

3526
01:01:33,349 --> 01:01:33,359
a secondary ion mass spec
 

3527
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:34,870
a secondary ion mass spec
which is an extremely sensitive

3528
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:34,880
which is an extremely sensitive
 

3529
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:39,270
which is an extremely sensitive
instrument and it can see down to 0.0001

3530
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
instrument and it can see down to 0.0001
 

3531
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,030
instrument and it can see down to 0.0001
mass units

3532
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:41,040
mass units
 

3533
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,750
mass units
uh which is important for

3534
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
uh which is important for
 

3535
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:45,109
uh which is important for
let's say more

3536
01:01:45,109 --> 01:01:45,119
let's say more
 

3537
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,870
let's say more
arcane reasons but

3538
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
arcane reasons but
 

3539
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,870
arcane reasons but
um it's a sensitive instrument and so

3540
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
um it's a sensitive instrument and so
 

3541
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,109
um it's a sensitive instrument and so
one of the chains of custody we had two

3542
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:53,119
one of the chains of custody we had two
 

3543
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,750
one of the chains of custody we had two
pieces from the same chain of custody

3544
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
pieces from the same chain of custody
 

3545
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,029
pieces from the same chain of custody
and then two pieces from the other chain

3546
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,039
and then two pieces from the other chain
 

3547
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:59,270
and then two pieces from the other chain
of custody

3548
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
of custody
 

3549
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,910
of custody
one of them had completely normal

3550
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:01,920
one of them had completely normal
 

3551
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:05,349
one of them had completely normal
uh magnesium isotope ratios magnesium 24

3552
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:05,359
uh magnesium isotope ratios magnesium 24
 

3553
01:02:05,359 --> 01:02:08,069
uh magnesium isotope ratios magnesium 24
25 26 and the other was off

3554
01:02:08,069 --> 01:02:08,079
25 26 and the other was off
 

3555
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:09,670
25 26 and the other was off
not just like slightly off way off and

3556
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
not just like slightly off way off and
 

3557
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,549
not just like slightly off way off and
they were both off to the same extent

3558
01:02:12,549 --> 01:02:12,559
they were both off to the same extent
 

3559
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,589
they were both off to the same extent
so

3560
01:02:13,589 --> 01:02:13,599
so
 

3561
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,710
so
uh

3562
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:14,720
uh
 

3563
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:16,069
uh
i mean it was sort of like you had an

3564
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:16,079
i mean it was sort of like you had an
 

3565
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,910
i mean it was sort of like you had an
internal control

3566
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:17,920
internal control
 

3567
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:19,190
internal control
of what was normal then you had this

3568
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
of what was normal then you had this
 

3569
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,230
of what was normal then you had this
other one which was which was wrong

3570
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
other one which was which was wrong
 

3571
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:25,109
other one which was which was wrong
and so you're left with

3572
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:25,119
and so you're left with
 

3573
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,390
and so you're left with
uh that's what kind of an open question

3574
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
uh that's what kind of an open question
 

3575
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,710
uh that's what kind of an open question
was this a hoax were these two chains of

3576
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
was this a hoax were these two chains of
 

3577
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,870
was this a hoax were these two chains of
custody one of them a hoax that somebody

3578
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
custody one of them a hoax that somebody
 

3579
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,950
custody one of them a hoax that somebody
purposefully introduced those things

3580
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
purposefully introduced those things
 

3581
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,190
purposefully introduced those things
because you could do it it would

3582
01:02:37,190 --> 01:02:37,200
because you could do it it would
 

3583
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,750
because you could do it it would
cost a lot i mean at the time that this

3584
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:39,760
cost a lot i mean at the time that this
 

3585
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,670
cost a lot i mean at the time that this
was found i guess the 1970s or so

3586
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
was found i guess the 1970s or so
 

3587
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,829
was found i guess the 1970s or so
um might have been earlier i forget

3588
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:46,839
um might have been earlier i forget
 

3589
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:49,670
um might have been earlier i forget
uh the amount that i had would have cost

3590
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:49,680
uh the amount that i had would have cost
 

3591
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,430
uh the amount that i had would have cost
several tens of thousands of dollars to

3592
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:51,440
several tens of thousands of dollars to
 

3593
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:52,870
several tens of thousands of dollars to
make

3594
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
make
 

3595
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:53,829
make
um

3596
01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:53,839
um
 

3597
01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:55,190
um
and again it's not something you would

3598
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
and again it's not something you would
 

3599
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,950
and again it's not something you would
just throw around and why would you do

3600
01:02:56,950 --> 01:02:56,960
just throw around and why would you do
 

3601
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,710
just throw around and why would you do
it in the hope that some guy 30 years

3602
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
it in the hope that some guy 30 years
 

3603
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,990
it in the hope that some guy 30 years
from then

3604
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,000
from then
 

3605
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:00,789
from then
would

3606
01:03:00,789 --> 01:03:00,799
would
 

3607
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:02,710
would
would pick it up and study it that's a

3608
01:03:02,710 --> 01:03:02,720
would pick it up and study it that's a
 

3609
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:04,150
would pick it up and study it that's a
very subtle

3610
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,160
very subtle
 

3611
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,029
very subtle
subtle

3612
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:05,039
subtle
 

3613
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,349
subtle
it's a long-term plan

3614
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
it's a long-term plan
 

3615
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:10,150
it's a long-term plan
um so so i i just don't know i just

3616
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:10,160
um so so i i just don't know i just
 

3617
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:11,190
um so so i i just don't know i just
don't know

3618
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:11,200
don't know
 

3619
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,789
don't know
what to make of it except it's

3620
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
what to make of it except it's
 

3621
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,829
what to make of it except it's
interesting but it's but so a different

3622
01:03:15,829 --> 01:03:15,839
interesting but it's but so a different
 

3623
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:18,309
interesting but it's but so a different
kind of question that you're asking is

3624
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
kind of question that you're asking is
 

3625
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:21,029
kind of question that you're asking is
what constitutes evidence

3626
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
what constitutes evidence
 

3627
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:24,390
what constitutes evidence
right so is is this

3628
01:03:24,390 --> 01:03:24,400
right so is is this
 

3629
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,589
right so is is this
sufficient evidence absolutely not

3630
01:03:27,589 --> 01:03:27,599
sufficient evidence absolutely not
 

3631
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,990
sufficient evidence absolutely not
but somebody's put it forward i have the

3632
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
but somebody's put it forward i have the
 

3633
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,950
but somebody's put it forward i have the
time it's my time

3634
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:32,960
time it's my time
 

3635
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,109
time it's my time
i'll study it and i my objective is to

3636
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
i'll study it and i my objective is to
 

3637
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:36,870
i'll study it and i my objective is to
sort of take those that i think are

3638
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:36,880
sort of take those that i think are
 

3639
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,390
sort of take those that i think are
credible enough

3640
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:38,400
credible enough
 

3641
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,470
credible enough
and do a reasonable analysis put it out

3642
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,480
and do a reasonable analysis put it out
 

3643
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,150
and do a reasonable analysis put it out
there and maybe somebody else will come

3644
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
there and maybe somebody else will come
 

3645
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,470
there and maybe somebody else will come
up with an idea as to what it is

3646
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:44,480
up with an idea as to what it is
 

3647
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,950
up with an idea as to what it is
now what would be better

3648
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
now what would be better
 

3649
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,230
now what would be better
is some sort of

3650
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
is some sort of
 

3651
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,430
is some sort of
true

3652
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440
true
 

3653
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,589
true
technology right something that is

3654
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:51,599
technology right something that is
 

3655
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:52,950
technology right something that is
obviously

3656
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:52,960
obviously
 

3657
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,390
obviously
we don't have it

3658
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
we don't have it
 

3659
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:55,589
we don't have it
you know and

3660
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
you know and
 

3661
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,870
you know and

you know
something

3676
01:04:09,190 --> 01:04:09,200
something
 

3677
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,829
something
really obviously technology that we

3678
01:04:11,829 --> 01:04:11,839
really obviously technology that we
 

3679
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:13,349
really obviously technology that we
don't understand

3680
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
don't understand
 

3681
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,750
don't understand
you know then we'll pay attention

3682
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,760
you know then we'll pay attention
 

3683
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,430
you know then we'll pay attention
right not just material not just

3684
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:17,440
right not just material not just
 

3685
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,670
right not just material not just
material a piece of metal

3686
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
material a piece of metal
 

3687
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,230
material a piece of metal
is is interesting

3688
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:22,240
is is interesting
 

3689
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,150
is is interesting
uh but

3690
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
uh but
 

3691
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,430
uh but
and several of the things that i've

3692
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
and several of the things that i've
 

3693
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,870
and several of the things that i've
looked at and things that people other

3694
01:04:26,870 --> 01:04:26,880
looked at and things that people other
 

3695
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,470
looked at and things that people other
things that people have come

3696
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:28,480
things that people have come
 

3697
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,190
things that people have come
to me with we found to be completely

3698
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
to me with we found to be completely
 

3699
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,950
to me with we found to be completely
banal or

3700
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:32,960
banal or
 

3701
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:35,670
banal or
were actually pieces of aircraft

3702
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
were actually pieces of aircraft
 

3703
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:38,150
were actually pieces of aircraft
that were invented back in the 1940s

3704
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:38,160
that were invented back in the 1940s
 

3705
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,630
that were invented back in the 1940s
yeah and so take them off the table see

3706
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:40,640
yeah and so take them off the table see
 

3707
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:42,150
yeah and so take them off the table see
but

3708
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,160
but
 

3709
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,029
but
i think um

3710
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
i think um
 

3711
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,510
i think um
again i think showing up with technology

3712
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:47,520
again i think showing up with technology
 

3713
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,589
again i think showing up with technology
that we humans would find completely

3714
01:04:49,589 --> 01:04:49,599
that we humans would find completely
 

3715
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:51,750
that we humans would find completely
novel is actually a really difficult

3716
01:04:51,750 --> 01:04:51,760
novel is actually a really difficult
 

3717
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,710
novel is actually a really difficult
task for aliens because it obviously

3718
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:54,720
task for aliens because it obviously
 

3719
01:04:54,720 --> 01:04:56,630
task for aliens because it obviously
can't be so novel

3720
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
can't be so novel
 

3721
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:58,549
can't be so novel
that we don't recognize it for what it

3722
01:04:58,549 --> 01:04:58,559
that we don't recognize it for what it
 

3723
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:01,029
that we don't recognize it for what it
is for what it is and so and i would say

3724
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:01,039
is for what it is and so and i would say
 

3725
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:04,230
is for what it is and so and i would say
most the technology aliens likely have

3726
01:05:04,230 --> 01:05:04,240
most the technology aliens likely have
 

3727
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,349
most the technology aliens likely have
would be something we don't recognize

3728
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
would be something we don't recognize
 

3729
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,430
would be something we don't recognize
so they it's actually a hard problem how

3730
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
so they it's actually a hard problem how
 

3731
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,270
so they it's actually a hard problem how
to convince ants

3732
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
to convince ants
 

3733
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,589
to convince ants
like you first have to understand what

3734
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
like you first have to understand what
 

3735
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,910
like you first have to understand what
ants are tweeting about

3736
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:15,920
ants are tweeting about
 

3737
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,069
ants are tweeting about
like what they care about

3738
01:05:18,069 --> 01:05:18,079
like what they care about
 

3739
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,309
like what they care about
in order to like inject into their

3740
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
in order to like inject into their
 

3741
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,270

because uh

3744
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:22,880
because uh
 

3745
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,950
because uh
you know that's why i think

3746
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
you know that's why i think
 

3747
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,190
you know that's why i think
it would be the technology that you

3748
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
it would be the technology that you
 

3749
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,510
it would be the technology that you
could present is in the space of ideas

3750
01:05:29,510 --> 01:05:29,520
could present is in the space of ideas
 

3751

technology
the fascination with the development of

3778
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
the fascination with the development of
 

3779
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,349
the fascination with the development of
technology and the development of

3780

technology and the development of
 

3781
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:01,910
technology and the development of
technology the actual act of innovation

3782

itself
 

3785
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,430
itself
is the thing that they're communicating

3786
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:05,440
is the thing that they're communicating
 

3787
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,190
is the thing that they're communicating
right i mean this is kind of what you

right i mean this is kind of what you
 

3789
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,589
right i mean this is kind of what you
know jacques valet thinks about

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,750
program
um joe rogan has a lot of people don't

4146
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:15,760
um joe rogan has a lot of people don't
 

4147
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,070
um joe rogan has a lot of people don't
know about it so i think people if it's

4148
01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:18,080
know about it so i think people if it's
 

4149
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,470
know about it so i think people if it's
not affecting their day-to-day life

4150
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
not affecting their day-to-day life
 

4151
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:21,750
not affecting their day-to-day life
they're going on with their day-to-day

life
 

4155
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:25,669
life
so but that said

4156
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
so but that said
 

4157
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,510
so but that said
i think it was an important

4158
01:12:27,510 --> 01:12:27,520
i think it was an important
 

4159
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:28,870
i think it was an important
sea change

4160
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:28,880

in the internal discussions going on in

4162
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:31,360
in the internal discussions going on in
 

4163
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,350
in the internal discussions going on in
the government because

4164
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360
the government because
 

4165
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:35,430
the government because
and the reason being

4166
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:35,440
and the reason being
 

4167
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:36,630
and the reason being
that

4168
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:36,640
that
 

4169
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:38,470
that
i think this is actually partly true

4170
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:38,480
i think this is actually partly true
 

4171
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:41,669
i think this is actually partly true
with the the maturation of human social

4172
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:41,679
with the the maturation of human social
 

4173
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:42,950
with the the maturation of human social
technology

4174
01:12:42,950 --> 01:12:42,960
technology
 

4175
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,390
technology
it was becoming

4176
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:44,400
it was becoming
 

4177
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:46,709
it was becoming
so obvious that this stuff was showing

4178
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
so obvious that this stuff was showing
 

4179
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,550
so obvious that this stuff was showing
up again and again and again around our

4180
01:12:48,550 --> 01:12:48,560
up again and again and again around our
 

4181
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,229
up again and again and again around our
ships they just couldn't keep it quiet

4182
01:12:50,229 --> 01:12:50,239
ships they just couldn't keep it quiet
 

4183
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:51,510
ships they just couldn't keep it quiet
anymore

4184
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:51,520
anymore
 

4185
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,110
anymore
right and so it's like we need to do

4186
01:12:53,110 --> 01:12:53,120
right and so it's like we need to do
 

4187
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:54,870
right and so it's like we need to do
something about it and lou elizondo and

4188
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
something about it and lou elizondo and
 

4189
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,350
something about it and lou elizondo and
chris and others to their great credit

4190
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
chris and others to their great credit
 

4191
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,110
chris and others to their great credit
found the right angle

4192
01:12:59,110 --> 01:12:59,120
found the right angle
 

4193
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:01,750
found the right angle
to talk about this it says well okay

4194
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:01,760
to talk about this it says well okay
 

4195
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,110
to talk about this it says well okay
let's say it's not

4196
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:03,120
let's say it's not
 

4197
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,189
let's say it's not
out there maybe it's the russians the

4198
01:13:05,189 --> 01:13:05,199
out there maybe it's the russians the
 

4199
01:13:05,199 --> 01:13:07,590
out there maybe it's the russians the
chinese or somebody else we should know

4200
01:13:07,590 --> 01:13:07,600
chinese or somebody else we should know
 

4201
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,830
chinese or somebody else we should know
about this because we damn sure no it's

4202
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
about this because we damn sure no it's
 

4203
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,430
about this because we damn sure no it's
not us

4204
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
not us
 

4205
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:12,870
not us
so

4206
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:12,880
so
 

4207
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,550
so
that to me

4208
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:14,560
that to me
 

4209
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,350
that to me
is an important thing to to finally be a

4210
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:17,360
is an important thing to to finally be a
 

4211
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:19,430
is an important thing to to finally be a
little bit more open about

the matter
 

4215
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,590
the matter
but

to give me
 

4231
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,430
to give me
telescopic information about

4232
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:37,440
telescopic information about
 

4233
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,510
telescopic information about
technologies or

4234
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:39,520
technologies or
 

4235
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:40,870
technologies or
things that might be even on our own

4236
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
things that might be even on our own
 

4237
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,630

it myself
 

4241
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,070
it myself
and and that's the right way to do it

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:50,630
give it to you
it's also possible to

4248
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
it's also possible to
 

4249
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,590
it's also possible to
inspire a large number of people to do a

4250
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
inspire a large number of people to do a
 

4251
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,229
inspire a large number of people to do a
wider spread data collection yes you

4252
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
wider spread data collection yes you
 

4253
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:58,070
wider spread data collection yes you
yourself can't

4254
01:13:58,070 --> 01:13:58,080
yourself can't
 

4255
01:13:58,080 --> 01:13:59,990
yourself can't
do a large enough data collection that

4256
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:00,000
do a large enough data collection that
 

4257
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,990
do a large enough data collection that
would if you're talking about anomalous

4258
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:02,000
would if you're talking about anomalous
 

4259
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:03,669
would if you're talking about anomalous
events right

4260
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
events right
 

4261
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,149
events right
right you you should be

4262
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:06,159
right you you should be
 

4263
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:08,630
right you you should be
collecting high resolution data

4264
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:08,640
collecting high resolution data
 

4265
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:10,630
collecting high resolution data
about everything that's happening on

4266

about everything that's happening on
 

4267

about everything that's happening on
earth in terms of like at

in terms of the kind of
 

4271
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,950
in terms of the kind of
things that would indicate to you a

4272
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:16,960
things that would indicate to you a
 

4273
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:19,110
things that would indicate to you a

01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:12,229
right but i do um
i do think that

4436
01:17:12,229 --> 01:17:12,239
i do think that
 

4437
01:17:12,239 --> 01:17:13,510
i do think that
there will be

4438
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:13,520
there will be
 

4439
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:15,590
there will be
uh public efforts now they're going

4440
01:17:15,590 --> 01:17:15,600
uh public efforts now they're going
 

4441
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,510
uh public efforts now they're going
there there are being set up other

4442
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
there there are being set up other
 

4443
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,030
there there are being set up other
private efforts

4444
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
private efforts
 

4445
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,830
private efforts
to bring monies involved and to use that

4446
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
to bring monies involved and to use that
 

4447
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,270
to bring monies involved and to use that
to leverage

4448
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:23,280
to leverage
 

4449
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,510
to leverage
uh and get access to some of the

4450
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:25,520
uh and get access to some of the
 

4451
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,149
uh and get access to some of the
internal resources as well

4452
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:28,159
internal resources as well
 

4453
01:17:28,159 --> 01:17:31,270
internal resources as well
so um what you're seeing is uh kind of

4454
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:31,280
so um what you're seeing is uh kind of
 

4455
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,189
so um what you're seeing is uh kind of
an ecosystem building up

4456
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:33,199
an ecosystem building up
 

4457
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:36,310
an ecosystem building up
uh in a positive sense uh of people who

4458
01:17:36,310 --> 01:17:36,320
uh in a positive sense uh of people who
 

4459
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:39,430
uh in a positive sense uh of people who
are willing to do the research

4460
01:17:39,430 --> 01:17:39,440
are willing to do the research
 

4461
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:41,750
are willing to do the research
so you know before it it would be you

4462
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:41,760
so you know before it it would be you
 

4463
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,430
so you know before it it would be you
couldn't even go to a scientist and ask

4464
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:43,440
couldn't even go to a scientist and ask
 

4465
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,110
couldn't even go to a scientist and ask
them to help

4466
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:45,120
them to help
 

4467
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,149
them to help
now

4468
01:17:46,149 --> 01:17:46,159
now
 

4469
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,310
now
if there's money as i said before

4470
01:17:48,310 --> 01:17:48,320
if there's money as i said before
 

4471
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:50,229
if there's money as i said before
scientists are essentially capitalist we

4472
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:50,239
scientists are essentially capitalist we
 

4473
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,229
scientists are essentially capitalist we
go where the money is you know

4474
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
go where the money is you know
 

4475
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,990
go where the money is you know
i mean the work that i've done i did out

4476
01:17:53,990 --> 01:17:54,000
i mean the work that i've done i did out
 

4477
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,990
i mean the work that i've done i did out
of my own pocket

4478
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
of my own pocket
 

4479
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,390
of my own pocket
and probably about 50 60 70 000

4480
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:58,400
and probably about 50 60 70 000
 

4481
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,550
and probably about 50 60 70 000
of money went into

4482
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:00,560
of money went into
 

4483
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,630
of money went into
the paper we published yeah out of my

4484
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
the paper we published yeah out of my
 

4485
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,550
the paper we published yeah out of my
own pocket um

4486
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:04,560
own pocket um
 

4487
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,630
own pocket um
and you know but the amount of money

4488
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:06,640
and you know but the amount of money
 

4489
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:08,470
and you know but the amount of money
that needs to go in is in the in at

4490
01:18:08,470 --> 01:18:08,480
that needs to go in is in the in at
 

4491
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:11,030
that needs to go in is in the in at
least the few millions to do a proper

4492
01:18:11,030 --> 01:18:11,040
least the few millions to do a proper
 

4493
01:18:11,040 --> 01:18:13,750
least the few millions to do a proper
analysis of these materials

4494
01:18:13,750 --> 01:18:13,760
analysis of these materials
 

4495
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,229
analysis of these materials
the work i know that the galileo project

4496
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:16,239
the work i know that the galileo project
 

4497
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:19,430
the work i know that the galileo project
is involved with uh it's probably in the

4498
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:19,440
is involved with uh it's probably in the
 

4499
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:21,189
is involved with uh it's probably in the
in the you know five to ten million

4500
01:18:21,189 --> 01:18:21,199
in the you know five to ten million
 

4501
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:24,070
in the you know five to ten million
range to get stuff done but that's

4502
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
range to get stuff done but that's
 

4503
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,910
range to get stuff done but that's
actually a relatively modest amount of

4504
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:25,920
actually a relatively modest amount of
 

4505
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:26,790
actually a relatively modest amount of
money

4506
01:18:26,790 --> 01:18:26,800
money
 

4507
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,229
money
to accomplish

4508
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
to accomplish
 

4509
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,550
to accomplish
something that has been in the zeitgeist

4510
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
something that has been in the zeitgeist
 

4511
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,510
something that has been in the zeitgeist
for

4512
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:31,520
for
 

4513
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:33,750
for
decades

4514
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
decades
 

4515
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,310
decades
i should also push back a little bit on

4516
01:18:36,310 --> 01:18:36,320
i should also push back a little bit on
 

4517
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,750
i should also push back a little bit on
something you probably will agree with

4518
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
something you probably will agree with
 

4519
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:39,189
something you probably will agree with
you said scientists are essentially

4520
01:18:39,189 --> 01:18:39,199
you said scientists are essentially
 

4521
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:40,870
you said scientists are essentially
capitalists

4522
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
capitalists
 

4523
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,950
capitalists
what i've noticed is there's certainly

4524
01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:42,960
what i've noticed is there's certainly
 

4525
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,270
what i've noticed is there's certainly
an influence of money but oftentimes

4526
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:45,280
an influence of money but oftentimes
 

4527
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:46,950
an influence of money but oftentimes
when you're talking about basic research

4528
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:46,960
when you're talking about basic research
 

4529
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,870
when you're talking about basic research
in basic science

4530
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:48,880
in basic science
 

4531
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:51,430
in basic science
the money

4532
01:18:51,430 --> 01:18:51,440
the money
 

4533
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,669
the money
is a little bit a little bit ambiguous

4534
01:18:53,669 --> 01:18:53,679
is a little bit a little bit ambiguous
 

4535
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:55,110
is a little bit a little bit ambiguous
to what direction you're doing the

4536
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:55,120
to what direction you're doing the
 

4537
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,669
to what direction you're doing the
research in and the scientists get

4538
01:18:57,669 --> 01:18:57,679
research in and the scientists get
 

4539
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,110
research in and the scientists get
really good

4540
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
really good
 

4541
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:01,669
really good
at telling a narrative of like yeah yeah

4542
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
at telling a narrative of like yeah yeah
 

4543
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,430
at telling a narrative of like yeah yeah
we're fulfilling

4544
01:19:03,430 --> 01:19:03,440
we're fulfilling
 

4545
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,430
we're fulfilling
the purpose of this funding but we're

4546
01:19:05,430 --> 01:19:05,440
the purpose of this funding but we're
 

4547
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,430
the purpose of this funding but we're
actually they end up doing really what

4548
01:19:07,430 --> 01:19:07,440
actually they end up doing really what
 

4549
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:09,189
actually they end up doing really what
they're curious about yes and of course

4550
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:09,199
they're curious about yes and of course
 

4551
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:11,270
they're curious about yes and of course
you cannot deviate like if you're

4552
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
you cannot deviate like if you're
 

4553
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:12,950
you cannot deviate like if you're
getting funded to study penguins in

4554
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
getting funded to study penguins in
 

4555
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,709
getting funded to study penguins in
antarctica you can't start building

4556
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:14,719
antarctica you can't start building
 

4557
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:17,030
antarctica you can't start building
rockets but probably you can because

4558
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
rockets but probably you can because
 

4559
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,910
rockets but probably you can because
you'll

4560
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
you'll
 

4561
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,669
you'll
convince some kind you'll concoct a

4562
01:19:19,669 --> 01:19:19,679
convince some kind you'll concoct a
 

4563
01:19:19,679 --> 01:19:20,950
convince some kind you'll concoct a
narrative saying

4564
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
narrative saying
 

4565
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,310
narrative saying
rockets are really important for

4566
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
rockets are really important for
 

4567
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,430
rockets are really important for
studying penguins in the entire right i

4568
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:25,440
studying penguins in the entire right i
 

4569
01:19:25,440 --> 01:19:27,910
studying penguins in the entire right i
i think that's actually

4570
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
i think that's actually
 

4571
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:30,790
i think that's actually
this is one thing i think people don't

4572
01:19:30,790 --> 01:19:30,800
this is one thing i think people don't
 

4573
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:31,910
this is one thing i think people don't
generally understand about the

4574
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:31,920
generally understand about the
 

4575
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,430
generally understand about the
scientific mind

4576
01:19:33,430 --> 01:19:33,440
scientific mind
 

4577
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:35,990
scientific mind
is i don't know how capitalistic it is

4578
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,000
is i don't know how capitalistic it is
 

4579
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,390
is i don't know how capitalistic it is
because if it was they would start an

4580
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
because if it was they would start an
 

4581
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,630
because if it was they would start an
effing company no no no no i mean when i

4582
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:40,640
effing company no no no no i mean when i
 

4583
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,830
effing company no no no no i mean when i
met capitalist i didn't mean in the uh

4584
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:43,840
met capitalist i didn't mean in the uh
 

4585
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,149
met capitalist i didn't mean in the uh
they'll they'll start companies per se i

4586
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:46,159
they'll they'll start companies per se i
 

4587
01:19:46,159 --> 01:19:46,950
they'll they'll start companies per se i
mean

4588
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:46,960
mean
 

4589
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:48,470
mean
we can only do the research where

4590
01:19:48,470 --> 01:19:48,480
we can only do the research where
 

4591
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:51,910
we can only do the research where
there's money and so from from

4592
01:19:51,910 --> 01:19:51,920
there's money and so from from
 

4593
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,830
there's money and so from from
you know maybe it's a a bad use of the

4594
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
you know maybe it's a a bad use of the
 

4595
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,750
you know maybe it's a a bad use of the
term capitalist so

4596
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:55,760
term capitalist so
 

4597
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,590
term capitalist so
but the

4598
01:19:57,590 --> 01:19:57,600
but the
 

4599
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,950
but the
we will only do the research where

4600
01:19:58,950 --> 01:19:58,960
we will only do the research where
 

4601
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:00,870
we will only do the research where
there's money i mean why do most people

4602
01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:00,880
there's money i mean why do most people
 

4603
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:01,910
there's money i mean why do most people
work

4604
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
work
 

4605
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:05,750
work
uh many biologists uh work in cancer

4606
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:05,760
uh many biologists uh work in cancer
 

4607
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,790
uh many biologists uh work in cancer
research

4608
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:06,800
research
 

4609
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,070
research
because there's a lot of money there

4610
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:08,080
because there's a lot of money there
 

4611
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,910
because there's a lot of money there
it's an important problem

4612
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:09,920
it's an important problem
 

4613
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,590
it's an important problem
but

4614
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:11,600
but
 

4615
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,830
but
i might not have ever gotten involved in

4616
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840
i might not have ever gotten involved in
 

4617
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,510
i might not have ever gotten involved in
it if there wasn't money i might have

4618
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:15,520
it if there wasn't money i might have
 

4619
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,990
it if there wasn't money i might have
gone and i was going to be a botanist

4620
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
gone and i was going to be a botanist
 

4621
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,030
gone and i was going to be a botanist
when i when i was a kid that's what i

4622
01:20:21,030 --> 01:20:21,040
when i when i was a kid that's what i
 

4623
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:22,149
when i when i was a kid that's what i
wanted to do

4624
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:22,159
wanted to do
 

4625
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:23,110
wanted to do
um

4626
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:23,120
um
 

4627
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,390
um
so

4628
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:24,400
so
 

4629
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,310
so
having money available

4630
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:26,320
having money available
 

4631
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:29,430
having money available
will bring people to bear now another

4632
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:29,440
will bring people to bear now another
 

4633
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,110
will bring people to bear now another
mistake that's often actually made i

4634
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
mistake that's often actually made i
 

4635
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,430
mistake that's often actually made i
think by the lay public about science

4636
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
think by the lay public about science
 

4637
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,830
think by the lay public about science
is that people think that we're paid to

4638
01:20:35,830 --> 01:20:35,840
is that people think that we're paid to
 

4639
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:38,390
is that people think that we're paid to
do things just as you said i get a

4640
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:38,400
do things just as you said i get a
 

4641
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:40,550
do things just as you said i get a
research grant and luckily from the nih

4642
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:40,560
research grant and luckily from the nih
 

4643
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,030
research grant and luckily from the nih
they give you a fair amount of latitude

4644
01:20:43,030 --> 01:20:43,040
they give you a fair amount of latitude
 

4645
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:45,030
they give you a fair amount of latitude
uh i will go my own way and i'll find

4646
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
uh i will go my own way and i'll find
 

4647
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,550
uh i will go my own way and i'll find
something i might have proposed

4648
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:46,560
something i might have proposed
 

4649
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,510
something i might have proposed
something

4650
01:20:47,510 --> 01:20:47,520
something
 

4651
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:49,189
something
but i'll end up somewhere entirely

4652
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:49,199
but i'll end up somewhere entirely
 

4653
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,590
but i'll end up somewhere entirely
different by the end of the project and

4654
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
different by the end of the project and
 

4655
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,030
different by the end of the project and
that's how good science is done you

4656
01:20:53,030 --> 01:20:53,040
that's how good science is done you
 

4657
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,550
that's how good science is done you
follow the you follow the data you

4658
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
follow the you follow the data you
 

4659
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,629
follow the you follow the data you
follow the results

4660
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:56,639
follow the results
 

4661
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:57,510
follow the results
um

4662
01:20:57,510 --> 01:20:57,520
um
 

4663
01:20:57,520 --> 01:21:00,470
um
and so that's what i'm hoping can be

4664
01:21:00,470 --> 01:21:00,480
and so that's what i'm hoping can be
 

4665
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,669
and so that's what i'm hoping can be
done here i think the worst kind of

4666
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
done here i think the worst kind of
 

4667
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,669
done here i think the worst kind of
thing that could be done with this

4668
01:21:05,669 --> 01:21:05,679
thing that could be done with this
 

4669
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,149
thing that could be done with this
subject area is to put it inside another

4670
01:21:08,149 --> 01:21:08,159
subject area is to put it inside another
 

4671
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:09,350
subject area is to put it inside another
company

4672
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
company
 

4673
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,310
company
where

4674
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
where
 

4675
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,470
where
they have a set plan of what it is

4676
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
they have a set plan of what it is
 

4677
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:13,750
they have a set plan of what it is
they're going to do and the scientists

4678
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:13,760
they're going to do and the scientists
 

4679
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,070
they're going to do and the scientists
either tell do what the executives tell

4680
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
either tell do what the executives tell
 

4681
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:18,229
either tell do what the executives tell
them to do or not

4682
01:21:18,229 --> 01:21:18,239
them to do or not
 

4683
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,830
them to do or not
that isn't how anything will really get

4684
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:19,840
that isn't how anything will really get
 

4685
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,110
that isn't how anything will really get
discovered

4686
01:21:21,110 --> 01:21:21,120
discovered
 

4687
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:24,149
discovered
put it get it out into the public

4688
01:21:24,149 --> 01:21:24,159
put it get it out into the public
 

4689
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:26,950
put it get it out into the public
get open minds thinking about it and

4690
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
get open minds thinking about it and
 

4691
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,629
get open minds thinking about it and
then publishing on it and doing the

4692
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,639
then publishing on it and doing the
 

4693
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:31,350
then publishing on it and doing the
right kind of work that's how real

4694
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:31,360
right kind of work that's how real
 

4695
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:33,750
right kind of work that's how real
progress will be made with this

4696
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:33,760
progress will be made with this
 

4697
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:35,750
progress will be made with this
let's again put put our sort of

4698
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
let's again put put our sort of
 

4699
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,910
let's again put put our sort of
philosophical hats on do you think the

4700
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
philosophical hats on do you think the
 

4701
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,470
philosophical hats on do you think the
us government or some other government

4702
01:21:40,470 --> 01:21:40,480
us government or some other government
 

4703
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,550
us government or some other government
is in possession

4704
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:42,560
is in possession
 

4705
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,510
is in possession
of

4706
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
of
 

4707
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,110
of
something

4708
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
something
 

4709
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:48,229
something
of extraterrestrial origin that is far

4710
01:21:48,229 --> 01:21:48,239
of extraterrestrial origin that is far
 

4711
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:50,470
of extraterrestrial origin that is far
more impressive

4712
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:50,480
more impressive
 

4713
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,550
more impressive
than anything we've seen

4714
01:21:52,550 --> 01:21:52,560
than anything we've seen
 

4715
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,910
than anything we've seen
in the public

4716
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:53,920
in the public
 

4717
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,229
in the public
if i i've not seen anything personally

4718
01:21:56,229 --> 01:21:56,239
if i i've not seen anything personally
 

4719
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,790
if i i've not seen anything personally
but if i believe the people who i don't

4720
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:58,800
but if i believe the people who i don't
 

4721
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,950
but if i believe the people who i don't
think can lie

4722
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:00,960
think can lie
 

4723
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:02,470
think can lie
yes

4724
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:02,480
yes
 

4725
01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:04,870
yes
this is how does that make you feel in

4726
01:22:04,870 --> 01:22:04,880
this is how does that make you feel in
 

4727
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,950
this is how does that make you feel in
terms of the way government works the

4728
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
terms of the way government works the
 

4729
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,350
terms of the way government works the
way our human civilization works that

4730
01:22:09,350 --> 01:22:09,360
way our human civilization works that
 

4731
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,510
way our human civilization works that
there might be things like that

4732
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
there might be things like that
 

4733
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,149
there might be things like that
and we're not they're not public is is

4734
01:22:14,149 --> 01:22:14,159
and we're not they're not public is is
 

4735
01:22:14,159 --> 01:22:16,149
and we're not they're not public is is
there a hopeful message for transparency

4736
01:22:16,149 --> 01:22:16,159
there a hopeful message for transparency
 

4737
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,790
there a hopeful message for transparency
that's possible like if you were if you

4738
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:18,800
that's possible like if you were if you
 

4739
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,189
that's possible like if you were if you
were uh in power and i'm not saying

4740
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
were uh in power and i'm not saying
 

4741
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,870
were uh in power and i'm not saying
president because maybe the president is

4742
01:22:22,870 --> 01:22:22,880
president because maybe the president is
 

4743
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:26,470
president because maybe the president is
not the source of power here

4744
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
not the source of power here
 

4745
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,189
not the source of power here
would you release this information in

4746
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
would you release this information in
 

4747
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,350
would you release this information in
some way or form yes

4748
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:31,360
some way or form yes
 

4749
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:32,550
some way or form yes
if i were

4750
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,560
if i were
 

4751
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,070
if i were
i i think it would i think it's

4752
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:36,080
i i think it would i think it's
 

4753
01:22:36,080 --> 01:22:37,270
i i think it would i think it's
i think it's something that can bring

4754
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:37,280
i think it's something that can bring
 

4755
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:39,189
i think it's something that can bring
humanity together

4756
01:22:39,189 --> 01:22:39,199
humanity together
 

4757
01:22:39,199 --> 01:22:41,110
humanity together
right i think that

your reasons were selfish
if your reasons were you wanted to do it

4804
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840
if your reasons were you wanted to do it
 

4805
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,590
if your reasons were you wanted to do it
because you wanted to monetize it

4806
01:23:27,590 --> 01:23:27,600
because you wanted to monetize it

in our solar system is that a valuable

in our solar system is that a valuable
pursuit or maybe most of the stories are

5152
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:31,520
pursuit or maybe most of the stories are
 

5153
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,030
pursuit or maybe most of the stories are
can be

5154
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040
can be
 

5155
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:34,470
can be
most of the fascinating things can be

5156
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
most of the fascinating things can be
 

5157
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,149
most of the fascinating things can be
discovered here on earth or on other

uh
 

5165
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:41,990
uh
you know i think

5166
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
you know i think
 

5167
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,149
you know i think
avi's insight

5168
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:44,159
avi's insight
 

5169
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:48,229
avi's insight
is an interesting speculation right

5170
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
is an interesting speculation right
 

5171
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:49,669
is an interesting speculation right
like i was saying before people can

5172
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
like i was saying before people can
 

5173
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,189
like i was saying before people can
sometimes look at something and not see

5174
01:29:51,189 --> 01:29:51,199
sometimes look at something and not see
 

5175
01:29:51,199 --> 01:29:53,510
sometimes look at something and not see
it for what it is

5176
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520
it for what it is
 

5177
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,430
it for what it is
many would just look at that and say oh

5178
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:55,440
many would just look at that and say oh
 

5179
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,149
many would just look at that and say oh
it's an asteroid and dismiss it there

5180
01:29:58,149 --> 01:29:58,159
it's an asteroid and dismiss it there
 

5181
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,270
it's an asteroid and dismiss it there
was something

5182
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
was something
 

5183
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,390
was something
odd about the data that avi picked up on

5184
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:02,400
odd about the data that avi picked up on
 

5185
01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:03,910
odd about the data that avi picked up on
and said well here's an alternative

5186
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:03,920
and said well here's an alternative
 

5187
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:06,310
and said well here's an alternative
explanation that doesn't fit that

5188
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:06,320
explanation that doesn't fit that
 

5189
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,229
explanation that doesn't fit that
actually better fits the models than it

5190
01:30:08,229 --> 01:30:08,239
actually better fits the models than it
 

5191
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:09,669
actually better fits the models than it
just being a rock

he just has

5196
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
he just has
 

5197
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,629
he just has
ignored the critics because he believes

5198
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:16,639
ignored the critics because he believes
 

5199
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,950
ignored the critics because he believes
the data is real and is using that then

5200
01:30:18,950 --> 01:30:18,960
the data is real and is using that then
 

5201
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:20,629
the data is real and is using that then
as a battering ram

5202
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:20,639
as a battering ram
 

5203
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,390
as a battering ram
to go after other things so i think

5204
01:30:22,390 --> 01:30:22,400
to go after other things so i think
 

5205
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,390
to go after other things so i think
that's i think that's great

5206
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:24,400
that's i think that's great
 

5207
01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:25,830
that's i think that's great
you know yeah

5208
01:30:25,830 --> 01:30:25,840
you know yeah
 

5209
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,669
you know yeah
what what is his main conclusion does he

5210
01:30:27,669 --> 01:30:27,679
what what is his main conclusion does he
 

5211
01:30:27,679 --> 01:30:28,629
what what is his main conclusion does he
say

5212
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:28,639
say
 

5213
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:31,270
say
it could be of uh alien extraterrestrial

5214
01:30:31,270 --> 01:30:31,280
it could be of uh alien extraterrestrial
 

5215
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,030
it could be of uh alien extraterrestrial
origin is that well that's one of the

5216
01:30:33,030 --> 01:30:33,040
origin is that well that's one of the
 

5217
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:34,790
origin is that well that's one of the
things i mean he you know he's explained

5218
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:34,800
things i mean he you know he's explained
 

5219
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:36,709
things i mean he you know he's explained
how it could be a light sail

5220
01:30:36,709 --> 01:30:36,719
how it could be a light sail
 

5221
01:30:36,719 --> 01:30:37,910
how it could be a light sail
um

5222
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
um
 

5223
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,870
um
and a light sail is certainly within

5224
01:30:40,870 --> 01:30:40,880
and a light sail is certainly within
 

5225
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:43,669
and a light sail is certainly within
near human capabilities to make such a

5226
01:30:43,669 --> 01:30:43,679
near human capabilities to make such a
 

5227
01:30:43,679 --> 01:30:45,110
near human capabilities to make such a
thing i think

5228
01:30:45,110 --> 01:30:45,120
thing i think
 

5229
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,669
thing i think
yuri milner is he's a russian

5230
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:47,679
yuri milner is he's a russian
 

5231
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:48,790
yuri milner is he's a russian
billionaire

5232
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:48,800
billionaire
 

5233
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,830
billionaire
he's involved i think in a project to

5234
01:30:51,830 --> 01:30:51,840
he's involved i think in a project to
 

5235
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:55,350
he's involved i think in a project to
make light sales with laser you know to

5236
01:30:55,350 --> 01:30:55,360
make light sales with laser you know to
 

5237
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,390
make light sales with laser you know to
to

5238
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
to
 

5239
01:30:56,400 --> 01:31:00,310
to
launch them with laser power essentially

5240
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:00,320
launch them with laser power essentially
 

5241
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,550
launch them with laser power essentially
uh towards alpha centauri

5242
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:02,560
uh towards alpha centauri
 

5243
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,030
uh towards alpha centauri
right so it's something that

5244
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
right so it's something that
 

5245
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:06,390
right so it's something that
humans

5246
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
humans
 

5247
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:07,590
humans
could make

5248
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:07,600
could make
 

5249
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,830
could make
i think avi's proposal is perfectly

5250
01:31:09,830 --> 01:31:09,840
i think avi's proposal is perfectly
 

5251
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:11,990
i think avi's proposal is perfectly
within the realm of possibility i mean

5252
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,000
within the realm of possibility i mean
 

5253
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,629
within the realm of possibility i mean
sadly the thing is you know now nearly

5254
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
sadly the thing is you know now nearly
 

5255
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:16,790
sadly the thing is you know now nearly
out of our solar system yes i mean to me

5256
01:31:16,790 --> 01:31:16,800
out of our solar system yes i mean to me
 

5257
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:18,470
out of our solar system yes i mean to me
that's inspiring to

5258
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,480
that's inspiring to
 

5259
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:21,030
that's inspiring to
do greater levels of data collection

5260
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
do greater levels of data collection
 

5261
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,870
do greater levels of data collection
yeah in our solar system but also here

5262
01:31:22,870 --> 01:31:22,880
yeah in our solar system but also here
 

5263
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,870
yeah in our solar system but also here
on earth it just seems like we should be

5264
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:24,880
on earth it just seems like we should be
 

5265
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,790
on earth it just seems like we should be
constantly collecting collecting data

5266
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:26,800
constantly collecting collecting data
 

5267
01:31:26,800 --> 01:31:28,870
constantly collecting collecting data
because the tools of software that we're

5268
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:28,880
because the tools of software that we're
 

5269
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,550
because the tools of software that we're
developing get better and better at

5270
01:31:30,550 --> 01:31:30,560
developing get better and better at
 

5271
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:32,310
developing get better and better at
dealing with huge amounts of data it's

5272
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:32,320
dealing with huge amounts of data it's
 

5273
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,870
dealing with huge amounts of data it's
changing the nature of science i mean

5274
01:31:34,870 --> 01:31:34,880
changing the nature of science i mean
 

5275
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:36,950
changing the nature of science i mean
collect all of the data right collect

5276
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
collect all of the data right collect
 

5277
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,830
collect all of the data right collect
the data i mean i i um the galileo

5278
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
the data i mean i i um the galileo
 

5279
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,510
the data i mean i i um the galileo
project asked me over the weekend to

5280
01:31:41,510 --> 01:31:41,520
project asked me over the weekend to
 

5281
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,110
project asked me over the weekend to
join and i did

5282
01:31:43,110 --> 01:31:43,120
join and i did
 

5283
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:45,750
join and i did
so um you know i'm not a specialist in

5284
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:45,760
so um you know i'm not a specialist in
 

5285
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,669
so um you know i'm not a specialist in
any of the stuff that they're doing

5286
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:47,679
any of the stuff that they're doing
 

5287
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,550
any of the stuff that they're doing
uh but you know in looking at the list

5288
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,560
uh but you know in looking at the list
 

5289
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:52,229
uh but you know in looking at the list
of people who are on there there are

5290
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
of people who are on there there are
 

5291
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:55,750
of people who are on there there are
really no biologists on there so at some

5292
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:55,760
really no biologists on there so at some
 

5293
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,149
really no biologists on there so at some
point if my expertise is required for

5294
01:31:58,149 --> 01:31:58,159
point if my expertise is required for
 

5295
01:31:58,159 --> 01:31:59,990
point if my expertise is required for
something what's the goal in the vision

5296
01:31:59,990 --> 01:32:00,000
something what's the goal in the vision
 

5297
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,310
something what's the goal in the vision
of the galileo project better talk to

5298
01:32:02,310 --> 01:32:02,320
of the galileo project better talk to
 

5299
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,390
of the galileo project better talk to
avi but my understanding and just

5300
01:32:04,390 --> 01:32:04,400
avi but my understanding and just
 

5301

potentially
 

5315
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:22,470
potentially
local technological artifacts i need to

5316
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480
local technological artifacts i need to
 

5317
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:24,629
local technological artifacts i need to
look into this this is fascinating and

5318
01:32:24,629 --> 01:32:24,639
look into this this is fascinating and
 

5319
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,110
look into this this is fascinating and
the is heading the galileo project yeah

5320
01:32:27,110 --> 01:32:27,120
the is heading the galileo project yeah
 

5321
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:28,790
the is heading the galileo project yeah
have you spoken to him i've on this

5322
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:28,800
have you spoken to him i've on this

5327
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:35,669
before he was headed it was a new
creation yeah the galileo project was i

5328
01:32:35,669 --> 01:32:35,679
creation yeah the galileo project was i
 

5329
01:32:35,679 --> 01:32:37,350
creation yeah the galileo project was i
think it's about six or seven months old

5330
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
think it's about six or seven months old
 

5331

5333
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,790
now okay you know amazing and he's
getting a group of scientists together

5334
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
getting a group of scientists together
 

5335
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,950
getting a group of scientists together
oh yeah about 100 oh it's it's that's

5336
01:32:42,950 --> 01:32:42,960
oh yeah about 100 oh it's it's that's

it looks like
 

5349
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:54,229
it looks like
a moonshot project i mean i've been

5350
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:54,239
a moonshot project i mean i've been
 

5351
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:56,790
a moonshot project i mean i've been
involved with a lot of nih uh large nih

5352
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
involved with a lot of nih uh large nih

in a lot of
um the fields we began this conversation

5370
01:33:14,790 --> 01:33:14,800
um the fields we began this conversation
 

5371
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:16,870
um the fields we began this conversation
with

5372
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:16,880
with
 

5373
01:33:16,880 --> 01:33:20,310
with
so you're legit scientist

5374
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
so you're legit scientist
 

5375
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,149
so you're legit scientist
but yet you're keeping an open mind to a

5376
01:33:22,149 --> 01:33:22,159
but yet you're keeping an open mind to a
 

5377
01:33:22,159 --> 01:33:25,990
but yet you're keeping an open mind to a
lot of ideas that um

5378
01:33:25,990 --> 01:33:26,000

 

5379
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,590

that

5380
01:33:27,590 --> 01:33:27,600
that
 

5381
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,709
that
maybe require you to take a leap

5382
01:33:30,709 --> 01:33:30,719
maybe require you to take a leap
 

5383
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:32,870
maybe require you to take a leap
outside of the conventional

5384
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
outside of the conventional
 

5385
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,790
outside of the conventional
so what advice would you give to young

5386
01:33:34,790 --> 01:33:34,800
so what advice would you give to young
 

5387
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,430
so what advice would you give to young
people today that are

5388
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
people today that are
 

5389
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:40,470
people today that are
you know in high school or in college

5390
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
you know in high school or in college
 

5391
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,790
you know in high school or in college
that are

that are
 

5393
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,950
that are
dreaming of having impact in science or

5394
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:44,960
dreaming of having impact in science or
 

5395
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:47,750
dreaming of having impact in science or
maybe in whatever career path that goes

5396
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:47,760
maybe in whatever career path that goes
 

5397
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,510
maybe in whatever career path that goes
outside of the conventional that really

5398
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:51,520
outside of the conventional that really
 

5399
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,350
outside of the conventional that really
does something new

5400
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
does something new
 

5401
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,350
does something new
if you believe in something you believe

5402
01:33:55,350 --> 01:33:55,360
if you believe in something you believe
 

5403
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:58,790
if you believe in something you believe
that an idea is

5404
01:33:58,790 --> 01:33:58,800
that an idea is
 

5405
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,310
that an idea is
valuable

5406
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:00,320
valuable
 

5407
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:01,910
valuable
or you haven't approached something

5408
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:01,920
or you haven't approached something
 

5409
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:04,709
or you haven't approached something
don't let others shame you into not

5410
01:34:04,709 --> 01:34:04,719
don't let others shame you into not
 

5411
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:06,470
don't let others shame you into not
doing it

5412
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480
doing it
 

5413
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,270
doing it
as i've said shame is a

5414
01:34:09,270 --> 01:34:09,280
as i've said shame is a
 

5415
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:11,350
as i've said shame is a
societal control device to get other

5416
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:11,360
societal control device to get other
 

5417
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:14,310
societal control device to get other
people to do what they want you to do

5418
01:34:14,310 --> 01:34:14,320
people to do what they want you to do
 

5419
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:16,390
people to do what they want you to do
rather than what you want to do

5420
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:16,400
rather than what you want to do
 

5421
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,390
rather than what you want to do
so shame sometimes is good to stop you

5422
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
so shame sometimes is good to stop you
 

5423
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,950
so shame sometimes is good to stop you
from doing something unethical or wrong

5424
01:34:20,950 --> 01:34:20,960
from doing something unethical or wrong
 

5425
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,669
from doing something unethical or wrong
but shame also is something that is

5426
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
but shame also is something that is
 

5427
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,669
but shame also is something that is
circumscribing

5428
01:34:25,669 --> 01:34:25,679
circumscribing
 

5429
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:28,390
circumscribing
your environment i've never let people

5430
01:34:28,390 --> 01:34:28,400
your environment i've never let people
 

5431
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,830
your environment i've never let people
who've told me you know you shouldn't do

5432
01:34:30,830 --> 01:34:30,840
who've told me you know you shouldn't do
 

5433
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:33,189
who've told me you know you shouldn't do
that line of science you should be

5434
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
that line of science you should be
 

5435
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,550
that line of science you should be
ashamed of yourself for even thinking

5436
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:34,560
ashamed of yourself for even thinking
 

5437
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,550

you basically have closed your mind
 

5455
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,750
you basically have closed your mind
to what the possibilities are and if i'm

i have a couple questions on this so
 

5475
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:17,189
i have a couple questions on this so
first of all just a small comment on

5476
01:35:17,189 --> 01:35:17,199
first of all just a small comment on
 

5477
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:18,229
first of all just a small comment on
that

5478
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:18,239
that
 

5479
01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:20,709
that
i've realized that

5480
01:35:20,709 --> 01:35:20,719
i've realized that
 

5481
01:35:20,719 --> 01:35:22,470
i've realized that
it feels like a lot of the progress in

5482
01:35:22,470 --> 01:35:22,480
it feels like a lot of the progress in
 

5483
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,350
it feels like a lot of the progress in
science is done by people pursuing an

5484
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
science is done by people pursuing an
 

5485
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,910
science is done by people pursuing an
idea that another senior faculty would

5486
01:35:27,910 --> 01:35:27,920
idea that another senior faculty would
 

5487
01:35:27,920 --> 01:35:30,070
idea that another senior faculty would
probably say this is going to hurt your

5488
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:30,080

career
i think it's actually a pretty good

5492
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
i think it's actually a pretty good
 

5493
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,390
i think it's actually a pretty good
indicator that there's something

5494
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:34,400
indicator that there's something
 

5495
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,750
indicator that there's something
interesting when

5496

interesting when
 

5497
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:37,830
interesting when
when a senior wise

5498
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:37,840
when a senior wise
 

5499
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,590
when a senior wise
uh person tells you this is going to

5500
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600

5517
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,270
um and the other i tell my own students
you know i have a lab of about 20 30

5518
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,280
you know i have a lab of about 20 30
 

5519
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:03,189
you know i have a lab of about 20 30
people and has been that big since 1992

5520
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:03,199
people and has been that big since 1992
 

5521
01:36:03,199 --> 01:36:05,109
people and has been that big since 1992
people come and go

5522
01:36:05,109 --> 01:36:05,119
people come and go
 

5523
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:06,390
people come and go
is

5524
01:36:06,390 --> 01:36:06,400
is
 

5525
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:10,229
is
it's not the data that falls in line

5526
01:36:10,229 --> 01:36:10,239
it's not the data that falls in line
 

5527
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,629
it's not the data that falls in line
that's is it that's so interesting it's

5528
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:12,639
that's is it that's so interesting it's
 

5529
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:13,750
that's is it that's so interesting it's
the

5530
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
the
 

5531
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,950
the
it's the spot off the graph

5532
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:16,960
it's the spot off the graph
 

5533
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,590
it's the spot off the graph
that you want to understand yeah that's

5534
01:36:19,590 --> 01:36:19,600
that you want to understand yeah that's
 

5535
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,990
that you want to understand yeah that's
that's it you wanna when something is

5536
01:36:21,990 --> 01:36:22,000
that's it you wanna when something is
 

5537
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,430
that's it you wanna when something is
way off the graph

5538
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:23,440
way off the graph
 

5539
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,350
way off the graph
that's the interesting thing because

5540
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:25,360
that's the interesting thing because
 

5541
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:28,070
that's the interesting thing because
that's usually where discovery is

5542
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,080
that's usually where discovery is
 

5543
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,669
that's usually where discovery is
and the number of times that i've

5544
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
and the number of times that i've
 

5545
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,750
and the number of times that i've
stopped people in my lab and said wait a

5546
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
stopped people in my lab and said wait a
 

5547
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,750
stopped people in my lab and said wait a
second go back a few slides

5548
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
second go back a few slides
 

5549
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,510
second go back a few slides
what was that

5550
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:35,520
what was that
 

5551
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:36,790
what was that
and then it ended up being something

5552
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:36,800
and then it ended up being something
 

5553
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,070
and then it ended up being something
interesting that made their careers

5554
01:36:40,070 --> 01:36:40,080
interesting that made their careers
 

5555
01:36:40,080 --> 01:36:42,470
interesting that made their careers
i i could you know count on

5556
01:36:42,470 --> 01:36:42,480
i i could you know count on
 

5557
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:44,229
i i could you know count on
a few hands

5558
01:36:44,229 --> 01:36:44,239
a few hands
 

5559
01:36:44,239 --> 01:36:46,709
a few hands
yeah get excited by the extraordinary

5560
01:36:46,709 --> 01:36:46,719
yeah get excited by the extraordinary
 

5561
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:49,830
yeah get excited by the extraordinary
that's outside of the thing that you uh

5562
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:49,840
that's outside of the thing that you uh
 

5563
01:36:49,840 --> 01:36:52,790
that's outside of the thing that you uh
that you've done in the past right um

5564
01:36:52,790 --> 01:36:52,800
that you've done in the past right um
 

5565
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:56,709
that you've done in the past right um
just on a personal psychological level

5566

just on a personal psychological level
 

5567
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,870
just on a personal psychological level
is is there

01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
you know i'm sure at stanford i'm sure
 

5571
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,189
you know i'm sure at stanford i'm sure
in you exploring some of these ideas

5572
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199
in you exploring some of these ideas
 

5573
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,790
in you exploring some of these ideas
there's pressure

5574
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:04,800
there's pressure
 

5575
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,510
there's pressure
how do you um

5576
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
how do you um
 

5577
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,510
how do you um
how do you not give in to the pressure

5578
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
how do you not give in to the pressure
 

5579
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,030
how do you not give in to the pressure
how do you not give in to the people

5580
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:11,040
how do you not give in to the people
 

5581
01:37:11,040 --> 01:37:12,470
how do you not give in to the people
that say uh

5582
01:37:12,470 --> 01:37:12,480
that say uh
 

5583
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:14,790
that say uh
like uh that push you away from these

topics that um
 

5587
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,390
topics that um
what you said shame i just point to my

5588
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:20,400
what you said shame i just point to my
 

5589
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,910
what you said shame i just point to my
successes

5590
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:21,920
successes
 

5591
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,830
successes
i say what you know you're the ones who

5592
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:23,840
i say what you know you're the ones who
 

5593
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:25,910
i say what you know you're the ones who
told me not to start companies all this

5594
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:25,920
told me not to start companies all this
 

5595
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:27,189
told me not to start companies all this
time ago

5596
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:27,199
time ago
 

5597
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:29,030
time ago
uh you know and now you're the one

5598
01:37:29,030 --> 01:37:29,040
uh you know and now you're the one
 

5599
01:37:29,040 --> 01:37:30,790
uh you know and now you're the one
coming to me for advice for how to start

5600
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:30,800
coming to me for advice for how to start
 

5601
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,390
coming to me for advice for how to start
a company yeah

5602
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
a company yeah
 

5603
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,629
a company yeah
right um

5604
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
right um
 

5605
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,070
right um
but the

5606
01:37:36,070 --> 01:37:36,080
but the
 

5607
01:37:36,080 --> 01:37:39,590
but the
from the scientific area it's it's

5608
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
from the scientific area it's it's
 

5609
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,830
from the scientific area it's it's
you're wanting to take something off the

5610
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:41,840
you're wanting to take something off the
 

5611
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:46,070
you're wanting to take something off the
table that might be an explanation

5612
01:37:46,070 --> 01:37:46,080
table that might be an explanation
 

5613
01:37:46,080 --> 01:37:47,430
table that might be an explanation
how

5614
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:47,440
how
 

5615
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:48,470
how
how is that

5616
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:48,480
how is that
 

5617
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,350
how is that
the scientific method so you i reverse

5618
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
the scientific method so you i reverse
 

5619
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,990
the scientific method so you i reverse
shame them reversing them

5620
01:37:53,990 --> 01:37:54,000
shame them reversing them
 

5621
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,350
shame them reversing them
so purely with reason through

5622
01:37:55,350 --> 01:37:55,360
so purely with reason through
 

5623
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:56,790
so purely with reason through
conversation you're able to do that so

5624
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
conversation you're able to do that so
 

5625
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,229
conversation you're able to do that so
it doesn't feel because to me it would

5626
01:37:58,229 --> 01:37:58,239
it doesn't feel because to me it would
 

5627
01:37:58,239 --> 01:37:59,750
it doesn't feel because to me it would
just feel lonely there's there's a

5628
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
just feel lonely there's there's a
 

5629
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,070
just feel lonely there's there's a
community yeah there's a community of

5630
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
community yeah there's a community of
 

5631
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,390
community yeah there's a community of
science and you know when you're working

5632
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
science and you know when you're working
 

5633
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,430
science and you know when you're working
on something that's outside a particular

5634
01:38:07,430 --> 01:38:07,440
on something that's outside a particular
 

5635
01:38:07,440 --> 01:38:08,470
on something that's outside a particular
uh

5636
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
uh
 

5637
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,550
uh
conventional way of thinking it could be

5638
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
conventional way of thinking it could be
 

5639
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,550
conventional way of thinking it could be
lonely i mean there there's a you know

5640
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:12,560
lonely i mean there there's a you know
 

5641
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:14,229
lonely i mean there there's a you know
in the ai field

5642
01:38:14,229 --> 01:38:14,239
in the ai field
 

5643
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,149
in the ai field
if you're working on neural networks in

5644
01:38:16,149 --> 01:38:16,159
if you're working on neural networks in
 

5645
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,629
if you're working on neural networks in
the 90s it could be lonely

5646
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
the 90s it could be lonely
 

5647
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,709
the 90s it could be lonely
i have met some of the most fascinating

5648
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
i have met some of the most fascinating
 

5649
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,550
i have met some of the most fascinating
people ever that had i stayed the

5650
01:38:22,550 --> 01:38:22,560
people ever that had i stayed the
 

5651
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:24,629
people ever that had i stayed the
conventional track i would never have

5652
01:38:24,629 --> 01:38:24,639
conventional track i would never have
 

5653
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:25,750
conventional track i would never have
met

5654
01:38:25,750 --> 01:38:25,760
met
 

5655
01:38:25,760 --> 01:38:28,149
met
i mean truly yeah uh

5656
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:28,159
i mean truly yeah uh
 

5657
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:30,950
i mean truly yeah uh
brilliant people because of this

5658
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:30,960
brilliant people because of this
 

5659
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:33,910
brilliant people because of this
so you know it is

5660
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
so you know it is
 

5661
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:36,550
so you know it is
for those worried about

5662
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:36,560
for those worried about
 

5663
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,870
for those worried about
well should i step outside of my

5664
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
well should i step outside of my
 

5665
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:41,030
well should i step outside of my
comfort zone you're going to meet some

5666
01:38:41,030 --> 01:38:41,040
comfort zone you're going to meet some
 

5667
01:38:41,040 --> 01:38:43,430
comfort zone you're going to meet some
really interesting people and you know

5668
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
really interesting people and you know
 

5669
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,709
really interesting people and you know
because i'm open about this area

5670
01:38:46,709 --> 01:38:46,719
because i'm open about this area
 

5671
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,310
because i'm open about this area
you know i'll go and give a talk you

5672
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:48,320
you know i'll go and give a talk you
 

5673
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:51,109
you know i'll go and give a talk you
know in boston harvard or mit

5674
01:38:51,109 --> 01:38:51,119
know in boston harvard or mit
 

5675
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,430
know in boston harvard or mit
and at dinner

5676
01:38:53,430 --> 01:38:53,440
and at dinner
 

5677
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,189
and at dinner
inevitably

5678
01:38:55,189 --> 01:38:55,199
inevitably
 

5679
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:56,870
inevitably
this subject comes up

5680
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
this subject comes up
 

5681
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,870
this subject comes up
and inevitably somebody else at the

5682
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:58,880
and inevitably somebody else at the
 

5683
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:00,790
and inevitably somebody else at the
table will admit both that they're

5684
01:39:00,790 --> 01:39:00,800
table will admit both that they're
 

5685
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:01,990
table will admit both that they're
interested or that they've seen

5686
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:02,000
interested or that they've seen
 

5687
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:03,270
interested or that they've seen
something

5688
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
something
 

5689
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:04,470
something
and suddenly the whole tone of the

5690
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,480
and suddenly the whole tone of the
 

5691
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,790
and suddenly the whole tone of the
conversation changes

5692
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
conversation changes
 

5693
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,229
conversation changes
it's kind of like there's safety in

5694
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:08,239
it's kind of like there's safety in
 

5695
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,750
it's kind of like there's safety in
numbers

5696
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:09,760
numbers
 

5697
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,030
numbers
and uh

5698
01:39:11,030 --> 01:39:11,040
and uh
 

5699
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:12,709
and uh
and then or i've had people come to me

5700
01:39:12,709 --> 01:39:12,719
and then or i've had people come to me
 

5701
01:39:12,719 --> 01:39:14,229
and then or i've had people come to me
afterwards after

5702
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:14,239
afterwards after
 

5703
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,830
afterwards after
dinner and say hey

5704
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:15,840
dinner and say hey
 

5705
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,510
dinner and say hey
you know i i don't talk about this

5706
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,520
you know i i don't talk about this
 

5707
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,189
you know i i don't talk about this
openly but

5708
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
openly but
 

5709
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,270
openly but
so the number of scientists

5710
01:39:21,270 --> 01:39:21,280
so the number of scientists
 

5711
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,070
so the number of scientists
who

5712
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
who
 

5713
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,229
who
who know that there's something

5714
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:24,239
who know that there's something
 

5715
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:27,750
who know that there's something
else going on is much larger

5716
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:27,760
else going on is much larger
 

5717
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,229
else going on is much larger
than the scientific community would like

5718
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:30,239
than the scientific community would like
 

5719
01:39:30,239 --> 01:39:31,830
than the scientific community would like
to think

5720
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
to think
 

5721
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:34,149
to think
that's a really powerful one which is i

5722
01:39:34,149 --> 01:39:34,159
that's a really powerful one which is i
 

5723
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,669
that's a really powerful one which is i
don't talk about this

5724
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
don't talk about this
 

5725
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:37,510
don't talk about this
you know openly

5726
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
you know openly
 

5727
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,390
you know openly
but here's what i believe and you'd be

5728
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,400
