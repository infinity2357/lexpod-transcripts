00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
conscious well it might say that it
 

325
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,480
conscious well it might say that it
would be wrong to turn it off if it was

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,490
would be wrong to turn it off if it was
 

327
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:55,520
would be wrong to turn it off if it was
actually conscious I mean these

328
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,530
actually conscious I mean these
 

329
00:06:55,530 --> 00:07:00,800
actually conscious I mean these
questions arise if you think I mean AI

330
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:00,810
questions arise if you think I mean AI
 

331
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,649
questions arise if you think I mean AI
one of the ideas it's sort of a mixture

332
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:03,659
one of the ideas it's sort of a mixture
 

333
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,080
one of the ideas it's sort of a mixture
in a sense you say if it's trying to do

334
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,090
in a sense you say if it's trying to do
 

335
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,589
in a sense you say if it's trying to do
everything a human can do and if you

336
00:07:09,589 --> 00:07:09,599
everything a human can do and if you
 

337
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,570
everything a human can do and if you
take the view that consciousness is

338
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:11,580
take the view that consciousness is
 

339
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,580
take the view that consciousness is
something which would come along when

340
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:13,590
something which would come along when
 

341
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,640
something which would come along when
the computer is sufficiently complicated

342
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:15,650
the computer is sufficiently complicated
 

343
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,070
the computer is sufficiently complicated
sufficiently whatever criteria you used

344
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,080
sufficiently whatever criteria you used

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:23,750

00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,549
to characterize its consciousness in
terms of some can come

national criterion so how does

350
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:29,339
national criterion so how does
 

351
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,619
national criterion so how does
consciousness change our evaluation of

352
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:33,629
consciousness change our evaluation of
 

353
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:36,589
consciousness change our evaluation of
the decision the hell made it's not to

00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:36,599
the decision the hell made it's not to
 

355
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,909
the decision the hell made it's not to
say that people have been confused about

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
say that people have been confused about
 

357
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,789
say that people have been confused about
this because if they say these machines

358
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:40,799
this because if they say these machines
 

359
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,709
this because if they say these machines
will become conscious but just simply

360
00:07:42,709 --> 00:07:42,719
will become conscious but just simply
 

361
00:07:42,719 --> 00:07:45,229
will become conscious but just simply
because it's the degree of computation

362
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:45,239
because it's the degree of computation
 

363
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,729
because it's the degree of computation
and when you get beyond that certain

364
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:46,739
and when you get beyond that certain
 

365
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,829
and when you get beyond that certain
degree of computation it will become

366
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:48,839
degree of computation it will become
 

367
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,269
degree of computation it will become
conscious then of course you have all

368
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:50,279
conscious then of course you have all
 

369
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,149
conscious then of course you have all
these problems I mean you might say well

370
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:53,159
these problems I mean you might say well
 

371
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,769
these problems I mean you might say well
one of the reasons you're doing AI is

372
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:54,779
one of the reasons you're doing AI is
 

373
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:57,199
one of the reasons you're doing AI is
because you understand the device at

374
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:57,209
because you understand the device at
 

375
00:07:57,209 --> 00:08:00,109
because you understand the device at
some distant planet and you don't want

376
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:00,119
some distant planet and you don't want
 

377
00:08:00,119 --> 00:08:01,609
some distant planet and you don't want
to send a human out there because then

378
00:08:01,609 --> 00:08:01,619
to send a human out there because then
 

379
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:02,719
to send a human out there because then
you'd have to bring it back again and

380
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:02,729
you'd have to bring it back again and
 

381
00:08:02,729 --> 00:08:05,029
you'd have to bring it back again and
that's cost you far more than just

382
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:05,039
that's cost you far more than just
 

383
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,349
that's cost you far more than just
sending it there and leaving it there

384
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:06,359
sending it there and leaving it there
 

385
00:08:06,359 --> 00:08:08,389
sending it there and leaving it there
but if this device is actually a

386
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:08,399
but if this device is actually a
 

387
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,669
but if this device is actually a
conscious entity then you have to face

388
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:10,679
conscious entity then you have to face
 

389
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:12,439
conscious entity then you have to face
up to the fact that that's immoral

390
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:12,449
up to the fact that that's immoral
 

391
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:16,279
up to the fact that that's immoral
and so the mere fact that you're making

392
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,289
and so the mere fact that you're making
 

393
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:21,049
and so the mere fact that you're making
some AI device and getting that thinking

394
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:21,059
some AI device and getting that thinking
 

395
00:08:21,059 --> 00:08:23,349
some AI device and getting that thinking
that removes your responsibility to it

396
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:23,359
that removes your responsibility to it
 

397
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:27,229
that removes your responsibility to it
would be incorrect and so this is a kind

398
00:08:27,229 --> 00:08:27,239
would be incorrect and so this is a kind
 

399
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:28,909
would be incorrect and so this is a kind
of plot floor and that kind of viewpoint

400
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:28,919
of plot floor and that kind of viewpoint
 

401
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:31,869
of plot floor and that kind of viewpoint
I'm not sure how you know people who

I'm not sure how you know people who
 

403
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:35,839
I'm not sure how you know people who
take it very seriously I'm gonna have

404
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:35,849
take it very seriously I'm gonna have

00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,139
take it very seriously I'm gonna have

going to forget names and I'm afraid
 

409
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,199
going to forget names and I'm afraid
because this is what happens to me in

because this is what happens to me in

well just tell you my story you see

00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:13,470
to paint him into a corner you see use
 

437
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,150
to paint him into a corner you see use

his arguments to convince him that
certain numbers are conscious you know

certain numbers are conscious you know

00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:23,459
actually conscious and this was going to
 

445
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,910
actually conscious and this was going to

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
be my reductio ad absurdum so i started

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,350
be my reductio ad absurdum so i started

having this argument and he simply

451
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,610
leptin to the corner he didn't even need
to be painted into it he took the view

452
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:31,620
to be painted into it he took the view
 

453
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,290
to be painted into it he took the view
that certain numbers were conscious I

454
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:33,300
that certain numbers were conscious I
 

455
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,210
that certain numbers were conscious I
thought that was a reductio ad absurdum

456
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:35,220
thought that was a reductio ad absurdum
 

457
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,490
thought that was a reductio ad absurdum
but he seemed to think it was perfectly

458
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,500
but he seemed to think it was perfectly
 

459
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,079
but he seemed to think it was perfectly
reasonable point of view with

460
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:39,089
reasonable point of view with
 

461
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:41,780
reasonable point of view with
out the absurdum there yes interesting

462
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:41,790
out the absurdum there yes interesting
 

463
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,660
out the absurdum there yes interesting
but the thing you mentioned about how is

464
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:44,670
but the thing you mentioned about how is
 

465
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,790
but the thing you mentioned about how is
the intuition that a lot of the people

466
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
the intuition that a lot of the people
 

467
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,410
the intuition that a lot of the people
at least in the artificial intelligence

468
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,420
at least in the artificial intelligence
 

469
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,769
at least in the artificial intelligence
world had and have I think they don't

world had and have I think they don't
 

471
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,049
world had and have I think they don't
make it explicit but that if you

472
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:54,059
make it explicit but that if you
 

473
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:56,499
make it explicit but that if you
increase the power of computation

474
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:56,509
increase the power of computation
 

475
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,119
increase the power of computation
naturally consciousness will emerge yes

476
00:09:59,119 --> 00:09:59,129
naturally consciousness will emerge yes
 

477
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,410
naturally consciousness will emerge yes
I think that's what they think but

478
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:00,420
I think that's what they think but
 

479
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,610
I think that's what they think but
basically that's because they can't

480
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:01,620
basically that's because they can't
 

481
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,290
basically that's because they can't
think of anything else well that's right

482
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:03,300
think of anything else well that's right
 

483
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,509
think of anything else well that's right
and so it's a reasonable thing I mean

484
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
and so it's a reasonable thing I mean
 

485
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,069
and so it's a reasonable thing I mean
you think what the brain do what does do

486
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:07,079
you think what the brain do what does do
 

487
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,829
you think what the brain do what does do
a lot of computation I think most of

488
00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:09,839
a lot of computation I think most of
 

489
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,629
a lot of computation I think most of
what you actually call computation is

490
00:10:11,629 --> 00:10:11,639
what you actually call computation is
 

491
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,869
what you actually call computation is
done by the cerebellum I mean this is

492
00:10:14,869 --> 00:10:14,879
done by the cerebellum I mean this is
 

493
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,699
done by the cerebellum I mean this is
one of the things that people don't much

494
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:16,709
one of the things that people don't much
 

495
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:18,829
one of the things that people don't much
mention and when I come to this subject

496
00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:18,839
mention and when I come to this subject
 

497
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,389
mention and when I come to this subject
from the outside and certain things

498
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
from the outside and certain things
 

499
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,210
from the outside and certain things
strike me which you hardly ever hear

500
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:23,220
strike me which you hardly ever hear
 

501
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,970
strike me which you hardly ever hear
mentioned em you hear mentioned about

502
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:25,980
mentioned em you hear mentioned about
 

503
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,720
mentioned em you hear mentioned about
the left-right business they move your

504
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:29,730
the left-right business they move your
 

505
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,309
the left-right business they move your
right arm that's you're on the left side

506
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:31,319
right arm that's you're on the left side
 

507
00:10:31,319 --> 00:10:33,379
right arm that's you're on the left side
of the brain and and so on and all that

508
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:33,389
of the brain and and so on and all that
 

509
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:36,230
of the brain and and so on and all that
sort of stuff and it's more than that if

510
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:36,240
sort of stuff and it's more than that if
 

511
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,590
sort of stuff and it's more than that if
you you have this plots of different

512
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,600
you you have this plots of different
 

513
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,970
you you have this plots of different
parts of the brain they're they're two

514
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:40,980
parts of the brain they're they're two
 

515
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,049
parts of the brain they're they're two
of these these things called the

516
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:42,059
of these these things called the
 

517
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,329
of these these things called the
homunculus which you see these pictures

518
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:44,339
homunculus which you see these pictures
 

519
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:49,129
homunculus which you see these pictures
of a distorted human figure and showing

520
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:49,139
of a distorted human figure and showing
 

521
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,889
of a distorted human figure and showing
different parts of the brain controlling

522
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:51,899
different parts of the brain controlling
 

523
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,689
different parts of the brain controlling
different parts of the body and it's not

524
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:53,699
different parts of the body and it's not
 

525
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:57,049
different parts of the body and it's not
simply things like okay the right hand

526
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:57,059
simply things like okay the right hand
 

527
00:10:57,059 --> 00:10:59,720
simply things like okay the right hand
is controlled and since both sensory and

528
00:10:59,720 --> 00:10:59,730
is controlled and since both sensory and
 

529
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,650
is controlled and since both sensory and
motor on the left side left hand on the

530
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:03,660
motor on the left side left hand on the
 

531
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,470
motor on the left side left hand on the
right side it's more than that vision is

532
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
right side it's more than that vision is
 

533
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,470
right side it's more than that vision is
at the back basically your feet at the

534
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:09,480
at the back basically your feet at the
 

535
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,230
at the back basically your feet at the
top I mean so it's about the worst

536
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
top I mean so it's about the worst
 

537
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,600
top I mean so it's about the worst
organization you can imagine right yeah

538
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:14,610
organization you can imagine right yeah
 

539
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,269
organization you can imagine right yeah
so it can't just be a mistake in nature

540
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
so it can't just be a mistake in nature
 

541
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,860
so it can't just be a mistake in nature
there's something going on there and

542
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:18,870
there's something going on there and
 

543
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,879
there's something going on there and
this is made more pronounced when you

544
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:22,889
this is made more pronounced when you
 

545
00:11:22,889 --> 00:11:25,780
this is made more pronounced when you
think of the cerebellum the cerebellum

546
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:25,790
think of the cerebellum the cerebellum
 

547
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,850
think of the cerebellum the cerebellum
has when I was first thinking about

548
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:28,860
has when I was first thinking about
 

549
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,220
has when I was first thinking about
these things I was told it had half as

these things I was told it had half as
 

551
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,799
these things I was told it had half as
many neurons or something they're bad

552
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:32,809
many neurons or something they're bad
 

553
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:34,970
many neurons or something they're bad
comparable and now they tell me it's got

554
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:34,980
comparable and now they tell me it's got
 

555
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,360
comparable and now they tell me it's got
far more neurons in the cerebrum then

556
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:38,370
far more neurons in the cerebrum then
 

557
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:40,100
far more neurons in the cerebrum then
cerebrum is this sort of convoluted

558
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,110
cerebrum is this sort of convoluted
 

559
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,600
cerebrum is this sort of convoluted
thing at the top people always talk

560
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:41,610

of a tennis player or something does
that tennis player think exactly harder

that tennis player think exactly harder

00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:52,139
that tennis player think exactly harder
which muscles should be moved in what

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:54,989
which muscles should be moved in what
direction and so of course not but he or

00:12:56,939 --> 00:12:56,949
she will maybe think well if the ball is

00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:58,679
she will maybe think well if the ball is
angled in such a way in that corner

622
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:58,689
angled in such a way in that corner
 

623
00:12:58,689 --> 00:13:00,779
angled in such a way in that corner
there will be tricky for the opponent

624
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:00,789
there will be tricky for the opponent
 

625
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:05,629
there will be tricky for the opponent
and the details of that are all done

626
00:13:05,629 --> 00:13:05,639
and the details of that are all done
 

627
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:09,179
and the details of that are all done
largely with the cerebellum that's where

628
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:09,189
largely with the cerebellum that's where
 

629
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,789
largely with the cerebellum that's where
all the precise motions but it's

630
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:11,799
all the precise motions but it's
 

631
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,219
all the precise motions but it's
unconscious so why is it interesting to

632
00:13:14,219 --> 00:13:14,229
unconscious so why is it interesting to
 

633
00:13:14,229 --> 00:13:16,799
unconscious so why is it interesting to
you that so much computation is done in

634
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:16,809
you that so much computation is done in
 

635
00:13:16,809 --> 00:13:19,169
you that so much computation is done in
the cerebellum and yet is unconscious

636
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:19,179
the cerebellum and yet is unconscious
 

637
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,689
the cerebellum and yet is unconscious
because it doesn't it's it's the view

638
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:21,699
because it doesn't it's it's the view
 

639

because it doesn't it's it's the view
that somehow it's computation which is

640
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:24,939
that somehow it's computation which is
 

641
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:29,099
that somehow it's computation which is
producing the consciousness and it's

642
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:29,109
producing the consciousness and it's
 

643
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:30,779
producing the consciousness and it's
here you have an incredible amount of

644
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:30,789
here you have an incredible amount of
 

645
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:34,019
here you have an incredible amount of
computation going on and as far as we

646
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:34,029
computation going on and as far as we
 

647
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:37,349
computation going on and as far as we
know it's completely unconscious so why

648
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:37,359
know it's completely unconscious so why
 

649
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,049
know it's completely unconscious so why
what's the difference and I think it's

650
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:40,059
what's the difference and I think it's
 

651
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:43,069
what's the difference and I think it's
an important thing what's the difference

652
00:13:43,069 --> 00:13:43,079
an important thing what's the difference
 

653
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,559
an important thing what's the difference
why is the cerebrum but all this very

654
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:46,569
why is the cerebrum but all this very
 

655
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:49,139
why is the cerebrum but all this very
peculiar stuff that very hard to see on

656
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:49,149
peculiar stuff that very hard to see on
 

657
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:51,839
peculiar stuff that very hard to see on
a computational perspectives like having

658
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:51,849
a computational perspectives like having
 

659
00:13:51,849 --> 00:13:54,089
a computational perspectives like having
me everything have to cross over under

660
00:13:54,089 --> 00:13:54,099
me everything have to cross over under
 

661
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:55,710
me everything have to cross over under
the other size and do something which

662
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:55,720
the other size and do something which
 

663
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,649
the other size and do something which
looks completely inefficient and you've

664
00:13:58,649 --> 00:13:58,659
looks completely inefficient and you've
 

665
00:13:58,659 --> 00:14:00,640
looks completely inefficient and you've
got funny things like the

666
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:00,650
got funny things like the
 

667
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:03,130
got funny things like the
frontal-lobe when the prett are where

668
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:03,140
frontal-lobe when the prett are where
 

669
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,230
frontal-lobe when the prett are where
did we call the Louvre and the place

670
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:05,240
did we call the Louvre and the place
 

671
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,690
did we call the Louvre and the place
where they come together you have the

672
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:09,700
where they come together you have the
 

673
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,580
where they come together you have the
different parts the control if you

674
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:12,590
different parts the control if you
 

675
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:14,230
different parts the control if you
wanted to do with motor and the other to

676
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,240
wanted to do with motor and the other to
 

677
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,050
wanted to do with motor and the other to
do with sensory and they're sort of

678
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,060
do with sensory and they're sort of
 

679
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,430
do with sensory and they're sort of
opposite each other rather than being

680
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:18,440
opposite each other rather than being
 

681
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,340
opposite each other rather than being
connected by a nuclear pie it's not just

682
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,350
connected by a nuclear pie it's not just
 

683
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,720
connected by a nuclear pie it's not just
though you've got electrical circuits

684
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:22,730
though you've got electrical circuits
 

685
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,410
though you've got electrical circuits
there's something else going on there so

686
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:26,420
there's something else going on there so
 

687
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,990
there's something else going on there so
it's it's just the idea that it's like a

688
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,000
it's it's just the idea that it's like a
 

689
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,970
it's it's just the idea that it's like a
complicated computer it just seems to me

690
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:30,980
complicated computer it just seems to me
 

691
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,720
complicated computer it just seems to me
to be completely missing the point there

692
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:34,730
to be completely missing the point there
 

693
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:36,540
to be completely missing the point there
must be a lot of computation going on

694
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:36,550
must be a lot of computation going on
 

695
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,190
must be a lot of computation going on
but the cerebellum seems to be much

696
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:39,200
but the cerebellum seems to be much
 

697
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,080
but the cerebellum seems to be much
better at doing that then the cerebrum

698
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,090
better at doing that then the cerebrum
 

699
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,310
better at doing that then the cerebrum
is so for sure I think what explains it

700
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:45,320
is so for sure I think what explains it
 

701
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,820
is so for sure I think what explains it
it's as like half hope and half we don't

702
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:48,830
it's as like half hope and half we don't
 

703
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,800
it's as like half hope and half we don't
know what's going on and therefore from

704
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:50,810
know what's going on and therefore from
 

705
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,600
know what's going on and therefore from
the computer science perspective you

706
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,610
the computer science perspective you
 

707
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:55,480
the computer science perspective you
hope that a Turing machine can be

708
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:55,490
hope that a Turing machine can be
 

709
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,340
hope that a Turing machine can be
perfectly can achieve general

710
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:57,350
perfectly can achieve general
 

711
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,570
perfectly can achieve general
intelligence well you have this

712
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:58,580
intelligence well you have this
 

713
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,910
intelligence well you have this
wonderful thing about during and girdle

714
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
wonderful thing about during and girdle
 

715
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,780
wonderful thing about during and girdle
and church and carry and various people

716
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:06,790
and church and carry and various people
 

717
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,330
and church and carry and various people
particularly Turing and I guess post was

718
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:10,340
particularly Turing and I guess post was
 

719
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,630
particularly Turing and I guess post was
the other one these people who develop

720
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:13,640
the other one these people who develop
 

721
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,830
the other one these people who develop
the idea of what a computation is and

722
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:17,840
the idea of what a computation is and
 

723
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,420
the idea of what a computation is and
there were different ideas of what a

724
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:19,430
there were different ideas of what a
 

725
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,830
there were different ideas of what a
computer developed differently I mean

726
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:20,840
computer developed differently I mean
 

727
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,750
computer developed differently I mean
church's way of doing it was very

728
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:22,760
church's way of doing it was very
 

729
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,000
church's way of doing it was very
different from Turing's but then they

730
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,010
different from Turing's but then they
 

731
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,220
different from Turing's but then they
were shown to be equivalent and so the

732
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:27,230
were shown to be equivalent and so the
 

733
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,710
were shown to be equivalent and so the
view emerged that what we mean by a

734
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:29,720
view emerged that what we mean by a
 

735
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:35,340
view emerged that what we mean by a
computation is a very clear concept and

736
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,350
computation is a very clear concept and
 

737
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:37,600
computation is a very clear concept and
one of the wonderful things that during

738
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:37,610
one of the wonderful things that during
 

739
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:40,330
one of the wonderful things that during
did was to show that you could have what

740
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:40,340
did was to show that you could have what
 

741
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:43,330
did was to show that you could have what
we call the universal Turing machine it

742
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:43,340
we call the universal Turing machine it
 

743
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,920
we call the universal Turing machine it
you just have to have a certain finite

744
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:44,930
you just have to have a certain finite
 

745
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:47,500
you just have to have a certain finite
device okay it has to have an unlimited

746
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:47,510
device okay it has to have an unlimited
 

747
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,630
device okay it has to have an unlimited
storage space which is accessible to it

748
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:49,640
storage space which is accessible to it
 

749
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,820
storage space which is accessible to it
but the actual computation if you like

750
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:51,830
but the actual computation if you like
 

751
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,550
but the actual computation if you like
is performed by this one universal

752
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:54,560
is performed by this one universal
 

753
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,910
is performed by this one universal
device and so the view comes away well

754
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:57,920
device and so the view comes away well
 

755
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,490
device and so the view comes away well
you have this universal Turing machine

756
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:00,500
you have this universal Turing machine
 

757
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,220
you have this universal Turing machine
and maybe the the brain is something

758
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,230
and maybe the the brain is something
 

759
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,260
and maybe the the brain is something
like that a universal Turing machine and

760
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,270
like that a universal Turing machine and
 

761
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:08,350
like that a universal Turing machine and
it's got maybe not an unlimited storage

762
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:08,360
it's got maybe not an unlimited storage
 

763
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,860
it's got maybe not an unlimited storage
with a huge storage accessible through

764
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:11,870
with a huge storage accessible through
 

765
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,230
with a huge storage accessible through
it and this model is one

766
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:14,240
it and this model is one
 

767
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,030
it and this model is one
which is what's used in ordinary

768
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:16,040
which is what's used in ordinary
 

769
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,400
which is what's used in ordinary
computation it's a very powerful model

770
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,410
computation it's a very powerful model
 

771
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:22,740
computation it's a very powerful model
and the universalness of computation

772
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:22,750
and the universalness of computation
 

773
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,720
and the universalness of computation
it's very useful you can have some

774
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:25,730
it's very useful you can have some
 

775
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:27,430
it's very useful you can have some
problem and you may not see immediately

776
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
problem and you may not see immediately
 

777
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,610
problem and you may not see immediately
how to put it onto a computer but if it

778
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:30,620
how to put it onto a computer but if it
 

779
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,360
how to put it onto a computer but if it
is something of that nature then there

780
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,370
is something of that nature then there
 

781
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:36,340
is something of that nature then there
were all sorts of sub programs and

782
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:36,350
were all sorts of sub programs and
 

783
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,840
were all sorts of sub programs and
subroutines when all the I mean I

784
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:37,850
subroutines when all the I mean I
 

785
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,250
subroutines when all the I mean I
learned a little bit of computing when I

786
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:39,260
learned a little bit of computing when I
 

787
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,650
learned a little bit of computing when I
was when I was a student but not very

788
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:41,660
was when I was a student but not very
 

789
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,250
was when I was a student but not very
much

790
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:42,260
much
 

791
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,710
much
it was enough to get the general ideas

792
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
it was enough to get the general ideas
 

793
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,300
it was enough to get the general ideas
and there's something really Pleasant

794
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,310
and there's something really Pleasant
 

795
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,090
and there's something really Pleasant
about a formal system like that yeah

796
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,100
about a formal system like that yeah
 

797
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,470
about a formal system like that yeah

you've got it right or not you've got a

958
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:21,470
you've got it right or not you've got a
 

959
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,490
you've got it right or not you've got a
lot of steps have you carried this

960
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:23,500
lot of steps have you carried this
 

961
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,920
lot of steps have you carried this
computational procedure well following

962
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:26,930
computational procedure well following
 

963
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,010
computational procedure well following
the proof steps of the proof correctly

964
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:30,020
the proof steps of the proof correctly
 

965
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,330
the proof steps of the proof correctly
that can be checked by an algorithm by a

966
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,340
that can be checked by an algorithm by a
 

967
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,530
that can be checked by an algorithm by a
computer so that's the key thing now

968
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:38,540
computer so that's the key thing now
 

969
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,070
computer so that's the key thing now
what

970
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
what
 

971
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,480
what
have to now you see is this any good if

972
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,490
have to now you see is this any good if
 

973
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:47,419
have to now you see is this any good if
you've got an algorithmic system which

974
00:20:47,419 --> 00:20:47,429
you've got an algorithmic system which
 

975
00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:49,940
you've got an algorithmic system which
claims to say yes this is right this

976
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:49,950
claims to say yes this is right this
 

977
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,740
claims to say yes this is right this
you've proved it correctly this is true

978
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:51,750
you've proved it correctly this is true
 

979
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,409
you've proved it correctly this is true
if you've proved it if you made a

980
00:20:54,409 --> 00:20:54,419
if you've proved it if you made a
 

981
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,639
if you've proved it if you made a
mistake it doesn't say it's true or

982
00:20:55,639 --> 00:20:55,649
mistake it doesn't say it's true or
 

983
00:20:55,649 --> 00:20:56,899
mistake it doesn't say it's true or
false but if you have if you've done it

984
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:56,909
false but if you have if you've done it
 

985
00:20:56,909 --> 00:21:00,169
false but if you have if you've done it
right then the conclusion you've come to

986
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:00,179
right then the conclusion you've come to
 

987
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,779
right then the conclusion you've come to
is correct now you say why do you

988
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:02,789
is correct now you say why do you
 

989
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:04,159
is correct now you say why do you
believe it's correct because you've

990
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:04,169
believe it's correct because you've
 

991
00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:05,539
believe it's correct because you've
looked at the rules and you said well

992
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:05,549
looked at the rules and you said well
 

993
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:06,980
looked at the rules and you said well
okay that one's all right yeah and that

994
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:06,990
okay that one's all right yeah and that
 

995
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,210
okay that one's all right yeah and that
one's all right what about that harm not

996
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:08,220
one's all right what about that harm not
 

997
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,310
one's all right what about that harm not
yeah I see I see why it's all right okay

998
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
yeah I see I see why it's all right okay
 

999
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,379
yeah I see I see why it's all right okay
you go through all the rules you say yes

1000
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:12,389
you go through all the rules you say yes
 

1001
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,779
you go through all the rules you say yes
following those rules if it says yes

1002
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:14,789
following those rules if it says yes
 

1003
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:18,259
following those rules if it says yes
it's true it is true they've got to make

1004
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:18,269
it's true it is true they've got to make
 

1005
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:20,389
it's true it is true they've got to make
sure that these rules are ones that you

1006
00:21:20,389 --> 00:21:20,399
sure that these rules are ones that you
 

1007
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:23,419
sure that these rules are ones that you
trust is if you follow the rules and it

1008
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:23,429
trust is if you follow the rules and it
 

1009
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:26,210
trust is if you follow the rules and it
says it's a proof is the result actually

1010
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:26,220
says it's a proof is the result actually
 

1011
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,669
says it's a proof is the result actually
true right and that your belief that's

1012
00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:28,679
true right and that your belief that's
 

1013
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:31,549
true right and that your belief that's
true depends upon looking at the rules

1014
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:31,559
true depends upon looking at the rules
 

1015
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:35,000
true depends upon looking at the rules
and understanding them now what girl

1016
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,010
and understanding them now what girl
 

1017
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,620
and understanding them now what girl
shows that if you have such a system

1018
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:38,630
shows that if you have such a system
 

1019
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,360
shows that if you have such a system
then you can construct a statement of

1020
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,370
then you can construct a statement of
 

1021
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,310
then you can construct a statement of
the very kind that it's supposed to look

1022
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:43,320
the very kind that it's supposed to look
 

1023
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,129
the very kind that it's supposed to look
at a mathematical statement and you can

1024
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:46,139
at a mathematical statement and you can
 

1025
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,340
at a mathematical statement and you can
see by the way it's constructed and what

1026
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:49,350
see by the way it's constructed and what
 

1027
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,740
see by the way it's constructed and what
it means that it's true but not provable

1028
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:54,750
it means that it's true but not provable
 

1029
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,039
it means that it's true but not provable
by the rules that you've been given and

1030
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:58,049
by the rules that you've been given and
 

1031
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:01,009
by the rules that you've been given and
it depends on your trust in the rules do

1032
00:22:01,009 --> 00:22:01,019
it depends on your trust in the rules do
 

1033
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,629
it depends on your trust in the rules do
you believe that the rules only give you

1034
00:22:02,629 --> 00:22:02,639
you believe that the rules only give you
 

1035
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:04,370
you believe that the rules only give you
truth if you believe the rules on you

1036
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:04,380
truth if you believe the rules on you
 

1037
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,019
truth if you believe the rules on you
give you truth then you believe this

1038
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:06,029
give you truth then you believe this
 

1039
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:08,990
give you truth then you believe this
other statement is also true I found

1040
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:09,000
other statement is also true I found
 

1041
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,210
other statement is also true I found
this absolutely mind-blowing when I saw

1042
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,220
this absolutely mind-blowing when I saw
 

1043
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,320
this absolutely mind-blowing when I saw
this it blew my mind oh my god you can

1044
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:15,330
this it blew my mind oh my god you can
 

1045
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,169
this it blew my mind oh my god you can
see that this statement is true it's as

1046
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:18,179
see that this statement is true it's as
 

1047
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:20,330
see that this statement is true it's as
good as any proof because it only

1048
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:20,340
good as any proof because it only
 

1049
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,909
good as any proof because it only
depends on your belief in the

1050
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:22,919
depends on your belief in the
 

1051
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,470
depends on your belief in the
reliability of the proof procedure

1052
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:24,480
reliability of the proof procedure
 

1053
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,620
reliability of the proof procedure
that's all it is and understanding that

1054
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:27,630
that's all it is and understanding that
 

1055
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,409
that's all it is and understanding that
the coding is done correctly and it

1056
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:30,419
the coding is done correctly and it
 

1057
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,950
the coding is done correctly and it
enables you to transcend that system so

1058
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:33,960
enables you to transcend that system so
 

1059
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,919
enables you to transcend that system so
whatever system you have as long as you

1060
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:36,929
whatever system you have as long as you
 

1061
00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:39,289
whatever system you have as long as you
can understand what it's doing and why

1062
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:39,299
can understand what it's doing and why
 

1063
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,110
can understand what it's doing and why
you believe it only gives you truths

1064
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
you believe it only gives you truths
 

1065
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,049
you believe it only gives you truths
then you can see beyond that system now

1066
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:44,059
then you can see beyond that system now
 

1067
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:48,010
then you can see beyond that system now
how do you see beyond it what is it that

1068
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,020
how do you see beyond it what is it that
 

1069
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,899
how do you see beyond it what is it that
enables you to transcend that system

1070
00:22:50,899 --> 00:22:50,909
enables you to transcend that system
 

1071
00:22:50,909 --> 00:22:53,340
enables you to transcend that system
well it's your understanding

1072
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:53,350
well it's your understanding
 

1073
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,930
well it's your understanding
of what the system is actually saying

1074
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:54,940
of what the system is actually saying
 

1075
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,970
of what the system is actually saying
and what the statement and you've

1076
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:56,980
and what the statement and you've
 

1077
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,850
and what the statement and you've
constructed is actually staying just

1078
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:58,860
constructed is actually staying just
 

1079
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,560
constructed is actually staying just
this quality of understanding whatever

1080
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:01,570
this quality of understanding whatever
 

1081
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,070
this quality of understanding whatever
it is which is not governed by rules

1082
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:05,080
it is which is not governed by rules
 

1083
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,529
it is which is not governed by rules
it's not a computational procedure so

1084
00:23:07,529 --> 00:23:07,539
it's not a computational procedure so
 

1085
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:09,419
it's not a computational procedure so
this idea of understanding is not going

1086
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:09,429
this idea of understanding is not going
 

1087
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,570
this idea of understanding is not going
to be within the rules of the sort of

1088
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:11,580
to be within the rules of the sort of
 

1089
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,730
to be within the rules of the sort of
within the formal system yes yes rules

1090
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:14,740
within the formal system yes yes rules
 

1091
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,340
within the formal system yes yes rules
anyway yeah because you have understood

1092
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,350
anyway yeah because you have understood
 

1093
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,169
anyway yeah because you have understood
them to be rules which only give you

1094
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:19,179
them to be rules which only give you
 

1095
00:23:19,179 --> 00:23:21,480
them to be rules which only give you
truths they be no point in it otherwise

1096
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:21,490
truths they be no point in it otherwise
 

1097
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,460
truths they be no point in it otherwise
I'm a people say well ok this is what

1098
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,470
I'm a people say well ok this is what
 

1099
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,779
I'm a people say well ok this is what
this one said the rules as good as any

1100
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:27,789
this one said the rules as good as any
 

1101
00:23:27,789 --> 00:23:29,070
this one said the rules as good as any
other well it's not true you see you

1102
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,080
other well it's not true you see you
 

1103
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,710
other well it's not true you see you
have to understand what the rules mean

1104
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:30,720
have to understand what the rules mean
 

1105
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,060
have to understand what the rules mean
and why does that understanding of the

1106
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,070
and why does that understanding of the
 

1107
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,190
and why does that understanding of the
mean give you something beyond the rules

1108
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:35,200
mean give you something beyond the rules
 

1109
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,289
mean give you something beyond the rules
themselves and that's that's what it was

1110
00:23:37,289 --> 00:23:37,299
themselves and that's that's what it was
 

1111
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:40,070
themselves and that's that's what it was
that's what blew my mind it's somehow

1112
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
that's what blew my mind it's somehow
 

1113
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,310
that's what blew my mind it's somehow
standing why the rules give you truths

1114
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,320
standing why the rules give you truths
 

1115
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:46,080
standing why the rules give you truths
enables you to transcend the rules so

1116
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,090
enables you to transcend the rules so
 

1117
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,789
enables you to transcend the rules so
that's where I mean even at that time

1118
00:23:47,789 --> 00:23:47,799
that's where I mean even at that time
 

1119
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,440
that's where I mean even at that time
that's already where the thought entered

1120
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:49,450
that's already where the thought entered
 

1121
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,850
that's already where the thought entered
your mind that the idea of understanding

1122
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:52,860
your mind that the idea of understanding
 

1123
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,680
your mind that the idea of understanding
or we can start calling it things like

or we can start calling it things like
 

1125
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,140

people say people somebody knows well we

1132
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:05,710
people say people somebody knows well we
 

1133
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,350
people say people somebody knows well we
know but about creativity that's

1134
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
know but about creativity that's
 

1135
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,789
know but about creativity that's
something a machine can't do is great

1136
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:08,799
something a machine can't do is great
 

1137
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,340
something a machine can't do is great
well I don't know what is creativity and

1138
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:11,350
well I don't know what is creativity and
 

1139
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,960
well I don't know what is creativity and
I don't know you know somebody can put

1140
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:12,970
I don't know you know somebody can put
 

1141
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,460
I don't know you know somebody can put
some funny things on a piece of paper

1142
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:14,470
some funny things on a piece of paper
 

1143
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,990
some funny things on a piece of paper
and say that's creative and you could

1144
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
and say that's creative and you could
 

1145
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,370
and say that's creative and you could
make a machine do that is it really

1146
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:17,380
make a machine do that is it really
 

1147
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380

creative I don't know he said I worry

1148
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,390
creative I don't know he said I worry
 

1149
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,630
creative I don't know he said I worry
about that one I sort of agree with it

1150
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:21,640
about that one I sort of agree with it
 

1151
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,090
about that one I sort of agree with it
in a sense but it's so hard to do

1152
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,100
in a sense but it's so hard to do
 

1153
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,520
in a sense but it's so hard to do
anything with that statement but

1154
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:25,530
anything with that statement but
 

1155
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:28,340
anything with that statement but
understanding yes you can you can make

1156
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:28,350
understanding yes you can you can make
 

1157
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,039
understanding yes you can you can make
go see that understanding whatever it is

1158
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:32,049
go see that understanding whatever it is
 

1159
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:33,930
go see that understanding whatever it is
and it's very hard to put your finger on

1160
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:33,940
and it's very hard to put your finger on
 

1161
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,419
and it's very hard to put your finger on
it that's absolutely true can you try to

1162
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:36,429
it that's absolutely true can you try to
 

1163
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:39,690
it that's absolutely true can you try to
define or maybe dance around a

1164
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:39,700
define or maybe dance around a
 

1165
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,330
define or maybe dance around a
definition of understanding to some

1166

definition of understanding to some
 

1167
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,360
definition of understanding to some
degree but I don't often once it's about

1168
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:45,370
degree but I don't often once it's about
 

1169
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,190
degree but I don't often once it's about
this but there is something there which

1170
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:47,200
this but there is something there which
 

1171
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,180
this but there is something there which
is very slippery it's something like

1172
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,190
is very slippery it's something like
 

1173
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,250
is very slippery it's something like

quality of understanding which goes with
 

1221

quality of understanding which goes with
all the it's not just a mathematician

1222
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,220
all the it's not just a mathematician
 

1223
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,880
all the it's not just a mathematician
doing some mathematics this

understanding quality is something else
which has been a tremendous advantage to

1228
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,100
which has been a tremendous advantage to
 

1229
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,680
which has been a tremendous advantage to
us not just to us see I don't think

1230
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:00,690
us not just to us see I don't think
 

1231
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:02,930
us not just to us see I don't think
consciousness is limited to humans

consciousness is limited to humans
 

1233
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:05,190
consciousness is limited to humans
that's the interesting question at which

1234
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,200
that's the interesting question at which
 

1235
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,590
that's the interesting question at which
point if it is indeed connected to the

1236
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
point if it is indeed connected to the
 

1237
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,120
point if it is indeed connected to the
evolutionary process yeah

1238
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:09,130
evolutionary process yeah
 

1239
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,610
evolutionary process yeah
at which point is we pick up this very

1240
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:11,620
at which point is we pick up this very
 

1241
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,490
at which point is we pick up this very
hard question it's certainly I don't

1242
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:14,500
hard question it's certainly I don't
 

1243
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,280
hard question it's certainly I don't
think it's primates you know you see

1244
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:17,290
think it's primates you know you see
 

1245
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,190
think it's primates you know you see

these pictures of African hunting dogs
 

1247
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,260
these pictures of African hunting dogs
and how they they can plan amongst

1248
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,270
and how they they can plan amongst
 

1249
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,940
and how they they can plan amongst
themselves how to catch the antelopes

1250
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:23,950
themselves how to catch the antelopes
 

1251
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,820
themselves how to catch the antelopes
didn't some of these and David

1252
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:26,830
didn't some of these and David

Attenborough films I think this probably

1254
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:28,060
Attenborough films I think this probably
 

1255
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,940
Attenborough films I think this probably
was one of them and you can see they're

1256
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:29,950
was one of them and you can see they're
 

1257
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,700
was one of them and you can see they're
hunting dogs and they divide themselves

1258
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:32,710
hunting dogs and they divide themselves
 

1259
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,920
hunting dogs and they divide themselves
into two groups and they go in two

1260
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:34,930
into two groups and they go in two
 

1261
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:37,230
into two groups and they go in two
routes two different routes one of them

1262
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:37,240
routes two different routes one of them
 

1263
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,180
routes two different routes one of them
goes and they sort of hide next to the

1264
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:39,190
goes and they sort of hide next to the
 

1265
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:42,120
goes and they sort of hide next to the
river and the other group goes around

1266
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,130
river and the other group goes around
 

1267
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,930
river and the other group goes around
and they start yelping at these then

1268
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:45,940
and they start yelping at these then
 

1269
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,880
and they start yelping at these then
embark I guess whatever noise hunting

1270
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:47,890
embark I guess whatever noise hunting
 

1271
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:50,370
embark I guess whatever noise hunting
dogs do the antelopes and they sort of

1272
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:50,380
dogs do the antelopes and they sort of
 

1273
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,830
dogs do the antelopes and they sort of
round them up and they chase them in the

1274
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:52,840
round them up and they chase them in the
 

1275
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,230
round them up and they chase them in the
direction of the river and they're the

1276
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:55,240
direction of the river and they're the
 

1277
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,910
direction of the river and they're the
other ones just waiting for them just to

1278
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:56,920
other ones just waiting for them just to
 

1279
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,710
other ones just waiting for them just to
get because this when they get to the

1280
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:58,720
get because this when they get to the
 

1281
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,750
get because this when they get to the
river it slows them down and so they

1282
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:00,760
river it slows them down and so they
 

1283
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,610
river it slows them down and so they
pounce on them so they've obviously

1284
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:02,620
pounce on them so they've obviously
 

1285
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,790
pounce on them so they've obviously
planned this all out somehow I have no

1286
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:05,800
planned this all out somehow I have no
 

1287
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,980
planned this all out somehow I have no
idea how and there is some element of

1288
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:09,990
idea how and there is some element of
 

1289
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:12,360
idea how and there is some element of
conscious planning as far as I can see I

1290
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:12,370
conscious planning as far as I can see I
 

1291
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,230
conscious planning as far as I can see I
don't think it's just some kind of

1292
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,240
don't think it's just some kind of
 

1293
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,690
don't think it's just some kind of
there's so much of AI these days

1294
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:18,700
there's so much of AI these days
 

1295
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,440
there's so much of AI these days
they call bottom-up systems is it yeah

1296
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:21,450
they call bottom-up systems is it yeah
 

1297
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,849
they call bottom-up systems is it yeah
where you have neural networks and they

1298
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:23,859
where you have neural networks and they
 

1299
00:27:23,859 --> 00:27:25,529
where you have neural networks and they
and they you give them a zillion

1300
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:25,539
and they you give them a zillion
 

1301
00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:28,799
and they you give them a zillion
different things to look at and and then

1302
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:28,809
different things to look at and and then
 

1303
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:32,519
different things to look at and and then
they sort of you can choose one thing

1304
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:32,529
they sort of you can choose one thing
 

1305
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:34,560
they sort of you can choose one thing
over another this because it's seen so

1306
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:34,570
over another this because it's seen so
 

1307
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,739
over another this because it's seen so
many examples and picks up on the wrong

1308
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:37,749
many examples and picks up on the wrong
 

1309
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:40,289
many examples and picks up on the wrong
signals which your mom may not even be

1310
00:27:40,289 --> 00:27:40,299
signals which your mom may not even be
 

1311
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:42,269
signals which your mom may not even be
conscious of and that doesn't feel like

1312
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:42,279
conscious of and that doesn't feel like
 

1313
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,070
conscious of and that doesn't feel like
understanding there's no understanding

1314
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:44,080
understanding there's no understanding
 

1315
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,769

and that whatsoever so well you're being

1316
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:46,779
and that whatsoever so well you're being
 

1317
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:50,310
and that whatsoever so well you're being
a little bit human centric so well what

1318
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
a little bit human centric so well what
 

1319
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,979

exactly I'm not with the dogs Emma no

1320
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:52,989
exactly I'm not with the dogs Emma no
 

1321
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:54,869
exactly I'm not with the dogs Emma no
you're not sorry I'm not human centric

1322
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:54,879
you're not sorry I'm not human centric
 

1323
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,529
you're not sorry I'm not human centric
but I misspoke by a la biologie centric

00:27:58,529 --> 00:27:58,539
but I misspoke by a la biologie centric

is it possible that consciousness would

1326
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:00,999
is it possible that consciousness would
 

1327
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,359
is it possible that consciousness would
just look slightly different well I'm

1328
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:03,369
just look slightly different well I'm
 

1329
00:28:03,369 --> 00:28:04,919
just look slightly different well I'm
not saying it's biological because we

1330
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:04,929
not saying it's biological because we
 

1331
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:06,930
not saying it's biological because we
don't know all right I think other

1332
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:06,940
don't know all right I think other
 

1333
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,029
don't know all right I think other
examples of the elephants is a wonderful

1334
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:09,039
examples of the elephants is a wonderful
 

1335
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,149
examples of the elephants is a wonderful
example to where they it's just I think

1336
00:28:12,149 --> 00:28:12,159
example to where they it's just I think
 

1337
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,379
example to where they it's just I think
this was about that's number one

1338
00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:13,389
this was about that's number one
 

1339
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:15,720
this was about that's number one
well they the elephants have to go from

1340
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:15,730
well they the elephants have to go from
 

1341
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,210
well they the elephants have to go from
along with the troop of them have to go

1342
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,220
along with the troop of them have to go
 

1343
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,909
along with the troop of them have to go
long distances and the leader of a troop

1344
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:20,919
long distances and the leader of a troop
 

1345
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:23,909
long distances and the leader of a troop
is a female they are apparently and this

1346
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:23,919
is a female they are apparently and this
 

1347
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,399
is a female they are apparently and this
female that she had to go all the way

1348
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:26,409
female that she had to go all the way
 

1349
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:29,070
female that she had to go all the way
from one part of the country to another

1350
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,080
from one part of the country to another
 

1351
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,950
from one part of the country to another
and at a certain point she made a detour

1352
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:31,960
and at a certain point she made a detour
 

1353
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,129
and at a certain point she made a detour
and they went off in this big detour all

1354
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:35,139
and they went off in this big detour all
 

1355
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,590
and they went off in this big detour all
the troop came with her and this is

1356
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
the troop came with her and this is
 

1357
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,320
the troop came with her and this is
where her sister had died and there were

1358
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:40,330
where her sister had died and there were
 

1359
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,909
where her sister had died and there were
her bones lying around and they go and

1360
00:28:41,909 --> 00:28:41,919
her bones lying around and they go and
 

1361
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,710
her bones lying around and they go and
pick up the bones and they hand it round

1362
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:43,720
pick up the bones and they hand it round
 

1363
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,169
pick up the bones and they hand it round
and they caress the bones and then they

1364
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:46,179
and they caress the bones and then they
 

1365
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:47,549
and they caress the bones and then they
put them back and they will go back

1366
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:47,559
put them back and they will go back
 

1367
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,599
put them back and they will go back
again how am i doing that's so

1368
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:51,609
again how am i doing that's so
 

1369
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,979
again how am i doing that's so
interesting I mean there's something

1370
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:52,989
interesting I mean there's something
 

1371
00:28:52,989 --> 00:28:56,759
interesting I mean there's something
going on there's no clear connection

1372
00:28:56,759 --> 00:28:56,769
going on there's no clear connection
 

1373
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:00,029
going on there's no clear connection
with natural selection there's just some

1374
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:00,039
with natural selection there's just some
 

1375
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,509
with natural selection there's just some
deep feeling going on there we have to

1376
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:03,519
deep feeling going on there we have to
 

1377
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,619
deep feeling going on there we have to
do with their conscious experience and I

1378
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:07,629
do with their conscious experience and I
 

1379
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,509
do with their conscious experience and I
think it's something that your overall

1380
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:09,519
think it's something that your overall
 

1381
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:15,149
think it's something that your overall
is advantageous a natural selection but

1382
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:15,159
is advantageous a natural selection but
 

1383
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:16,649
is advantageous a natural selection but
not directly to do with natural

1384
00:29:16,649 --> 00:29:16,659
not directly to do with natural
 

1385
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,680
not directly to do with natural
selection I like that there's something

1386
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:19,690
selection I like that there's something
 

1387
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,499
selection I like that there's something
going on and go on going on there yeah

1388
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:22,509
going on and go on going on there yeah
 

1389
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:24,840
going on and go on going on there yeah
like I told young Russian so I tend to

1390
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:24,850
like I told young Russian so I tend to
 

1391
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,789
like I told young Russian so I tend to
romanticize all things of this nature

1392
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
romanticize all things of this nature
 

1393
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,040
romanticize all things of this nature
that that it's not merely cold hard

1394
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,050
that that it's not merely cold hard
 

1395
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,810
that that it's not merely cold hard
computation perhaps I could just

1396
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:33,820
computation perhaps I could just
 

1397
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,060
computation perhaps I could just
slightly answer your question you were

1398
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,070
slightly answer your question you were
 

1399
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:38,550
slightly answer your question you were
asking me what is it

1400
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:38,560
asking me what is it
 

1401
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,440
asking me what is it
there's something about sort of standing

1402
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,450
there's something about sort of standing
 

1403
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,170
there's something about sort of standing
back and thinking about your own thought

1404
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:43,180
back and thinking about your own thought
 

1405
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,750
back and thinking about your own thought
processes I mean there is something like

1406
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:45,760
processes I mean there is something like
 

1407
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,090
processes I mean there is something like
that in the girdle thing because it's

1408
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:48,100
that in the girdle thing because it's
 

1409
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,410
that in the girdle thing because it's
just you're not following the rules

1410
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:49,420
just you're not following the rules
 

1411
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:51,900
just you're not following the rules
you're standing back and thinking about

1412
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:51,910
you're standing back and thinking about
 

1413
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:55,080
you're standing back and thinking about
the rules and so there is something that

1414
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,090
the rules and so there is something that
 

1415
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,660
the rules and so there is something that
you might say you think about you're

1416
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:57,670
you might say you think about you're
 

1417
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,860
you might say you think about you're
doing something that you think what the

1418
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:58,870
doing something that you think what the
 

1419
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,960
doing something that you think what the
hell am i doing and you sort of stand

1420
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:00,970
hell am i doing and you sort of stand
 

1421
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,790
hell am i doing and you sort of stand
back and think about what it is that's

1422
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:02,800
back and think about what it is that's
 

1423
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,580
back and think about what it is that's
making you think such a way just take a

1424
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:05,590
making you think such a way just take a
 

1425
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,920
making you think such a way just take a
step back outside this the game you've

1426
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:07,930
step back outside this the game you've
 

1427
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,930
step back outside this the game you've
been playing yeah you back up and you

1428
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:09,940
been playing yeah you back up and you
 

1429
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,730
been playing yeah you back up and you
think about yeah you're just not playing

1430
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:11,740
think about yeah you're just not playing
 

1431
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,110
think about yeah you're just not playing
the game anymore you're thinking about

1432
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
the game anymore you're thinking about
 

1433
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,000
the game anymore you're thinking about
what the hell you're doing in playing

1434
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,010
what the hell you're doing in playing
 

1435
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,330
what the hell you're doing in playing
this game and that's that's somehow it's

1436
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:18,340
this game and that's that's somehow it's
 

1437
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,670
this game and that's that's somehow it's
it's not very precise descriptive but

1438
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:20,680
it's not very precise descriptive but
 

1439
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,560
it's not very precise descriptive but
somehow feels very true that that's

1440
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,570
somehow feels very true that that's
 

1441
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,990
somehow feels very true that that's
somehow understandings yeah this kind of

1442
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:25,000
somehow understandings yeah this kind of
 

1443
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,650
somehow understandings yeah this kind of
reflection a reflection yes yeah there

1444
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:28,660
reflection a reflection yes yeah there
 

1445
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,030
reflection a reflection yes yeah there
is some it's a bit hard to put your

1446
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,040
is some it's a bit hard to put your
 

1447
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,470
is some it's a bit hard to put your
finger on but there is something there

1448
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:31,480
finger on but there is something there
 

1449
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,600
finger on but there is something there
which I think maybe could be unearthed

1450
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:33,610
which I think maybe could be unearthed
 

1451
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,370
which I think maybe could be unearthed
at some point and see this is really

1452
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:35,380
at some point and see this is really
 

1453
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:38,070
at some point and see this is really
what's going on why conscious beings

1454
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,080
what's going on why conscious beings
 

1455
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,670
what's going on why conscious beings
have this advantage what it is that

1456
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:41,680
have this advantage what it is that
 

1457
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,200
have this advantage what it is that
gives them an advantage and I think it

1458
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,210
gives them an advantage and I think it
 

1459
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,660
gives them an advantage and I think it
goes way back I don't think we're

1460
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:45,670
goes way back I don't think we're
 

1461
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:46,890
goes way back I don't think we're
talking about the hunting dogs and the

1462
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:46,900
talking about the hunting dogs and the
 

1463
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,320
talking about the hunting dogs and the
elephants that's pretty clear that

1464
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,330
elephants that's pretty clear that
 

1465
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,100
elephants that's pretty clear that
octopuses have the same sort of quality

1466
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,110
octopuses have the same sort of quality
 

1467
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,570
octopuses have the same sort of quality
and we call it consciousness yeah I

1468
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:54,580
and we call it consciousness yeah I
 

1469
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,170
and we call it consciousness yeah I
think so

1470
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:55,180
think so
 

1471
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:58,050
think so
seen enough examples of the way that

1472
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,060
seen enough examples of the way that
 

1473
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:01,170
seen enough examples of the way that
they behave and the evolution route is

1474
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:01,180
they behave and the evolution route is
 

1475
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:02,750
they behave and the evolution route is
completely different

1476
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:02,760
completely different
 

1477
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,280
completely different
does it go way back to some common

1478
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:05,290
does it go way back to some common
 

1479
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,680
does it go way back to some common
ancestor or did it come separately my

1480
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:07,690
ancestor or did it come separately my
 

1481
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,780
ancestor or did it come separately my
hope is it something simple but the hard

1482
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:09,790
hope is it something simple but the hard
 

1483
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,870
hope is it something simple but the hard
question if there's a hardware

1484
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:11,880
question if there's a hardware
 

1485
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,870
question if there's a hardware
prerequisite you know we have to develop

1486
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:14,880
prerequisite you know we have to develop
 

1487
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
prerequisite you know we have to develop
some kind of hardware mechanisms and our

1488
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,010
some kind of hardware mechanisms and our
 

1489
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,970
some kind of hardware mechanisms and our
computers like basically as you suggest

1490
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:20,980
computers like basically as you suggest
 

1491
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,130
computers like basically as you suggest
I'll get to in a second we kind of have

1492
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:23,140
I'll get to in a second we kind of have
 

1493
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,810
I'll get to in a second we kind of have
to throw away the computer as we know

1494
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:24,820
to throw away the computer as we know
 

1495
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:27,780
to throw away the computer as we know
today yeah the deterministic machines we

1496
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:27,790
today yeah the deterministic machines we
 

1497
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,610
today yeah the deterministic machines we
know today is it tried to create it

1498
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:29,620
know today is it tried to create it
 

1499
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,310
know today is it tried to create it
I mean why my hope of course is not but

1500
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:34,320
I mean why my hope of course is not but
 

1501
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,840
I mean why my hope of course is not but
well I should go really back to the

1502
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:36,850
well I should go really back to the
 

1503
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,080
well I should go really back to the
story which instance I'm finished

1504
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:39,090
story which instance I'm finished
 

1505
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:41,370
story which instance I'm finished
because I went to these three courses

1506
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:41,380
because I went to these three courses
 

1507
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,660
because I went to these three courses
you see when I was a graduate student

1508
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:42,670
you see when I was a graduate student
 

1509
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:45,510
you see when I was a graduate student
and so I started to think

1510
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:45,520
and so I started to think
 

1511
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:48,450
and so I started to think
I'm really I'm a pretty view what you

1512
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:48,460
I'm really I'm a pretty view what you
 

1513
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,630
I'm really I'm a pretty view what you
might call a materialist in the sense of

1514
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:50,640
might call a materialist in the sense of
 

1515
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,920
might call a materialist in the sense of
thinking that there's no kind of

1516
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:52,930
thinking that there's no kind of
 

1517
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:54,690
thinking that there's no kind of
mystical or something around which comes

1518
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:54,700
mystical or something around which comes
 

1519
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,580
mystical or something around which comes
in from who knows where you still that

1520
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:56,590
in from who knows where you still that
 

1521
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,650
in from who knows where you still that
yeah you still throw your life into me I

1522
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:58,660
yeah you still throw your life into me I
 

1523
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,300
yeah you still throw your life into me I
don't like the word materialist because

1524
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,310
don't like the word materialist because
 

1525
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,010
don't like the word materialist because
this is just we know what material is

1526
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,020
this is just we know what material is
 

1527
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,460
this is just we know what material is
and that's that is what is a bad word

1528
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,470
and that's that is what is a bad word
 

1529
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:07,980
and that's that is what is a bad word
because there's no mystical it's not

1530
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:07,990
because there's no mystical it's not
 

1531
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:10,170
because there's no mystical it's not
some mystical something which is not not

1532
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:10,180
some mystical something which is not not
 

1533
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,480
some mystical something which is not not
treatable my science it's so beautifully

1534
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:12,490
treatable my science it's so beautifully
 

1535
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,130
treatable my science it's so beautifully
put just a pause on that for a second

1536
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:14,140
put just a pause on that for a second
 

1537
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,980
put just a pause on that for a second
your materialist but you acknowledge

1538
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:16,990
your materialist but you acknowledge
 

1539
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,000
your materialist but you acknowledge
that we don't really know what the

1540
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,010
that we don't really know what the
 

1541
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,500
that we don't really know what the
materialist that's right I mean I like

1542
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:22,510
materialist that's right I mean I like
 

1543
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,030
materialist that's right I mean I like
to call myself a scientist that's the

1544
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,040
to call myself a scientist that's the
 

1545
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:28,440
to call myself a scientist that's the
first but it means that yes we see the

1546
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,450
first but it means that yes we see the
 

1547
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,960
first but it means that yes we see the
question goes on here so I began

1548
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:30,970
question goes on here so I began
 

1549
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,330
question goes on here so I began
thinking okay if consciousness or

1550
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:33,340
thinking okay if consciousness or
 

1551
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,420
thinking okay if consciousness or
understanding is something which is not

1552
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:36,430
understanding is something which is not
 

1553
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,970
understanding is something which is not
a computational process what can it be

1554
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:38,980
a computational process what can it be
 

1555
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:41,730
a computational process what can it be
and I knew enough from my undergraduate

1556
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:41,740
and I knew enough from my undergraduate
 

1557
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,010
and I knew enough from my undergraduate
work I knew about Newtonian mechanics

1558
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:44,020
work I knew about Newtonian mechanics
 

1559
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,790
work I knew about Newtonian mechanics
and I knew how basically you could put

1560
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:47,800
and I knew how basically you could put
 

1561
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:51,120
and I knew how basically you could put
it on a computer there is a fundamental

1562
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:51,130
it on a computer there is a fundamental
 

1563
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:54,560
it on a computer there is a fundamental
issue which is it important or not that

1564
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:54,570
issue which is it important or not that
 

1565
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:58,730
issue which is it important or not that
computation depends upon discrete things

1566
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:58,740
computation depends upon discrete things
 

1567
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,030
computation depends upon discrete things
so using discrete elements whereas the

1568
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,040
so using discrete elements whereas the
 

1569
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,330
so using discrete elements whereas the
physical laws depend on the continuum

1570
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:05,340
physical laws depend on the continuum
 

1571
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,720
physical laws depend on the continuum
now is this something to do with it is

1572
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:09,730
now is this something to do with it is
 

1573
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,370
now is this something to do with it is
it the fact that we use the continuum in

1574
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:11,380
it the fact that we use the continuum in
 

1575
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,820
it the fact that we use the continuum in
our physics and if we model our physical

1576
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:14,830
our physics and if we model our physical
 

1577
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,590
our physics and if we model our physical
system we use discrete systems like

1578
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:16,600
system we use discrete systems like
 

1579
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,890
system we use discrete systems like
ordinary computers I came to the view

1580
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:19,900
ordinary computers I came to the view
 

1581
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,270
ordinary computers I came to the view
that that's probably not it

1582
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:21,280
that that's probably not it
 

1583
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,090
that that's probably not it
I might have to retract on that someday

1584
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:24,100
I might have to retract on that someday
 

1585
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,570
I might have to retract on that someday
but the view was no you can get close

1586
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:27,580
but the view was no you can get close
 

1587
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,940
but the view was no you can get close
enough it's not altogether clear I have

1588
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:29,950
enough it's not altogether clear I have
 

1589
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:32,690
enough it's not altogether clear I have
to say but you can get close enough and

1590
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,700
to say but you can get close enough and
 

1591
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,610
to say but you can get close enough and
you know when to this course and I'm

1592
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:35,620
you know when to this course and I'm
 

1593
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,200
you know when to this course and I'm
Bondy on general relativity and I

1594
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:37,210
Bondy on general relativity and I
 

1595
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:38,520
Bondy on general relativity and I
thought well you can put that on a

1596
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:38,530
thought well you can put that on a
 

1597
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,380
thought well you can put that on a
computer because that was a long time

1598
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,390
computer because that was a long time
 

1599
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:43,560
computer because that was a long time
before people and I've sort of grown up

1600
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:43,570
before people and I've sort of grown up
 

1601
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,910
before people and I've sort of grown up
with this how people have done better

1602
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:44,920
with this how people have done better
 

1603
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,590
with this how people have done better
and better calculations and they could

1604
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:46,600
and better calculations and they could
 

1605
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,330
and better calculations and they could
work out black about black holes and

1606
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:48,340
work out black about black holes and
 

1607
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,010
work out black about black holes and
they can then work out how black holes

1608
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:50,020
they can then work out how black holes
 

1609
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,530
they can then work out how black holes
can interact with each other spar around

1610
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:52,540
can interact with each other spar around
 

1611
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,240
can interact with each other spar around
and what kind of gravitational waves can

1612
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,250
and what kind of gravitational waves can
 

1613
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,820
and what kind of gravitational waves can
add and there's still a very impressive

1614
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:56,830
add and there's still a very impressive
 

1615
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,010
add and there's still a very impressive
piece of computational work how you can

1616
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,020
piece of computational work how you can
 

1617
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,460
piece of computational work how you can
actually

1618
00:33:59,460 --> 00:33:59,470
actually
 

1619
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:01,980
actually
work out the shapes of those signals and

1620
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:01,990
work out the shapes of those signals and
 

1621
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,899
work out the shapes of those signals and
now we have LIGO seeing these signals

1622
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:03,909
now we have LIGO seeing these signals
 

1623
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,310
now we have LIGO seeing these signals
and they say yeah there's this black

1624
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,320
and they say yeah there's this black
 

1625
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,500
and they say yeah there's this black
hole spiraling through each other this

1626
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,510
hole spiraling through each other this
 

1627
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,080
hole spiraling through each other this
is just a vindication of the power of

1628
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,090
is just a vindication of the power of
 

1629
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:14,490
is just a vindication of the power of
computation in describing einstein's

1630
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:14,500
computation in describing einstein's
 

1631
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,770
computation in describing einstein's
general as if it a so in that case we

1632
00:34:16,770 --> 00:34:16,780
general as if it a so in that case we
 

1633
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,119
general as if it a so in that case we
can get close we would computation we

1634
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:21,129
can get close we would computation we
 

1635
00:34:21,129 --> 00:34:22,830
can get close we would computation we
can get close to our understanding of

1636
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:22,840
can get close to our understanding of
 

1637
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,419
can get close to our understanding of
the physics you can get very very close

1638
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:24,429
the physics you can get very very close
 

1639
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,609
the physics you can get very very close
now is that close enough you see and

1640
00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:26,619
now is that close enough you see and
 

1641
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,730
now is that close enough you see and
then I went to this course by Dirac they

1642
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:29,740
then I went to this course by Dirac they
 

1643
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,320
then I went to this course by Dirac they
see I think it was the very first

1644
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:31,330
see I think it was the very first
 

1645
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,040
see I think it was the very first
lecture that he gave and he was talking

1646
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,050
lecture that he gave and he was talking
 

1647
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,740
lecture that he gave and he was talking
about the superposition principle and he

1648
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:37,750
about the superposition principle and he
 

1649
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,139
about the superposition principle and he
said if you have a particle you usually

1650
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,149
said if you have a particle you usually
 

1651
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:41,909
said if you have a particle you usually
think of particle can be over here or

1652
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:41,919
think of particle can be over here or
 

1653
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,129
think of particle can be over here or
over there but in quantum mechanics it

1654
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:44,139
over there but in quantum mechanics it
 

1655
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:46,619
over there but in quantum mechanics it
can be over here and over there at the

1656
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:46,629
can be over here and over there at the
 

1657
00:34:46,629 --> 00:34:48,960
can be over here and over there at the
same time and you have these states

1658
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:48,970
same time and you have these states
 

1659
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:51,750
same time and you have these states
which involve a superposition in some

1660
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:51,760
which involve a superposition in some
 

1661
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,290
which involve a superposition in some
sense of it different locations for that

1662
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:55,300
sense of it different locations for that
 

1663
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,690
sense of it different locations for that
particle and then he got out his piece

1664
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:57,700
particle and then he got out his piece
 

1665
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,700
particle and then he got out his piece
of chalk some people say broke it into

1666
00:34:59,700 --> 00:34:59,710
of chalk some people say broke it into
 

1667
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,130
of chalk some people say broke it into
as a kind of illustration of how the

1668
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:02,140
as a kind of illustration of how the
 

1669
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,200
as a kind of illustration of how the
piece of chalk might be over here and

1670
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,210
piece of chalk might be over here and
 

1671
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:07,230
piece of chalk might be over here and
over there at the same time and he was

1672
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:07,240
over there at the same time and he was
 

1673
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,990
over there at the same time and he was
talking about this and I my mind

1674
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
talking about this and I my mind
 

1675
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,180
talking about this and I my mind
wandered I don't remember he what he

1676
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,190
wandered I don't remember he what he
 

1677
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,849
wandered I don't remember he what he
said well I can remember he's just moved

1678
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:14,859
said well I can remember he's just moved
 

1679
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:17,130
said well I can remember he's just moved
on to the next topic and something about

1680
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:17,140
on to the next topic and something about
 

1681
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,930
on to the next topic and something about
energy he'd mentioned which I had no

1682
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:18,940
energy he'd mentioned which I had no
 

1683
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,160
energy he'd mentioned which I had no
idea what had to do with anything

1684
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:20,170
idea what had to do with anything
 

1685
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:22,920
idea what had to do with anything
and so I'd been struck with this and

1686
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:22,930
and so I'd been struck with this and
 

1687
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,320
and so I'd been struck with this and
worried about it ever since it's

1688
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:25,330
worried about it ever since it's
 

1689
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,030
worried about it ever since it's
probably just as well I didn't hear his

1690
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:27,040
probably just as well I didn't hear his
 

1691
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,770
probably just as well I didn't hear his
explanation because it was probably one

1692
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:28,780
explanation because it was probably one
 

1693
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,270
explanation because it was probably one
of these things to calm me down and not

1694
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,280
of these things to calm me down and not
 

1695
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,880
of these things to calm me down and not
worry about it anymore it's in my case

1696
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:32,890
worry about it anymore it's in my case
 

1697
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:36,030
worry about it anymore it's in my case
I've worried it about it ever since so I

1698
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,040
I've worried it about it ever since so I
 

1699
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,579
I've worried it about it ever since so I
thought maybe that's the catch there is

1700
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:38,589
thought maybe that's the catch there is
 

1701
00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:41,520
thought maybe that's the catch there is
something in quantum mechanics where are

1702
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:41,530
something in quantum mechanics where are
 

1703
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,740
something in quantum mechanics where are
these super positions become one or the

1704
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:43,750
these super positions become one or the
 

1705
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,829
these super positions become one or the
other and that's not part of quantum

1706
00:35:46,829 --> 00:35:46,839
other and that's not part of quantum
 

1707
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:48,870
other and that's not part of quantum
mechanics there's something missing in

1708
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:48,880
mechanics there's something missing in
 

1709
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,690
mechanics there's something missing in
the theory the theory is incomplete it's

1710
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:51,700
the theory the theory is incomplete it's
 

1711
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,190
the theory the theory is incomplete it's
not just incomplete it's in a sentence

1712
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:53,200
not just incomplete it's in a sentence
 

1713
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,010
not just incomplete it's in a sentence
that's not quite right because if you

1714
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,020
that's not quite right because if you
 

1715
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,410
that's not quite right because if you
follow the equation the basic equation

1716
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:58,420
follow the equation the basic equation
 

1717
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,520
follow the equation the basic equation
of quantum mechanics that's the

1718
00:35:59,520 --> 00:35:59,530
of quantum mechanics that's the
 

1719
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,710
of quantum mechanics that's the
Schrodinger equation you could put that

1720
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:01,720
Schrodinger equation you could put that
 

1721
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,060
Schrodinger equation you could put that
on a computer too there are lots of

1722
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:03,070
on a computer too there are lots of
 

1723
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,740
on a computer too there are lots of
difficulties about how many parameters

1724
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:04,750
difficulties about how many parameters
 

1725
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,690
difficulties about how many parameters
you have to put in so on it can be very

1726
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:06,700
you have to put in so on it can be very
 

1727
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,640
you have to put in so on it can be very
tricky but nevertheless it is a

neighborhood because you see if you have

1886
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,270
neighborhood because you see if you have
 

1887
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,880
neighborhood because you see if you have
people dropping rocks all around the

1888
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:16,890
people dropping rocks all around the
 

1889
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:18,800
people dropping rocks all around the
world somewhere you can't get rid of it

1890
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:18,810
world somewhere you can't get rid of it
 

1891
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,900
world somewhere you can't get rid of it
all at once but in the local

1892
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:20,910
all at once but in the local
 

1893
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,060
all at once but in the local
neighborhood you can eliminate the

1894
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,070
neighborhood you can eliminate the
 

1895
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,190
neighborhood you can eliminate the
gravitational field by falling freely

1896
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,200
gravitational field by falling freely
 

1897
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,710
gravitational field by falling freely
with it and we now see this with

1898
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:27,720
with it and we now see this with
 

1899
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,720
with it and we now see this with
astronauts and they don't you know the

1900
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:29,730
astronauts and they don't you know the
 

1901
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:31,130
astronauts and they don't you know the
earth is right there you can see the

1902
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,140
earth is right there you can see the
 

1903
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,080
earth is right there you can see the
great globe of the earth right beneath

1904
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,090
great globe of the earth right beneath
 

1905
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,000
great globe of the earth right beneath
them but they don't care about it they

1906
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,010
them but they don't care about it they
 

1907
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,770
them but they don't care about it they
as far as they're concerned there's no

1908
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:36,780
as far as they're concerned there's no
 

1909
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:40,970
as far as they're concerned there's no
gravity they fall freely within the

1910
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:40,980
gravity they fall freely within the
 

1911
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,860
gravity they fall freely within the
gravitational field and that gets rid of

1912
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:42,870
gravitational field and that gets rid of
 

1913
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:45,470
gravitational field and that gets rid of
the gravitational field and that's the

1914
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:45,480
the gravitational field and that's the
 

1915
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,390
the gravitational field and that's the
principle of equivalence so what's the

1916
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,400
principle of equivalence so what's the
 

1917
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,430
principle of equivalence so what's the
was the contradiction what's the tension

1918
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
was the contradiction what's the tension
 

1919
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,450
was the contradiction what's the tension
with superposition uh well what so we

1920
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:53,460
with superposition uh well what so we
 

1921
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,340
with superposition uh well what so we
just a backtrack for a second just to

1922
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:55,350
just a backtrack for a second just to
 

1923
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,230
just a backtrack for a second just to
see if we can weave a thread through it

1924
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:57,240
see if we can weave a thread through it
 

1925
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,470
see if we can weave a thread through it
all yes so you wish she started to think

1926
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:00,480
all yes so you wish she started to think
 

1927
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,140
all yes so you wish she started to think
about consciousness as potentially

1928
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,150
about consciousness as potentially
 

1929
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:07,490
about consciousness as potentially
needing some of the same not mystical

1930
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:07,500
needing some of the same not mystical
 

1931
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,200
needing some of the same not mystical
but some of the same imagine see this is

1932
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,210
but some of the same imagine see this is
 

1933
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:11,600
but some of the same imagine see this is
a complicated story so you know people

1934
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:11,610
a complicated story so you know people
 

1935
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,860
a complicated story so you know people
think oh I'm drifting away from the

1936
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:12,870
think oh I'm drifting away from the
 

1937
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,870
think oh I'm drifting away from the
point of something but I think it is a

1938
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
point of something but I think it is a
 

1939
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,420
point of something but I think it is a
complicated story so what I'm trying to

1940
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:17,430
complicated story so what I'm trying to
 

1941
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:19,130
complicated story so what I'm trying to
say I mean I try to put it in a nutshell

1942
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:19,140
say I mean I try to put it in a nutshell
 

1943
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,640
say I mean I try to put it in a nutshell
it's not so easy I'm trying to say that

1944
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:22,650
it's not so easy I'm trying to say that
 

1945
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:25,400
it's not so easy I'm trying to say that
whatever consciousness is it's not a

1946
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:25,410
whatever consciousness is it's not a
 

1947
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:28,220
whatever consciousness is it's not a
computation yes it's not a physical

1948
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:28,230
computation yes it's not a physical
 

1949
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,540
computation yes it's not a physical
process which can be described by

1950
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:31,550
process which can be described by
 

1951
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,460
process which can be described by
computation but it nevertheless could be

1952
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:34,470
computation but it nevertheless could be
 

1953
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:38,190
computation but it nevertheless could be
so one of the interesting models the

1954
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:38,200
so one of the interesting models the
 

1955
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:40,680
so one of the interesting models the
you've proposed as the orchestrated

1956
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:40,690
you've proposed as the orchestrated
 

1957
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,410
you've proposed as the orchestrated
objective reduction yeah that's going

1958
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:43,420
objective reduction yeah that's going
 

1959
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,540
objective reduction yeah that's going
from there you say so I say I have no

1960
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:45,550
from there you say so I say I have no
 

1961
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,829
from there you say so I say I have no
idea so I wrote this book through my

1962
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:48,839
idea so I wrote this book through my
 

1963
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,000
idea so I wrote this book through my
scientific career I thought you know

1964
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,010
scientific career I thought you know
 

1965
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,609
scientific career I thought you know
when I'm retired I have enough time to

1966
00:40:53,609 --> 00:40:53,619
when I'm retired I have enough time to
 

1967
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:57,270
when I'm retired I have enough time to
write a sort of a popular book which I

1968
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
write a sort of a popular book which I
 

1969
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,319
write a sort of a popular book which I
will explain my ideas and puzzles but I

1970
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:01,329
will explain my ideas and puzzles but I
 

1971
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,329
will explain my ideas and puzzles but I
like beautiful things about physics and

1972
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:03,339
like beautiful things about physics and
 

1973
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:06,020
like beautiful things about physics and
mathematics and this puzzle about

1974
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,030
mathematics and this puzzle about
 

1975
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,460
mathematics and this puzzle about
computability and consciousness and so

1976
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:08,470
computability and consciousness and so
 

1977
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:08,790
computability and consciousness and so
on

1978
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:08,800
on
 

1979
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,230
on
and in the process of writing this book

1980
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:12,240
and in the process of writing this book
 

1981
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,010
and in the process of writing this book
well I thought I'd do it when I was

1982
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:14,020
well I thought I'd do it when I was
 

1983
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,599
well I thought I'd do it when I was
retired I didn't actually I would didn't

1984
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:15,609
retired I didn't actually I would didn't
 

1985
00:41:15,609 --> 00:41:18,690
retired I didn't actually I would didn't
wait that long because there was a radio

1986
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:18,700
wait that long because there was a radio
 

1987
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,200
wait that long because there was a radio
discussion between edward fredkin and

1988
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:22,210
discussion between edward fredkin and
 

1989
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:23,250

1990
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:23,260
marvin minsky
 

1991
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:26,520
marvin minsky
and they were talking about what

1992
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:26,530
and they were talking about what
 

1993
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,710
and they were talking about what
computers could do and they were

1994
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:28,720
computers could do and they were
 

1995
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,599
computers could do and they were
entering and entering a big room they

1996
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:30,609
entering and entering a big room they
 

1997
00:41:30,609 --> 00:41:32,250
entering and entering a big room they
imagined entering this big room with the

1998
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,260
imagined entering this big room with the
 

1999
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,040
imagined entering this big room with the
other end of the room two computers were

2000
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,050
other end of the room two computers were
 

2001
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,890
other end of the room two computers were
talking to each other and as you walk up

2002
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:37,900
talking to each other and as you walk up
 

2003
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,750
talking to each other and as you walk up
to the computers they will have

2004
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:39,760
to the computers they will have
 

2005
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,620
to the computers they will have
communicated to each other more ideas

2006
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:43,630
communicated to each other more ideas
 

2007
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,230
communicated to each other more ideas
concepts things than the entire human

2008
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
concepts things than the entire human
 

2009
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,230
concepts things than the entire human
race had ever commute

2010
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,240
race had ever commute
 

2011
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,950
race had ever commute
so I thought well know where you're

2012
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:49,960
so I thought well know where you're
 

2013
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,920
so I thought well know where you're
coming from but I just don't believe you

2014
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:52,930
coming from but I just don't believe you
 

2015
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,980
coming from but I just don't believe you
there's something missing that's it's

2016
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:55,990
there's something missing that's it's
 

2017
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,079
there's something missing that's it's
not that so I thought well I should

2018
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:58,089
not that so I thought well I should
 

2019
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:01,859
not that so I thought well I should
write my book and so I did it was

2020
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:01,869
write my book and so I did it was
 

2021
00:42:01,869 --> 00:42:03,990
write my book and so I did it was
roughly the same time Stephen Hawking

2022
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
roughly the same time Stephen Hawking
 

2023
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,050
roughly the same time Stephen Hawking
this writing his brief history of time

2024
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:07,060
this writing his brief history of time
 

2025
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,609
this writing his brief history of time
and Hades at some point the book you're

2026
00:42:11,609 --> 00:42:11,619
and Hades at some point the book you're
 

2027
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:13,079
and Hades at some point the book you're
talking about the emperor's new mind

2028
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:13,089
talking about the emperor's new mind
 

2029
00:42:13,089 --> 00:42:15,420
talking about the emperor's new mind
that's right and both are and incredible

2030
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,430
that's right and both are and incredible
 

2031
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:17,339
that's right and both are and incredible
books the brief history of time and I'm

2032
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:17,349
books the brief history of time and I'm
 

2033
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:19,290
books the brief history of time and I'm
person you mind yes it was quite

2034
00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:19,300
person you mind yes it was quite
 

2035
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,599
person you mind yes it was quite
interesting because he got he told me

2036
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:21,609
interesting because he got he told me
 

2037
00:42:21,609 --> 00:42:23,579
interesting because he got he told me
he'd got some Carl Sagan I think to

2038
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:23,589
he'd got some Carl Sagan I think to
 

2039
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,750
he'd got some Carl Sagan I think to
write that forward good gosh what am I

2040
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
write that forward good gosh what am I
 

2041
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,670
write that forward good gosh what am I
gonna do I'm not gonna get anywhere

2042
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:29,680
gonna do I'm not gonna get anywhere
 

2043
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,800
gonna do I'm not gonna get anywhere
unless I get somebody so I know I know

2044
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:31,810
unless I get somebody so I know I know
 

2045
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:33,780
unless I get somebody so I know I know
Martin Gardner so I wonder if he'd do it

2046
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:33,790
Martin Gardner so I wonder if he'd do it
 

2047
00:42:33,790 --> 00:42:36,000
Martin Gardner so I wonder if he'd do it
so he did and it is a very nice forward

2048
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,010
so he did and it is a very nice forward
 

2049
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,339
so he did and it is a very nice forward
so that so that's an incredible book and

2050
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:38,349
so that so that's an incredible book and
 

2051
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:39,960
so that so that's an incredible book and
some of the the same people you

2052
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:39,970
some of the the same people you
 

2053
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:43,020
some of the the same people you
mentioned Ed Franken which I guess of

2054
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,030
mentioned Ed Franken which I guess of
 

2055
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:45,480
mentioned Ed Franken which I guess of
expert systems Fame and Minsky of course

2056
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:45,490
expert systems Fame and Minsky of course
 

2057
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:47,220
expert systems Fame and Minsky of course
people know in the eye world but they

2058
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,230
people know in the eye world but they
 

2059
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:48,920
people know in the eye world but they
represent the artificial intelligence

2060
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:48,930
represent the artificial intelligence
 

2061
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,130
represent the artificial intelligence
that do hope and dream that

2062
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:52,140
that do hope and dream that
 

2063
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:55,140
that do hope and dream that
intelligences am i thinking well you

2064
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,150
intelligences am i thinking well you
 

2065
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,060
intelligences am i thinking well you
know I see where they're coming from and

2066
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:57,070
know I see where they're coming from and
 

2067
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,589
know I see where they're coming from and
they're like from exercise rectus oh

2068
00:42:58,589 --> 00:42:58,599
they're like from exercise rectus oh
 

2069
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,640
they're like from exercise rectus oh
yeah you're right

2070
00:42:59,640 --> 00:42:59,650
yeah you're right
 

2071
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,829
yeah you're right
but that's not my perspective so I

2072
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:01,839
but that's not my perspective so I
 

2073
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,930
but that's not my perspective so I
thought I had to say it and as I was

2074
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:03,940
thought I had to say it and as I was
 

2075
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:05,790
thought I had to say it and as I was
writing my book you see I thought well I

2076
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:05,800
writing my book you see I thought well I
 

2077
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,780
writing my book you see I thought well I
don't really know anything about

2078
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:06,790
don't really know anything about
 

2079
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,579
don't really know anything about
neurophysiology what am i doing writing

2080
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:08,589
neurophysiology what am i doing writing
 

2081
00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:10,260
neurophysiology what am i doing writing
this book so I certainly reading up

2082
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:10,270
this book so I certainly reading up
 

2083
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:12,780
this book so I certainly reading up
about neurophysiology and I rate I'm

2084
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:12,790
about neurophysiology and I rate I'm
 

2085
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,160
about neurophysiology and I rate I'm
nothing I'm trying to find out well how

2086
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,170
nothing I'm trying to find out well how
 

2087
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:15,930
nothing I'm trying to find out well how
it is the nerve signals could possibly

2088
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:15,940
it is the nerve signals could possibly
 

2089
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,630
it is the nerve signals could possibly
preserve quantum coherence and all I

2090
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:18,640
preserve quantum coherence and all I
 

2091
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,460
preserve quantum coherence and all I
read is that the second electrical

2092
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:20,470
read is that the second electrical
 

2093
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:22,710
read is that the second electrical
signals which go along the nerves create

2094
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:22,720
signals which go along the nerves create
 

2095
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,710
signals which go along the nerves create
some effects through the brain there's

2096
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:25,720
some effects through the brain there's
 

2097
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,800
some effects through the brain there's
no chance you can isolate it so this is

2098
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:28,810
no chance you can isolate it so this is
 

2099
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,720
no chance you can isolate it so this is
hopeless so I come to the end of the

2100
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:30,730
hopeless so I come to the end of the
 

2101
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:31,109
hopeless so I come to the end of the
book

2102
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
book
 

2103
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,690
book
and I'm more or less give up and just

2104
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:33,700
and I'm more or less give up and just
 

2105
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:34,920
and I'm more or less give up and just
think of something which I didn't

2106
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:34,930
think of something which I didn't
 

2107
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:37,200
think of something which I didn't
believe in this maybe this is the way

2108
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:37,210
believe in this maybe this is the way
 

2109
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:40,109
believe in this maybe this is the way
around it but no and then you say I

2110
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:40,119
around it but no and then you say I
 

2111
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:41,790
around it but no and then you say I
thought well maybe this book well at

2112
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:41,800
thought well maybe this book well at
 

2113
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,220
thought well maybe this book well at
least stimulate young people to do

2114
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:44,230
least stimulate young people to do
 

2115
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,839
least stimulate young people to do
science or something and I got all these

2116
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:45,849
science or something and I got all these
 

2117
00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:47,790
science or something and I got all these
letters from old people instead

2118
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:47,800
letters from old people instead
 

2119
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:50,220
letters from old people instead
he's the only people who could had time

2120
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,230
he's the only people who could had time
 

2121
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,460
he's the only people who could had time
to read my book so I mean except for

2122
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:53,470
to read my book so I mean except for
 

2123
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:55,980
to read my book so I mean except for
Stuart Hameroff except for Stuart

2124
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:55,990
Stuart Hameroff except for Stuart
 

2125
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,480
Stuart Hameroff except for Stuart
Hameroff you don't have a rough road to

2126
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:57,490
Hameroff you don't have a rough road to
 

2127
00:43:57,490 --> 00:43:59,160
Hameroff you don't have a rough road to
me and he said I think you're missing

2128
00:43:59,160 --> 00:43:59,170
me and he said I think you're missing
 

2129
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:02,069
me and he said I think you're missing
something you don't know about

2130
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
something you don't know about
 

2131
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,930
something you don't know about
microtubules do you didn't put it quite

2132
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:03,940
microtubules do you didn't put it quite
 

2133
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,760
microtubules do you didn't put it quite
like that but that was more or less it

2134
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:05,770
like that but that was more or less it
 

2135
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:07,470
like that but that was more or less it
and he said this is what you really need

2136
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:07,480
and he said this is what you really need
 

2137
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,349
and he said this is what you really need
to consider so I thought oh my god yes

2138
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:10,359
to consider so I thought oh my god yes
 

2139
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:12,660
to consider so I thought oh my god yes
that's a much more promising structure

2140
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:12,670
that's a much more promising structure
 

2141
00:44:12,670 --> 00:44:15,540
that's a much more promising structure
so I mean fundamentally you were

2142
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:15,550
so I mean fundamentally you were
 

2143
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,160
so I mean fundamentally you were
searching for the source of a non

2144
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:20,170
searching for the source of a non
 

2145
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:21,630
searching for the source of a non
computable source of consciousness

2146
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:21,640
computable source of consciousness
 

2147
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,000
computable source of consciousness
within the human brain yeah in the

2148
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,010
within the human brain yeah in the
 

2149
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,200
within the human brain yeah in the
biology and so what are mark if I may

2150
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,210
biology and so what are mark if I may
 

2151
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,349
biology and so what are mark if I may
ask what are microtubules well you see I

2152
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:31,359
ask what are microtubules well you see I
 

2153
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,230
ask what are microtubules well you see I
I was ignorant in what address I never

2154
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:34,240
I was ignorant in what address I never
 

2155
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:36,329
I was ignorant in what address I never
came across them and in in in the books

2156
00:44:36,329 --> 00:44:36,339
came across them and in in in the books
 

2157
00:44:36,339 --> 00:44:38,670
came across them and in in in the books
I looked at that's I only read rather

2158
00:44:38,670 --> 00:44:38,680
I looked at that's I only read rather
 

2159
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,400
I looked at that's I only read rather
superficially which is true but I didn't

2160
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:41,410
superficially which is true but I didn't
 

2161
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:44,849
superficially which is true but I didn't
know about microtubules Stuart I think

2162
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:44,859
know about microtubules Stuart I think
 

2163
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,290
know about microtubules Stuart I think
one of the things here was impressed him

2164
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:46,300
one of the things here was impressed him
 

2165
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:48,000
one of the things here was impressed him
about them is when you see pictures of

2166
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:48,010
about them is when you see pictures of
 

2167
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,599
about them is when you see pictures of
mitosis that's a cell dividing and you

2168
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:51,609
mitosis that's a cell dividing and you
 

2169
00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:53,609
mitosis that's a cell dividing and you
see all the chromosomes and the

2170
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:53,619
see all the chromosomes and the
 

2171
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:55,530
see all the chromosomes and the
chromosomes get their gate or gate line

2172
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:55,540
chromosomes get their gate or gate line
 

2173
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,319
chromosomes get their gate or gate line
and then they get pulled apart and so

2174
00:44:58,319 --> 00:44:58,329
and then they get pulled apart and so
 

2175
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,720
and then they get pulled apart and so
that as the cell divides the half the

2176
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:00,730
that as the cell divides the half the
 

2177
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:02,609
that as the cell divides the half the
chromosomes go you know how their web is

2178
00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:02,619
chromosomes go you know how their web is
 

2179
00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:04,910
chromosomes go you know how their web is
divided into the two pass

2180
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:04,920
divided into the two pass
 

2181
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,760
divided into the two pass
and they go to different ways and what

2182
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:07,770
and they go to different ways and what
 

2183
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,040
and they go to different ways and what
is it that's pulling them apart well

2184
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,050
is it that's pulling them apart well
 

2185
00:45:10,050 --> 00:45:11,240
is it that's pulling them apart well
those are these little things called

2186
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:11,250
those are these little things called
 

2187
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,090
those are these little things called
microtubules and so he starts to get

2188
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:14,100
microtubules and so he starts to get
 

2189
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,520
microtubules and so he starts to get
interested in them and he formed the

2190
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:16,530
interested in them and he formed the
 

2191
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:20,030
interested in them and he formed the
view well he was his day job or night

2192
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:20,040
view well he was his day job or night
 

2193
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,470
view well he was his day job or night
job of where every call it is to put

general anesthetics in a reversible way
so you want to make sure that they don't

2202
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:31,770
so you want to make sure that they don't
 

2203
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,800
so you want to make sure that they don't
experience the pain that would otherwise

and it can be turned back on again so
 

2211
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,460
and it can be turned back on again so
it's crucial that you can turn it off

it's crucial that you can turn it off
 

2213
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:46,910
it's crucial that you can turn it off
and turn it on and what do you do when

2214
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:46,920
and turn it on and what do you do when
 

2215
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,200
and turn it on and what do you do when
you're doing that what do general

00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,690

the time because they were there very
 

2257
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,600

very symmetrical structures and I had
 

2259
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:46,220
very symmetrical structures and I had
reason to believe that these very

reason to believe that these very
 

2261
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,590
reason to believe that these very

better at preserving a quantum state

2264

00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:59,630
without you just need to cut preserve

leak into the environment your loss so
 

2275
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:05,570
leak into the environment your loss so
you ought to preserve these quantum

00:47:19,890 --> 00:47:22,849
process in quantum mechanics what's
going on so something about the the

00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:22,859
going on so something about the the
 

2289
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:24,259
going on so something about the the

00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:25,769
something about the structure on the
 

2293
00:47:25,769 --> 00:47:28,099
something about the structure on the
microtubules yes your intuition says

2294
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:28,109
microtubules yes your intuition says
 

2295
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,380
microtubules yes your intuition says
maybe there's something here maybe this

2296
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:30,390
maybe there's something here maybe this
 

2297
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:34,219
maybe there's something here maybe this
kind of structure allows for the the

00:47:34,219 --> 00:47:34,229
kind of structure allows for the the
 

2299
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:36,650
kind of structure allows for the the
mystery the there was a moment of chance

2300
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:36,660
mystery the there was a moment of chance
 

2301
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,349
mystery the there was a moment of chance
yes it just struck me that partly it was

2302
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
yes it just struck me that partly it was
 

2303
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,870
yes it just struck me that partly it was
the symmetry because there is a feature

the symmetry because there is a feature
 

2305
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,829
the symmetry because there is a feature
of symmetry you can predict preserve

00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:44,839
of symmetry you can predict preserve
 

2307
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,969
of symmetry you can predict preserve
quantum coherence much better with

00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:46,979
quantum coherence much better with
 

2309
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:48,859
quantum coherence much better with
symmetrical structures there's a good

2310
00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:48,869
symmetrical structures there's a good
 

2311
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:51,559
symmetrical structures there's a good
reason for that and that impressed me a

2312
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:51,569
reason for that and that impressed me a
 

2313
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,779
reason for that and that impressed me a
lot I didn't know the difference between

2314
00:47:53,779 --> 00:47:53,789
lot I didn't know the difference between
 

2315
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:55,880
lot I didn't know the difference between
the a lattice and B lattice at that time

00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,109
sometimes people say it's because it's
quantum mechanical it's not just that

2352
00:48:42,109 --> 00:48:42,119
quantum mechanical it's not just that
 

2353
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:44,539
quantum mechanical it's not just that
see it's it's it more outrageous than

2354
00:48:44,539 --> 00:48:44,549
see it's it's it more outrageous than
 

2355
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:46,130
see it's it's it more outrageous than
that you see this is one reason I think

2356
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:46,140
that you see this is one reason I think
 

2357
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,709
that you see this is one reason I think
we're so far off from it because we

2358
00:48:48,709 --> 00:48:48,719
we're so far off from it because we
 

2359
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,079
we're so far off from it because we
don't even know the physics right you

2360
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:51,089
don't even know the physics right you
 

2361
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:53,079
don't even know the physics right you
see it's not just quantum mechanics

2362
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:53,089
see it's not just quantum mechanics
 

2363
00:48:53,089 --> 00:48:55,759
see it's not just quantum mechanics
people say oh you know quantum systems

2364
00:48:55,759 --> 00:48:55,769
people say oh you know quantum systems
 

2365
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,829
people say oh you know quantum systems
and biological structures no well he's

2366
00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
and biological structures no well he's
 

2367
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:00,709
and biological structures no well he's
starting to see that some basic

2368
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:00,719
starting to see that some basic
 

2369
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,890
starting to see that some basic
biological systems does depend on

2370
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:03,900
biological systems does depend on
 

2371
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,400
biological systems does depend on
quantum I mean look you the first place

2372
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:07,410
quantum I mean look you the first place
 

2373
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:09,109
quantum I mean look you the first place
all of chemistry is quantum mechanics

2374
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
all of chemistry is quantum mechanics
 

2375
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,150
all of chemistry is quantum mechanics
people got used to that so they don't

2376
00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:11,160
people got used to that so they don't
 

2377
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,969
people got used to that so they don't
count that so you said let's not count

2378
00:49:13,969 --> 00:49:13,979
count that so you said let's not count
 

2379
00:49:13,979 --> 00:49:17,209
count that so you said let's not count
come on chemistry we sort of got the

2380
00:49:17,209 --> 00:49:17,219
come on chemistry we sort of got the
 

2381
00:49:17,219 --> 00:49:19,789
come on chemistry we sort of got the
hang of that I think but you have

2382
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:19,799
hang of that I think but you have
 

2383
00:49:19,799 --> 00:49:21,739
hang of that I think but you have
quantum effects which are not just

2384
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:21,749
quantum effects which are not just
 

2385
00:49:21,749 --> 00:49:25,789
quantum effects which are not just
chemical in photosynthesis and this is

2386
00:49:25,789 --> 00:49:25,799
chemical in photosynthesis and this is
 

2387
00:49:25,799 --> 00:49:27,529
chemical in photosynthesis and this is
one of the striking things in the last

2388
00:49:27,529 --> 00:49:27,539
one of the striking things in the last
 

2389
00:49:27,539 --> 00:49:30,739
one of the striking things in the last
several years that photosynthesis seems

2390
00:49:30,739 --> 00:49:30,749
several years that photosynthesis seems
 

2391
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:34,339
several years that photosynthesis seems
to be a basically quantum process which

2392
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:34,349
to be a basically quantum process which
 

2393
00:49:34,349 --> 00:49:38,449
to be a basically quantum process which
is not simply create chemical it's using

2394
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:38,459
is not simply create chemical it's using
 

2395
00:49:38,459 --> 00:49:41,599
is not simply create chemical it's using
quantum mechanics in a very basic way so

2396
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:41,609
quantum mechanics in a very basic way so
 

2397
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:43,189
quantum mechanics in a very basic way so
you can start saying oh well with

2398
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:43,199
you can start saying oh well with
 

2399
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,229
you can start saying oh well with
photosynthesis is based on quantum

2400
00:49:45,229 --> 00:49:45,239
photosynthesis is based on quantum
 

2401
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:48,650
photosynthesis is based on quantum
mechanics why not behave you have

2402
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:48,660
mechanics why not behave you have
 

2403
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:49,789
mechanics why not behave you have
neurons and things like that

2404
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:49,799
neurons and things like that
 

2405
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:52,609
neurons and things like that
maybe there's something which is a bit

2406
00:49:52,609 --> 00:49:52,619
maybe there's something which is a bit
 

2407
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:55,099
maybe there's something which is a bit
like photosynthesis in that respect but

2408
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:55,109
like photosynthesis in that respect but
 

2409
00:49:55,109 --> 00:49:56,719
like photosynthesis in that respect but
what I'm saying is even more outrageous

2410
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:56,729
what I'm saying is even more outrageous
 

2411
00:49:56,729 --> 00:49:59,650
what I'm saying is even more outrageous
than that because those things are

2412
00:49:59,650 --> 00:49:59,660
than that because those things are
 

2413
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:02,059
than that because those things are
talking about conventional quantum

2414
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:02,069
talking about conventional quantum
 

2415
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:05,799
talking about conventional quantum
mechanics now my argument says that

2416
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:05,809
mechanics now my argument says that
 

2417
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:07,729
mechanics now my argument says that
conventional quantum mechanics if you're

2418
00:50:07,729 --> 00:50:07,739
conventional quantum mechanics if you're
 

2419
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:08,839
conventional quantum mechanics if you're
just following the Schrodinger equation

2420
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:08,849
just following the Schrodinger equation
 

2421
00:50:08,849 --> 00:50:11,900
just following the Schrodinger equation
that's still competing well so you've

2422
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:11,910
that's still competing well so you've
 

2423
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,390
that's still competing well so you've
got to go beyond that so you've got to

2424
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
got to go beyond that so you've got to
 

2425
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:19,549
got to go beyond that so you've got to
go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong

2426
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:19,559
go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong
 

2427
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,459
go to where quantum mechanics goes wrong
in a certain sense you have to a little

2428
00:50:22,459 --> 00:50:22,469
in a certain sense you have to a little
 

2429
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:24,380
in a certain sense you have to a little
bit careful about that because the way

2430
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:24,390
bit careful about that because the way
 

2431
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:29,019
bit careful about that because the way
people do quantum mechanics is a sort of

2432
00:50:29,019 --> 00:50:29,029

 

2433
00:50:29,029 --> 00:50:32,959

mixture of two different processes one
 

2435
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:33,979
mixture of two different processes one
of them is the Schrodinger equation

2436
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:33,989
of them is the Schrodinger equation

would lead to a state which is the cat

this out loud too much because he was
 

2511
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:11,420
this out loud too much because he was
very cautious about what he said you

00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:11,430
very cautious about what he said you
 

2513

bit you know bit Mavericks who believe

00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:37,370
bit you know bit Mavericks who believe
that quantum mechanics needs to be

that quantum mechanics needs to be
 

2533
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,460
that quantum mechanics needs to be
modified there's a small minority of

2534
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:40,470
modified there's a small minority of
 

2535
00:52:40,470 --> 00:52:41,750
modified there's a small minority of
those people which were really a

those people which were really a

00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,410
those people which were really a

minority who think that the way in which
 

2539
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,039
minority who think that the way in which
it's modified has to be with gravity and

2540
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:48,049
it's modified has to be with gravity and
 

2541
00:52:48,049 --> 00:52:50,750
it's modified has to be with gravity and
there is an even smaller minority of

those people who think it's a particular
 

2545
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,280
those people who think it's a particular
way that I think it is you see so so

2546
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:55,290
way that I think it is you see so so
 

2547
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,990
way that I think it is you see so so
those are the quantum gravity folks for

2548
00:52:56,990 --> 00:52:57,000
those are the quantum gravity folks for
 

2549
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,700
those are the quantum gravity folks for
what's well you see quantum gravity is

2550
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:58,710
what's well you see quantum gravity is
 

2551
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,339
what's well you see quantum gravity is
already not this because when you say

2552
00:53:01,339 --> 00:53:01,349
already not this because when you say
 

2553
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:03,799
already not this because when you say
quantum gravity what you really mean is

2554
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:03,809
quantum gravity what you really mean is
 

2555
00:53:03,809 --> 00:53:06,410
quantum gravity what you really mean is
quantum mechanics and Clyde -

2556
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:06,420
quantum mechanics and Clyde -
 

2557
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:08,599
quantum mechanics and Clyde -
gravitational Theory so you say let's

2558
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:08,609
gravitational Theory so you say let's
 

2559
00:53:08,609 --> 00:53:10,730
gravitational Theory so you say let's
take this wonderful formalism of quantum

2560
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:10,740
take this wonderful formalism of quantum
 

2561
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,780
take this wonderful formalism of quantum
mechanics and make gravity fit into it

2562
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:14,790
mechanics and make gravity fit into it
 

2563
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:17,030
mechanics and make gravity fit into it
so that is what quantum gravity is meant

2564
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:17,040
so that is what quantum gravity is meant
 

2565
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,880
so that is what quantum gravity is meant
to be now I'm saying you've got to be

2566
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:19,890
to be now I'm saying you've got to be
 

2567
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:22,430
to be now I'm saying you've got to be
more even-handed that gravity affects

2568
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:22,440
more even-handed that gravity affects
 

2569
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,319
more even-handed that gravity affects
the structure of quantum mechanics -

2570
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:24,329
the structure of quantum mechanics -
 

2571
00:53:24,329 --> 00:53:26,270
the structure of quantum mechanics -
it's not just you quantize gravity

2572
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:26,280
it's not just you quantize gravity
 

2573
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,250
it's not just you quantize gravity
you've got to gravity as quantum

2574
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:28,260
you've got to gravity as quantum
 

2575
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:30,859
you've got to gravity as quantum
mechanics and it's it's a two-way thing

2576
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:30,869
mechanics and it's it's a two-way thing
 

2577
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:33,140
mechanics and it's it's a two-way thing
but then when you even get started so

2578
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:33,150
but then when you even get started so
 

2579
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,000
but then when you even get started so
that you're saying and we have to figure

2580
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:35,010
that you're saying and we have to figure
 

2581
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:38,329
that you're saying and we have to figure
out totally new ideas indirectly no yes

2582
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:38,339
out totally new ideas indirectly no yes
 

2583
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:40,190
out totally new ideas indirectly no yes
it's you were stuck I don't have a

2584
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:40,200
it's you were stuck I don't have a
 

2585
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,730
it's you were stuck I don't have a
theory that's the trouble so this is a

2586
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:43,740
theory that's the trouble so this is a
 

2587
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:45,559
theory that's the trouble so this is a
big problem if you say okay well what so

2588
00:53:45,559 --> 00:53:45,569
big problem if you say okay well what so
 

2589
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:47,960
big problem if you say okay well what so
there I don't know so we may be in the

2590
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:47,970
there I don't know so we may be in the
 

2591
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,940
there I don't know so we may be in the
very early days sort of it is in the

2592
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:49,950
very early days sort of it is in the
 

2593
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:51,680
very early days sort of it is in the
very early days and there but just

2594
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:51,690
very early days and there but just
 

2595
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:54,349
very early days and there but just
making this point yes you see Stuart

2596
00:53:54,349 --> 00:53:54,359
making this point yes you see Stuart
 

2597
00:53:54,359 --> 00:53:54,840
making this point yes you see Stuart
Hameroff

2598
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:54,850
Hameroff

to be open Rose says that it's got to be

2600
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,030
to be open Rose says that it's got to be
 

2601
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,700
to be open Rose says that it's got to be
a reduction of the state and so so let's

2602
00:53:59,700 --> 00:53:59,710
a reduction of the state and so so let's
 

2603
00:53:59,710 --> 00:54:00,180
a reduction of the state and so so let's
use it

2604
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:00,190
use it
 

2605
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,040
use it
the trouble is Penrose doesn't say that

2606
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,050
the trouble is Penrose doesn't say that
 

2607
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:05,580
the trouble is Penrose doesn't say that
Penrose says well I think that no no we

2608
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:05,590
Penrose says well I think that no no we
 

2609
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,700
Penrose says well I think that no no we
have no experiments as yet which shows

2610
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:08,710
have no experiments as yet which shows
 

2611
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,610
have no experiments as yet which shows
that yes there are experiments which are

2612
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:11,620
that yes there are experiments which are
 

2613
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,380
that yes there are experiments which are
being thought through and which I'm

2614
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:13,390
being thought through and which I'm
 

2615
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:16,310
being thought through and which I'm
hoping will be performed there is an

2616
00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:16,320
hoping will be performed there is an
 

2617
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,390
hoping will be performed there is an
experiment which is being developed by

2618
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
experiment which is being developed by
 

2619
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,820
experiment which is being developed by
dirt Romney Stowe who is I've known for

2620
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:20,830
dirt Romney Stowe who is I've known for
 

2621
00:54:20,830 --> 00:54:23,670
dirt Romney Stowe who is I've known for
a long time who shares his time between

Barbara in the US and he's been working

2626
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:28,690
Barbara in the US and he's been working
 

2627
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:31,100
Barbara in the US and he's been working
on an experiment which could perhaps

2628
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:31,110
on an experiment which could perhaps
 

2629
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:35,490
on an experiment which could perhaps
demonstrate that quantum mechanics as we

2630
00:54:35,490 --> 00:54:35,500
demonstrate that quantum mechanics as we
 

2631
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,380
demonstrate that quantum mechanics as we
now understand it if you don't bring in

2632
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:37,390
now understand it if you don't bring in
 

2633
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:40,920
now understand it if you don't bring in
the gravitational effects it has to be

2634
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:40,930
the gravitational effects it has to be
 

2635
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:43,680
the gravitational effects it has to be
modified and and then there's also

2636
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:43,690
modified and and then there's also
 

2637
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:46,350
modified and and then there's also
experiments that are underway that kind

2638
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:46,360
experiments that are underway that kind
 

2639
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,010
experiments that are underway that kind
of look at the microtubule side of

2640
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:50,020
of look at the microtubule side of
 

2641
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,080
of look at the microtubule side of
things to see if there's in the biology

2642
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:52,090
things to see if there's in the biology
 

2643
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:53,940
things to see if there's in the biology
you could see something like that could

2644
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:53,950
you could see something like that could
 

2645
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:55,800
you could see something like that could
you briefly mention it because that's a

2646
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:55,810
you briefly mention it because that's a
 

2647
00:54:55,810 --> 00:54:57,990
you briefly mention it because that's a
really sort of one of the only

2648
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
really sort of one of the only
 

2649
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,480
really sort of one of the only
experimental attempts in the very early

2650
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:00,490
experimental attempts in the very early
 

2651
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:03,210
experimental attempts in the very early
days of even yeah about I think there's

2652
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:03,220
days of even yeah about I think there's
 

2653
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,580
days of even yeah about I think there's
there's a very serious area here which

2654
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:05,590
there's a very serious area here which
 

2655
00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:07,440
there's a very serious area here which
is what Stuart Hameroff is doing and I

2656
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:07,450
is what Stuart Hameroff is doing and I
 

2657
00:55:07,450 --> 00:55:09,690
is what Stuart Hameroff is doing and I
think it's very important one of the few

2658
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:09,700
think it's very important one of the few
 

2659
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:12,000
think it's very important one of the few
places that you can really get a bit of

2660
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:12,010
places that you can really get a bit of
 

2661
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,550
places that you can really get a bit of
a handle on what consciousness is is

2662
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:14,560
a handle on what consciousness is is
 

2663
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:17,600
a handle on what consciousness is is
what turns it off and when you're

2664
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:17,610
what turns it off and when you're
 

2665
00:55:17,610 --> 00:55:20,130
what turns it off and when you're
thinking about general anesthetics it's

2666
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:20,140
thinking about general anesthetics it's
 

2667
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:22,440
thinking about general anesthetics it's
very specific these things turn

2668
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:22,450
very specific these things turn
 

2669
00:55:22,450 --> 00:55:25,110
very specific these things turn
consciousness off what the hell do they

2670
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:25,120
consciousness off what the hell do they
 

2671
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:29,070
consciousness off what the hell do they
do well Stuart and a number of people

2672
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:29,080
do well Stuart and a number of people
 

2673
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:32,340
do well Stuart and a number of people
who work with him and others happen to

2674
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:32,350
who work with him and others happen to
 

2675
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,320
who work with him and others happen to
believe that the general anesthetics

2676
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:34,330
believe that the general anesthetics
 

2677
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,080
believe that the general anesthetics
directly effect microtubules and there

2678
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,090
directly effect microtubules and there
 

2679
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:39,180
directly effect microtubules and there
is some evidence for this I don't know

2680
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:39,190
is some evidence for this I don't know
 

2681
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:42,660
is some evidence for this I don't know
how strong it is and how watertight the

2682
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:42,670
how strong it is and how watertight the
 

2683
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,910
how strong it is and how watertight the
cases but I think there is some evidence

2684
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:44,920
cases but I think there is some evidence
 

2685
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:49,290
cases but I think there is some evidence
pointing in that kind of direction it's

2686
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:49,300
pointing in that kind of direction it's
 

2687
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,090
pointing in that kind of direction it's
not just an ordinary chemical process

2688
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:51,100
not just an ordinary chemical process
 

2689
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,410
not just an ordinary chemical process
there's something quite different about

2690
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:52,420
there's something quite different about
 

2691
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,000
there's something quite different about
it and one of the main candidates is

2692
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:57,010
it and one of the main candidates is
 

2693
00:55:57,010 --> 00:55:59,850
it and one of the main candidates is
that these anesthetic gases do affect

2694
00:55:59,850 --> 00:55:59,860
that these anesthetic gases do affect
 

2695
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:03,420
that these anesthetic gases do affect
directly microtubules and how strong

2696
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:03,430
directly microtubules and how strong
 

2697
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:05,829
directly microtubules and how strong
that evidence is I wouldn't

2698
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:05,839
that evidence is I wouldn't
 

2699
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:07,809
that evidence is I wouldn't
position to say but I think there is

2700
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:07,819
position to say but I think there is
 

2701
00:56:07,819 --> 00:56:10,509
position to say but I think there is
fairly impressive evidence and the point

2702
00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:10,519
fairly impressive evidence and the point
 

2703
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,339
fairly impressive evidence and the point
is the experiments are being undertaken

2704
00:56:12,339 --> 00:56:12,349
is the experiments are being undertaken
 

2705
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:14,589
is the experiments are being undertaken
with yes I mean that is experimental

2706
00:56:14,589 --> 00:56:14,599
with yes I mean that is experimental
 

2707
00:56:14,599 --> 00:56:17,559
with yes I mean that is experimental
it's a very clear direction where you

2708
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:17,569
it's a very clear direction where you
 

2709
00:56:17,569 --> 00:56:19,469
it's a very clear direction where you
can think of experiments which could

2710
00:56:19,469 --> 00:56:19,479
can think of experiments which could
 

2711
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:22,120
can think of experiments which could
indicate whether or not it's really

2712
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:22,130
indicate whether or not it's really
 

2713
00:56:22,130 --> 00:56:24,309
indicate whether or not it's really
microtubules which the anaesthetic gas

2714
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
microtubules which the anaesthetic gas
 

2715
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,559
microtubules which the anaesthetic gas
is directly affect that's really

2716
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:26,569
is directly affect that's really
 

2717
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:27,099
is directly affect that's really
exciting

2718
00:56:27,099 --> 00:56:27,109
exciting
 

2719
00:56:27,109 --> 00:56:30,160
exciting
one of the sad things is as far as I'm

2720
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:30,170
one of the sad things is as far as I'm
 

2721
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,620
one of the sad things is as far as I'm
for my outside perspective it's not many

2722
00:56:32,620 --> 00:56:32,630
for my outside perspective it's not many
 

2723
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:34,959
for my outside perspective it's not many
people are working on this so there's a

2724
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:34,969
people are working on this so there's a
 

2725
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:37,900
people are working on this so there's a
very like Oh Stewart even it feels like

2726
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:37,910
very like Oh Stewart even it feels like
 

2727
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,459
very like Oh Stewart even it feels like
there's very few people are carrying the

2728
00:56:39,459 --> 00:56:39,469
there's very few people are carrying the
 

2729
00:56:39,469 --> 00:56:42,279
there's very few people are carrying the
flag forward on this I think it's it's

2730
00:56:42,279 --> 00:56:42,289
flag forward on this I think it's it's
 

2731
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:44,289
flag forward on this I think it's it's
not many in the sense it's a minority

2732
00:56:44,289 --> 00:56:44,299
not many in the sense it's a minority
 

2733
00:56:44,299 --> 00:56:46,299
not many in the sense it's a minority
but it's not zero anymore

2734
00:56:46,299 --> 00:56:46,309
but it's not zero anymore
 

2735
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:49,509
but it's not zero anymore
you see when I were originally serious

2736
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:49,519
you see when I were originally serious
 

2737
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,279
you see when I were originally serious
you know we were just just us and a few

2738
00:56:51,279 --> 00:56:51,289
you know we were just just us and a few
 

2739
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:53,440
you know we were just just us and a few
few of our friends they weren't many

2740
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:53,450
few of our friends they weren't many
 

2741
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,749
few of our friends they weren't many
people think it but it's grown into into

2742
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:55,759
people think it but it's grown into into
 

2743
00:56:55,759 --> 00:56:59,620
people think it but it's grown into into
it one of the main viewpoints yeah there

2744
00:56:59,620 --> 00:56:59,630
it one of the main viewpoints yeah there
 

2745
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,719
it one of the main viewpoints yeah there
might be about four or five or six

2746
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:01,729
might be about four or five or six
 

2747
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:06,039
might be about four or five or six
different news that which people hold

2748
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:06,049
different news that which people hold
 

2749
00:57:06,049 --> 00:57:08,200
different news that which people hold
and it's one of them so it's it's

2750
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:08,210
and it's one of them so it's it's
 

2751
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:12,249
and it's one of them so it's it's
considered as one of the possible lines

2752
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:12,259
considered as one of the possible lines
 

2753
00:57:12,259 --> 00:57:14,620
considered as one of the possible lines
of thinking yes you describe physics

2754
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:14,630
of thinking yes you describe physics
 

2755
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,209
of thinking yes you describe physics
theories as falling into one of three

2756
00:57:16,209 --> 00:57:16,219
theories as falling into one of three
 

2757
00:57:16,219 --> 00:57:18,729
theories as falling into one of three
categories the superb the useful or the

2758
00:57:18,729 --> 00:57:18,739
categories the superb the useful or the
 

2759
00:57:18,739 --> 00:57:21,880
categories the superb the useful or the
tentative I like those words it's a

2760
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:21,890
tentative I like those words it's a
 

2761
00:57:21,890 --> 00:57:24,009
tentative I like those words it's a
beautiful categorization do you think

2762
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:24,019
beautiful categorization do you think
 

2763
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:26,950
beautiful categorization do you think
we'll ever have a superb theory of

2764
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:26,960
we'll ever have a superb theory of
 

2765
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,890
we'll ever have a superb theory of
intelligence and of consciousness we

2766
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:29,900
intelligence and of consciousness we
 

2767
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:34,029
intelligence and of consciousness we
might we're a long way from it I don't

2768
00:57:34,029 --> 00:57:34,039
might we're a long way from it I don't
 

2769
00:57:34,039 --> 00:57:35,589
might we're a long way from it I don't
think we're even whether in the

2770
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:35,599
think we're even whether in the
 

2771
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,209
think we're even whether in the
tentative scale I mean it's uh you don't

2772
00:57:40,209 --> 00:57:40,219
tentative scale I mean it's uh you don't
 

2773
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:41,680
tentative scale I mean it's uh you don't
think we've even entered the realm of

2774
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:41,690
think we've even entered the realm of
 

2775
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,299
think we've even entered the realm of
tentative probably no I think yeah

2776
00:57:43,299 --> 00:57:43,309
tentative probably no I think yeah
 

2777
00:57:43,309 --> 00:57:45,729
tentative probably no I think yeah
that's raised you know what do you see

2778
00:57:45,729 --> 00:57:45,739
that's raised you know what do you see
 

2779
00:57:45,739 --> 00:57:47,410
that's raised you know what do you see
the circle is so controversial we don't

2780
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:47,420
the circle is so controversial we don't
 

2781
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,450
the circle is so controversial we don't
have a clear view which which is

2782
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:51,460
have a clear view which which is
 

2783
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,529
have a clear view which which is
accepted by a majority I mean you say

2784
00:57:53,529 --> 00:57:53,539
accepted by a majority I mean you say
 

2785
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,690
accepted by a majority I mean you say
yeah people most views are computational

2786
00:57:55,690 --> 00:57:55,700
yeah people most views are computational
 

2787
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,559
yeah people most views are computational
in one form or another

2788
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:56,569
in one form or another
 

2789
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:58,719
in one form or another
they think it's some but it's not very

2790
00:57:58,719 --> 00:57:58,729
they think it's some but it's not very
 

2791
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:02,950
they think it's some but it's not very
clear because even the the IIT people

2792
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
clear because even the the IIT people
 

2793
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,799
clear because even the the IIT people
who I think think of them as

2794
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:05,809
who I think think of them as
 

2795
00:58:05,809 --> 00:58:07,660
who I think think of them as
computational but I've heard them saying

2796
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:07,670
computational but I've heard them saying
 

2797
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:09,219
computational but I've heard them saying
they know consciousness is supposed to

2798
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:09,229
they know consciousness is supposed to
 

2799
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:10,450
they know consciousness is supposed to
be not computation I say well if it's

2800
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:10,460
be not computation I say well if it's
 

2801
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,309
be not computation I say well if it's
not coming in what the hell is it what's

2802
00:58:12,309 --> 00:58:12,319
not coming in what the hell is it what's
 

2803
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,680
not coming in what the hell is it what's
good what's going on but physical

2804
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:14,690
good what's going on but physical
 

2805
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:16,300
good what's going on but physical
processes are going on which

2806
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:16,310
processes are going on which
 

2807
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:20,140
processes are going on which
that what does it mean for something to

2808
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,150
that what does it mean for something to
 

2809
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:25,240
that what does it mean for something to
be computational then so is uh well

2810
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:25,250
be computational then so is uh well
 

2811
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:29,680
be computational then so is uh well
there has to be a process which is it's

2812
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:29,690
there has to be a process which is it's
 

2813
00:58:29,690 --> 00:58:31,990
there has to be a process which is it's
very curious the way the history has

2814
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:32,000
very curious the way the history has
 

2815
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,300
very curious the way the history has
developed in quantum mechanics because

2816
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:34,310
developed in quantum mechanics because
 

2817
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:36,310
developed in quantum mechanics because
very early on people thought there was

2818
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:36,320
very early on people thought there was
 

2819
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,870
very early on people thought there was
something to do with consciousness but

2820
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:37,880
something to do with consciousness but
 

2821
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:39,370
something to do with consciousness but
it was almost the other way around you

2822
00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:39,380
it was almost the other way around you
 

2823
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,070
it was almost the other way around you
see you have to say the Schrodinger

2824
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:42,080
see you have to say the Schrodinger
 

2825
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,840
see you have to say the Schrodinger
equations says all these different

2826
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:43,850
equations says all these different
 

2827
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,270
equations says all these different
alternatives happen all at once and then

2828
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:46,280
alternatives happen all at once and then
 

2829
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,890
alternatives happen all at once and then
when is it that only one of them happens

2830
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:47,900
when is it that only one of them happens
 

2831
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,020
when is it that only one of them happens
where one of the views which was quite

2832
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:50,030
where one of the views which was quite
 

2833
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,910
where one of the views which was quite
commonly held by a few distinguished

2834
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:51,920
commonly held by a few distinguished

quantum physicists this well a conscious

2836
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:54,320
quantum physicists this well a conscious
 

2837
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,070
quantum physicists this well a conscious
being looks at the system what becomes

2838
00:58:57,070 --> 00:58:57,080
being looks at the system what becomes
 

2839
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,680
being looks at the system what becomes
aware of it and at that point it becomes

2840
00:58:59,680 --> 00:58:59,690
aware of it and at that point it becomes
 

2841
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:03,010
aware of it and at that point it becomes
one of the other that's a row where

2842
00:59:03,010 --> 00:59:03,020
one of the other that's a row where
 

2843
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:04,150
one of the other that's a row where
consciousness is somehow

2844
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
consciousness is somehow
 

2845
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,540
consciousness is somehow
actively reducing the state my view is

2846
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:07,550
actively reducing the state my view is
 

2847
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:10,270
actively reducing the state my view is
almost the exact opposite of that it's

2848
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:10,280
almost the exact opposite of that it's
 

2849
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,000
almost the exact opposite of that it's
the state reduces itself in some way

2850
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,010
the state reduces itself in some way
 

2851
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:16,090
the state reduces itself in some way
which some non computational way which

2852
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:16,100
which some non computational way which
 

2853
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,500
which some non computational way which
we don't understand we don't have a

2854
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:17,510
we don't understand we don't have a
 

2855
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,010
we don't understand we don't have a
proper theory of and that is the

2856
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:21,020
proper theory of and that is the
 

2857
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:23,550
proper theory of and that is the
building block of what consciousness is

2858
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:23,560
building block of what consciousness is
 

2859
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,810
building block of what consciousness is
so consciousness is the other way around

2860
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:25,820
so consciousness is the other way around
 

2861
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:29,320
so consciousness is the other way around
it depends on that choice which nature

2862
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:29,330
it depends on that choice which nature
 

2863
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:31,540
it depends on that choice which nature
makes all the time when the state

2864
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:31,550
makes all the time when the state
 

2865
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,550
makes all the time when the state
becomes one of the other rather than the

2866
00:59:33,550 --> 00:59:33,560
becomes one of the other rather than the
 

2867
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,680
becomes one of the other rather than the
superposition of one and the other and

2868
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:35,690
superposition of one and the other and
 

2869
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:38,920
superposition of one and the other and
when that happens there is what we're

2870
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:38,930
when that happens there is what we're
 

2871
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:40,420
when that happens there is what we're
saying now an element of proto

2872
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:40,430
saying now an element of proto
 

2873
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:43,270
saying now an element of proto
consciousness takes place proto

2874
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
consciousness takes place proto
 

2875
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,670
consciousness takes place proto
consciousness is roughly speaking the

2876
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
consciousness is roughly speaking the
 

2877
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,740
consciousness is roughly speaking the
building block out of which actual

00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:47,750
building block out of which actual
 

2879
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,530
building block out of which actual
consciousness is constructed so you have

2880
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:50,540
consciousness is constructed so you have
 

2881
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:53,500
consciousness is constructed so you have
these proto conscious elements which are

2882
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:53,510
these proto conscious elements which are
 

2883
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:55,690
these proto conscious elements which are
when the state decides to won't do one

2884
00:59:55,690 --> 00:59:55,700
when the state decides to won't do one
 

2885
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,480
when the state decides to won't do one
thing or the other and that's the thing

2886
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:58,490
thing or the other and that's the thing
 

2887
00:59:58,490 --> 01:00:01,780
thing or the other and that's the thing
which when organized together that's the

2888
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:01,790
which when organized together that's the
 

2889
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:04,870
which when organized together that's the
oh our part in orko our but the ork part

that's the the Oh our part at least once

that's the the Oh our part at least once
can see where when driving as a theory

01:00:10,150 --> 01:00:10,160
can see where when driving as a theory
 

2895
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:13,150
can see where when driving as a theory
you can say it's the quantum choice of

2896
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:13,160
you can say it's the quantum choice of
 

2897
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:15,100
you can say it's the quantum choice of
going this way or that way but the ork

01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:20,230

is much more mysterious and how does the
 

2903
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:23,680
is much more mysterious and how does the
brain somehow orchestrate all these

2904
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:23,690
brain somehow orchestrate all these

aware and completely in the dark about
 

2915
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,910

yeah I think at the moment it's best the

2916
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:39,920
yeah I think at the moment it's best the
 

2917
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,010
yeah I think at the moment it's best the
thing you know we happily put the word

2918
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:42,020
thing you know we happily put the word
 

2919
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,920

walk down there to say orchestrated

walk down there to say orchestrated
 

2921
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:47,620
walk down there to say orchestrated
that's even more unclear what that

2922
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:47,630
that's even more unclear what that
 

2923
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:50,640
that's even more unclear what that
really means just like the word material

2924
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:50,650
really means just like the word material
 

2925
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:54,550
really means just like the word material
orchestrated yeah it's we know yes and

2926
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:54,560
orchestrated yeah it's we know yes and
 

2927
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,440
orchestrated yeah it's we know yes and
we've been dancing a little bit between

2928
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:56,450
we've been dancing a little bit between
 

2929
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,830
we've been dancing a little bit between
the word intelligence or understanding

2930
01:00:59,830 --> 01:00:59,840
the word intelligence or understanding
 

2931
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:01,450
the word intelligence or understanding
in consciousness do you kind of see

2932
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:01,460
in consciousness do you kind of see
 

2933
01:01:01,460 --> 01:01:04,660
in consciousness do you kind of see
those as sitting in the same space of

2934
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:04,670
those as sitting in the same space of
 

2935
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:07,900
those as sitting in the same space of
mystery yes you see I tend to say you

2936
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:07,910
mystery yes you see I tend to say you
 

2937
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:11,410
mystery yes you see I tend to say you
have understanding and intelligence and

2938
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:11,420
have understanding and intelligence and
 

2939
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:18,250
have understanding and intelligence and
awareness and somehow understanding is

2940
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:18,260
awareness and somehow understanding is
 

2941
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,430
awareness and somehow understanding is
in the middle of it you see it's I like

2942
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
in the middle of it you see it's I like
 

2943
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,180
in the middle of it you see it's I like
to say could you say of an entity that

2944
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:25,190
to say could you say of an entity that
 

2945
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:28,540
to say could you say of an entity that
is actually intelligent if it doesn't

2946
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:28,550
is actually intelligent if it doesn't
 

2947
01:01:28,550 --> 01:01:30,460
is actually intelligent if it doesn't
have the quality of understanding nice

2948
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:30,470
have the quality of understanding nice
 

2949
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:31,960
have the quality of understanding nice
I'm using terms I don't even know how to

2950
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:31,970
I'm using terms I don't even know how to
 

2951
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:35,560
I'm using terms I don't even know how to
define but who cares really there's

2952
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:35,570
define but who cares really there's
 

2953
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:37,360
define but who cares really there's
somewhat poetic so I I somehow

2954
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:37,370
somewhat poetic so I I somehow
 

2955
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:41,170
somewhat poetic so I I somehow
understand them yes I think there's not

2956
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:41,180
understand them yes I think there's not
 

2957
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,240
understand them yes I think there's not
mathematical in nature yes you see as a

2958
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:43,250
mathematical in nature yes you see as a
 

2959
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,830
mathematical in nature yes you see as a
mathematician I don't know how to define

2960
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:44,840
mathematician I don't know how to define
 

2961
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,450
mathematician I don't know how to define
any of them but at least I can point to

2962
01:01:46,450 --> 01:01:46,460
any of them but at least I can point to
 

2963
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,480
any of them but at least I can point to
the connections so the idea is

2964
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:48,490
the connections so the idea is
 

2965
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:50,500
the connections so the idea is
intelligence is something which I

2966
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:50,510
intelligence is something which I
 

2967
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:54,250
intelligence is something which I
believe needs understanding otherwise

2968
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:54,260
believe needs understanding otherwise
 

2969
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,310
believe needs understanding otherwise
you wouldn't say for any intelligence an

2970
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:56,320
you wouldn't say for any intelligence an
 

2971
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,740
you wouldn't say for any intelligence an
understanding needs awareness otherwise

2972
01:01:59,740 --> 01:01:59,750
understanding needs awareness otherwise
 

2973
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,000
understanding needs awareness otherwise
you wouldn't really say it's

2974
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,010
you wouldn't really say it's
 

2975
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,310
you wouldn't really say it's
understanding you say of an entity they

2976
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:03,320
understanding you say of an entity they
 

2977
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,110
understanding you say of an entity they
understand something and it's unless

2978
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:05,120
understand something and it's unless
 

2979
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,210
understand something and it's unless
it's really aware of it in our normal

2980
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:07,220
it's really aware of it in our normal
 

2981
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,430
it's really aware of it in our normal
usage so there's a three sort of

2982
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:09,440
usage so there's a three sort of
 

2983
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,910
usage so there's a three sort of
weirdness understanding and intelligence

2984
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:12,920
weirdness understanding and intelligence
 

2985
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:16,440
weirdness understanding and intelligence
and I just tend to concentrate on

2986
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:16,450
and I just tend to concentrate on
 

2987
01:02:16,450 --> 01:02:18,430
and I just tend to concentrate on
understanding because that's where I can

2988
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:18,440
understanding because that's where I can
 

2989
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,470
understanding because that's where I can
say something okay that's the kernel

2990
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
say something okay that's the kernel
 

2991
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,320
say something okay that's the kernel
theorem and things like that but they

2992
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:22,330
theorem and things like that but they
 

2993
01:02:22,330 --> 01:02:25,660
theorem and things like that but they
what does it mean to be perceive the

2994
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:25,670
what does it mean to be perceive the
 

2995
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,790
what does it mean to be perceive the
color blue or something I mean I guess

2996
01:02:27,790 --> 01:02:27,800
color blue or something I mean I guess
 

2997
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:31,180
color blue or something I mean I guess
it's much more difficult question I mean

2998
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:31,190
it's much more difficult question I mean
 

2999
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:33,160
it's much more difficult question I mean
is it the same if I see a color blue and

3000
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,170
is it the same if I see a color blue and
 

3001
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,080
is it the same if I see a color blue and
you see it if you're something with them

3002
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:35,090
you see it if you're something with them
 

3003
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,000
you see it if you're something with them
wasn't this this condition wants to call

3004
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:37,010
wasn't this this condition wants to call
 

3005
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:41,620
wasn't this this condition wants to call
them or were you assign a sound - yeah

3006
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:41,630
them or were you assign a sound - yeah
 

3007
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,000
them or were you assign a sound - yeah
yeah that's right you get colors and

3008
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,010
yeah that's right you get colors and
 

3009
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,880
yeah that's right you get colors and
sounds mixed up and that sort of thing I

3010
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:45,890
sounds mixed up and that sort of thing I
 

3011
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:49,240
sounds mixed up and that sort of thing I
mean an interesting subject um here but

3012
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,250
mean an interesting subject um here but
 

3013
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,070
mean an interesting subject um here but
from the physics perspective from the

3014
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:51,080
from the physics perspective from the
 

3015
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,960
from the physics perspective from the
fundamentals perspective we don't I

3016
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:52,970
fundamentals perspective we don't I
 

3017
01:02:52,970 --> 01:02:55,260
fundamentals perspective we don't I
think we're way off pretty much

3018
01:02:55,260 --> 01:02:55,270
think we're way off pretty much
 

3019
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:57,910
think we're way off pretty much
understanding what's going on there in

3020
01:02:57,910 --> 01:02:57,920
understanding what's going on there in
 

3021
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,390
understanding what's going on there in
your 2010 book cycles of time you

3022
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:01,400
your 2010 book cycles of time you
 

3023
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,640
your 2010 book cycles of time you
suggest that another universe may have

3024
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:03,650
suggest that another universe may have
 

3025
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:05,370
suggest that another universe may have
existed before the Big Bang

3026
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:05,380
existed before the Big Bang
 

3027
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:09,130
existed before the Big Bang
can you describe this idea first of all

3028
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:09,140
can you describe this idea first of all
 

3029
01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:10,690
can you describe this idea first of all
what is the Big Bang

3030
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:10,700
what is the Big Bang
 

3031
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:15,220
what is the Big Bang
sounds like a funny word and what may

3032
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:15,230
sounds like a funny word and what may
 

3033
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:18,220
sounds like a funny word and what may
have been there before it yes just as a

3034
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:18,230
have been there before it yes just as a
 

3035
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,900
have been there before it yes just as a
matter of terminology I don't like to

3036
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:19,910
matter of terminology I don't like to
 

3037
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:22,000
matter of terminology I don't like to
call it another universe because when

3038
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:22,010
call it another universe because when
 

3039
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:23,380
call it another universe because when
you have another universe you think of

3040
01:03:23,380 --> 01:03:23,390
you have another universe you think of
 

3041
01:03:23,390 --> 01:03:25,570
you have another universe you think of
it kind of quite separate from us but

3042
01:03:25,570 --> 01:03:25,580
it kind of quite separate from us but
 

3043
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,720
it kind of quite separate from us but
these things they're not separate now

3044
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:28,730
these things they're not separate now
 

3045
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:31,990
these things they're not separate now
the Big Bang conventional theories yeah

3046
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:32,000
the Big Bang conventional theories yeah
 

3047
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,600
the Big Bang conventional theories yeah
I was actually brought up in the sense

3048
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:34,610
I was actually brought up in the sense
 

3049
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,250
I was actually brought up in the sense
of when I started getting dressed in

3050
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:36,260
of when I started getting dressed in
 

3051
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,570
of when I started getting dressed in
cosmology there was a thing called the

3052
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:37,580
cosmology there was a thing called the
 

3053
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,940
cosmology there was a thing called the
steady-state model which was sort of

3054
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:39,950
steady-state model which was sort of
 

3055
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,440
steady-state model which was sort of
philosophically very interesting and

3056
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:41,450
philosophically very interesting and
 

3057
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,910
philosophically very interesting and
there wasn't a big bang in that theory

3058
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:42,920
there wasn't a big bang in that theory
 

3059
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,520
there wasn't a big bang in that theory
that somehow new material was created

3060
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:45,530
that somehow new material was created
 

3061
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,130
that somehow new material was created
all the time in the form of hydrogen and

3062
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:48,140
all the time in the form of hydrogen and
 

3063
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,690
all the time in the form of hydrogen and
the universe kept on expanding expanding

3064
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:49,700
the universe kept on expanding expanding
 

3065
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:51,340
the universe kept on expanding expanding
expanding and there was room for more

3066
01:03:51,340 --> 01:03:51,350
expanding and there was room for more
 

3067
01:03:51,350 --> 01:03:53,980
expanding and there was room for more
hydrogen it was a rather philosophically

3068
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:53,990
hydrogen it was a rather philosophically
 

3069
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:57,640
hydrogen it was a rather philosophically
nice picture it was disproved when the

3070
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:57,650
nice picture it was disproved when the
 

3071
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:01,060
nice picture it was disproved when the
Big Bang well when I say the Big Bang

3072
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:01,070
Big Bang well when I say the Big Bang
 

3073
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:05,110
Big Bang well when I say the Big Bang
this was theoretically discovered by

3074
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:05,120
this was theoretically discovered by
 

3075
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,730
this was theoretically discovered by
people trying to solve Einstein's

3076
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:06,740
people trying to solve Einstein's
 

3077
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,770
people trying to solve Einstein's
equations and apply it to cosmology

3078
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:08,780
equations and apply it to cosmology
 

3079
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:11,050
equations and apply it to cosmology
Einstein didn't like the idea he liked

3080
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:11,060
Einstein didn't like the idea he liked
 

3081
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:13,180
Einstein didn't like the idea he liked
and I a universe which was there all the

3082
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:13,190
and I a universe which was there all the
 

3083
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:15,760
and I a universe which was there all the
time and he had a model which they wish

3084
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:15,770
time and he had a model which they wish
 

3085
01:04:15,770 --> 01:04:17,680
time and he had a model which they wish
there all the time but then there was

3086
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:17,690
there all the time but then there was
 

3087
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,170
there all the time but then there was
this discovery

3088
01:04:19,170 --> 01:04:19,180
this discovery
 

3089
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:21,490
this discovery
accidental discovery a very important

3090
01:04:21,490 --> 01:04:21,500
accidental discovery a very important
 

3091
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,010
accidental discovery a very important
discovery of this microwave background

3092
01:04:24,010 --> 01:04:24,020
discovery of this microwave background
 

3093
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:27,250
discovery of this microwave background
and if you you know there's the crackle

3094
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:27,260
and if you you know there's the crackle
 

3095
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:28,960
and if you you know there's the crackle
on your television screen which is is

3096
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:28,970
on your television screen which is is
 

3097
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:31,960
on your television screen which is is
already sensing this microwave

3098
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:31,970
already sensing this microwave
 

3099
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,700
already sensing this microwave
background which is coming at us from

3100
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:33,710
background which is coming at us from
 

3101
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:36,190
background which is coming at us from
all directions and you can trace it back

3102
01:04:36,190 --> 01:04:36,200
all directions and you can trace it back
 

3103
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:38,110
all directions and you can trace it back
and back and back and back and it came

3104
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:38,120
and back and back and back and it came
 

3105
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,890
and back and back and back and it came
from a very early stage of the universe

3106
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:40,900
from a very early stage of the universe
 

3107
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:43,360
from a very early stage of the universe
well it's part of the Big Bang Theory

3108
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:43,370
well it's part of the Big Bang Theory
 

3109
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:45,400
well it's part of the Big Bang Theory
the Big Bang Theory was when people

3110
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:45,410
the Big Bang Theory was when people
 

3111
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:46,960
the Big Bang Theory was when people
tried to solve our science equations

3112
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:46,970
tried to solve our science equations
 

3113
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,300
tried to solve our science equations
they really found you have to have this

3114
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:49,310
they really found you have to have this
 

3115
01:04:49,310 --> 01:04:50,920
they really found you have to have this
initial State

3116
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:50,930
initial State
 

3117
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:52,420

there's freedmen and a la Mettrie

3122
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:58,270
there's freedmen and a la Mettrie
 

3123
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,460
there's freedmen and a la Mettrie
Freedman was a Russian the Metro was the

01:05:00,460 --> 01:05:00,470
Freedman was a Russian the Metro was the

basically Friedman first the maitre

3128
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:05,390
basically Friedman first the maitre
 

3129
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:09,220
basically Friedman first the maitre
talked about the initial state which is

3130
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:09,230
talked about the initial state which is
 

3131
01:05:09,230 --> 01:05:11,349
talked about the initial state which is
a very very concentrated initial state

3132
01:05:11,349 --> 01:05:11,359
a very very concentrated initial state
 

3133
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:12,579
a very very concentrated initial state
which seemed to be the origin of the

3134
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:12,589
which seemed to be the origin of the
 

3135
01:05:12,589 --> 01:05:14,770
which seemed to be the origin of the
universe from more Deol Adam that's the

3136
01:05:14,770 --> 01:05:14,780
universe from more Deol Adam that's the
 

3137
01:05:14,780 --> 01:05:16,599
universe from more Deol Adam that's the
primordial atom is what he called it yes

3138
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:16,609
primordial atom is what he called it yes
 

3139
01:05:16,609 --> 01:05:19,270

Hoyle used the term Big Bang in a kind

3142
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,020
Hoyle used the term Big Bang in a kind
 

3143
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,200
Hoyle used the term Big Bang in a kind
of derogatory sense just like it was a

3144
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:23,210
of derogatory sense just like it was a
 

3145
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:25,420
of derogatory sense just like it was a
Schrodinger in the cat's right yeah it's

01:05:25,420 --> 01:05:25,430
Schrodinger in the cat's right yeah it's
 

3147

Schrodinger in the cat's right yeah it's
this like sort of geek tick got picked

3148
01:05:27,670 --> 01:05:27,680
this like sort of geek tick got picked
 

3149
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,440
this like sort of geek tick got picked
up on whereas it wasn't his intention

piled up and piled up and my one of my

piled up and piled up and my one of my
 

3155
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:36,460
piled up and piled up and my one of my
friends and I learned a lot from him

usually a proponent of steady state and

usually a proponent of steady state and
 

3161
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,430
usually a proponent of steady state and
then he got to convert it just said no

3162
01:05:42,430 --> 01:05:42,440
then he got to convert it just said no
 

3163
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,470
then he got to convert it just said no
I'm sorry I had a great respect for him

he went around lecturing said I was

01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:45,710
he went around lecturing said I was
 

3167
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:47,950
he went around lecturing said I was
wrong the steady-state model doesn't

3168
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:47,960
wrong the steady-state model doesn't
 

3169

work there was this big bang and this

01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:51,230
work there was this big bang and this
 

3171
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:53,829
work there was this big bang and this

01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:08,050
call that a mammoth in the room paradox
and mother yes it is so people why don't

3282
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,060
and mother yes it is so people why don't
 

3283
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,720
and mother yes it is so people why don't
cosmologists worry about this so I'm

3284
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:10,730
cosmologists worry about this so I'm
 

3285
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:12,640
cosmologists worry about this so I'm
worried about it and then I thought well

3286
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:12,650
worried about it and then I thought well
 

3287
01:08:12,650 --> 01:08:16,690
worried about it and then I thought well
it's not really a paradox because you're

3288
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:16,700
it's not really a paradox because you're
 

3289
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,150
it's not really a paradox because you're
looking at matter and radiation at a

3290
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:19,160
looking at matter and radiation at a
 

3291
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,190
looking at matter and radiation at a
maximum entropy state what you're not

3292
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:21,200
maximum entropy state what you're not
 

3293
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,860
maximum entropy state what you're not
seeing directly in that is the

3294
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:23,870
seeing directly in that is the
 

3295
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:27,340
seeing directly in that is the
gravitation its gravitation which is not

3296
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:27,350
gravitation its gravitation which is not
 

3297
01:08:27,350 --> 01:08:29,890
gravitation its gravitation which is not
thermalized the gravitation was very

3298
01:08:29,890 --> 01:08:29,900
thermalized the gravitation was very
 

3299
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,490
thermalized the gravitation was very
very low entropy and it's low entropy by

3300
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:33,500
very low entropy and it's low entropy by
 

3301
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,230
very low entropy and it's low entropy by
the uniformity and you see that in the

3302
01:08:35,230 --> 01:08:35,240
the uniformity and you see that in the
 

3303
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,180
the uniformity and you see that in the
microwave - it's very uniform over the

3304
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:37,190
microwave - it's very uniform over the
 

3305
01:08:37,190 --> 01:08:39,340
microwave - it's very uniform over the
whole sky I'm compressing a long story

3306
01:08:39,340 --> 01:08:39,350
whole sky I'm compressing a long story
 

3307
01:08:39,350 --> 01:08:41,230
whole sky I'm compressing a long story
into a very short sentence and doing a

3308
01:08:41,230 --> 01:08:41,240
into a very short sentence and doing a
 

3309
01:08:41,240 --> 01:08:43,510
into a very short sentence and doing a
great job yet so what I'm saying is that

3310
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:43,520
great job yet so what I'm saying is that
 

3311
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:47,470
great job yet so what I'm saying is that
there's a huge puzzle why it was gravity

3312
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:47,480
there's a huge puzzle why it was gravity
 

3313
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:51,340
there's a huge puzzle why it was gravity
in this very low entropy state very high

3314
01:08:51,340 --> 01:08:51,350
in this very low entropy state very high
 

3315
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,280
in this very low entropy state very high
organized state everything else was all

3316
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:54,290
organized state everything else was all
 

3317
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:57,130
organized state everything else was all
random and that to me was the biggest

3318
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:57,140
random and that to me was the biggest
 

3319
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:59,880
random and that to me was the biggest
problem in cosmology the biggest problem

3320
01:08:59,880 --> 01:08:59,890
problem in cosmology the biggest problem
 

3321
01:08:59,890 --> 01:09:03,070
problem in cosmology the biggest problem
nobody seemed worried about it people

3322
01:09:03,070 --> 01:09:03,080
nobody seemed worried about it people
 

3323
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:04,480
nobody seemed worried about it people
say they solved all the problems and

3324
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:04,490
say they solved all the problems and
 

3325
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:05,590
say they solved all the problems and
they don't even worry about it they

3326
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:05,600
they don't even worry about it they
 

3327
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,960
they don't even worry about it they
think inflation sources it doesn't I

3328
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:07,970
think inflation sources it doesn't I
 

3329
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:12,550
think inflation sources it doesn't I
can't because it's it's just just to

3330
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:12,560
can't because it's it's just just to
 

3331
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:15,450
can't because it's it's just just to
clarify that was your problem with the

3332
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:15,460
clarify that was your problem with the
 

3333
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:17,860
clarify that was your problem with the
inflation describing some ass

3334
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:17,870
inflation describing some ass
 

3335
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:20,020
inflation describing some ass
but those yes moments right after the

3336
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:20,030
but those yes moments right after the

01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,610
but those yes moments right after the
Big Bang inflation we're supposed to

3338
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:21,620
Big Bang inflation we're supposed to
 

3339
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:23,290
Big Bang inflation we're supposed to
stretch it out make it all uniform you

3340
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:23,300
stretch it out make it all uniform you
 

3341
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:24,880
stretch it out make it all uniform you
see it doesn't do it because you can

3342
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:24,890
see it doesn't do it because you can
 

3343
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:26,500
see it doesn't do it because you can
only do it if it's uniform already at

3344
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:26,510
only do it if it's uniform already at
 

3345
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:28,330
only do it if it's uniform already at
the beginning it's it's you just have a

3346
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:28,340
the beginning it's it's you just have a
 

3347
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:30,700
the beginning it's it's you just have a
look I can't go into the details but it

3348
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:30,710
look I can't go into the details but it
 

3349
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:32,440
look I can't go into the details but it
doesn't solve this and it was completely

3350
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:32,450
doesn't solve this and it was completely
 

3351
01:09:32,450 --> 01:09:34,210
doesn't solve this and it was completely
clear to me it doesn't solve well word

3352
01:09:34,210 --> 01:09:34,220
clear to me it doesn't solve well word
 

3353

yeah we're starting to talk about

3356
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:38,240
yeah we're starting to talk about
 

3357
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,700
yeah we're starting to talk about
something before

3358
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:39,710
something before
 

3359
01:09:39,710 --> 01:09:42,250
something before
yes that's singular I began I was just

3360
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:42,260
yes that's singular I began I was just
 

3361
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:45,640
yes that's singular I began I was just
thinking of myself how boring this

3362
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:45,650
thinking of myself how boring this
 

3363
01:09:45,650 --> 01:09:48,100
thinking of myself how boring this
universe is going to be you've got this

3364
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:48,110
universe is going to be you've got this
 

3365
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:49,720
universe is going to be you've got this
exponential expansion this was

3366
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:49,730
exponential expansion this was
 

3367
01:09:49,730 --> 01:09:54,100
exponential expansion this was
discovered early in the in this century

3368
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:54,110
discovered early in the in this century
 

3369
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:57,460
discovered early in the in this century
20th 21st century people discovered that

3370
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:57,470
20th 21st century people discovered that
 

3371
01:09:57,470 --> 01:10:01,360
20th 21st century people discovered that
these supernovae exploding stars showed

3372
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:01,370
these supernovae exploding stars showed
 

3373
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:04,450
these supernovae exploding stars showed
that the universe is actually undergoing

3374
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:04,460
that the universe is actually undergoing
 

3375
01:10:04,460 --> 01:10:07,900
that the universe is actually undergoing
this exponential expansion so it's a

3376
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:07,910
this exponential expansion so it's a
 

3377
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:11,920
this exponential expansion so it's a
self-similar expansion and it seems to

3378
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:11,930
self-similar expansion and it seems to
 

3379
01:10:11,930 --> 01:10:14,860
self-similar expansion and it seems to
be a feature of this term that Einstein

3380
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:14,870
be a feature of this term that Einstein
 

3381
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:17,410
be a feature of this term that Einstein
introduced into his cosmology for the

3382
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:17,420
introduced into his cosmology for the
 

3383
01:10:17,420 --> 01:10:19,930
introduced into his cosmology for the
wrong reason he wanted a universe that

3384
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:19,940
wrong reason he wanted a universe that
 

3385
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:22,150
wrong reason he wanted a universe that
was static he put this new term into his

3386
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:22,160
was static he put this new term into his
 

3387
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:24,520
was static he put this new term into his
cosmology and to make it make sense it's

3388
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:24,530
cosmology and to make it make sense it's
 

3389
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,080
cosmology and to make it make sense it's
called the cosmological constant and

3390
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:26,090
called the cosmological constant and
 

3391
01:10:26,090 --> 01:10:28,450
called the cosmological constant and
then when he got convinced that the

3392
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:28,460
then when he got convinced that the
 

3393
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:30,070
then when he got convinced that the
universe had the Big Bang he retracted

3394
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:30,080
universe had the Big Bang he retracted
 

3395
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,230
universe had the Big Bang he retracted
it complaining this was his greatest

3396
01:10:32,230 --> 01:10:32,240
it complaining this was his greatest
 

3397
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,300
it complaining this was his greatest
blunder the trouble is it wasn't a

3398
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:34,310
blunder the trouble is it wasn't a
 

3399
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:36,850
blunder the trouble is it wasn't a
blunder it was actually right very

3400
01:10:36,850 --> 01:10:36,860
blunder it was actually right very
 

3401
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:39,700
blunder it was actually right very
ironic and so the universe seems to be

3402
01:10:39,700 --> 01:10:39,710
ironic and so the universe seems to be
 

3403
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:41,860
ironic and so the universe seems to be
behaving with this cosmological constant

3404
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:41,870
behaving with this cosmological constant
 

3405
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,260
behaving with this cosmological constant
okay so this universe is expanding and

3406
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:44,270
okay so this universe is expanding and
 

3407
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:45,970
okay so this universe is expanding and
expanding what's going to happen in the

3408
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:45,980
expanding what's going to happen in the
 

3409
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:48,430
expanding what's going to happen in the
future well it gets more and more boring

3410
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:48,440
future well it gets more and more boring
 

3411
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,810
future well it gets more and more boring
from well what's the most interesting

3412
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:49,820
from well what's the most interesting
 

3413
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,040
from well what's the most interesting
thing in the universe well there's black

3414
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:51,050
thing in the universe well there's black
 

3415
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,930
thing in the universe well there's black
holes the black holes more or less

3416
01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:52,940
holes the black holes more or less
 

3417
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,960
holes the black holes more or less
gulped down the entire clusters of

3418
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:54,970
gulped down the entire clusters of
 

3419
01:10:54,970 --> 01:10:58,030
gulped down the entire clusters of
galaxies the class it'll swallow up most

3420
01:10:58,030 --> 01:10:58,040
galaxies the class it'll swallow up most
 

3421
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,430
galaxies the class it'll swallow up most
of our galaxy we will run into Andromeda

3422
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:00,440
of our galaxy we will run into Andromeda
 

3423
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,230
of our galaxy we will run into Andromeda
galaxies black hole that black hole will

galaxies black hole that black hole will
 

3425
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,240
galaxies black hole that black hole will
swallow em they will get bigger and

3426
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:04,250
swallow em they will get bigger and
 

3427
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:06,370
swallow em they will get bigger and
bigger and they'll basically swallow up

3428
01:11:06,370 --> 01:11:06,380
bigger and they'll basically swallow up
 

3429
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,430
bigger and they'll basically swallow up
the whole cluster of galaxies golf it

3430
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
the whole cluster of galaxies golf it
 

3431
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,650
the whole cluster of galaxies golf it
all down pretty well all most of it

3432
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:11,660
all down pretty well all most of it
 

3433
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,290
all down pretty well all most of it
maybe not all most of it okay

3434
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:14,300
maybe not all most of it okay
 

3435
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:15,700
maybe not all most of it okay
that'll happen too there'll be just

3436
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:15,710
that'll happen too there'll be just

that'll happen too there'll be just
these black holes around pretty boring

these black holes around pretty boring
 

3439
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:18,820
these black holes around pretty boring
but still not as boring as it's going to

3440
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:18,830
but still not as boring as it's going to
 

3441
01:11:18,830 --> 01:11:20,560
but still not as boring as it's going to
get it's going to get more boring

01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:20,570
get it's going to get more boring
 

3443
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:22,180
get it's going to get more boring
because these black holes you wait you

3483
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:10,010
because it's a part of relativity you
see it's not really that they don't

you can see them crowding and crowding
 

3535
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:06,470
you can see them crowding and crowding
and crowding up to the edge now the kind

3536
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
and crowding up to the edge now the kind
 

3537
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,750
and crowding up to the edge now the kind

and habits that's their infinity but
 

3541
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,990

from our perspective infinity is just a

01:13:14,990 --> 01:13:15,000
from our perspective infinity is just a
 

3543
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:18,290
from our perspective infinity is just a
point is a place ok there it is I can

3545
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:20,930
point is a place ok there it is I can
you just take a brief pause yes and the

3546
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:20,940
you just take a brief pause yes and the
 

3547
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,360
you just take a brief pause yes and the
in just the word you're saying infinity

3548
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:23,370
in just the word you're saying infinity
 

3549
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,610
in just the word you're saying infinity
is just a place so I have for the most

3550
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:25,620
is just a place so I have for the most
 

3551
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:27,830
is just a place so I have for the most
part infinity sort of even just going

3552
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
part infinity sort of even just going
 

3553
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,350
part infinity sort of even just going
back yeah infinity is a mathematical

3554
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:30,360
back yeah infinity is a mathematical
 

3555
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,210
back yeah infinity is a mathematical
concept I think this is what I think

3556
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:32,220
concept I think this is what I think
 

3557
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:35,300
concept I think this is what I think
there's an actual physical manifestation

3558
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:35,310
there's an actual physical manifestation
 

3559
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:36,950
there's an actual physical manifestation
in which way does infinity ever

3560
01:13:36,950 --> 01:13:36,960
in which way does infinity ever
 

3561
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,140
in which way does infinity ever
manifests itself in our physical

3562
01:13:39,140 --> 01:13:39,150
manifests itself in our physical
 

3563
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:41,270
manifests itself in our physical
universe what it does in various places

3564
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
universe what it does in various places
 

3565
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,320
universe what it does in various places
you see

3566
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:42,330
you see
 

3567
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,760
you see
it's the thing that we're if you're not

3568
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:43,770
it's the thing that we're if you're not

it's the thing that we're if you're not
a mathematician you think aren't

01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:44,910
a mathematician you think aren't
 

3571
01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:46,130
a mathematician you think aren't
finished yeah I can't think about that

3572
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:46,140
finished yeah I can't think about that
 

3573
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:47,930
finished yeah I can't think about that
mathematicians think about affinity all

3574
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:47,940
mathematicians think about affinity all
 

3575
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:49,970
mathematicians think about affinity all
the time they get used to the idea and

3576
01:13:49,970 --> 01:13:49,980
the time they get used to the idea and
 

3577
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,080
the time they get used to the idea and
they just play around with different

3578
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:51,090
they just play around with different
 

3579
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,270
they just play around with different
kinds of infinities and it becomes no

3580
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
kinds of infinities and it becomes no
 

3581
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,550
kinds of infinities and it becomes no
problem but yeah you just have to take

3582
01:13:55,550 --> 01:13:55,560
problem but yeah you just have to take
 

3583
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:58,400
problem but yeah you just have to take
my word for it now one of the things is

3584
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:58,410
my word for it now one of the things is
 

3585
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:59,720
my word for it now one of the things is
you see you have taken Euclidian

3586
01:13:59,720 --> 01:13:59,730
you see you have taken Euclidian
 

3587
01:13:59,730 --> 01:14:01,910
you see you have taken Euclidian
geometry well it just keeps on keeps on

3588
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
geometry well it just keeps on keeps on

geometry and this is a what's called
 

3595
01:14:07,950 --> 01:14:09,830
geometry and this is a what's called
hyperbolic geometry it's a bit like

hyperbolic geometry it's a bit like
 

3597
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,540
hyperbolic geometry it's a bit like
Euclidean geometry so it'll be different

01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:14,010
it's like what Asia was trying to
 

3601
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:17,600
it's like what Asia was trying to
describe in his angels and devils and he

represent this infinity to this kind of
 

3609
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,770
represent this infinity to this kind of
geometry so it's not quite Euclidean

3610
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:27,780
geometry so it's not quite Euclidean
 

3611
01:14:27,780 --> 01:14:29,480

you see it's what the angels levels have
if you look at the eye of the devil no

3744
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:35,160
if you look at the eye of the devil no
 

3745
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,770
if you look at the eye of the devil no
matter how close to the boundary it is

3746
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:36,780
matter how close to the boundary it is
 

3747
01:17:36,780 --> 01:17:38,990
matter how close to the boundary it is
it has the same shape but it has a

3748
01:17:38,990 --> 01:17:39,000
it has the same shape but it has a
 

3749
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,810
it has the same shape but it has a
different size so you can scale up and

3750
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:41,820
different size so you can scale up and
 

3751
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:43,970
different size so you can scale up and
you can scale down but you mustn't

3752
01:17:43,970 --> 01:17:43,980
you can scale down but you mustn't
 

3753
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:47,450
you can scale down but you mustn't
change the shape so it's basically the

3754
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:47,460
change the shape so it's basically the
 

3755
01:17:47,460 --> 01:17:49,940
change the shape so it's basically the
same idea but applied to space-time now

3756
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:49,950
same idea but applied to space-time now
 

3757
01:17:49,950 --> 01:17:52,910
same idea but applied to space-time now
in the very remote future you have

3758
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:52,920
in the very remote future you have
 

3759
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,790
in the very remote future you have
things which don't measure the scale but

3760
01:17:55,790 --> 01:17:55,800
things which don't measure the scale but
 

3761
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:58,580
things which don't measure the scale but
the shape if you like is still there now

3762
01:17:58,580 --> 01:17:58,590
the shape if you like is still there now
 

3763
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:00,290
the shape if you like is still there now
that's in the remote future now I'm

3764
01:18:00,290 --> 01:18:00,300
that's in the remote future now I'm
 

3765
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,240
that's in the remote future now I'm
going to do the exact opposite now I'm

3766
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:02,250
going to do the exact opposite now I'm
 

3767
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:04,010
going to do the exact opposite now I'm
going to go way back into the Big Bang

3768
01:18:04,010 --> 01:18:04,020
going to go way back into the Big Bang
 

3769
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,010
going to go way back into the Big Bang
now as you get there things go hotter

3770
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:07,020
now as you get there things go hotter
 

3771
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,830
now as you get there things go hotter
and hotter denser and denser

3772
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
and hotter denser and denser
 

3773
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,500
and hotter denser and denser
what the universe dominated by particles

3774
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:13,510
what the universe dominated by particles
 

3775
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:15,270
what the universe dominated by particles
moving around almost with the speed of

3776
01:18:15,270 --> 01:18:15,280
moving around almost with the speed of
 

3777
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,670
moving around almost with the speed of
light when they get almost with the

3778
01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:17,680
light when they get almost with the
 

3779
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,130
light when they get almost with the
speed of light okay they begin to lose

3780
01:18:20,130 --> 01:18:20,140
speed of light okay they begin to lose
 

3781
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,560
speed of light okay they begin to lose
the mass to therefore a completely

3782
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:22,570
the mass to therefore a completely
 

3783
01:18:22,570 --> 01:18:25,260
the mass to therefore a completely
opposite reason they lose the sense of

3784
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:25,270
opposite reason they lose the sense of
 

3785
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:28,800
opposite reason they lose the sense of
scale as well so my crazy idea is the

3786
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:28,810
scale as well so my crazy idea is the
 

3787
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:32,550
scale as well so my crazy idea is the
Big Bang and a remote future they seem

3788
01:18:32,550 --> 01:18:32,560
Big Bang and a remote future they seem
 

3789
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:34,530
Big Bang and a remote future they seem
completely different one is extremely

3790
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:34,540
completely different one is extremely
 

3791
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:36,420
completely different one is extremely
dense extremely hot the other is very

3792
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:36,430
dense extremely hot the other is very
 

3793
01:18:36,430 --> 01:18:40,170
dense extremely hot the other is very
very rarefied and very very cold but if

3794
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:40,180
very rarefied and very very cold but if
 

3795
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,360
very rarefied and very very cold but if
you squash one down by this conformal

3796
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:42,370
you squash one down by this conformal
 

3797
01:18:42,370 --> 01:18:44,790
you squash one down by this conformal
scale and you get the other so although

3798
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
scale and you get the other so although
 

3799
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,310
scale and you get the other so although
they look and feel very different

3800
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:47,320
they look and feel very different
 

3801
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,460
they look and feel very different
they're really almost the same the

3802
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:50,470
they're really almost the same the
 

3803
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:53,220
they're really almost the same the
remote future on the other side and

3804
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:53,230
remote future on the other side and
 

3805
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:54,840
remote future on the other side and
claiming is that one of the photons go

3806
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:54,850
claiming is that one of the photons go
 

3807
01:18:54,850 --> 01:18:58,770
claiming is that one of the photons go
they go into the next Big Bang you've

3808
01:18:58,770 --> 01:18:58,780
they go into the next Big Bang you've
 

3809
01:18:58,780 --> 01:19:00,210
they go into the next Big Bang you've
got to get your mind around that crazy

3810
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:00,220
got to get your mind around that crazy
 

3811
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:03,120
got to get your mind around that crazy
idea taking a step on the other side of

3812
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:03,130
idea taking a step on the other side of
 

3813
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:07,380
idea taking a step on the other side of
the place that is infinity yes but I'm

3814
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:07,390
the place that is infinity yes but I'm
 

3815
01:19:07,390 --> 01:19:08,580
the place that is infinity yes but I'm
saying the other side of our Big Bang

3816
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:08,590
saying the other side of our Big Bang
 

3817
01:19:08,590 --> 01:19:10,830
saying the other side of our Big Bang
now I'm going back into the Big Bang

3818
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:10,840
now I'm going back into the Big Bang
 

3819
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:12,570
now I'm going back into the Big Bang
that was the remote future of a

3820
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:12,580
that was the remote future of a
 

3821
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,510
that was the remote future of a
previously on previously on and what I'm

3822
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:15,520
previously on previously on and what I'm
 

3823
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,910
previously on previously on and what I'm
saying is that previously on there are

3824
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
saying is that previously on there are
 

3825
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:20,610
saying is that previously on there are
signals coming through to us which we

3826
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:20,620
signals coming through to us which we
 

3827
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,060
signals coming through to us which we
can see and which we do see and these

3828
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:24,070
can see and which we do see and these
 

3829
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:26,040
can see and which we do see and these
are both signals the two main signals

3830
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:26,050
are both signals the two main signals
 

3831
01:19:26,050 --> 01:19:29,910
are both signals the two main signals
are to do with black holes one of them

3832
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
are to do with black holes one of them
 

3833
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,160
are to do with black holes one of them
is the collisions between black holes

3834
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:32,170
is the collisions between black holes
 

3835
01:19:32,170 --> 01:19:35,340
is the collisions between black holes
and as they spiral into each other they

3836
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:35,350
and as they spiral into each other they
 

3837
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:37,380
and as they spiral into each other they
release a lot of energy in the form of

3838
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:37,390
release a lot of energy in the form of
 

3839
01:19:37,390 --> 01:19:39,990
release a lot of energy in the form of
gravitational waves those gravitational

3840
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000
gravitational waves those gravitational
 

3841
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,260
gravitational waves those gravitational
waves get through in a certain form into

3842
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:43,270
waves get through in a certain form into
 

3843
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,360

the next DM that's fascinating that

3844
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:45,370
the next DM that's fascinating that
 

3845
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:48,060
the next DM that's fascinating that
there's some I mean maybe I'm maybe you

3846
01:19:48,060 --> 01:19:48,070
there's some I mean maybe I'm maybe you
 

3847
01:19:48,070 --> 01:19:49,200
there's some I mean maybe I'm maybe you
can correct me if I'm wrong but that

3848
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,210
can correct me if I'm wrong but that
 

3849
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:51,030
can correct me if I'm wrong but that
means that some information can travel

3850
01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:51,040
means that some information can travel
 

3851
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,230
means that some information can travel
yes from another eon exactly that that

3852
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:55,240
yes from another eon exactly that that
 

3853
01:19:55,240 --> 01:20:00,600
yes from another eon exactly that that
is fascinating I mean I've seen

3854
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:00,610
is fascinating I mean I've seen

01:20:00,610 --> 01:20:02,130
is fascinating I mean I've seen
somewhere described sort of the

somewhere described sort of the
 

3857
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,550

discussion of the Fermi paradox you know

3858
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:05,560
discussion of the Fermi paradox you know
 

3859
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:08,430
discussion of the Fermi paradox you know
that if there's intelligent life yes

3860
01:20:08,430 --> 01:20:08,440
that if there's intelligent life yes

Gossage on who I work with this on these
 

3869
01:20:18,790 --> 01:20:20,820
Gossage on who I work with this on these
ideas for a while we have a crazy paper

3870
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:20,830
ideas for a while we have a crazy paper
 

3871
01:20:20,830 --> 01:20:21,580
ideas for a while we have a crazy paper
on that yes

3872
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:21,590
on that yes
 

3873
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:24,700
on that yes
so the family paradoxes right so so if

3874
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:24,710
so the family paradoxes right so so if
 

3875
01:20:24,710 --> 01:20:26,320
so the family paradoxes right so so if
the universe is just cycling over and

3876
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:26,330
the universe is just cycling over and
 

3877
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:29,939
the universe is just cycling over and
over and over punctuated by have the

3878
01:20:29,939 --> 01:20:29,949
over and over punctuated by have the
 

3879
01:20:29,949 --> 01:20:31,959
over and over punctuated by have the
punctuated the singularity of the Big

punctuated the singularity of the Big
 

3881
01:20:31,969 --> 01:20:35,890

intelligent systems can communicate

3884
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:37,550
intelligent systems can communicate
 

3885
01:20:37,550 --> 01:20:40,330
intelligent systems can communicate
through from e on T on why haven't we

3886
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:40,340
through from e on T on why haven't we
 

3887
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:43,830
through from e on T on why haven't we
heard anything from our alien friends

3888
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
heard anything from our alien friends
 

3889
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:47,109
heard anything from our alien friends
because we don't know how to look that's

3890
01:20:47,109 --> 01:20:47,119
because we don't know how to look that's
 

3891
01:20:47,119 --> 01:20:49,149
because we don't know how to look that's
fundamentally the reason is we I don't

3892
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:49,159
fundamentally the reason is we I don't
 

3893
01:20:49,159 --> 01:20:51,129
fundamentally the reason is we I don't
know you see it's it's speculation I

3894
01:20:51,129 --> 01:20:51,139
know you see it's it's speculation I
 

3895
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:54,399
know you see it's it's speculation I
mean the SETI program was a reasonable

3896
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:54,409
mean the SETI program was a reasonable
 

3897
01:20:54,409 --> 01:20:57,040
mean the SETI program was a reasonable
thing to do but still speculation it's

3898
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:57,050
thing to do but still speculation it's
 

3899
01:20:57,050 --> 01:21:00,990
thing to do but still speculation it's
trying to say ok maybe not too far away

3900
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:01,000
trying to say ok maybe not too far away
 

3901
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,280
trying to say ok maybe not too far away
with a civilization which got there

3902
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:03,290
with a civilization which got there
 

3903
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:06,580
with a civilization which got there
first before us early enough that they

3904
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:06,590
first before us early enough that they
 

3905
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:09,520
first before us early enough that they
could send our signals but how far away

3906
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:09,530
could send our signals but how far away
 

3907
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:11,410
could send our signals but how far away
would you need to go before I mean I

3908
01:21:11,410 --> 01:21:11,420
would you need to go before I mean I
 

3909
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,120
would you need to go before I mean I
don't know we with so little knowledge

3910
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:13,130
don't know we with so little knowledge
 

3911

don't know we with so little knowledge
about that we haven't seen any signals

about that we haven't seen any signals
yet but it's worth looking it's worth

01:22:08,119 --> 01:22:11,020
yes what to you is the most beautiful
idea in physics or mathematics or the

idea in physics or mathematics or the
 

3957
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:15,160
idea in physics or mathematics or the
art at the intersection of the two I'm

3958
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:15,170
art at the intersection of the two I'm
 

3959
01:22:15,170 --> 01:22:17,879
art at the intersection of the two I'm
going to have to say complex analysis I

3960
01:22:17,879 --> 01:22:17,889
going to have to say complex analysis I
 

3961
01:22:17,889 --> 01:22:20,890
going to have to say complex analysis I
might have said infinities and one of

3962
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:20,900
might have said infinities and one of
 

3963
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,140
might have said infinities and one of
the most single most beautiful idea I

3964
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:23,150
the most single most beautiful idea I
 

3965
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:24,510
the most single most beautiful idea I
think was the fact that you can even

3966
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:24,520
think was the fact that you can even
 

3967
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,800
think was the fact that you can even
infinities of different sizes and so on

3968
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:26,810
infinities of different sizes and so on
 

3969
01:22:26,810 --> 01:22:30,250
infinities of different sizes and so on
but that's anyway I think complex

3970
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:30,260
but that's anyway I think complex
 

3971
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,990
but that's anyway I think complex
analysis this goes it's got so much

3972
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
analysis this goes it's got so much
 

3973
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,600
analysis this goes it's got so much
magic in it it's a very simple idea

3974
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:35,610
magic in it it's a very simple idea
 

3975
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:39,240
magic in it it's a very simple idea
you take these you guys hope you do you

3976
01:22:39,240 --> 01:22:39,250
you take these you guys hope you do you
 

3977
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:41,220
you take these you guys hope you do you
take numbers you take the integers and

3978
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:41,230
take numbers you take the integers and
 

3979
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,020
take numbers you take the integers and
then you fill them up into the fractions

3980
01:22:43,020 --> 01:22:43,030
then you fill them up into the fractions
 

3981
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:45,240
then you fill them up into the fractions
and the real numbers you imagine you're

3982
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:45,250
and the real numbers you imagine you're
 

3983
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:47,250
and the real numbers you imagine you're
trying to measure a continuous line and

3984
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:47,260
trying to measure a continuous line and
 

3985
01:22:47,260 --> 01:22:49,710
trying to measure a continuous line and
then you think of how you can solve

3986
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:49,720
then you think of how you can solve
 

3987
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,230
then you think of how you can solve
equations then what about x squared

3988
01:22:52,230 --> 01:22:52,240
equations then what about x squared
 

3989
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:55,170
equations then what about x squared
equals minus 1 well there's no real

3990
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:55,180
equals minus 1 well there's no real
 

3991
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,600

number which has to satisfies that so

3992
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:57,610
number which has to satisfies that so
 

3993
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,130
number which has to satisfies that so
you have to think of well there's a

3994
01:22:59,130 --> 01:22:59,140
you have to think of well there's a
 

3995
01:22:59,140 --> 01:23:02,190
you have to think of well there's a
number called I you think you invent it

3996
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:02,200
number called I you think you invent it
 

3997
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:03,900
number called I you think you invent it
well in a certain sense it's there

3998
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:03,910
well in a certain sense it's there
 

3999
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:06,450
well in a certain sense it's there
already but this number when you add

4000
01:23:06,450 --> 01:23:06,460
already but this number when you add
 

4001
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:08,400
already but this number when you add
that square root of minus 1 to it you

4002
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:08,410
that square root of minus 1 to it you
 

4003
01:23:08,410 --> 01:23:10,110
that square root of minus 1 to it you
have what's called the complex numbers

4004
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:10,120
have what's called the complex numbers
 

4005
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:14,100
have what's called the complex numbers
and they're an incredible system if you

4006
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:14,110
and they're an incredible system if you
 

4007
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,990
and they're an incredible system if you
like you put one little thing in you put

4008
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,000
like you put one little thing in you put
 

4009
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,630
like you put one little thing in you put
square root of -1 in and you get how

4010
01:23:18,630 --> 01:23:18,640
square root of -1 in and you get how
 

4011
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:21,240
square root of -1 in and you get how
much benefit out of it all sorts of

4012
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:21,250
much benefit out of it all sorts of
 

4013
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:22,710
much benefit out of it all sorts of
things that you'd never imagined before

4014
01:23:22,710 --> 01:23:22,720
things that you'd never imagined before
 

4015
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,780
things that you'd never imagined before
and it's that amazing or hiding there in

4016
01:23:27,780 --> 01:23:27,790
and it's that amazing or hiding there in
 

4017
01:23:27,790 --> 01:23:30,390
and it's that amazing or hiding there in
putting that square root of -1 in so in

4018
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:30,400
putting that square root of -1 in so in
 

4019
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,190
putting that square root of -1 in so in
the sense that's the most magical thing

4020
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:32,200
the sense that's the most magical thing
 

4021
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,110
the sense that's the most magical thing
I've seen in mathematics or physics and

I've seen in mathematics or physics and
 

4023
01:23:34,120 --> 01:23:36,090
I've seen in mathematics or physics and
it's in quantum mechanics and in quantum

01:23:36,090 --> 01:23:36,100
it's in quantum mechanics and in quantum
 

4025
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:38,430
it's in quantum mechanics and in quantum
mechanics for there already you might

mechanics for there already you might
 

4027
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,170

think what's it doing there ok just a

4028
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:40,180
think what's it doing there ok just a
 

4029
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:41,730
think what's it doing there ok just a
nice beautiful piece of mathematics and

4030
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:41,740
nice beautiful piece of mathematics and
 

4031
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,700
nice beautiful piece of mathematics and
then suddenly we say nope it's the very

4032
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:44,710
then suddenly we say nope it's the very
 

4033
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:47,550
then suddenly we say nope it's the very
crucial basis of quantum mechanics so on

4034
01:23:47,550 --> 01:23:47,560
crucial basis of quantum mechanics so on
 

4035
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:49,740
crucial basis of quantum mechanics so on
there and the way the world works so on

4036
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:49,750
there and the way the world works so on
 

4037
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,060
there and the way the world works so on
the question of whether math is

4038
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:51,070
the question of whether math is
 

4039
01:23:51,070 --> 01:23:53,400
the question of whether math is
discovered or invented it sounds like

4040
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:53,410
discovered or invented it sounds like
 

4041
01:23:53,410 --> 01:23:55,470
discovered or invented it sounds like
you may be suggesting that partially as

4042
01:23:55,470 --> 01:23:55,480
you may be suggesting that partially as
 

4043
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,720
you may be suggesting that partially as
possible the math is indeed discovered

4044
01:23:57,720 --> 01:23:57,730
possible the math is indeed discovered
 

4045
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:00,270
possible the math is indeed discovered
oh absolutely yes no it's more like

4046
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:00,280
oh absolutely yes no it's more like
 

4047
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:03,020
oh absolutely yes no it's more like
archeology than you might think

4048
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:03,030
archeology than you might think
 

4049
01:24:03,030 --> 01:24:06,720
archeology than you might think
so let me ask the most ridiculous maybe

4050
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:06,730
so let me ask the most ridiculous maybe
 

4051
01:24:06,730 --> 01:24:09,540
so let me ask the most ridiculous maybe
the most important question what is the

4052
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:09,550
the most important question what is the
 

4053
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:13,380
the most important question what is the
meaning of life what gives your life

4054
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:13,390
meaning of life what gives your life
 

4055
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:15,720
meaning of life what gives your life
fulfillment purpose happiness and

4056
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:15,730
fulfillment purpose happiness and
 

4057
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:17,010
fulfillment purpose happiness and
meaning why do you think we're here on

4058
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:17,020
meaning why do you think we're here on
 

4059
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,530
meaning why do you think we're here on
this given all the Big Bang and the

4060
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:19,540
this given all the Big Bang and the
 

4061
01:24:19,540 --> 01:24:21,780
this given all the Big Bang and the
infinities of photons that we've told I

4062
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:21,790
infinities of photons that we've told I
 

4063
01:24:21,790 --> 01:24:23,490
infinities of photons that we've told I
would say I think it's not a stupid

4064
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:23,500
would say I think it's not a stupid
 

4065
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:27,540
would say I think it's not a stupid
question I mean there are some people

4066
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:27,550
question I mean there are some people
 

4067
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:29,190
question I mean there are some people
you know many of my colleagues new

4068
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:29,200
you know many of my colleagues new
 

4069
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,720
you know many of my colleagues new
scientists they say well that's a stupid

4070
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:30,730
scientists they say well that's a stupid
 

4071
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,460
scientists they say well that's a stupid
question meaning yeah well we just hear

4072
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:32,470
question meaning yeah well we just hear
 

4073
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:34,800
question meaning yeah well we just hear
because things came together and produce

4074
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:34,810
because things came together and produce
 

4075
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:38,280
because things came together and produce
life and so what I think there's more to

4076
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:38,290
life and so what I think there's more to
 

4077
01:24:38,290 --> 01:24:41,300
life and so what I think there's more to
it but what there is that's more to it

4078
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:41,310
it but what there is that's more to it
 

4079
01:24:41,310 --> 01:24:43,830
it but what there is that's more to it
really much idea it might be somehow

4080
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:43,840
really much idea it might be somehow
 

4081
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:45,480
really much idea it might be somehow
connected to the mechanisms of

4082
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:45,490
connected to the mechanisms of
 

4083
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,310
connected to the mechanisms of
consciousness though we're talking about

4084
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:47,320
consciousness though we're talking about
 

4085
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,660
consciousness though we're talking about
the mystery there

4086
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:48,670
the mystery there
 

4087
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,970
the mystery there
it's connected with all sortsa yeah I

4088
01:24:50,970 --> 01:24:50,980
it's connected with all sortsa yeah I
 

4089
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:52,770
it's connected with all sortsa yeah I
think these things are tied up in ways

4090
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:52,780
think these things are tied up in ways
 

4091
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:55,740
think these things are tied up in ways
which er you see I tend to think the

4092
01:24:55,740 --> 01:24:55,750
which er you see I tend to think the
 

4093
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:57,800
which er you see I tend to think the
mystery of consciousness is tied up with

4094
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:57,810
mystery of consciousness is tied up with
 

4095
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:01,350
mystery of consciousness is tied up with
the mystery of quantum mechanics and how

4096
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:01,360
the mystery of quantum mechanics and how
 

4097
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:04,050
the mystery of quantum mechanics and how
it fits in with the classical world and

4098
01:25:04,050 --> 01:25:04,060
it fits in with the classical world and
 

4099
01:25:04,060 --> 01:25:05,370
it fits in with the classical world and
that's all to do with the mystery of

4100
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:05,380
that's all to do with the mystery of
 

4101
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,880
that's all to do with the mystery of
quantum of complex numbers and there are

4102
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:08,890
quantum of complex numbers and there are
 

4103
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:11,460
quantum of complex numbers and there are
mysteries there which I look like

4104
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:11,470
mysteries there which I look like
 

4105
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:15,000
mysteries there which I look like
mathematical mysteries but they seem to

4106
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,010
mathematical mysteries but they seem to
 

4107
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,620
mathematical mysteries but they seem to
have a bearing on the way the physical

4108
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:16,630
have a bearing on the way the physical
 

4109
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:19,380
have a bearing on the way the physical
world operates we're scratching the

4110
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:19,390
world operates we're scratching the
 

4111
01:25:19,390 --> 01:25:22,800
world operates we're scratching the
surface we have a long huge way to go

4112
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:22,810
surface we have a long huge way to go
 

4113
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:24,840
surface we have a long huge way to go
before we really understand that and

4114
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:24,850
before we really understand that and
 

4115
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:27,630
before we really understand that and
it's a beautiful idea that the the the

4116
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:27,640
it's a beautiful idea that the the the
 

4117
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:29,580
it's a beautiful idea that the the the
depth the mathematical depth could be

4118
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:29,590
depth the mathematical depth could be
 

4119
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:32,160
depth the mathematical depth could be
discovered and then there's tragedies of

4120
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:32,170
discovered and then there's tragedies of
 

4121
01:25:32,170 --> 01:25:34,170
discovered and then there's tragedies of
Gaydos and completeness along the way

4122
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:34,180
Gaydos and completeness along the way
 

4123
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:35,730
Gaydos and completeness along the way
they will have to somehow figure our

4124
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:35,740
they will have to somehow figure our
 

4125
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:40,650
they will have to somehow figure our
ways around yeah so Roger as a huge

4126
