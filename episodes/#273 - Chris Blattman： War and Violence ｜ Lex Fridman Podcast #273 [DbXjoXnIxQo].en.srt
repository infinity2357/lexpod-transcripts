00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,869
say let's hold out individual violence
which has a lot in common but but

170
00:03:00,869 --> 00:03:00,879
which has a lot in common but but
 

171
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,710
which has a lot in common but but
individuals

172
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
individuals
 

173
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,030
individuals
choose to engage in violence for

174
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
choose to engage in violence for
 

175
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,869
choose to engage in violence for
more and sometimes different reasons so

176
00:03:06,869 --> 00:03:06,879
more and sometimes different reasons so
 

177
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,710
more and sometimes different reasons so
let's just put that aside

178
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
let's just put that aside
 

179
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,869
let's just put that aside
so that we can focus a bit and let's

180
00:03:10,869 --> 00:03:10,879
so that we can focus a bit and let's
 

181
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,190
so that we can focus a bit and let's
really put aside short incidents of

182
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:13,200
really put aside short incidents of
 

183
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,830
really put aside short incidents of
violence because those might have the

184
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:15,840
violence because those might have the
 

185
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,070
violence because those might have the
same kind of things explaining them but

186
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
same kind of things explaining them but
 

187
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,270
same kind of things explaining them but
actually there's a lot of other things

188
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,280
actually there's a lot of other things
 

189
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,790
actually there's a lot of other things
that can explain short violence short

190
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
that can explain short violence short
 

191
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,030
that can explain short violence short
violence can be really

192
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
violence can be really
 

193
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,990
violence can be really
uh

194
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
uh
 

195
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,910
uh
demonstrative like you can just i can

196
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
demonstrative like you can just i can
 

197
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,910
demonstrative like you can just i can
use it to communicate information

198
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:27,920
use it to communicate information
 

199
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,430
use it to communicate information
the thing that all of it has in common

200
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,440
the thing that all of it has in common
 

201
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,190
the thing that all of it has in common
is that it doesn't generally make sense

202
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
is that it doesn't generally make sense
 

203
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,949
is that it doesn't generally make sense
it's not your best option most of the

204
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:32,959
it's not your best option most of the
 

205
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,830
it's not your best option most of the
time

206
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
time
 

207
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,229
time
and so i wanted to say let's take this

208
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
and so i wanted to say let's take this
 

209
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,550
and so i wanted to say let's take this
thing that should be puzzling we kind of

210
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
thing that should be puzzling we kind of
 

211
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,070
thing that should be puzzling we kind of
think it's normal we kind of think this

212
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:40,080
think it's normal we kind of think this
 

213
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,070
think it's normal we kind of think this
is what all humans do

214
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,080
is what all humans do
 

215
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,509
is what all humans do
but let's point out that it's not normal

216
00:03:45,509 --> 00:03:45,519
but let's point out that it's not normal
 

217
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,789
but let's point out that it's not normal
and then figure out why and let's talk

218
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
and then figure out why and let's talk
 

219
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,309
and then figure out why and let's talk
about why and so that's so i was trying

220
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
about why and so that's so i was trying
 

221
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,309
about why and so that's so i was trying
to throw out the the short violence i

222
00:03:50,309 --> 00:03:50,319
to throw out the the short violence i
 

223
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,630
to throw out the the short violence i
was trying to throw out the individual

224
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:52,640
was trying to throw out the individual
 

225
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,390
was trying to throw out the individual
violence i was also trying to throw out

226
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
violence i was also trying to throw out
 

227
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,830
violence i was also trying to throw out
all the

228
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
all the
 

229
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,350
all the
competition that happens that's not

230
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
competition that happens that's not
 

231
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,789
competition that happens that's not
violent that's that's the normal normal

232
00:03:58,789 --> 00:03:58,799
violent that's that's the normal normal
 

233
00:03:58,799 --> 00:03:59,990
violent that's that's the normal normal
competition i was trying to say let's

234
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
competition i was trying to say let's
 

235
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,429
competition i was trying to say let's
talk about violent competition because

236
00:04:01,429 --> 00:04:01,439
talk about violent competition because
 

237
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,750
talk about violent competition because
that's kind of the puzzle

238
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
that's kind of the puzzle
 

239
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,589
that's kind of the puzzle
so that's really interesting you said

240
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:05,599
so that's really interesting you said
 

241
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,270
so that's really interesting you said
usually

242
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:07,280
usually
 

243
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,350
usually
people try to find a narrow definition

244
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:09,360
people try to find a narrow definition
 

245
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,270
people try to find a narrow definition
and you said progress so you make

246
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
and you said progress so you make
 

247
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,589
and you said progress so you make
progress by finding a narrow definition

248
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
progress by finding a narrow definition
 

249
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,150
progress by finding a narrow definition
for example of military conflict

250
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
for example of military conflict
 

251
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,629
for example of military conflict
in a particular context yeah and

252
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
in a particular context yeah and
 

253
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,229
in a particular context yeah and
progress means

254
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
progress means
 

255
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,990
progress means
all right well how do we prevent this

256
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,000
all right well how do we prevent this
 

257
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,390
all right well how do we prevent this
particular kind of military conflict or

258
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:24,400
particular kind of military conflict or
 

259
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,710
particular kind of military conflict or
maybe if it's already happening how do

260
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
maybe if it's already happening how do
 

261
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,749
maybe if it's already happening how do
we de-escalate it and how do we solve it

262
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
we de-escalate it and how do we solve it
 

263
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,749
we de-escalate it and how do we solve it
so from a geopolitics perspective from

264
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
so from a geopolitics perspective from
 

265
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,909
so from a geopolitics perspective from
an economics perspective and you're

266
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
an economics perspective and you're
 

267
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,550
an economics perspective and you're
looking for a definition of war that is

268
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
looking for a definition of war that is
 

269
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,790
looking for a definition of war that is
as broad as possible

270
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
as broad as possible
 

271
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,590
as broad as possible
but

272
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
but
 

273
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,749
but
not so broad that you cannot achieve a

274
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:41,759
not so broad that you cannot achieve a
 

275
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,629
not so broad that you cannot achieve a
deep level of understanding of why it

276
00:04:44,629 --> 00:04:44,639
deep level of understanding of why it
 

277
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,710
deep level of understanding of why it
happens and how it can be avoided

278
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
happens and how it can be avoided
 

279
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,790
happens and how it can be avoided
right and a comment basically like

280
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:48,800
right and a comment basically like
 

281
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,510
right and a comment basically like
recognize that common principles govern

282
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,520
recognize that common principles govern
 

283
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,749
recognize that common principles govern
some kinds of behavior that look

284
00:04:53,749 --> 00:04:53,759
some kinds of behavior that look
 

285
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,390
some kinds of behavior that look
pretty different like an indian ethnic

286
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
pretty different like an indian ethnic
 

287
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,070
pretty different like an indian ethnic
riot

288
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
riot
 

289
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,430
riot
is obviously pretty different than

290
00:04:59,430 --> 00:04:59,440
is obviously pretty different than
 

291
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,629
is obviously pretty different than
invading a neighboring country right but

292
00:05:02,629 --> 00:05:02,639
invading a neighboring country right but
 

293
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,990
invading a neighboring country right but
uh and that's pretty different than two

294
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,000
uh and that's pretty different than two
 

295
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,670
uh and that's pretty different than two
villages or two gangs a lot of what i

296
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
villages or two gangs a lot of what i
 

297
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,510
villages or two gangs a lot of what i
work on is studying organized criminals

298
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:07,520
work on is studying organized criminals
 

299
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,710
work on is studying organized criminals
and gangs two gangs going to where you

300
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
and gangs two gangs going to where you
 

301
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,150
and gangs two gangs going to where you
think is really different and and of

302
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
think is really different and and of
 

303
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,749
think is really different and and of
course it is but

304
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
course it is but
 

305
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,870
course it is but
but there are some like common

306
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
but there are some like common
 

307
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,990
but there are some like common
principles you can just think about

308
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,000
principles you can just think about
 

309
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,310
principles you can just think about
conflict and the use of violence

310
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:16,320
conflict and the use of violence
 

311
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,670
conflict and the use of violence
and um

312
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
and um
 

313
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,029
and um
and not learn everything but just get a

314
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:19,039
and not learn everything but just get a
 

315
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,270
and not learn everything but just get a
lot just get really really far by sort

316
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,280
lot just get really really far by sort
 

317
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,790
lot just get really really far by sort
of seeing the commonalities rather than

318
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
of seeing the commonalities rather than
 

319
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,390
of seeing the commonalities rather than
just focusing on the differences so

320
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
just focusing on the differences so
 

321
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,830
just focusing on the differences so
again those words are prolonged groups

322
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:27,840
again those words are prolonged groups
 

323
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,150
again those words are prolonged groups
and violent can you maybe linger on each

324
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:30,160
and violent can you maybe linger on each
 

325
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,550
and violent can you maybe linger on each
of those words what is prolonged mean

326
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
of those words what is prolonged mean
 

327
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,110
of those words what is prolonged mean
what's where's the line between short

328
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,120
what's where's the line between short
 

329
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,670
what's where's the line between short
and long what does groups mean

330
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
and long what does groups mean
 

331
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,749
and long what does groups mean

figure out a way to split that pie and
 

489
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,309
figure out a way to split that pie and
you could use violence

490
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:14,319
you could use violence
 

491
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,990

00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
like if you're nap like if you start a
 

495
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,830
like if you're nap like if you start a
war one you know there's lots of risks

496
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:19,840
war one you know there's lots of risks

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,150
war one you know there's lots of risks
you could get killed that's not good

498
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:22,160
you could get killed that's not good
 

499
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,589
you could get killed that's not good
uh you could kill somebody else and go

500
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
uh you could kill somebody else and go
 

501
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,950
uh you could kill somebody else and go
to jail which is what happened to him

502
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:24,960
to jail which is what happened to him
 

503
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,189
to jail which is what happened to him
that's not good uh your soldiers get

504
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
that's not good uh your soldiers get
 

505
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,950
that's not good uh your soldiers get
killed no one's buying your drugs in the

506
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:28,960
killed no one's buying your drugs in the
 

507
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,550
killed no one's buying your drugs in the
middle of a gunfight so it interrupts

508
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
middle of a gunfight so it interrupts
 

509
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,310
middle of a gunfight so it interrupts
your business and so on and on like it's

510
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
your business and so on and on like it's
 

511
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,269
your business and so on and on like it's
really miserable this is what we're

512
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:33,279
really miserable this is what we're
 

513
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,110
really miserable this is what we're
seeing right now you know as we're

514
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:35,120
seeing right now you know as we're
 

515
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,469
seeing right now you know as we're
recording you know the

516
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
recording you know the
 

517
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,070
recording you know the
russian invasion of ukraine is now its

518
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,080
russian invasion of ukraine is now its
 

519
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,029
russian invasion of ukraine is now its
fourth or fifth week everybody's

520
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
fourth or fifth week everybody's
 

521
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,870
fourth or fifth week everybody's
if it didn't dawn on them before it's

522
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:42,880
if it didn't dawn on them before it's
 

523
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,590
if it didn't dawn on them before it's
dawned on them now just how brutal and

524
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
dawned on them now just how brutal and
 

525
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,030
dawned on them now just how brutal and
costly this is

526
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
costly this is
 

527
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,590
costly this is
as you describe for everybody so

528
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
as you describe for everybody so
 

529
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,070
as you describe for everybody so
everybody is losing in this war yeah i

530
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,080
everybody is losing in this war yeah i
 

531
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,509
everybody is losing in this war yeah i
mean that's maybe the inside everybody

532
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:53,519
mean that's maybe the inside everybody
 

533
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,990
mean that's maybe the inside everybody
loses something from war

534
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,000
loses something from war
 

535
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,790
loses something from war
and

536
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
and
 

537
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,110
and
there was usually not always but this

538
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
there was usually not always but this
 

539
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,350
there was usually not always but this
the point is there was usually a way to

540
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
the point is there was usually a way to
 

541
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,230
the point is there was usually a way to
get

542
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,240
get
 

543
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,630
get
what you wanted or be better off without

544
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
what you wanted or be better off without
 

545
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,389
what you wanted or be better off without
having to fight over it so there's this

546
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:06,399
having to fight over it so there's this
 

547
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,389
having to fight over it so there's this
it's just fighting is just

548
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
it's just fighting is just
 

549
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,470
it's just fighting is just
politics by other means and it's just

550
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:10,480
politics by other means and it's just
 

551
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,829
politics by other means and it's just
inefficient

552
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
inefficient
 

553
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,509
inefficient
costly brutal

554
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
costly brutal
 

555
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,350
costly brutal
devastating means and so that's like the

556
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:15,360
devastating means and so that's like the
 

557
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,110
devastating means and so that's like the
deep insight and so i kind of wanted to

558
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
deep insight and so i kind of wanted to
 

559
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,550
deep insight and so i kind of wanted to
say um so so i guess like what's not war

560
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
say um so so i guess like what's not war
 

561
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,470
say um so so i guess like what's not war
and i mean i don't i don't want i don't

562
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:22,480
and i mean i don't i don't want i don't
 

563
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,829
and i mean i don't i don't want i don't
try to belabor the definitions because

564
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:23,839
try to belabor the definitions because
 

565
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,070
try to belabor the definitions because
some some you know there's

566
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
some some you know there's
 

567
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,350
some some you know there's
reams and reams of political science

568
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:27,360
reams and reams of political science

what's not award
 

573
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,150
what's not award
people disagree

574
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
people disagree
 

575
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,590
people disagree
uh

576
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
uh
 

577
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,470
uh
the

578
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:34,480
the
 

579
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,030
the
i just wanted to say war is the thing

580
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:37,040
i just wanted to say war is the thing
 

581
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,389
i just wanted to say war is the thing
that we shouldn't be doing or where's

582
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
that we shouldn't be doing or where's
 

583
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,790
that we shouldn't be doing or where's
the violence that doesn't make sense

584
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:40,800
the violence that doesn't make sense
 

585
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,389
the violence that doesn't make sense
there's a whole bunch of other violence

586
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:42,399
there's a whole bunch of other violence
 

587
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,430
there's a whole bunch of other violence
including

588
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:43,440
including
 

589
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,030
including
gang banging and skirmishes and things

590
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
gang banging and skirmishes and things
 

591
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,630
gang banging and skirmishes and things
that might make sense

592
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:46,640
that might make sense
 

593
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,630
that might make sense
uh precisely because they're cheap ways

594
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:48,640
uh precisely because they're cheap ways
 

595
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,269
uh precisely because they're cheap ways
of communicating or their their way

596
00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:51,279
of communicating or their their way
 

597
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,230
of communicating or their their way
they're

598
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
they're
 

599
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,910
they're
they're not particularly costly where's

600
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:53,920
they're not particularly costly where's
 

601
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,190
they're not particularly costly where's
the thing that's just so costly we

602
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:55,200
the thing that's just so costly we
 

603
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,630
the thing that's just so costly we
should be trying to avoid is maybe like

604
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
should be trying to avoid is maybe like
 

605
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,110
should be trying to avoid is maybe like
the meta way i think about it

606
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
the meta way i think about it
 

607
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,069
the meta way i think about it
right uh nevertheless definitions are

608
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
right uh nevertheless definitions are
 

609
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,110
right uh nevertheless definitions are
interesting so outside of the academic

610
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
interesting so outside of the academic
 

611
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,190
interesting so outside of the academic
bickering yeah every time you try to

612
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
bickering yeah every time you try to
 

613
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,790
bickering yeah every time you try to
define something i'm a big fan of it

614
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
define something i'm a big fan of it
 

615
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,430
define something i'm a big fan of it
the process illuminates

616
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:13,440
the process illuminates
 

617
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,030
the process illuminates
so the destination doesn't matter

618
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
so the destination doesn't matter
 

619
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,829
so the destination doesn't matter
because the moment you arrive at the

620
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
because the moment you arrive at the
 

621
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,470
because the moment you arrive at the
definition um you lose the power

622
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:20,480
definition um you lose the power
 

623
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,750
definition um you lose the power
yeah one of the interesting things i

624
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:21,760
yeah one of the interesting things i
 

625
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,350
yeah one of the interesting things i
mean so people you know if you want to

626
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
mean so people you know if you want to
 

627
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,110
mean so people you know if you want to
do you know some of what i do is just

628
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,120
do you know some of what i do is just
 

629
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,670
do you know some of what i do is just
quantitative analysis of conflict and

630
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:27,680
quantitative analysis of conflict and
 

631
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,350
quantitative analysis of conflict and
and if you want to do that if you want

632
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:29,360
and if you want to do that if you want
 

633
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,269
and if you want to do that if you want
to sort of run statistics on war then

634
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:31,279
to sort of run statistics on war then
 

635
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,350
to sort of run statistics on war then
you have to code it all up and and then

636
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:33,360
you have to code it all up and and then
 

637
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,389
you have to code it all up and and then
lots of people have done that there's

638
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
lots of people have done that there's
 

639
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,550
lots of people have done that there's
four or five major data sets where

640
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:36,560
four or five major data sets where
 

641
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,710
four or five major data sets where
people or teams of people have over time

642
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
people or teams of people have over time
 

643
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,790
people or teams of people have over time
said we're going to code years of war

644
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
said we're going to code years of war
 

645
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,910
said we're going to code years of war
between these

646
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:41,920
between these
 

647
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,230
between these
groups or within a country and what's

648
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
groups or within a country and what's
 

649
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,790
groups or within a country and what's
interesting is how difficult these these

650
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
interesting is how difficult these these
 

651
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,310
interesting is how difficult these these
data sets don't often agree you have to

652
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
data sets don't often agree you have to
 

653
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,230
data sets don't often agree you have to
make all of these the decision gets

654
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
make all of these the decision gets
 

655
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,230
make all of these the decision gets
really complicated like when does the

656
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
really complicated like when does the
 

657
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,190
really complicated like when does the
war begin right does it does it begin

658
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:55,200
war begin right does it does it begin
 

659
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,030
war begin right does it does it begin
when a certain number of people have

660
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
when a certain number of people have
 

661
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,670
when a certain number of people have
been killed did it begin

662
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
been killed did it begin
 

663
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,190
been killed did it begin
did it what if there's like lots of

664
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:01,200
did it what if there's like lots of
 

665
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,949
did it what if there's like lots of
skirmishing and sort of like little

666
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
skirmishing and sort of like little
 

667
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,750
skirmishing and sort of like little
terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed

668
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed
 

669
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,630
terror attacks or a couple bombs lobbed
and then eventually turns into war do we

670
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:08,640
and then eventually turns into war do we
 

671
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,630
and then eventually turns into war do we
do we call that did do we back date it

672
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
do we call that did do we back date it
 

673
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,710
do we call that did do we back date it
to like when the first act of violence

674
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:12,720
to like when the first act of violence
 

675
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,389
to like when the first act of violence
started and then what do we do with all

676
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:14,399
started and then what do we do with all
 

677
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,910
started and then what do we do with all
the one the times when there was like

678
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
the one the times when there was like
 

679
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,550
the one the times when there was like
that low scale low intensity violence or

680
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
that low scale low intensity violence or
 

681
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,470
that low scale low intensity violence or
lob bombs lobbed and

682
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
lob bombs lobbed and
 

683
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,870
lob bombs lobbed and
do we do we call those wars but or maybe

684
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
do we do we call those wars but or maybe
 

685
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,310
do we do we call those wars but or maybe
only if they eventually get worse like

686
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
only if they eventually get worse like
 

687
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,710
only if they eventually get worse like
so you get it actually is really tricky

688
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
so you get it actually is really tricky
 

689
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,550
so you get it actually is really tricky
and the defense on the offensive aspect

690
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:28,560
and the defense on the offensive aspect
 

691
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,069
and the defense on the offensive aspect
so everybody

692
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
so everybody
 

693
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:32,710
so everybody
uh hitler in world war ii

694
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:32,720
uh hitler in world war ii
 

695
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,870
uh hitler in world war ii
it seems like he never attacked anybody

696
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:34,880
it seems like he never attacked anybody
 

697
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,069
it seems like he never attacked anybody
he's always defending against the unjust

698
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
he's always defending against the unjust
 

699
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,150
he's always defending against the unjust
attack of everybody else as he's taking

700
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,160
attack of everybody else as he's taking
 

701
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,310
attack of everybody else as he's taking
over the world so that's like

702
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:42,320
over the world so that's like
 

703
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,470
over the world so that's like
information propaganda

704
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:44,480
information propaganda
 

705
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,030
information propaganda
that every side is trying to communicate

706
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
that every side is trying to communicate
 

707
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,790
that every side is trying to communicate
to the world so you can't listen to

708
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
to the world so you can't listen to
 

709
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,350
to the world so you can't listen to
necessarily information like self-report

710
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
necessarily information like self-report
 

711
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,150
necessarily information like self-report
data you have to kind of look past that

712
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,160
data you have to kind of look past that
 

713
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,470
data you have to kind of look past that
somehow maybe look especially in the

714
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
somehow maybe look especially in the
 

715
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,069
somehow maybe look especially in the
modern world as much as possible at the

716
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
modern world as much as possible at the
 

717
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,670
modern world as much as possible at the
data how many

718
00:11:59,670 --> 00:11:59,680
data how many
 

719
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,190
data how many
bombs dropped

720
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
bombs dropped
 

721
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,190
bombs dropped
how many people killed

722
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,200
how many people killed
 

723
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,350
how many people killed
how the number of the estimates of the

724
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
how the number of the estimates of the
 

725
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,190
how the number of the estimates of the
number of troops moved from one location

726
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
number of troops moved from one location
 

727
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,110
number of troops moved from one location
to another and that kind of thing and

728
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:09,120
to another and that kind of thing and
 

729
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,389
to another and that kind of thing and
then the other interesting thing is

730
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
then the other interesting thing is
 

731
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,750
then the other interesting thing is
there's um

732
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
there's um
 

733
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,069
there's um
quantitative analysis of war so for

734
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
quantitative analysis of war so for
 

735
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,030
quantitative analysis of war so for
example i was looking at just war index

736
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,040
example i was looking at just war index
 

737
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,829
example i was looking at just war index
or people trying to measure

738
00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:19,839
or people trying to measure
 

739
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,590
or people trying to measure
trying to put a number

740
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:21,600
trying to put a number
 

741
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,790
trying to put a number
on what wars are seen as just and not oh

742
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:24,800
on what wars are seen as just and not oh
 

743
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,310
on what wars are seen as just and not oh
really i've never seen that

744
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:26,320
really i've never seen that
 

745
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,190
really i've never seen that
it's

746
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:27,200
it's
 

747
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,269
it's
there there's numbers behind it it's

748
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
there there's numbers behind it it's
 

749
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,389
there there's numbers behind it it's
great

750
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
great
 

751
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,430
great
so it's great because again as you do an

752
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
so it's great because again as you do an
 

753
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,670
so it's great because again as you do an
extensive

quantification of justice

756
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:38,560
quantification of justice
 

757
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,389
quantification of justice
you start to think

758
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
you start to think
 

759
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,430
you start to think
what actually contributes to our

760
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:43,440
what actually contributes to our
 

761
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,190
what actually contributes to our
thought that for example world war ii is

762
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
thought that for example world war ii is
 

763
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,550
thought that for example world war ii is
a just war and other wars are not

764
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:48,560
a just war and other wars are not
 

765
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,910
a just war and other wars are not
um a lot of it is about intent and some

766
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:51,920
um a lot of it is about intent and some
 

767
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,910
um a lot of it is about intent and some
of the other factors like that you look

768
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:53,920
of the other factors like that you look
 

769
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,230
of the other factors like that you look
at which is prolonged the degree of

770
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
at which is prolonged the degree of
 

771
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,310
at which is prolonged the degree of
violence that is necessary

772
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
violence that is necessary
 

773
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,030
violence that is necessary
versus not necessary given

774
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
versus not necessary given
 

775
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,949
versus not necessary given
the greater good some measure of the

776
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:02,959
the greater good some measure of the
 

777
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,629
the greater good some measure of the
greater good of people all those kinds

778
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
greater good of people all those kinds
 

779
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,190
greater good of people all those kinds
of things the then there's reasons for

780
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
of things the then there's reasons for
 

781
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,069
of things the then there's reasons for
war

782
00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:08,079
war
 

783
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,430
war
you know looking

784
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:09,440
you know looking
 

785
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,069
you know looking
to free people or to

786
00:13:12,069 --> 00:13:12,079
to free people or to
 

787
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,949
to free people or to
stop a genocide versus

788
00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:14,959
stop a genocide versus
 

789
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,790
stop a genocide versus
uh conquering land all those kinds of

790
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
uh conquering land all those kinds of
 

791
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,389
uh conquering land all those kinds of
things and people tried to put a number

792
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
things and people tried to put a number
 

793
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,110
things and people tried to put a number
behind it and a lot based on i mean what

794
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
behind it and a lot based on i mean what
 

795
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,870
behind it and a lot based on i mean what
i'm trying to imagine is

i'm trying to imagine is
 

797
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,350
i'm trying to imagine is
i mean suppose i wake up and or is

moral sense thinks that something that
another group is doing is repugnant

808
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:37,760
another group is doing is repugnant
 

809
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,590
another group is doing is repugnant
i'm curious like are they evaluating

810
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:39,600
i'm curious like are they evaluating
 

811
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,870
i'm curious like are they evaluating
like the

812
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:40,880
like the
 

813
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,550
like the
validity of that claim or just the idea

814
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
validity of that claim or just the idea
 

815
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,230
validity of that claim or just the idea
that like well you said it was repugnant

816
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
that like well you said it was repugnant
 

817
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,990
that like well you said it was repugnant
you deeply believe that therefore it's

818
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
you deeply believe that therefore it's
 

819
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,389
you deeply believe that therefore it's
just i think uh now it could be

820
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:48,399
just i think uh now it could be
 

821
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,790
just i think uh now it could be
corrected on a lot of this but i think

822
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:50,800
corrected on a lot of this but i think
 

823
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,710
corrected on a lot of this but i think
this is always looking at wars after

824
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
this is always looking at wars after
 

825
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,069
this is always looking at wars after
they happened

826
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
they happened
 

827
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,230
they happened
so it's and trying to take a global

828
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
so it's and trying to take a global
 

829
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,910
so it's and trying to take a global
perspective from all

830
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:57,920
perspective from all
 

831
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,069
perspective from all
sort of a general survey of how people

832
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
sort of a general survey of how people
 

833
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,470
sort of a general survey of how people
perceive so you're not weighing

834
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:02,480
perceive so you're not weighing
 

835
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,230
perceive so you're not weighing
disproportionately the opinions of the

836
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,240
disproportionately the opinions of the
 

837
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,389
disproportionately the opinions of the
people who waged the war yeah

838
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:06,399
people who waged the war yeah
 

839
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,430
people who waged the war yeah
i mean i i kind of ended up dodging that

840
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,440
i mean i i kind of ended up dodging that
 

841
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,949
i mean i i kind of ended up dodging that
because

842
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
because
 

843
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,069
because
i mean

844
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
i mean
 

845
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,629
i mean
one is to just point out that wars

846
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
one is to just point out that wars
 

847
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,949
one is to just point out that wars
actually most wars aren't necessary and

848
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:16,959
actually most wars aren't necessary and
 

849
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,670
actually most wars aren't necessary and
so

850
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:17,680
so
 

851
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,949
so
in the sense that there's there's

852
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
in the sense that there's there's
 

853
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,150
in the sense that there's there's
another way to

854
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:20,160
another way to
 

855
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,670
another way to
get what you wanted

856
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:21,680
get what you wanted
 

857
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,710
get what you wanted
um

858
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:22,720
um
 

859
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,710
um
and so on on one level there's no just

860
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:24,720
and so on on one level there's no just
 

861
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,910
and so on on one level there's no just
war now that that's not true because

862
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:27,920
war now that that's not true because
 

863
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,590
war now that that's not true because
take an example like the u.s invasion

864
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
take an example like the u.s invasion
 

865
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,790
take an example like the u.s invasion
afghanistan

866
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
afghanistan
 

867
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,590
afghanistan
the united states has been attacked

868
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:33,600
the united states has been attacked
 

869
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,030
the united states has been attacked
uh there's a

870
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,040
uh there's a
 

871
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,189
uh there's a
culpable agent reliable evidence that

872
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
culpable agent reliable evidence that
 

873
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,030
culpable agent reliable evidence that
this is al-qaeda

874
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
this is al-qaeda
 

875
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,550
this is al-qaeda
they're being sheltered

876
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:40,560
they're being sheltered
 

877
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,110
they're being sheltered
by in afghanistan by the taliban

878
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,120
by in afghanistan by the taliban
 

879
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,350
by in afghanistan by the taliban
and then the taliban this is this is a

880
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:45,360
and then the taliban this is this is a
 

881
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,509
and then the taliban this is this is a
bit murky it seems that there was an

882
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
bit murky it seems that there was an
 

883
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,110
bit murky it seems that there was an
attempt to

884
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
attempt to
 

885
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,670
attempt to
say hand him over or else and and they

886
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:51,680
say hand him over or else and and they
 

887
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,030
say hand him over or else and and they
said no way

888
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
said no way
 

889
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,150
said no way
now you can make an argument that

890
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:56,160
now you can make an argument that
 

891
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,230
now you can make an argument that
invading and attacking is strategically

892
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
invading and attacking is strategically
 

893
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,670
invading and attacking is strategically
the right thing to do in terms of

894
00:14:59,670 --> 00:14:59,680
the right thing to do in terms of
 

895
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,550
the right thing to do in terms of
sending signals to your future enemies

896
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560
sending signals to your future enemies
 

897
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,230
sending signals to your future enemies
or you just if you think it's important

898
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,240
or you just if you think it's important
 

899
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,829
or you just if you think it's important
to bring someone to justice

900
00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:05,839
to bring someone to justice
 

901
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,910
to bring someone to justice
in this case al-qaeda then then you

902
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
in this case al-qaeda then then you
 

903
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,829
in this case al-qaeda then then you
maybe that's just war or that's a just

904
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:09,839
maybe that's just war or that's a just
 

905
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,870
maybe that's just war or that's a just
invasion

906
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:10,880
invasion
 

907
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,590
invasion
but it hinges on the fact that

908
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:13,600
but it hinges on the fact that
 

909
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,150
but it hinges on the fact that
the the other side just didn't do the

910
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:16,160
the the other side just didn't do the
 

911
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,430
the the other side just didn't do the
seemingly sensible thing which is say

912
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
seemingly sensible thing which is say
 

913
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,790
seemingly sensible thing which is say
okay we'll give them up

914
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:20,800
okay we'll give them up
 

915
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,750
okay we'll give them up
and uh and so so it was completely

916
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:23,760
and uh and so so it was completely
 

917
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,189
and uh and so so it was completely
avoidable

918
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
avoidable
 

919
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,030
avoidable
in one sense but if you believe and i

920
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
in one sense but if you believe and i
 

921
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,470
in one sense but if you believe and i
think it's probably true if you believe

922
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:28,480
think it's probably true if you believe
 

923
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,389
think it's probably true if you believe
that for their own

924
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
that for their own
 

925
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,269
that for their own
ideological and other reasons

926
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:33,279
ideological and other reasons
 

927
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,310
ideological and other reasons
um

928
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
um
 

929
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,470
um
you know mulomar in particular and

930
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
you know mulomar in particular and
 

931
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,470
you know mulomar in particular and
taliban in general decided we're not

932
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
taliban in general decided we're not
 

933
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,389
taliban in general decided we're not
going to do this

934
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
going to do this
 

935
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,110
going to do this
uh then then now you're not left with

936
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:43,120
uh then then now you're not left with
 

937
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,269
uh then then now you're not left with
very many good choices

938
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:45,279
very many good choices
 

939
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,870
very many good choices
uh and now i

940
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:46,880
uh and now i
 

941
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,470
uh and now i
you know i didn't want to talk about is

942
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:48,480
you know i didn't want to talk about is
 

943
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,389
you know i didn't want to talk about is
that a just war is that what's justice

944
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
that a just war is that what's justice
 

945
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,629
that a just war is that what's justice
or not i just wanted to point out that

946
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
or not i just wanted to point out that
 

947
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,150
or not i just wanted to point out that
like it one side's intransigence if

948
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
like it one side's intransigence if
 

949
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,590
like it one side's intransigence if
that's indeed what happened one side's

950
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
that's indeed what happened one side's
 

951
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,550
that's indeed what happened one side's
intransigent sort of maybe compels you

952
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
intransigent sort of maybe compels you
 

953
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,350
intransigent sort of maybe compels you
to

954
00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:01,360
to
 

955
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,030
to
basically eliminates all of the

956
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,040
basically eliminates all of the
 

957
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,550
basically eliminates all of the
reasonable bargains that you could be

958
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:04,560
reasonable bargains that you could be
 

959
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,069
reasonable bargains that you could be
satisfied with and now you're left with

960
00:16:06,069 --> 00:16:06,079
satisfied with and now you're left with
 

961
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:07,910
satisfied with and now you're left with
really no other strategic option but to

962
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
really no other strategic option but to
 

963
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,189
really no other strategic option but to
invade i think that's a slight

964
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
invade i think that's a slight
 

965
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,949
invade i think that's a slight
oversimplification but i think that

966
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
oversimplification but i think that
 

967
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,069
oversimplification but i think that
that's like

968
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:12,079
that's like
 

969
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,590
that's like
that's like one way to describe what

970
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:13,600
that's like one way to describe what
 

971
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,670
that's like one way to describe what
happened so your book is fascinating

972
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
happened so your book is fascinating
 

973
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,150
happened so your book is fascinating
your perspective on this is fascinating

974
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:18,160
your perspective on this is fascinating
 

975
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,590
your perspective on this is fascinating
i'll try to sort of play devil's

976
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:19,600
i'll try to sort of play devil's
 

977
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,829
i'll try to sort of play devil's
advocate at times to try to get a

978
00:16:21,829 --> 00:16:21,839
advocate at times to try to get a
 

979
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,150
advocate at times to try to get a
clarity but the thesis is that

980
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
clarity but the thesis is that
 

981
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,749
clarity but the thesis is that
war is costly

982
00:16:27,749 --> 00:16:27,759
war is costly
 

983
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,949
war is costly
usually costly for everybody so

984
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:30,959
usually costly for everybody so
 

985
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,550
usually costly for everybody so
that's what you mean when you say nobody

986
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
that's what you mean when you say nobody
 

987
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,269
that's what you mean when you say nobody
wants war because you're going to

988
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:35,279
wants war because you're going to
 

989
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,470
wants war because you're going to
from a game theoretical perspective

990
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:38,480
from a game theoretical perspective
 

991
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,670
from a game theoretical perspective
uh nobody wins

992
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
uh nobody wins
 

993
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,870
uh nobody wins
and so

994
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
and so
 

995
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,990
and so
war

996
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,000
war
 

997
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,110
war
is essentially a breakdown of reason a

998
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:47,120
is essentially a breakdown of reason a
 

999
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,829
is essentially a breakdown of reason a
breakdown of negotiation of healthy

1000
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:49,839
breakdown of negotiation of healthy
 

1001
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,230
breakdown of negotiation of healthy
communication or healthy operation of

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
communication or healthy operation of
 

1003
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,870
communication or healthy operation of
the world some kind of breakdown you

1004
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:54,880
the world some kind of breakdown you
 

1005
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,189
the world some kind of breakdown you
list all kinds of ways in which it

1006
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
list all kinds of ways in which it
 

1007
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,110
list all kinds of ways in which it
it breaks down but there's also

1008
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
it breaks down but there's also
 

1009
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,029
it breaks down but there's also
there's also human beings in this mix

1010
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:05,039
there's also human beings in this mix
 

1011
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,350
there's also human beings in this mix
and there is ideas of justice so for

doesn't serve me well on which wars were

1016
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,240
doesn't serve me well on which wars were
 

1017
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,230
doesn't serve me well on which wars were
seen as justice very very few in the

1018
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
seen as justice very very few in the
 

1019
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,870
seen as justice very very few in the
20th century of the many that have been

1020
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
20th century of the many that have been
 

1021
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,669
20th century of the many that have been
there

1022
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
there
 

1023
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,429
there
the the wars that were seen as just

1024
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
the the wars that were seen as just
 

1025
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,189
the the wars that were seen as just
first of all the most just war seen as

1026
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:21,199
first of all the most just war seen as
 

1027
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,590
first of all the most just war seen as
world war ii by far

1028
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
world war ii by far
 

1029
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,829
world war ii by far
um it's actually the only one

1030
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:25,839
um it's actually the only one
 

1031
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,390
um it's actually the only one
uh that goes above a threshold as seen

1032
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:28,400
uh that goes above a threshold as seen
 

1033
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,549
uh that goes above a threshold as seen
as just everything is seen as unjust

1034
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:30,559
as just everything is seen as unjust
 

1035
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,950
as just everything is seen as unjust
it's it's uh less

1036
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:32,960
it's it's uh less
 

1037
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,549
it's it's uh less
it's like degrees of unjustness

1038
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:36,559
it's like degrees of unjustness
 

1039
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,630
it's like degrees of unjustness
and i i think the ones that are seen as

1040
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:38,640
and i i think the ones that are seen as
 

1041
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,669
and i i think the ones that are seen as
more just are the ones that are fast

1042
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
more just are the ones that are fast
 

1043
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,909
more just are the ones that are fast
that you have a very specific purpose

1044
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
that you have a very specific purpose
 

1045
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,390
that you have a very specific purpose
you communicate that purpose honestly

1046
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
you communicate that purpose honestly
 

1047
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,110
you communicate that purpose honestly
with the global community and you strike

1048
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
with the global community and you strike
 

1049
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,310
with the global community and you strike
hard fast and you pull out

1050
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
hard fast and you pull out
 

1051
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,270
hard fast and you pull out
uh to do sort of it's like rescue

1052
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:55,280
uh to do sort of it's like rescue
 

1053
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,430
uh to do sort of it's like rescue
missions it's almost like policing work

1054
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
missions it's almost like policing work
 

1055
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,350
missions it's almost like policing work
if there's somebody suffering you go in

1056
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,360
if there's somebody suffering you go in
 

1057
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,909
if there's somebody suffering you go in
and stop that suffering directly that's

1058
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
and stop that suffering directly that's
 

1059
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,630
and stop that suffering directly that's
it

1060
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:02,640
it
 

1061
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,150
it
i think world war ii is seen in that way

1062
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
i think world war ii is seen in that way
 

1063
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,270
i think world war ii is seen in that way
that

1064
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:07,280
that
 

1065
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,510
that
there's an obvious aggressor

1066
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
there's an obvious aggressor
 

1067
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,190
there's an obvious aggressor
that is causing a lot of suffering in

1068
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
that is causing a lot of suffering in
 

1069
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,110
that is causing a lot of suffering in
the world and looking to expand the

1070
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:13,120
the world and looking to expand the
 

1071
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,870
the world and looking to expand the
scale of that suffering

1072
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
scale of that suffering
 

1073
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,590
scale of that suffering
and so you strike

1074
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:17,600
and so you strike
 

1075
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,150
and so you strike
i mean given the scale you strike car as

1076
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
i mean given the scale you strike car as
 

1077
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,270
i mean given the scale you strike car as
hard and as fast as possible to stop the

1078
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,280
hard and as fast as possible to stop the
 

1079
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,710
hard and as fast as possible to stop the
expansion of the suffering and so that's

1080
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:26,720
expansion of the suffering and so that's
 

1081
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,029
expansion of the suffering and so that's
kind of how they see i don't know if you

1082
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
kind of how they see i don't know if you
 

1083
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,230
kind of how they see i don't know if you
can kind of

1084
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
can kind of
 

1085
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,909
can kind of
look with this

1086
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:31,919
look with this
 

1087
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,070
look with this
framework that you presented and look at

1088
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
framework that you presented and look at
 

1089
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,150
framework that you presented and look at
hitler and think

1090
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
hitler and think
 

1091
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,669
hitler and think
well

1092
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:37,679
well
 

1093
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,750
well

suffering in the world
 

1121
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,070
suffering in the world
yes it's not it seems like almost

1122
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,080
yes it's not it seems like almost

no war is just

1124
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
no war is just
 

1125
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,750
no war is just
but it also seems somehow deeply human

1126

but it also seems somehow deeply human
 

1127
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,430
but it also seems somehow deeply human
to fight

to fight
 

1129
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,390

and i think your book makes the case no

1130
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:24,400
and i think your book makes the case no
 

1131
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,669
and i think your book makes the case no
it's not can you can you try to like get

it's not can you can you try to like get
 

1133
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,070
it's not can you can you try to like get
at that because it seems that war there

1134
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
at that because it seems that war there
 

1135
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,990
at that because it seems that war there
is some that

1136

1142
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:39,440
somewhere maybe it's
 

1143
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,029
somewhere maybe it's
maybe there's like a relic of the past

1144
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:41,039
maybe there's like a relic of the past
 

1145
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,270
maybe there's like a relic of the past
and we need to get rid of it it's deeply

1146
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
and we need to get rid of it it's deeply
 

1147
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,549
and we need to get rid of it it's deeply
irrational

1148
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:44,559
irrational
 

1149
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,150
irrational
okay so obviously we go to war and

1150
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
okay so obviously we go to war and
 

1151
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,590
okay so obviously we go to war and
obviously there's a lot of violence and

1152
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
obviously there's a lot of violence and
 

1153
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,470
obviously there's a lot of violence and
so

1154
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:48,480
so
 

1155
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,150
so
we have to explain something and and

1156
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
we have to explain something and and
 

1157
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,990
we have to explain something and and
some of that's going to be aspects of

1158
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:52,000
some of that's going to be aspects of
 

1159
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,990
some of that's going to be aspects of
our humanness so so i guess what i

1160
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
our humanness so so i guess what i
 

1161
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,870
our humanness so so i guess what i
wanted us to sort of start with

1162
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:56,880
wanted us to sort of start with
 

1163
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,390
wanted us to sort of start with
i think it was just useful to sort of

1164
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
i think it was just useful to sort of
 

1165
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,070
i think it was just useful to sort of
start and point out actually you know

1166
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,080
start and point out actually you know
 

1167
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,750
start and point out actually you know
there's really really really really

1168
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
there's really really really really
 

1169
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,430
there's really really really really
strong incentives not to go to war

1170
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:03,440
strong incentives not to go to war
 

1171
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,789
strong incentives not to go to war
because it's going to be really costly

1172
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:04,799
because it's going to be really costly
 

1173
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:07,190
because it's going to be really costly
and so all of these other human or

1174
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
and so all of these other human or
 

1175
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,870
and so all of these other human or
strategic things all these things the

1176
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:08,880
strategic things all these things the
 

1177
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,350
strategic things all these things the
circumstantial things that will

1178
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:11,360
circumstantial things that will
 

1179
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,510
circumstantial things that will
eventually lead us go to war have to be

1180
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:13,520
eventually lead us go to war have to be
 

1181
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,549
eventually lead us go to war have to be
pretty

1182
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:14,559
pretty
 

1183
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,669
pretty
powerful before we go there and and most

1184
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
powerful before we go there and and most
 

1185
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,669
powerful before we go there and and most
of the time sorry to interrupt uh and

1186
00:20:19,669 --> 00:20:19,679
of the time sorry to interrupt uh and
 

1187
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,909
of the time sorry to interrupt uh and
that's you why you also describe very

1188
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
that's you why you also describe very
 

1189
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,830
that's you why you also describe very
importantly that war throughout human

1190
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
importantly that war throughout human
 

1191
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,510
importantly that war throughout human
history is actually rare

1192
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:25,520
history is actually rare
 

1193
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,669
history is actually rare
we usually avoid it

1194
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
we usually avoid it
 

1195
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,149
we usually avoid it
you know most people don't know about

it
 

1217
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,350
it
didn't actually happen because

1218
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
didn't actually happen because
 

1219
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,549
didn't actually happen because
uh before the troops could land

1220

and tries to convince him to step down
 

1237
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,430
and tries to convince him to step down
or else and he says no no and and then

1238
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:13,440
or else and he says no no and and then
 

1239
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,830
or else and he says no no and and then
he shows him a video and it's basically

1240
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
he shows him a video and it's basically
 

1241
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,990
he shows him a video and it's basically
troop planes and all these things taking

1242
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,000
troop planes and all these things taking
 

1243

troop planes and all these things taking
off

1244
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:18,799
off
 

1245
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,310
off
and he's like this is not live this is

1246
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
and he's like this is not live this is
 

1247
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,630
and he's like this is not live this is
two hours ago so

1248
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
two hours ago so
 

1249
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,029
two hours ago so
it's a and and basically he basically

1250
00:21:25,029 --> 00:21:25,039
it's a and and basically he basically
 

1251
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,630
it's a and and basically he basically
gives up right there

1252
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
gives up right there
 

1253
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,230
gives up right there
so that was that's a powerful move yeah

1254
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
so that was that's a powerful move yeah
 

1255
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,070
so that was that's a powerful move yeah
i think powell might have been one of

1256
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
i think powell might have been one of
 

1257
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,990
i think powell might have been one of
his teachers in like a u.s military

1258
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,000
his teachers in like a u.s military
 

1259
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,669
his teachers in like a u.s military
college because a lot of these military

1260
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:35,679
college because a lot of these military
 

1261
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,510
college because a lot of these military
dictators are trained at some point so

1262
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
dictators are trained at some point so
 

1263
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,789
dictators are trained at some point so
they had some there was some personal

1264
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:38,799
they had some there was some personal
 

1265
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,990
they had some there was some personal
relationships at least between people in

1266
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,000
relationships at least between people in
 

1267
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
relationships at least between people in
the us government and this guy that they

1268
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:41,760
the us government and this guy that they
 

1269
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,830
the us government and this guy that they
were trying to use the the point is and

1270
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:43,840
were trying to use the the point is and
 

1271
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,270
were trying to use the the point is and
that that's that's like what should have

1272
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
that that's that's like what should have
 

1273
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,710
that that's that's like what should have
happened like that makes sense right

1274
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
happened like that makes sense right
 

1275
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,630
happened like that makes sense right
like yeah i'm

1276
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:48,640
like yeah i'm
 

1277
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,870
like yeah i'm
maybe i can mount an insurgency

1278
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
maybe i can mount an insurgency
 

1279
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,990
maybe i can mount an insurgency
and yeah i'm not going to bear a lot of

1280
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,000
and yeah i'm not going to bear a lot of
 

1281
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,870
and yeah i'm not going to bear a lot of
the cost of work because i'm the

1282
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
the cost of work because i'm the
 

1283
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,710
the cost of work because i'm the
dictator and maybe he's human and he

1284
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
dictator and maybe he's human and he
 

1285
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,310
dictator and maybe he's human and he
just wants to fight or gets angry or

1286
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
just wants to fight or gets angry or
 

1287
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,750
just wants to fight or gets angry or
it's just in his mind whatever he's

1288
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:57,760
it's just in his mind whatever he's
 

1289
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,789
it's just in his mind whatever he's
doing but at the end of the day he's

1290
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
doing but at the end of the day he's
 

1291
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,710
doing but at the end of the day he's
like this does not make sense

1292
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:00,720
like this does not make sense
 

1293
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,230
like this does not make sense
um

1294
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
um
 

1295
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,390
um
and that's what happens most of the time

1296
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
and that's what happens most of the time
 

1297
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,990
and that's what happens most of the time
but we don't write so many books about

1298
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:06,000

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,750
to the radar
until we overestimate i think how

1376
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:13,760
until we overestimate i think how
 

1377
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,510
until we overestimate i think how
likely it is sides are going to fight

1378
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:15,520
likely it is sides are going to fight
 

1379

likely it is sides are going to fight
but then of course things do happen like

1380
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
but then of course things do happen like

normal state is health and then we're
 

1457
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,230
normal state is health and then we're
going to

1458
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,240
going to
 

1459
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,470
going to
identify like what are the diseases that

1460
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
identify like what are the diseases that
 

1461
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,269
identify like what are the diseases that
are causing this warfare so yeah the

1462
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:31,279
are causing this warfare so yeah the
 

1463
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,269
are causing this warfare so yeah the
natural state of the human body with the

1464
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
natural state of the human body with the
 

1465
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:34,710
natural state of the human body with the
immune system and all the different

1466
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
immune system and all the different
 

1467
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,310
immune system and all the different
parts

1468
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,320
parts
 

1469
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,710
parts
uh wants to be healthy and is really

1470
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
uh wants to be healthy and is really
 

1471
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,110
uh wants to be healthy and is really
damn good at being healthy but sometimes

1472
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:41,120
damn good at being healthy but sometimes
 

1473
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,710
damn good at being healthy but sometimes
it breaks down let's understand how it

1474
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:42,720
it breaks down let's understand how it
 

1475
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,470
it breaks down let's understand how it
breaks down yeah exactly so what are the

1476
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:44,480
breaks down yeah exactly so what are the
 

1477
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,870
breaks down yeah exactly so what are the
five ways that you list

1478
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:46,880
five ways that you list
 

1479
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,710
five ways that you list
that are the roots of war

1480
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
that are the roots of war
 

1481
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,830
that are the roots of war
yeah so i mean they're kind of like

1482
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
yeah so i mean they're kind of like
 

1483
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,269
yeah so i mean they're kind of like
buckets like there's sort of things that

1484
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:51,279
buckets like there's sort of things that
 

1485
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,230
buckets like there's sort of things that
rhyme

1486
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:52,240
rhyme
 

1487
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,590
rhyme
right in the interval you know because

1488
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:53,600
right in the interval you know because
 

1489
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,710
right in the interval you know because
it's not all the same there's like lots

1490
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
it's not all the same there's like lots
 

1491
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,750
it's not all the same there's like lots
of reasons to go to where there's this

1492
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:55,760
of reasons to go to where there's this
 

1493
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,789
of reasons to go to where there's this
great line

1494
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:56,799
great line
 

1495
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:57,909
great line
you know there's a reason for every war

1496
00:24:57,909 --> 00:24:57,919
you know there's a reason for every war
 

1497
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,430
you know there's a reason for every war
and a war for every reason

1498
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
and a war for every reason
 

1499
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,430
and a war for every reason
and that's true and it's kind of

1500
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:01,440
and that's true and it's kind of
 

1501
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,269
and that's true and it's kind of
overwhelming right and and it's

1502
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
overwhelming right and and it's
 

1503
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,470
overwhelming right and and it's
overwhelming for a lot of people it was

1504
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:04,480
overwhelming for a lot of people it was
 

1505
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,750
overwhelming for a lot of people it was
overwhelming for me for a lot of time

1506
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
overwhelming for me for a lot of time
 

1507
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,909
overwhelming for me for a lot of time
and i think i think one of the gifts of

1508
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
and i think i think one of the gifts of
 

1509
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,750
and i think i think one of the gifts of
this of social sciences actually people

1510
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:09,760
this of social sciences actually people
 

1511
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,430
this of social sciences actually people
have started to organize this for us and

1512
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:11,440
have started to organize this for us and
 

1513
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,269
have started to organize this for us and
i just tried to organize it like a tiny

1514
00:25:13,269 --> 00:25:13,279
i just tried to organize it like a tiny
 

1515
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,990
i just tried to organize it like a tiny
bit better buckets that rhyme buckets

1516
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
bit better buckets that rhyme buckets
 

1517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,950
bit better buckets that rhyme buckets
yeah some economics before right

1518
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:18,960
yeah some economics before right
 

1519
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,430
yeah some economics before right
metaphors so so the idea was that like

1520
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
metaphors so so the idea was that like
 

1521
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,789
metaphors so so the idea was that like
that basic instead of like something

1522
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:22,799
that basic instead of like something
 

1523
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,390
that basic instead of like something
overrides these incentives and and i

1524
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:24,400
overrides these incentives and and i
 

1525
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,230
overrides these incentives and and i
guess i was saying there's five ways

1526
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
guess i was saying there's five ways
 

1527
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,549
guess i was saying there's five ways
there that they get overrided and three

1528
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:28,559
there that they get overrided and three
 

1529
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,630
there that they get overrided and three
are i'd call strategic like they're kind

1530
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
are i'd call strategic like they're kind
 

1531
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,430
are i'd call strategic like they're kind
of logical there's circumstances

1532
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,440
of logical there's circumstances
 

1533
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,070
of logical there's circumstances
that um and and this is they're sort of

1534
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
that um and and this is they're sort of
 

1535
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,750
that um and and this is they're sort of
where strategic is the strategy is like

1536
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
where strategic is the strategy is like
 

1537
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,470
where strategic is the strategy is like
the

1538
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,480
the
 

1539
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,549
the
the game theory is you could use those

1540
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
the game theory is you could use those
 

1541
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,470
the game theory is you could use those
two things interchangeably but but game

1542
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:42,480
two things interchangeably but but game
 

1543
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,669
two things interchangeably but but game
theory is sort of making it sound more

1544
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
theory is sort of making it sound more
 

1545
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,110
theory is sort of making it sound more
complicated i think than it is it's

1546
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,120
complicated i think than it is it's
 

1547
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,870
complicated i think than it is it's
basically saying that there's times when

1548
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
basically saying that there's times when
 

1549
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,470
basically saying that there's times when
this is like

1550
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
this is like
 

1551
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,070
this is like
the optimal choice because of

1552
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
the optimal choice because of
 

1553
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,029
the optimal choice because of
circumstances and and and one of them is

1554
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:53,039
circumstances and and and one of them is
 

1555
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,110
circumstances and and and one of them is
when the people who are deciding don't

1556
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,120
when the people who are deciding don't
 

1557
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,590
when the people who are deciding don't
bear those costs so

1558
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:57,600
bear those costs so
 

1559
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,269
bear those costs so
that's or or maybe even have a private

1560
00:25:59,269 --> 00:25:59,279
that's or or maybe even have a private
 

1561
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,669
that's or or maybe even have a private
incentive that's gonna that's that's uh

1562
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
incentive that's gonna that's that's uh
 

1563
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,110
incentive that's gonna that's that's uh
if they don't if they're ignoring the

1564
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,120
if they don't if they're ignoring the
 

1565
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,950
if they don't if they're ignoring the
cost then maybe the costs of war are not

1566
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
cost then maybe the costs of war are not
 

1567
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,430
cost then maybe the costs of war are not
so material uh that's a contributing

1568
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:07,440
so material uh that's a contributing
 

1569
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,350
so material uh that's a contributing
factor another is just there's

1570
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,360
factor another is just there's
 

1571
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,950
factor another is just there's
uncertainty and we could talk about that

1572
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
uncertainty and we could talk about that
 

1573
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,789
uncertainty and we could talk about that
but there's just the absence of

1574
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:12,799
but there's just the absence of
 

1575
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,549
but there's just the absence of
information means that actually there's

1576
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
information means that actually there's
 

1577
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,750
information means that actually there's
circumstances where it's your best

1578
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
circumstances where it's your best
 

1579
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,870
circumstances where it's your best
choice to

1580
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:16,880
choice to
 

1581
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,710
choice to
attack there's this thing that political

1582
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
attack there's this thing that political
 

1583
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,470
attack there's this thing that political
economists call commitment problems

1584
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:20,480
economists call commitment problems
 

1585
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,070
economists call commitment problems
which are basically saying there's some

1586
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:22,080
which are basically saying there's some
 

1587
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,750
which are basically saying there's some
big power shift that you can avoid by

1588
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
big power shift that you can avoid by
 

1589
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,350
big power shift that you can avoid by
attacking now so it's like a dynamic

1590
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
attacking now so it's like a dynamic
 

1591
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,870
attacking now so it's like a dynamic
incentive it's sort of saying well in

1592
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
incentive it's sort of saying well in
 

1593
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,470
incentive it's sort of saying well in
order to keep something from happening

1594
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
order to keep something from happening
 

1595
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,669
order to keep something from happening
in the future

1596
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
in the future
 

1597
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,350
in the future
i can attack now and because of the

1598
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
i can attack now and because of the
 

1599
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,269
i can attack now and because of the
structure of incentives it actually

1600
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
structure of incentives it actually
 

1601
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,110
structure of incentives it actually
makes sense for me even the awards in

1602
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,120
makes sense for me even the awards in
 

1603
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,549
makes sense for me even the awards in
theory

1604
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
theory
 

1605
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,350
theory
uh

1606
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:37,360
uh
 

1607
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,510
uh
really costly or it is really costly

1608
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:39,520
really costly or it is really costly
 

1609
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,549
really costly or it is really costly
nonetheless

1610
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
nonetheless
 

1611
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,830
nonetheless
and then there's these sort of human

1612
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:41,840
and then there's these sort of human
 

1613
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,710
and then there's these sort of human
things

1614

things
 

1615
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,230
things
one's a little bit like just war one

1616
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
one's a little bit like just war one
 

1617
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,750
one's a little bit like just war one
sort of thing there's like ideologies or

1618
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:45,760
sort of thing there's like ideologies or
 

1619
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,909
sort of thing there's like ideologies or
principles or things we value

1620
00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:47,919
principles or things we value
 

1621
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,789
principles or things we value
that weigh against those costs

1622
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
that weigh against those costs
 

1623
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:51,590
that weigh against those costs
like

1624
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:51,600
like
 

1625
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,909
like
exterminating the heretical idea

1626
00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:53,919
exterminating the heretical idea
 

1627
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,470
exterminating the heretical idea
or standing up for a principle

1628
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,480
or standing up for a principle
 

1629
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,390
or standing up for a principle
might be so valuable to me that i'm

1630
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:58,400
might be so valuable to me that i'm
 

1631
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,110
might be so valuable to me that i'm
willing to use violence even if it's

1632
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:01,120
willing to use violence even if it's
 

1633
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,549
willing to use violence even if it's
costly

1634
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
costly
 

1635
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:03,830
costly
and there's nothing irrational about

1636
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:03,840
and there's nothing irrational about
 

1637
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,950
and there's nothing irrational about
that

1638
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:04,960
that
 

1639
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,590
that
and then the fifth bucket is is all of

1640
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:07,600
and then the fifth bucket is is all of
 

1641
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,830
and then the fifth bucket is is all of
the irrationalities all the passions and

1642
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
the irrationalities all the passions and
 

1643
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,669
the irrationalities all the passions and
all of the most importantly i think like

1644
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
all of the most importantly i think like
 

1645
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,830
all of the most importantly i think like
misperceptions the way we get like we

1646
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:13,840
misperceptions the way we get like we
 

1647
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,149
misperceptions the way we get like we
basically make wrong calculations about

1648
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
basically make wrong calculations about
 

1649
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,669
basically make wrong calculations about
whether or not war is the right decision

1650
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:17,679
whether or not war is the right decision
 

1651
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,149
whether or not war is the right decision
we get our we miss we misunderstand or

1652
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:20,159
we get our we miss we misunderstand or
 

1653
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,590
we get our we miss we misunderstand or
misjudge our enemy

1654
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
misjudge our enemy
 

1655
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,750
misjudge our enemy
or misjudge ourselves so if you put all

1656
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:23,760
or misjudge ourselves so if you put all
 

1657
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,750
or misjudge ourselves so if you put all
those things into buckets so how much

1658
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
those things into buckets so how much
 

1659
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,350
those things into buckets so how much
can it be modeled

1660
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:27,360
can it be modeled
 

1661
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,669
can it be modeled
in in a in a simple game theoretic way

1662
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:29,679
in in a in a simple game theoretic way
 

1663
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,870
in in a in a simple game theoretic way
and how much of it is a giant human mess

1664
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
and how much of it is a giant human mess
 

1665
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,269
and how much of it is a giant human mess
so four of those five are really

1666
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:35,279
so four of those five are really
 

1667
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,350
so four of those five are really
on some level easy to

1668
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
on some level easy to
 

1669
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,029
on some level easy to
think strategically and model in a

1670
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:39,039
think strategically and model in a
 

1671
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,230
think strategically and model in a
simple way

1672
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,240
simple way
 

1673
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,110
simple way
um

1674
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
um
 

1675
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,789
um
in the sense that any of us can do it

1676
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
in the sense that any of us can do it
 

1677
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:45,830
in the sense that any of us can do it
right we do this all the time you know

1678
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:45,840
right we do this all the time you know
 

1679
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,909
right we do this all the time you know
think of like bargaining in a market for

1680
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
think of like bargaining in a market for
 

1681
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,669
think of like bargaining in a market for
a carpet or something or whatever you're

1682
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
a carpet or something or whatever you're
 

1683
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,110
a carpet or something or whatever you're
bargained for

1684
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:53,120
bargained for
 

1685
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,070
bargained for
um

1686
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
um
 

1687
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,310
um
you're thinking a few steps ahead about

1688
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
you're thinking a few steps ahead about
 

1689
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,789
you're thinking a few steps ahead about
what your opponent's going to do

1690
00:27:58,789 --> 00:27:58,799
what your opponent's going to do
 

1691
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,950
what your opponent's going to do
and you stake out a high price like a

1692
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
and you stake out a high price like a
 

1693
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,950
and you stake out a high price like a
low price and the seller stakes out a

1694
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
low price and the seller stakes out a
 

1695
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,389
low price and the seller stakes out a
high price

1696
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
high price
 

1697
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,470
high price
and you might both say oh i refuse to

1698
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:06,480
and you might both say oh i refuse to
 

1699
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,750
and you might both say oh i refuse to
like i could never accept that and

1700
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
like i could never accept that and
 

1701
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,389
like i could never accept that and
there's all this sort of cheap talk

1702
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:10,399
there's all this sort of cheap talk
 

1703
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,389
there's all this sort of cheap talk
um but you kind of understand where

1704
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399
um but you kind of understand where
 

1705
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,470
um but you kind of understand where
you're going and it's efficient to like

1706
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
you're going and it's efficient to like
 

1707
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,590
you're going and it's efficient to like
find a deal and buy the market by the

1708
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
find a deal and buy the market by the
 

1709
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,950
find a deal and buy the market by the
carpet eventually

1710
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:18,960
carpet eventually
 

1711
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,350
carpet eventually
um so we all understand this like game

1712
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
um so we all understand this like game
 

1713
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,470
um so we all understand this like game
theory and the strategy i think

1714
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:22,480
theory and the strategy i think
 

1715
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,029
theory and the strategy i think
intuitively or maybe even a closer

1716
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
intuitively or maybe even a closer
 

1717
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,830
intuitively or maybe even a closer
example is like suppose

1718
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840
example is like suppose
 

1719
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,430
example is like suppose
i don't know you have a tenant you need

1720
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
i don't know you have a tenant you need
 

1721
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,830
i don't know you have a tenant you need
to evict or anyone normal like kind of

1722
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
to evict or anyone normal like kind of
 

1723
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,750
to evict or anyone normal like kind of
legal or not it's not yet a legal

1724
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:33,760
legal or not it's not yet a legal
 

1725
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,950
legal or not it's not yet a legal
dispute right like we just have a

1726
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
dispute right like we just have a
 

1727
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,110
dispute right like we just have a
dispute with a neighbor or somebody else

1728
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
dispute with a neighbor or somebody else
 

1729
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,590
dispute with a neighbor or somebody else
most of us don't end up going to court

1730
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
most of us don't end up going to court
 

1731
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,830
most of us don't end up going to court
going to court is like the war option

1732
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
going to court is like the war option
 

1733
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,590
going to court is like the war option
that's the costly thing that we just

1734
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
that's the costly thing that we just
 

1735
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,870
that's the costly thing that we just
ought to be able to avoid we ought to be

1736
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:44,880
ought to be able to avoid we ought to be
 

1737
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,190
ought to be able to avoid we ought to be
able to find something between ourselves

1738
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,200
able to find something between ourselves
 

1739
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,990
able to find something between ourselves
that doesn't you know require this

1740
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
that doesn't you know require this
 

1741
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,470
that doesn't you know require this
hiring lawyers and a long drawn out

1742
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
hiring lawyers and a long drawn out
 

1743
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,950
hiring lawyers and a long drawn out
trial and most of the time we do

1744
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
trial and most of the time we do
 

1745
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,269
trial and most of the time we do
right and so so we all understand that

1746
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:57,279
right and so so we all understand that
 

1747
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,950
right and so so we all understand that
incentives and then

1748
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
incentives and then
 

1749
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,870
incentives and then
for those five buckets

1750
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:00,880
for those five buckets
 

1751
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,710
for those five buckets
so everything except all the irrational

1752
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
so everything except all the irrational
 

1753
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,789
so everything except all the irrational
and the misperceptions are really easy

1754
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
and the misperceptions are really easy
 

1755
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,149
and the misperceptions are really easy
to model then from a technical

1756
00:29:06,149 --> 00:29:06,159
to model then from a technical
 

1757
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,350
to model then from a technical
standpoint it's actually pretty tricky

1758
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:07,360
standpoint it's actually pretty tricky
 

1759
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,630
standpoint it's actually pretty tricky
to model

1760
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
to model
 

1761
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,549
to model
the misperceptions and i'm not a game

1762
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:10,559
the misperceptions and i'm not a game
 

1763
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,630
the misperceptions and i'm not a game
theorist uh and so i'm more channeling

1764
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:12,640
theorist uh and so i'm more channeling
 

1765
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,389
theorist uh and so i'm more channeling
my colleagues who do this and and what i

1766
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:14,399
my colleagues who do this and and what i
 

1767
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:15,350
my colleagues who do this and and what i
know

1768
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
know
 

1769
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,990
know
um but but it's not rocket science i

1770
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
um but but it's not rocket science i
 

1771
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,070
um but but it's not rocket science i
mean i think that's what i that's kind

1772
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
mean i think that's what i that's kind
 

1773
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,710
mean i think that's what i that's kind

1777
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,669
what i try to lay out in the book is
like there's this all this all these

like there's this all this all these
 

1779
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,510
like there's this all this all these
ideas out there that that can actually

1780
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:25,520
ideas out there that that can actually
 

1781
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,950
ideas out there that that can actually
help us just make sense of all these

1782
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
help us just make sense of all these
 

1783
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,070
help us just make sense of all these

of all rocket science is actually pretty

1794
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:38,880
of all rocket science is actually pretty
 

1795
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,710
of all rocket science is actually pretty
simple

actually well i think it's because

00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:44,480
actually well i think it's because
 

1801
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,350
actually well i think it's because
unfortunately it's very like engineering

well defined the problem with humanity
 

1807
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,149
well defined the problem with humanity
is it's actually complicated so it is

game theory
 

1821
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,190
game theory
is not that it helps us make sense of

1822
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:07,200
is not that it helps us make sense of
 

1823
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,389
is not that it helps us make sense of
the world it projects a simple model of

00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:15,279
thinking we understand yeah and
 

1829
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,830
thinking we understand yeah and
sometimes that simplification

1830
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
sometimes that simplification
 

1831
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,710
sometimes that simplification
is actually getting at the core

1832
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:20,720
is actually getting at the core
 

1833
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,950
is actually getting at the core
first principles on understanding of

first principles on understanding of
 

1835
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,269
first principles on understanding of
something and sometimes it fools us into

1836
00:30:25,269 --> 00:30:25,279
something and sometimes it fools us into
 

1837
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,149
something and sometimes it fools us into
thinking we understand so for example i

1838
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159
thinking we understand so for example i
 

1839
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,269
thinking we understand so for example i
mean

1840
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
mean
 

1841
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,870
mean
mutually assured destruction is a very

1842
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
mutually assured destruction is a very
 

1843
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,269
mutually assured destruction is a very
simple model and people argue all the

1844
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:33,279
simple model and people argue all the
 

1845
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,630
simple model and people argue all the
time whether that's actually a good

1846
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
time whether that's actually a good
 

1847
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,549
time whether that's actually a good
model or not but you know there's

1848
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:36,559
model or not but you know there's
 

1849
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,630
model or not but you know there's
empirical fact that we're still alive as

1850
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
empirical fact that we're still alive as
 

1851
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,669
empirical fact that we're still alive as
a human civilization and also

1852
00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:41,679
a human civilization and also
 

1853
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,669
a human civilization and also
in the game theoretic sense do we model

1854
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:43,679
in the game theoretic sense do we model
 

1855
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,269
in the game theoretic sense do we model
individual leaders

1856
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
individual leaders
 

1857
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,029
individual leaders
and their relationships

1858
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
and their relationships
 

1859
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,389
and their relationships
do we

the staff the generals
 

1863
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,470
the staff the generals
uh or do we also

1864
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
uh or do we also
 

1865
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,909
uh or do we also
um have to model the culture the people

1866
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:55,919
um have to model the culture the people
 

1867
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,029
um have to model the culture the people
the

1868
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
the
 

1869
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,950
the
the the suffering of the people the

1870
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:58,960
the the suffering of the people the
 

1871
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,269
the the suffering of the people the
economic frustration or the anger the

1872
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:01,279
economic frustration or the anger the
 

1873
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,669
economic frustration or the anger the
distrust you have to model all those

1874
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
distrust you have to model all those
 

1875
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,149
distrust you have to model all those
things do they come into play uh and

1876
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:06,159
things do they come into play uh and
 

1877
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,149
things do they come into play uh and
sometimes i mean again we could be

1878
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
sometimes i mean again we could be
 

1879
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,750
sometimes i mean again we could be
romanticizing

1880
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:09,760
romanticizing
 

1881
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,350
romanticizing
those things from a historical

1882
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
those things from a historical
 

1883
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,110
those things from a historical
perspective but when you look at history

1884
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,120
perspective but when you look at history
 

1885
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,669
perspective but when you look at history
and you look at the way wars start

1886
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
and you look at the way wars start
 

1887
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,509
and you look at the way wars start
it sometimes feels

1888
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
it sometimes feels
 

1889
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,070
it sometimes feels
like a little bit of a misunderstanding

1890
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
like a little bit of a misunderstanding
 

1891
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,750
like a little bit of a misunderstanding
escalates

1892
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:21,760
escalates
 

1893
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,909

escalates escalates
and

1896
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,080
and
 

1897
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,630
and
just builds on top of itself and all of

1898
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:28,640
just builds on top of itself and all of
 

1899
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,190
just builds on top of itself and all of
a sudden it's an all-out war

1900
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,200
a sudden it's an all-out war
 

1901
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,149
a sudden it's an all-out war
it's the escalation with nobody hitting

1902
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
it's the escalation with nobody hitting
 

1903
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,190
it's the escalation with nobody hitting
the brakes

1904
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,200
the brakes
 

1905
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,149
the brakes
so

1906
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:36,159
so
 

1907
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,149
so
so i mean you're absolutely right and

1908
00:31:38,149 --> 00:31:38,159
so i mean you're absolutely right and
 

1909
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,230
so i mean you're absolutely right and
like in the sense that it's totally

1910
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:40,240
like in the sense that it's totally
 

1911
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,909
like in the sense that it's totally
possible to oversimplify these things

1912
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:41,919
possible to oversimplify these things
 

1913
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,070
possible to oversimplify these things
and take the game theory too seriously

1914
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:44,080
and take the game theory too seriously
 

1915
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,310
and take the game theory too seriously
and and some and and people who

1916
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
and and some and and people who
 

1917
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,590
and and some and and people who
study those things and write those

1918
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
study those things and write those
 

1919
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,950
study those things and write those
models and

1920
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
models and
 

1921
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,870
models and
people like me who use them sometimes

1922
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:52,880
people like me who use them sometimes
 

1923
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,950
people like me who use them sometimes
make that mistake i think that's not the

1924
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
make that mistake i think that's not the
 

1925
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,149
make that mistake i think that's not the
mistake that most people make most often

1926
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,159
mistake that most people make most often
 

1927
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,830
mistake that most people make most often
and it's actually true is i think most

1928
00:31:59,830 --> 00:31:59,840
and it's actually true is i think most
 

1929
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,509
and it's actually true is i think most
people we're actually really quick

1930
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
people we're actually really quick
 

1931
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,669
people we're actually really quick
whether it's the the u.s invasion of

1932
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:03,679
whether it's the the u.s invasion of
 

1933
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,830
whether it's the the u.s invasion of
afghanistan or iraq we're really quick

1934
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
afghanistan or iraq we're really quick
 

1935
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,389
afghanistan or iraq we're really quick
to blame that on

1936
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
to blame that on
 

1937
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,149
to blame that on
the humanness and the culture and that

1938
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
the humanness and the culture and that
 

1939
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,870
the humanness and the culture and that
so we're really quick to say oh this was

1940
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:12,880
so we're really quick to say oh this was
 

1941
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,590
so we're really quick to say oh this was

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,990
george w bush's either desire for
revenge and vengeance or some private

1944

agenda or blood for oil
 

1947
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,789
agenda or blood for oil
um so we're really quick to blame it on

1948
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:22,799
um so we're really quick to blame it on
 

1949
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,430
um so we're really quick to blame it on
these things and then we're really

1950
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:25,440
these things and then we're really
 

1951
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,430
these things and then we're really
we tend to overlook the strategic

1952
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
we tend to overlook the strategic
 

1953
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,710
we tend to overlook the strategic
incentives

1954
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
incentives
 

1955
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,509

to attack which i think were probably
 

1959
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,389
to attack which i think were probably
dominant i think those things might have

1960
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
dominant i think those things might have
 

1961
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,230
dominant i think those things might have
been true to a degree but i don't think

1962
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:34,240
been true to a degree but i don't think
 

1963
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,710
been true to a degree but i don't think
they were enough to ever you know bring

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
they were enough to ever you know bring
 

1965
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,310
they were enough to ever you know bring
those wars about just like i think

1966
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
those wars about just like i think
 

1967
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,470
those wars about just like i think
people are very quick to sort of in this

1968
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:40,480
people are very quick to sort of in this
 

1969

and and the mistakes and the
 

1983
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,950
and and the mistakes and the
miscalculations were really quick to

1984
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
miscalculations were really quick to
 

1985
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,230
miscalculations were really quick to
sort of say oh that that must be and

1986
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
sort of say oh that that must be and
 

1987
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,590
sort of say oh that that must be and
then kind of pause and start not

1988
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,600
then kind of pause and start not
 

1989
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,070
then kind of pause and start not
possible maybe even stop there and not

1990
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,080
possible maybe even stop there and not
 

1991
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,470
possible maybe even stop there and not
see some of the strategic

1992
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:04,480
see some of the strategic
 

1993
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,830
see some of the strategic
incentives and so

1994
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:05,840
incentives and so
 

1995
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,950
incentives and so
so i i guess we have to do both um but

1996
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:08,960
so i i guess we have to do both um but
 

1997
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,870
so i i guess we have to do both um but
the strategic i guess i would say like

1998
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
the strategic i guess i would say like
 

1999
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,750
the strategic i guess i would say like
the

2000
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:11,760
the
 

2001
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,830
the
war is just such a big problem it's just

2002
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:13,840
war is just such a big problem it's just
 

2003
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,350
war is just such a big problem it's just
so costly

2004
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
so costly
 

2005
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,909
so costly
that the strategic

2006
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
that the strategic
 

2007
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,830
that the strategic
incentives and and the things that game

2008
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:19,840
incentives and and the things that game
 

2009
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,990
incentives and and the things that game
theory has given us are like really

2010
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:22,000
theory has given us are like really
 

2011
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,549
theory has given us are like really
important in understanding why

2012
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
important in understanding why
 

2013
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,389
important in understanding why
there was so little room for negotiation

2014
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:26,399
there was so little room for negotiation
 

2015
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,350
there was so little room for negotiation
in a bargain that things like a leader's

2016
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,360
in a bargain that things like a leader's
 

2017
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,190
in a bargain that things like a leader's
mistakes start to matter or leaders

2018
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
mistakes start to matter or leaders
 

2019
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,909
mistakes start to matter or leaders
nationalist ideals or delusions or

2020
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
nationalist ideals or delusions or
 

2021
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,350
nationalist ideals or delusions or
vengeance actually matters because those

2022
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:37,360
vengeance actually matters because those
 

2023
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,389
vengeance actually matters because those
do matter but they only matter when the

2024
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399
do matter but they only matter when the
 

2025
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,350
do matter but they only matter when the
capacity to find a deal is so

2026
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:43,360
capacity to find a deal is so
 

2027
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,110
capacity to find a deal is so
narrow because of the circumstances and

2028
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:45,120
narrow because of the circumstances and
 

2029
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,549
narrow because of the circumstances and
so let's not

2030
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
so let's not
 

2031
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,630
so let's not
let's it's sort of like saying um like

2032
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
let's it's sort of like saying um like
 

2033
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,310
let's it's sort of like saying um like
an elderly person who dies of pneumonia

2034
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,320
an elderly person who dies of pneumonia
 

2035
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,389
an elderly person who dies of pneumonia
right pneumonia killed them

2036
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
right pneumonia killed them
 

2037
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,110
right pneumonia killed them
obviously but that's not the reason

2038
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:57,120
obviously but that's not the reason
 

2039
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:58,950
obviously but that's not the reason
mnemonia was able to kill them all of

2040
00:33:58,950 --> 00:33:58,960
mnemonia was able to kill them all of
 

2041
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,110
mnemonia was able to kill them all of
the fundamentals and the circumstances

2042
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:01,120
the fundamentals and the circumstances
 

2043
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,870
the fundamentals and the circumstances
were like made them very fragile and

2044
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:02,880
were like made them very fragile and
 

2045
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,310
were like made them very fragile and
that's how i think all the strategic

2046
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:04,320
that's how i think all the strategic
 

2047
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,350
that's how i think all the strategic
forces

2048
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:05,360
forces
 

2049
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,909
forces
make that situation fragile

2050
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
make that situation fragile
 

2051
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,629
make that situation fragile
and then the miscalculations and the all

2052
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
and then the miscalculations and the all
 

2053
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,829
and then the miscalculations and the all
these things you just said which are so

2054
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
these things you just said which are so
 

2055
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,589
these things you just said which are so
important are kind of like the pneumonia

2056
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
important are kind of like the pneumonia
 

2057
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,270
important are kind of like the pneumonia
and let's sort of let's pay attention to

2058
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
and let's sort of let's pay attention to
 

2059
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,230
and let's sort of let's pay attention to
both

2060
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
both
 

2061
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,149
both
and you're saying that people don't

2062
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:18,159
and you're saying that people don't
 

2063
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,310
and you're saying that people don't
disproportionately pay attention to the

2064
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
disproportionately pay attention to the
 

2065
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,829
disproportionately pay attention to the
it's hard i mean it wasn't to the

2066
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
it's hard i mean it wasn't to the
 

2067
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,270
it's hard i mean it wasn't to the
leaders it took me a long time to learn

2068
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:25,280
leaders it took me a long time to learn
 

2069
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,990
leaders it took me a long time to learn
to recognize them and it takes many

2070
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
to recognize them and it takes many
 

2071
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,510
to recognize them and it takes many
people you know it took and it took

2072
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:29,520
people you know it took and it took
 

2073
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,550
people you know it took and it took
generations of social scientists

2074
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:32,560
generations of social scientists
 

2075
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,710
generations of social scientists
um years and years to figure

2076
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:34,720
um years and years to figure
 

2077
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,310
um years and years to figure
figure some of this out and to sort of

2078
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:36,320
figure some of this out and to sort of
 

2079
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,069
figure some of this out and to sort of
help people understand it and clarify

2080
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
help people understand it and clarify
 

2081
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,790
help people understand it and clarify
concepts so it's not it's just not that

2082
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
concepts so it's not it's just not that
 

2083
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,310
concepts so it's not it's just not that
easy now it's not hard i think it's

2084
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:42,320
easy now it's not hard i think it's
 

2085
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,149
easy now it's not hard i think it's
possible to just as i was taught a lot

2086
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
possible to just as i was taught a lot
 

2087
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,589
possible to just as i was taught a lot
of the stuff i write in the book in

2088
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
of the stuff i write in the book in
 

2089
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,589
of the stuff i write in the book in
graduate school or from reading and i

2090
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:47,599
graduate school or from reading and i
 

2091
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,190
graduate school or from reading and i
it's possible to communicate and learn

2092
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
it's possible to communicate and learn
 

2093
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,869
it's possible to communicate and learn
this stuff but it's still really hard

2094
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:50,879
this stuff but it's still really hard

2256
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
of other reasons i think why
 

2257
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,710
of other reasons i think why
this happened but i think for me it

2258
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:36,720
this happened but i think for me it
 

2259
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,510
this happened but i think for me it
starts with ukrainians failing to make

2260
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,520
starts with ukrainians failing to make
 

2261
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,310
starts with ukrainians failing to make
that

2262
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
that
 

2263
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,470
that
sensible quote-unquote

2264
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
sensible quote-unquote
 

2265
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,550
sensible quote-unquote
rational deal that says

2266
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:44,560
rational deal that says
 

2267
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,230
rational deal that says
we should we should relinquish some of

2268
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,240
we should we should relinquish some of
 

2269
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,910
we should we should relinquish some of
our sovereignty because russia is more

2270
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:47,920
our sovereignty because russia is more
 

2271
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,870
our sovereignty because russia is more
powerful than we are

2272
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
powerful than we are
 

2273
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,710
powerful than we are
so there's a very clinical look

2274
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:54,720
so there's a very clinical look
 

2275
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,790
so there's a very clinical look
at the war

2276
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,800
at the war
 

2277
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,870
at the war
meaning there is

2278
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
meaning there is
 

2279
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,870
meaning there is
a man and a country vladimir putin

2280
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:02,880
a man and a country vladimir putin
 

2281
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,550
a man and a country vladimir putin
that has

2282
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:04,560
that has
 

2283
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,109
that has
makes a claim on a land

2284
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:07,119
makes a claim on a land

builds up troops
 

2287
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,870
builds up troops
and invades yep

2288
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:10,880
and invades yep
 

2289
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,829
and invades yep
the way to avoid

2290
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
the way to avoid
 

2291
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,390
the way to avoid
suffering there and the way to avoid

2292
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:16,400
suffering there and the way to avoid
 

2293
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,349
suffering there and the way to avoid
death and a way to avoid war

2294
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:19,359
death and a way to avoid war
 

2295
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,349
death and a way to avoid war
is to

2296
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
is to
 

2297
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,910
is to
uh back down and basically let

2298
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
uh back down and basically let
 

2299
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,430
uh back down and basically let
you know there's a list of interests he

2300
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440
you know there's a list of interests he
 

2301
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,150
you know there's a list of interests he
provides and you go along with that

2302
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:32,160
provides and you go along with that
 

2303
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,270
provides and you go along with that
um that's when the goal is to avoid war

2304
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
um that's when the goal is to avoid war
 

2305
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,190
um that's when the goal is to avoid war
uh let's do some other calculus

2306
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:41,200
uh let's do some other calculus
 

2307
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,829
uh let's do some other calculus
let's think about britain so

france
fought hitler

fought hitler
 

2313
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,030
fought hitler
but did not fight very hard portugal

but did not fight very hard portugal
 

2315
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,710
but did not fight very hard portugal
there's a lot of stories of countries

2316
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:50,720
there's a lot of stories of countries
 

2317
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,150
there's a lot of stories of countries
like this

2318
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
like this
 

2319
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,470
like this
and there is

2320
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
and there is
 

2321
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,670
and there is
winston [\h__\h] churchill

he's one of the rare humans in history
who had that we shall fight on the

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:02,480
who had that we shall fight on the
 

2327
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,829
who had that we shall fight on the
beaches

2328

beaches
 

2329
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,750
beaches
it made no sense

2330
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
it made no sense
 

2331
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,829
it made no sense
hitler did not say he's going to destroy

2332
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:07,839
hitler did not say he's going to destroy

hitler did not say he's going to destroy
britain he seemed to show respect for

2334
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:10,000
britain he seemed to show respect for
 

2335
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,910
britain he seemed to show respect for
britain he wanted to

2336
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
britain he wanted to
 

2337
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,589
britain he wanted to
keep the british empire he it made total

2338
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:15,599
keep the british empire he it made total
 

2339
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,589
keep the british empire he it made total
sense but it was obvious that britain

2340
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:17,599
sense but it was obvious that britain
 

2341
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,589
sense but it was obvious that britain
was going to lose if hitler goes all in

2342
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
was going to lose if hitler goes all in
 

2343
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,109
was going to lose if hitler goes all in
on britain as he seemed like he was

2344
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:21,119
on britain as he seemed like he was
 

2345
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,150
on britain as he seemed like he was
going to and yet winston churchill

2346
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
going to and yet winston churchill
 

2347
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,190
going to and yet winston churchill
said a big fu yeah

2348
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:27,200
said a big fu yeah
 

2349
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,470
said a big fu yeah
similar thing

2350
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:28,480
similar thing
 

2351
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,030
similar thing
zelensky and the ukrainian people

2352
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,040
zelensky and the ukrainian people
 

2353
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,510
zelensky and the ukrainian people
said fu in that same kind of way

2354
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:33,520
said fu in that same kind of way
 

2355
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,109
said fu in that same kind of way
so i think i think we're saying the same

2356
00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:35,119
so i think i think we're saying the same
 

2357
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:37,990
so i think i think we're saying the same
things i'm i'm being more clinical about

2358
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
things i'm i'm being more clinical about
 

2359
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,270
things i'm i'm being more clinical about
it well i'm trying to understand

2360
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
it well i'm trying to understand
 

2361
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,829
it well i'm trying to understand
and we won't know this

2362
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
and we won't know this
 

2363
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:47,349
and we won't know this
but which path minimizes human suffering

2364
00:39:47,349 --> 00:39:47,359
but which path minimizes human suffering
 

2365
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,670
but which path minimizes human suffering
in the long term

2366
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
in the long term
 

2367
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,470
in the long term
well

2368
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:50,480
well
 

2369
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,710
well
on the eve of the war ukraine was poor

2370
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:52,720
on the eve of the war ukraine was poor
 

2371
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,390
on the eve of the war ukraine was poor
in a per person terms than it was in

2372
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:54,400
in a per person terms than it was in
 

2373
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,550
in a per person terms than it was in
1990 the economy is just completely

2374
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,560
1990 the economy is just completely
 

2375
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,150
1990 the economy is just completely
stagnated

2376
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:58,160
stagnated
 

2377
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,150
stagnated
in russia meanwhile like many other

2378
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:00,160
in russia meanwhile like many other
 

2379
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,550
in russia meanwhile like many other
parts of the region sort of boomed

2380
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:02,560
parts of the region sort of boomed
 

2381
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,910
parts of the region sort of boomed
to a degree i mean certainly because of

2382
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:03,920
to a degree i mean certainly because of
 

2383
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,790
to a degree i mean certainly because of
oil and gas but also for a variety of

2384
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
oil and gas but also for a variety of
 

2385
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,950
oil and gas but also for a variety of
other reasons and putin's consolidated

2386
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
other reasons and putin's consolidated
 

2387
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,470
other reasons and putin's consolidated
political control and

2388
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:10,480
political control and
 

2389
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,030
political control and
and from a very cold-blooded and

2390
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
and from a very cold-blooded and
 

2391
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,990
and from a very cold-blooded and
calculated point of view i think one way

2392
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
calculated point of view i think one way
 

2393
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,750
calculated point of view i think one way
putin and russia could look at this is

2394
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:17,760
putin and russia could look at this is
 

2395
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,670
putin and russia could look at this is
this look we were temporarily weak after

2396
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
this look we were temporarily weak after
 

2397
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,109
this look we were temporarily weak after
the ball

2398
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
the ball
 

2399
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,470
the ball
of the iron curtain

2400
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
of the iron curtain
 

2401
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,790
of the iron curtain
and the rest in the west basically took

2402
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:24,800
and the rest in the west basically took
 

2403
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,109
and the rest in the west basically took
advantage of that like bravo you pulled

2404
00:40:27,109 --> 00:40:27,119
advantage of that like bravo you pulled
 

2405
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,349
advantage of that like bravo you pulled
it off you basically crept democracy and

2406
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:29,359
it off you basically crept democracy and
 

2407
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:30,950
it off you basically crept democracy and
capitalism all these things right up to

2408
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:30,960
capitalism all these things right up to
 

2409
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,470
capitalism all these things right up to
our border

2410
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:32,480
our border
 

2411
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,950
our border
and now we have regained some of our

2412
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
and now we have regained some of our
 

2413
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,630
and now we have regained some of our
strength we've consolidated political

2414
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:36,640
strength we've consolidated political
 

2415
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,630
strength we've consolidated political
control we've cowed our people

2416
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
control we've cowed our people
 

2417

2639
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,270
that says
russia is more powerful than it was

2640
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280
russia is more powerful than it was
 

2641
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,190
russia is more powerful than it was
20 years ago and even 10 years ago and

2642
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:01,200
20 years ago and even 10 years ago and
 

2643
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,790
20 years ago and even 10 years ago and
ukraine is not

2644
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:02,800
ukraine is not
 

2645
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,030
ukraine is not
and it's asking for something

2646
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040
and it's asking for something
 

2647
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,950
and it's asking for something
and and there's an incentive to give

2648
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:06,960
and and there's an incentive to give
 

2649
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,990
and and there's an incentive to give
that up

2650
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
that up
 

2651
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,510
that up
that's obvious like there's an incentive

2652
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
that's obvious like there's an incentive
 

2653
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,069
that's obvious like there's an incentive
to comply but my understanding is many

2654
00:45:12,069 --> 00:45:12,079
to comply but my understanding is many
 

2655
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,630
to comply but my understanding is many
of these post-soviet republics

2656
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:14,640
of these post-soviet republics
 

2657
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,069
of these post-soviet republics

00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:17,440
right which is what we call compromise
 

2661
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,030
right which is what we call compromise
when we disagree with it

2662
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:19,040
when we disagree with it
 

2663
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,230

many russians have tried to stand up and
 

2675
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,990
many russians have tried to stand up and
they've been beaten down

2676
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
they've been beaten down
 

2677
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,109
they've been beaten down
and now

2678
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
and now
 

2679
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,790
and now
people have

2680
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:34,800
people have
 

2681
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,150
people have
we'll see but people have not been

2682
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:36,160
we'll see but people have not been
 

2683
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,910
we'll see but people have not been
standing up very much

2684
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:37,920
standing up very much
 

2685
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,109
standing up very much
and so

2686
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
and so
 

2687
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,790
and so
lots of people are cowed and lots of

2688
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:40,800
lots of people are cowed and lots of
 

2689
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,030
lots of people are cowed and lots of
people have a piece and lots of people

2690
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
people have a piece and lots of people
 

2691
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,030
people have a piece and lots of people
hear that speech and think i would like

2692
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
hear that speech and think i would like
 

2693
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,109
hear that speech and think i would like
to do that but but don't

2694
00:45:47,109 --> 00:45:47,119
to do that but but don't
 

2695
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,230
to do that but but don't
and and so and my point is that

2696
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
and and so and my point is that
 

2697
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,150
and and so and my point is that
sadly we live in a world where a lot of

2698
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:52,160
sadly we live in a world where a lot of
 

2699
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,349
sadly we live in a world where a lot of
people

2700
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
people
 

2701
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,630
people
uh get stepped on by

2702
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
uh get stepped on by
 

2703
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,710
uh get stepped on by
tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't

2704
00:45:58,710 --> 00:45:58,720
tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't
 

2705
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,109
tyrants and empire and whatnot and don't
rise up and so so i think we could

2706
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:01,119
rise up and so so i think we could
 

2707
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,710
rise up and so so i think we could
admire especially

2708
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
admire especially
 

2709
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,710
admire especially
when they stand up for these reasons and

2710
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:04,720
when they stand up for these reasons and
 

2711
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,230
when they stand up for these reasons and
i think we can admire churchill for that

2712
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
i think we can admire churchill for that
 

2713
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,750
i think we can admire churchill for that
reason i think we could that's why we

2714
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
reason i think we could that's why we
 

2715
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,430
reason i think we could that's why we
admire the leaders the american

2716
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
admire the leaders the american
 

2717
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,670
admire the leaders the american
revolution and so on but doesn't always

2718
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:11,680
revolution and so on but doesn't always
 

2719
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,670
revolution and so on but doesn't always
happen and i i don't actually know why

2720
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:13,680
happen and i i don't actually know why
 

2721
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,030
happen and i i don't actually know why
but i don't think it's irrational i

2722
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
but i don't think it's irrational i
 

2723
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,870
but i don't think it's irrational i
think it's just it's it's something it's

2724
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
think it's just it's it's something it's
 

2725
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,630

about a set of values and it's hard to

2726
00:46:18,630 --> 00:46:18,640
about a set of values and it's hard to
 

2727
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:19,829
about a set of values and it's hard to
predict

2728
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
predict
 

2729
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,430
predict
and it was hard for

2730
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:21,440
and it was hard for
 

2731
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,870
and it was hard for
hard i i

2732
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
hard i i
 

2733
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,790
hard i i
putin might not have been out of line

2734
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
putin might not have been out of line
 

2735
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,190
putin might not have been out of line
and thinking just like everybody else

2736
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:27,200
and thinking just like everybody else
 

2737
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:28,790

00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:35,440
it was a threat to them and so they had
 

2911
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,549
it was a threat to them and so they had
to ask

2912
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:36,559
to ask

00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
and have been trying to achieve through
 

2921
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,470
and have been trying to achieve through
other means for

2922
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
other means for
 

2923
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,150
other means for
decades right they've been trying to

2924
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160
decades right they've been trying to
 

2925
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,109
decades right they've been trying to
undermine these things without uh

2926
00:49:51,109 --> 00:49:51,119
undermine these things without uh
 

2927
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,470
undermine these things without uh
invasion

2928
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
invasion
 

2929
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,069
invasion
and they've been doing that because it

2930
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:54,079
and they've been doing that because it
 

2931
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,670
and they've been doing that because it
threatens their interests and that's

2932
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
threatens their interests and that's
 

2933
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,109
threatens their interests and that's
like one of these other logics of war

2934
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
like one of these other logics of war
 

2935
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,230
like one of these other logics of war
it's not just that there's something

2936
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
it's not just that there's something
 

2937
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,750
it's not just that there's something
that i value so much that i'm willing to

2938
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
that i value so much that i'm willing to
 

2939
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,510
that i value so much that i'm willing to
injure the cost it's that there are

2940
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:01,520
injure the cost it's that there are
 

2941
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,710
injure the cost it's that there are
people

2942
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
people
 

2943
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,030
people
not only do does this oligarchy or

not only do does this oligarchy or
 

2945
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,390
not only do does this oligarchy or
whatever elite group that you want to

2946
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:06,400
whatever elite group that you want to
 

2947
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,630
whatever elite group that you want to
talk about in russia not

2948
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:08,640
talk about in russia not
 

2949
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,670
talk about in russia not
first of all they're not bearing

2950
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
first of all they're not bearing
 

2951
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,790
first of all they're not bearing
something they're bearing some costs of

2952
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:10,800
something they're bearing some costs of
 

2953
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,309
something they're bearing some costs of
war right they're very and they're

2954
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
war right they're very and they're
 

2955
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,630
war right they're very and they're
certainly bearing cost of sanctions

2956
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:14,640
certainly bearing cost of sanctions
 

2957
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,549
certainly bearing cost of sanctions
um but they are

2958
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559
um but they are
 

2959
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,910
um but they are
they don't bear all the costs of war

2960
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
they don't bear all the costs of war
 

2961
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,349
they don't bear all the costs of war
obviously and so they're more they're

2962
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
obviously and so they're more they're
 

2963
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:21,190
obviously and so they're more they're
quick to use it but more importantly

2964
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:21,200
quick to use it but more importantly
 

2965
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,790
quick to use it but more importantly
like

2966
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:22,800
like
 

2967
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:24,390
like
in some sense it i think there's a

2968
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:24,400
in some sense it i think there's a
 

2969
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,390
in some sense it i think there's a
strong argument that they had a

2970
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:26,400
strong argument that they had a
 

2971
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,630
strong argument that they had a
political incentive to invade and or at

2972
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
political incentive to invade and or at
 

2973
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,710
political incentive to invade and or at
least to ask ukraine this sort of

2974
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
least to ask ukraine this sort of
 

2975
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,109
least to ask ukraine this sort of
impossible to give up thing and then

2976
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:33,119
impossible to give up thing and then
 

2977
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,910
impossible to give up thing and then
invade despite ukrainian

2978
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:35,920
invade despite ukrainian
 

2979
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,150
invade despite ukrainian
nobility and transitions

2980
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
nobility and transitions
 

2981
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,549
nobility and transitions
because they were threatened

2982
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
because they were threatened
 

2983
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:42,230
because they were threatened
um and so

2984
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:42,240
um and so
 

2985
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,950
um and so
so that's extremely important i think

2986
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
so that's extremely important i think
 

2987
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,790
so that's extremely important i think
and so that's

2988
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:46,800
and so that's
 

2989
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:49,349
and so that's
those two things in concert make this a

2990
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:49,359
those two things in concert make this a
 

2991
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,270
those two things in concert make this a
very fragile situation that's i think

2992
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
very fragile situation that's i think
 

2993
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,430
very fragile situation that's i think
why we ended up

2994
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:53,440
why we ended up
 

2995
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,670
why we ended up
is go go not all the way but a long way

2996
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:55,680
is go go not all the way but a long way
 

2997
00:50:55,680 --> 00:50:58,069
is go go not all the way but a long way
to understanding now you can layer on to

2998
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
to understanding now you can layer on to
 

2999
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:58,950
to understanding now you can layer on to
that

3000
00:50:58,950 --> 00:50:58,960
that
 

3001
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,549
that
these intangible incentives these other

3002
00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
these intangible incentives these other
 

3003
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,390
these intangible incentives these other
things that are valued that are valued

3004
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:02,400
things that are valued that are valued
 

3005
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,670
things that are valued that are valued
on putin's side maybe there's a

3006
00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:03,680
on putin's side maybe there's a
 

3007
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,670
on putin's side maybe there's a
nationalist ideal maybe

3008
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:05,680
nationalist ideal maybe
 

3009
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,870
nationalist ideal maybe
he

3010
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:06,880
he
 

3011
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,549
he
seeks status and glory like maybe those

3012
00:51:08,549 --> 00:51:08,559
seeks status and glory like maybe those
 

3013
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:09,589
seeks status and glory like maybe those
things are all true and i'm sure they're

3014
00:51:09,589 --> 00:51:09,599
things are all true and i'm sure they're
 

3015
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,750
things are all true and i'm sure they're
true to an extent

3016
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
true to an extent
 

3017
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,430
true to an extent
and and and that'll weigh against his

3018
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:13,440
and and and that'll weigh against his
 

3019
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,510
and and and that'll weigh against his
costs of war as well but fundamentally i

3020
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:15,520
costs of war as well but fundamentally i
 

3021
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,510
costs of war as well but fundamentally i
think he just saw his regime as

3022
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:17,520
think he just saw his regime as
 

3023
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,069
think he just saw his regime as
threatened that's what he cares about

3024
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
threatened that's what he cares about
 

3025
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,190
threatened that's what he cares about
and

3026
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
and
 

3027
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,349
and
and and so he asked he made he made this

3028
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
and and so he asked he made he made this
 

3029
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,430
and and so he asked he made he made this
cruel list of demands

3030
00:51:25,430 --> 00:51:25,440
cruel list of demands
 

3031
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,270
cruel list of demands
i mean i would say i'm just one human

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,549
the cases where that ended up working
out

what hitler was doing
um

3388
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
um
 

3389
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,910
um
that's an explanation so that's a whole

3390
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:39,920
that's an explanation so that's a whole
 

3391
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,670
that's an explanation so that's a whole
class of explanations

3392
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:41,680
class of explanations
 

3393
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,190
class of explanations
that helps us understand that the

3394
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
that helps us understand that the
 

3395
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,950
that helps us understand that the
compromise that was on the table given

3396
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:44,960
compromise that was on the table given
 

3397
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,789
compromise that was on the table given
the relative balance of power was just

3398
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:46,799
the relative balance of power was just
 

3399
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,549
the relative balance of power was just
repugnant at least to one side if not

3400
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:48,559
repugnant at least to one side if not
 

3401
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:49,670
repugnant at least to one side if not
there's something they're unwilling to

3402
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
there's something they're unwilling to
 

3403
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,030
there's something they're unwilling to
part with that's

3404
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
part with that's
 

3405
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,150
part with that's
and then

3406
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,160
and then
 

3407
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,630
and then
you get to the leaders well what happens

3408
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:54,640
you get to the leaders well what happens
 

3409
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,030
you get to the leaders well what happens
when what the leaders want

3410
00:57:57,030 --> 00:57:57,040
when what the leaders want
 

3411
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,230
when what the leaders want
when what happens when the leaders are

3412
00:57:58,230 --> 00:57:58,240
when what happens when the leaders are
 

3413
00:57:58,240 --> 00:57:59,670
when what happens when the leaders are
detached from the interests of their

3414
00:57:59,670 --> 00:57:59,680
detached from the interests of their
 

3415
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,270
detached from the interests of their
groups which has been true for basically

3416
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:01,280
groups which has been true for basically
 

3417
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,870
groups which has been true for basically
most of human history there's a narrow

3418
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:02,880
most of human history there's a narrow
 

3419
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,549
most of human history there's a narrow
slice of societies

3420
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:04,559
slice of societies
 

3421
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:06,630
slice of societies
in the big scheme of things that have

3422
00:58:06,630 --> 00:58:06,640
in the big scheme of things that have
 

3423
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,990
in the big scheme of things that have
been accountable to their people a lot

3424
00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:08,000
been accountable to their people a lot
 

3425
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,510
been accountable to their people a lot
of them exist today

3426
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520

 

3427
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:13,030

where to some degree they're channeling

3428
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,040
where to some degree they're channeling
 

3429
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,109
where to some degree they're channeling
the interests of their group

3430
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
the interests of their group
 

3431
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,670
the interests of their group
right so the ukrainian politicians

3432
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:17,680
right so the ukrainian politicians
 

3433
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,829
right so the ukrainian politicians
didn't concede to these cool russian

3434
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:19,839
didn't concede to these cool russian
 

3435
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:20,870
didn't concede to these cool russian
demands

3436
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:20,880
demands
 

3437
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,230
demands
because even if they had it would have

3438
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:22,240
because even if they had it would have
 

3439
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,230
because even if they had it would have
been political suicide because it seemed

3440
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
been political suicide because it seemed
 

3441
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,910
been political suicide because it seemed
i think i don't it seems that the

3442
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
i think i don't it seems that the
 

3443
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,990
i think i don't it seems that the
ukrainians would have just rejected this

3444
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:28,000
ukrainians would have just rejected this
 

3445
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,230
ukrainians would have just rejected this
so they were in some sense channeling

3446
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:30,240
so they were in some sense channeling
 

3447
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,030
so they were in some sense channeling
the values of the broader population

3448
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,040
the values of the broader population
 

3449
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,230
the values of the broader population
even if they

3450
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
even if they
 

3451
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,510
even if they
i don't know what was going even and if

3452
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,520
i don't know what was going even and if
 

3453
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:38,150
i don't know what was going even and if
they didn't share those principles

3454
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
they didn't share those principles
 

3455
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,230
they didn't share those principles
they self-interestedly

3456
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
they self-interestedly
 

3457
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,750
they self-interestedly
followed them probably they shared them

3458
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:41,760
followed them probably they shared them
 

3459
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,190
followed them probably they shared them
but i'm just saying that even if they

3460
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
but i'm just saying that even if they
 

3461
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,390
but i'm just saying that even if they
didn't they wouldn't compromise

3462
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:46,400
didn't they wouldn't compromise
 

3463
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,829
didn't they wouldn't compromise
occasionally you get the reverse which

3464
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
occasionally you get the reverse which
 

3465
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,270
occasionally you get the reverse which
is where the leaders are not accountable

3466
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:51,280
is where the leaders are not accountable
 

3467
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,270
is where the leaders are not accountable
and now they have some value which could

3468
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:53,280
and now they have some value which could
 

3469
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,950
and now they have some value which could
be glory

3470
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:54,960
be glory
 

3471
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,470
be glory
i mean this is the story of the kings

3472
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:56,480
i mean this is the story of the kings
 

3473
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:57,990
i mean this is the story of the kings
and to some lesser extent the queens of

3474
00:58:57,990 --> 00:58:58,000
and to some lesser extent the queens of
 

3475
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,109
and to some lesser extent the queens of
europe

3476
00:58:59,109 --> 00:58:59,119
europe
 

3477
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,950
europe
for hundreds of years was it was

3478
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
for hundreds of years was it was
 

3479
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,030
for hundreds of years was it was
basically a contest and it was this war

3480
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
basically a contest and it was this war
 

3481
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,549
basically a contest and it was this war
was the sport of kings and to some

3482
00:59:04,549 --> 00:59:04,559
was the sport of kings and to some
 

3483
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,390
was the sport of kings and to some
extent they were just seeking status

3484
00:59:06,390 --> 00:59:06,400
extent they were just seeking status
 

3485
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,349
extent they were just seeking status
through violent competition and they

3486
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:09,359
through violent competition and they
 

3487
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:11,109
through violent competition and they
paid a lot a big price out of the royal

3488
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:11,119
paid a lot a big price out of the royal
 

3489
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,030
paid a lot a big price out of the royal
purse but but

3490
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,040
purse but but
 

3491
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:14,710
purse but but
uh but they didn't bear most of the

3492
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:14,720
uh but they didn't bear most of the
 

3493
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,549
uh but they didn't bear most of the
suffering

3494
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
suffering
 

3495
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:18,630
suffering
um and and so they were too quick to go

3496
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
um and and so they were too quick to go
 

3497
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:19,670
um and and so they were too quick to go
to war

3498
00:59:19,670 --> 00:59:19,680
to war
 

3499
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,990
to war
and so that's

3500
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
and so that's
 

3501
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,190
and so that's
i think that

3502
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
i think that
 

3503
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,390
i think that
detachment of leaders

3504
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
detachment of leaders
 

3505
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,309
detachment of leaders
combined with you know you mingle it

3506
00:59:28,309 --> 00:59:28,319
combined with you know you mingle it
 

3507
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:31,030
combined with you know you mingle it
with this that one bucket that

3508
00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:31,040
with this that one bucket that
 

3509
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,030
with this that one bucket that
uncheckedness and you mingle that with

3510
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
uncheckedness and you mingle that with
 

3511
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,710
uncheckedness and you mingle that with
the fact that that leaders might have

3512
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:34,720
the fact that that leaders might have
 

3513
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,910
the fact that that leaders might have
one of these values noble or otherwise

3514
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
one of these values noble or otherwise
 

3515
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,910
one of these values noble or otherwise
that carry them to war combined to

3516
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:39,920
that carry them to war combined to
 

3517
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:40,950
that carry them to war combined to
explain

3518
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:40,960
explain
 

3519
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,430
explain
a good number of conflicts as well

3520
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:43,440
a good number of conflicts as well
 

3521
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,430
a good number of conflicts as well
and that's a good illustration of why i

3522
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:45,440
and that's a good illustration of why i
 

3523
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,910
and that's a good illustration of why i
think like autocracy and

3524
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
think like autocracy and
 

3525
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,670
think like autocracy and
unaccountable power

3526
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:49,680
unaccountable power
 

3527
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,270
unaccountable power
is

3528
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
is
 

3529
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,950
is
i could make that story for all of those

3530
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
i could make that story for all of those
 

3531
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,710
i could make that story for all of those
things all five buckets they're all

3532
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:54,720
things all five buckets they're all
 

3533
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,230
things all five buckets they're all
we're all more susceptible to these

3534
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240
we're all more susceptible to these
 

3535
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,710
we're all more susceptible to these
things all five of these things when

3536
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:58,720
things all five of these things when
 

3537
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,789
things all five of these things when
leaders are not accountable to the

3538
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
leaders are not accountable to the
 

3539
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,630
leaders are not accountable to the
people and their group

3540
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
people and their group
 

3541
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,870
people and their group
and uh and that's what makes it like the

3542
01:00:04,870 --> 01:00:04,880
and uh and that's what makes it like the
 

3543
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:05,750
and uh and that's what makes it like the
meta

3544
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,760
meta
 

3545
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,109

for me the metacause of of conflict in

all of human history and sadly today
does the world to power play into this

3550
01:00:14,549 --> 01:00:14,559
does the world to power play into this
 

3551
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:17,270
does the world to power play into this
the desire for power

3552
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,280
the desire for power
 

3553
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,190
the desire for power
like that's a human thing again in the

3554
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
like that's a human thing again in the
 

3555
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,470
like that's a human thing again in the
calculation

3556
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
calculation
 

3557
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:21,670
calculation
that

3558
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:21,680
that
 

3559
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,589
that
shall we put that in the misperceptions

3560
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
shall we put that in the misperceptions
 

3561
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,549
shall we put that in the misperceptions
bucket

3562
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
bucket
 

3563
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:25,670
bucket
or is it

3564
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
or is it
 

3565
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,030
or is it
those misperceptions essentially

3566
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
those misperceptions essentially
 

3567
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,109
those misperceptions essentially
about interaction between humans and

3568
01:00:31,109 --> 01:00:31,119
about interaction between humans and
 

3569
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:33,430
about interaction between humans and
power is more about

3570
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
power is more about
 

3571
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,270
power is more about
the thing you feel in your heart when

3572
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
the thing you feel in your heart when
 

3573
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,670
the thing you feel in your heart when
you're alone as a as a leader

01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
you're alone as a as a leader
 

3575
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,270
you're alone as a as a leader
you know i said there were three

3576
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
you know i said there were three
 

3577
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,109
you know i said there were three
strategic reasons like the then check

3578
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:41,119
strategic reasons like the then check
 

3579
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:42,230
strategic reasons like the then check
leaders the commitment problems

3580
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:42,240
leaders the commitment problems
 

3581
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,990
leaders the commitment problems
uncertainty there are two sort of more

3582
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
uncertainty there are two sort of more
 

3583
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,069
uncertainty there are two sort of more
psychological and i call them intangible

3584
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
psychological and i call them intangible
 

3585

incentives and misperceptions the way

3586
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
incentives and misperceptions the way
 

3587
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,950
incentives and misperceptions the way
that like a game theorist or the way

3588
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:48,960
that like a game theorist or the way
 

3589
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,630
that like a game theorist or the way
that a behavioral economist would think

3590
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
that a behavioral economist would think
 

3591
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,069
that a behavioral economist would think
about those two was just to say

3592
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079
about those two was just to say
 

3593
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:53,829
about those two was just to say
preferences

3594
01:00:53,829 --> 01:00:53,839
preferences
 

3595
01:00:53,839 --> 01:00:55,349
preferences
and then

3596
01:00:55,349 --> 01:00:55,359
and then
 

3597
01:00:55,359 --> 01:00:57,270
and then
erroneous beliefs and mistakes it's like

3598
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:57,280
erroneous beliefs and mistakes it's like
 

3599
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,789
erroneous beliefs and mistakes it's like
so the pro our preferences are our

3600
01:00:58,789 --> 01:00:58,799
so the pro our preferences are our
 

3601
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,349
so the pro our preferences are our
preferences yeah right and so utility

3602
01:01:01,349 --> 01:01:01,359
preferences yeah right and so utility
 

3603
01:01:01,359 --> 01:01:02,950
preferences yeah right and so utility
functions whatever we want to call it

3604
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
functions whatever we want to call it
 

3605
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,390
functions whatever we want to call it
like there's not

3606
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
like there's not
 

3607
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,670
like there's not
that's why i wouldn't call them a

3608
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
that's why i wouldn't call them a
 

3609
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,829
that's why i wouldn't call them a

it was a big bucket full of stuff that

3630
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:28,319
it was a big bucket full of stuff that
 

3631
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,270
it was a big bucket full of stuff that
rhymes like that's a pretty messy bucket

3632
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:31,280
rhymes like that's a pretty messy bucket
 

3633
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,470
rhymes like that's a pretty messy bucket
like there's a lot of different stuff in

3634
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
like there's a lot of different stuff in
 

3635
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,390
like there's a lot of different stuff in
there and i'm just trying to say like

3636
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:34,400
there and i'm just trying to say like
 

3637
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,470
there and i'm just trying to say like
let's be clear

3638
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:36,480
let's be clear
 

3639
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,670
let's be clear
that

3640
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:37,680
that
 

3641
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,430
that
just about the law the shared logic of

3642
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
just about the law the shared logic of
 

3643
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,870
just about the law the shared logic of
these things is maybe just you know

3644
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:40,880
these things is maybe just you know
 

3645
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,150
these things is maybe just you know
they're really dissimilar but let's be

3646
01:01:42,150 --> 01:01:42,160
they're really dissimilar but let's be
 

3647
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,750
they're really dissimilar but let's be
clear about the shared logic

3648
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:43,760
clear about the shared logic
 

3649
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,789
clear about the shared logic
uh and if it were true that deep down we

3650
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
uh and if it were true that deep down we
 

3651
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,549
uh and if it were true that deep down we
were aggressive people who just liked

3652
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
were aggressive people who just liked
 

3653
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,349
were aggressive people who just liked
violence and enjoyed the blood

3654
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
violence and enjoyed the blood
 

3655
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,870
violence and enjoyed the blood
or some percentage of us do that would

3656
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
or some percentage of us do that would
 

3657
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,309
or some percentage of us do that would
be there too

3658
01:01:54,309 --> 01:01:54,319
be there too
 

3659
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:55,589
be there too
um

3660
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:55,599
um
 

3661
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:56,710
um
and so

3662
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
and so
 

3663
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,430
and so
i just want to say that's

3664
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
i just want to say that's
 

3665
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,789
i just want to say that's
but you know we're really quick to

3666
01:02:00,789 --> 01:02:00,799
but you know we're really quick to
 

3667
01:02:00,799 --> 01:02:03,349
but you know we're really quick to
recognize those right when we diagnose a

3668
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
recognize those right when we diagnose a
 

3669
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:05,829
recognize those right when we diagnose a
war as an armchair analyst or as a

3670
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:05,839
war as an armchair analyst or as a
 

3671
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:08,230
war as an armchair analyst or as a
journalist or something

3672
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:08,240
journalist or something
 

3673
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,069
journalist or something
we really jump to those we don't need a

3674
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
we really jump to those we don't need a
 

3675
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,430
we really jump to those we don't need a
lot of help

3676
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:11,440
lot of help
 

3677
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,510
lot of help
to like see those happening

3678
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:13,520
to like see those happening
 

3679
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,670
to like see those happening
we so we probably put a little bit too

3680
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
we so we probably put a little bit too
 

3681
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,670
we so we probably put a little bit too
much emphasis on them is maybe the only

3682
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:17,680
much emphasis on them is maybe the only
 

3683
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:19,270
much emphasis on them is maybe the only
thing that i would caution

3684
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:19,280
thing that i would caution
 

3685
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,829
thing that i would caution
because we're the others are more subtle

3686
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
because we're the others are more subtle
 

3687
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,109
because we're the others are more subtle
and they're often there and they

3688
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
and they're often there and they
 

3689
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:24,789
and they're often there and they
contribute

3690
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:24,799
contribute
 

3691
01:02:24,799 --> 01:02:26,549
contribute
so i just to look at something you said

3692
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:26,559
so i just to look at something you said
 

3693
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,990
so i just to look at something you said
before

3694
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:28,000
before
 

3695
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,910
before
would it be accurate to say when the

3696
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:29,920
would it be accurate to say when the
 

3697
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,630
would it be accurate to say when the
leaders become detached

3698
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
leaders become detached
 

3699
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,670
leaders become detached
from um the opinion of the people

3700
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
from um the opinion of the people
 

3701
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,630
from um the opinion of the people
is that's more likely to lead to war

3702
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:38,640
is that's more likely to lead to war
 

3703
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:39,510
is that's more likely to lead to war
so

3704
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:39,520
so
 

3705
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,670
so
uh and mechanically it's just they're

3706
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:41,680
uh and mechanically it's just they're
 

3707
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,109
uh and mechanically it's just they're
gonna bear fewer costs so it's gonna

3708
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
gonna bear fewer costs so it's gonna
 

3709
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,950
gonna bear fewer costs so it's gonna
it's gonna basically narrow the set of

3710
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:46,960
it's gonna basically narrow the set of
 

3711
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,069
it's gonna basically narrow the set of
deals that they're going to be willing

3712
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
deals that they're going to be willing
 

3713
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,390
deals that they're going to be willing
to accept instead of violence at the

3714
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
to accept instead of violence at the
 

3715
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,109
to accept instead of violence at the
same time most of the time

3716
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
same time most of the time
 

3717
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,789
same time most of the time
it's not enough because the leaders

3718
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
it's not enough because the leaders
 

3719
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,390
it's not enough because the leaders
still bear a lot of costs of war you

3720
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
still bear a lot of costs of war you
 

3721
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,950
still bear a lot of costs of war you
could be deposed you could be killed you

3722
01:02:58,950 --> 01:02:58,960
could be deposed you could be killed you
 

3723
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,390
could be deposed you could be killed you
could be tried

3724
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
could be tried
 

3725
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,150
could be tried
and the public purse is going to be

3726
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
and the public purse is going to be
 

3727
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,670
and the public purse is going to be
empty that's like the one story

3728
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:03,680
empty that's like the one story
 

3729
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,349
empty that's like the one story
throughout history is at the end of the

3730
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
throughout history is at the end of the
 

3731
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:08,309
throughout history is at the end of the
day your regime is broke as a result of

3732
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
day your regime is broke as a result of
 

3733
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:10,710
day your regime is broke as a result of
war and so you still internalize that a

3734
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:10,720
war and so you still internalize that a
 

3735
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,829
war and so you still internalize that a
little bit

3736
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:11,839
little bit
 

3737
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:15,430
little bit
um if i had to say like you know in my

3738
01:03:15,430 --> 01:03:15,440
um if i had to say like you know in my
 

3739
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,270
um if i had to say like you know in my
three buckets or through my bucket so

3740
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:17,280
three buckets or through my bucket so
 

3741
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,549
three buckets or through my bucket so
far i sort of started with like

3742
01:03:18,549 --> 01:03:18,559
far i sort of started with like
 

3743
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,710
far i sort of started with like
ukrainian intransigence

3744
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:20,720
ukrainian intransigence
 

3745
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,150
ukrainian intransigence
and then i jumped and then i said the

3746
01:03:22,150 --> 01:03:22,160
and then i jumped and then i said the
 

3747
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:23,589
and then i jumped and then i said the
essentially then you really have to

3748
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
essentially then you really have to
 

3749
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:25,510
essentially then you really have to
understand russian autocracy for just to

3750
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:25,520
understand russian autocracy for just to
 

3751
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:28,069
understand russian autocracy for just to
understand why they would ask

3752
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:28,079
understand why they would ask
 

3753
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,069
understand why they would ask
something so cool but i mean i think the

3754
01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:30,079
something so cool but i mean i think the
 

3755
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,349
something so cool but i mean i think the
uncertainty

3756
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:31,359
uncertainty
 

3757
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,870
uncertainty
is really

3758
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
is really
 

3759
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,549
is really
important here as well like if you think

3760
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
important here as well like if you think
 

3761
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:36,789
important here as well like if you think
about like think of all the things the

3762
01:03:36,789 --> 01:03:36,799
about like think of all the things the
 

3763
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,870
about like think of all the things the
way this is played out and just in some

3764
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:38,880
way this is played out and just in some
 

3765
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,029
way this is played out and just in some
ways how many how in how many ways we've

3766
01:03:41,029 --> 01:03:41,039
ways how many how in how many ways we've
 

3767
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:43,510
ways how many how in how many ways we've
been surprised we've been surprised by

3768
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:43,520
been surprised we've been surprised by
 

3769
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,510
been surprised we've been surprised by
the unity and the coherence of the west

3770
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
the unity and the coherence of the west
 

3771
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,670
the unity and the coherence of the west
and the sanctions that's sort of what's

3772
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:47,680
and the sanctions that's sort of what's
 

3773
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,029
and the sanctions that's sort of what's
happened is it was in the realm of

3774
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
happened is it was in the realm of
 

3775
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:50,789
happened is it was in the realm of
possibility but it was sort of like the

3776
01:03:50,789 --> 01:03:50,799
possibility but it was sort of like the
 

3777
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:52,549
possibility but it was sort of like the
best case scenario from the

3778
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
best case scenario from the
 

3779
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,150
best case scenario from the
perspective of the west and the worst

3780
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
perspective of the west and the worst
 

3781
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,069
perspective of the west and the worst
case scenario for the russians

3782
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
case scenario for the russians
 

3783
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,069
case scenario for the russians
the second thing is just the pluckiness

3784
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
the second thing is just the pluckiness
 

3785
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:00,549
the second thing is just the pluckiness
and the effectiveness and the

3786
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:00,559
and the effectiveness and the
 

3787
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,630
and the effectiveness and the
intransigence and the nobility of this

3788
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:02,640
intransigence and the nobility of this
 

3789
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,349
intransigence and the nobility of this
ukrainian resistance that's again was

3790
01:04:05,349 --> 01:04:05,359
ukrainian resistance that's again was
 

3791
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:06,950
ukrainian resistance that's again was
within the realm of possibility but

3792
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
within the realm of possibility but
 

3793
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,630
within the realm of possibility but
wasn't necessarily the likely thing

3794
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:08,640
wasn't necessarily the likely thing
 

3795
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,150
wasn't necessarily the likely thing
right it was again maybe the worst

3796
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,160
right it was again maybe the worst
 

3797
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:11,750
right it was again maybe the worst
realization for russia the best

3798
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:11,760
realization for russia the best
 

3799
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,230
realization for russia the best
realization in some sense for

3800
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
realization in some sense for
 

3801
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,910
realization in some sense for
in terms of revealed strength and

3802
01:04:15,910 --> 01:04:15,920
in terms of revealed strength and
 

3803
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,589
in terms of revealed strength and
resolve

3804
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:17,599
resolve
 

3805
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:18,549
resolve
um

3806
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:18,559
um
 

3807
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:19,670
um
and then the other thing that's been

3808
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
and then the other thing that's been
 

3809
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:21,750
and then the other thing that's been
revealed is just how

3810
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
revealed is just how
 

3811
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,270
revealed is just how
like the from the corruption and

3812
01:04:23,270 --> 01:04:23,280
like the from the corruption and
 

3813
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,430
like the from the corruption and
ineptitude and problems on the russian

3814
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
ineptitude and problems on the russian
 

3815
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,510
ineptitude and problems on the russian
military side them again

3816
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
military side them again
 

3817
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,029
military side them again
within the realm of possibility maybe

3818
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:29,039
within the realm of possibility maybe
 

3819
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,069
within the realm of possibility maybe
people who really knew the russian

3820
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:30,079
people who really knew the russian
 

3821
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,829
people who really knew the russian
military are less surprised than the

3822
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:31,839
military are less surprised than the
 

3823
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,230
military are less surprised than the
rest of us but but also

3824
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:34,240
rest of us but but also
 

3825
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,670
rest of us but but also
one of the worst possible draws for

3826
01:04:35,670 --> 01:04:35,680
one of the worst possible draws for
 

3827
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,750
one of the worst possible draws for
russia and so

3828
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:37,760
russia and so
 

3829
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,589
russia and so
putin asking this

3830
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
putin asking this
 

3831
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,270
putin asking this
terrible price

3832
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
terrible price
 

3833
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,870
terrible price
and expecting

3834
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:42,880
and expecting
 

3835
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:44,870
and expecting
ukraine to roll over

3836
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
ukraine to roll over
 

3837
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,230
ukraine to roll over
or the west to roll over at least to a

3838
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:46,240
or the west to roll over at least to a
 

3839
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:48,789
or the west to roll over at least to a
degree

3840
01:04:48,789 --> 01:04:48,799

 

3841
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:50,390

was

3842
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
was
 

3843
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,150
was
based on like a different set of

3844
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:52,160
based on like a different set of
 

3845
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:54,470
based on like a different set of
probably it was based on just expecting

3846
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
probably it was based on just expecting
 

3847
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,430
probably it was based on just expecting
something in the middle of the

3848
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
something in the middle of the
 

3849
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,349
something in the middle of the
probability distribution and not one of

3850
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
probability distribution and not one of
 

3851
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,349
probability distribution and not one of
all these different tail events and so

3852
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
all these different tail events and so
 

3853
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,789
all these different tail events and so
the fact that the world's so uncertain

3854
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
the fact that the world's so uncertain
 

3855
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,630
the fact that the world's so uncertain
and the fact that putin can come with a

3856
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:02,640
and the fact that putin can come with a
 

3857
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,470
and the fact that putin can come with a
different set of expectations than the

3858
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
different set of expectations than the
 

3859
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,230
different set of expectations than the
ukrainians in the west and all these

3860
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
ukrainians in the west and all these
 

3861
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:07,430
ukrainians in the west and all these
players can

3862
01:05:07,430 --> 01:05:07,440
players can
 

3863
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,309
players can
just have a hard time agreeing on just

3864
01:05:10,309 --> 01:05:10,319
just have a hard time agreeing on just
 

3865
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,309
just have a hard time agreeing on just
what the facts are because we live in an

3866
01:05:12,309 --> 01:05:12,319
what the facts are because we live in an
 

3867
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:13,589
what the facts are because we live in an
uncertain world everyone's quick to say

3868
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
uncertain world everyone's quick to say
 

3869
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,430
uncertain world everyone's quick to say
oh we miscalculated well i'm not i don't

3870
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:15,440
oh we miscalculated well i'm not i don't
 

3871
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:17,430
oh we miscalculated well i'm not i don't
know if he miscalculated i think he just

3872
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440
know if he miscalculated i think he just
 

3873
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,309
know if he miscalculated i think he just
he got a really bad draw

3874
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
he got a really bad draw
 

3875
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:22,390
he got a really bad draw
on in terms of the what the realized

3876
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:22,400
on in terms of the what the realized
 

3877
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:24,870
on in terms of the what the realized
outcomes are here and so that i mean

3878
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:24,880
outcomes are here and so that i mean
 

3879
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:27,109
outcomes are here and so that i mean
good for everybody else in some sense

3880
01:05:27,109 --> 01:05:27,119
good for everybody else in some sense
 

3881
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,390
good for everybody else in some sense
except you know the fact that it's

3882
01:05:28,390 --> 01:05:28,400
except you know the fact that it's
 

3883
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,670
except you know the fact that it's
involving a lot of violence is the

3884
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
involving a lot of violence is the
 

3885
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,750
involving a lot of violence is the
tragedy so uh well there's also economic

3886
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:31,760
tragedy so uh well there's also economic
 

3887
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,829
tragedy so uh well there's also economic
pain yeah just for the russian people

3888
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
pain yeah just for the russian people
 

3889
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,589
pain yeah just for the russian people
and the ukrainian people but the whole

3890
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:35,599
and the ukrainian people but the whole
 

3891
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,390
and the ukrainian people but the whole
world the whole world yeah so it

3892
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:38,400
world the whole world yeah so it
 

3893
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,750
world the whole world yeah so it
you know

3894
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:39,760
you know
 

3895
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,190
you know
uh you could talk about

3896
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
uh you could talk about
 

3897
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:45,589
uh you could talk about
things that you we are surprised from an

3898
01:05:45,589 --> 01:05:45,599
things that you we are surprised from an
 

3899
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:48,069
things that you we are surprised from an
analysis perspective of

3900
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:48,079
analysis perspective of
 

3901
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:49,910
analysis perspective of
small victories here or there but i

3902
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:49,920
small victories here or there but i
 

3903
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,750
small victories here or there but i
think it's universally true that

3904
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:51,760
think it's universally true that
 

3905
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:54,710
think it's universally true that
everybody loses once again

3906
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
everybody loses once again
 

3907
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,710
everybody loses once again
in this war right and so the question is

3908
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720
in this war right and so the question is
 

3909
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:57,829
in this war right and so the question is
is like

3910
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
is like
 

3911
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:59,829
is like
when does it you know why did why did

3912
01:05:59,829 --> 01:05:59,839
when does it you know why did why did
 

3913
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:01,829
when does it you know why did why did
russia choose to invade when ukraine

3914
01:06:01,829 --> 01:06:01,839
russia choose to invade when ukraine
 

3915
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:03,109
russia choose to invade when ukraine
didn't give this up well russia

3916
01:06:03,109 --> 01:06:03,119
didn't give this up well russia
 

3917
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:04,789
didn't give this up well russia
anticipated that it would be able to

3918
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:04,799
anticipated that it would be able to
 

3919
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:07,270
anticipated that it would be able to
seize

3920
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:07,280
seize
 

3921
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:09,430
seize
what it wanted the the available bargain

3922
01:06:09,430 --> 01:06:09,440
what it wanted the the available bargain
 

3923
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,510
what it wanted the the available bargain
that it deserved quote unquote based on

3924
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
that it deserved quote unquote based on
 

3925
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,309
that it deserved quote unquote based on
its power in the world it wasn't getting

3926
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:14,319
its power in the world it wasn't getting
 

3927
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:16,549
its power in the world it wasn't getting
and so it thought it could take that

3928
01:06:16,549 --> 01:06:16,559
and so it thought it could take that
 

3929
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:18,789
and so it thought it could take that
and and the uncertainty around that made

3930
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:18,799
and and the uncertainty around that made
 

3931
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:21,190
and and the uncertainty around that made
it potentially more likely that he would

3932
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:21,200
it potentially more likely that he would
 

3933
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,109
it potentially more likely that he would
choose to do this but in particular one

3934
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:23,119
choose to do this but in particular one
 

3935
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:25,510
choose to do this but in particular one
of the other things that i think is

3936
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:25,520
of the other things that i think is
 

3937
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,109
of the other things that i think is
probably less important this context but

3938
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
probably less important this context but
 

3939
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,109
probably less important this context but
still plays a role but less important

3940
01:06:29,109 --> 01:06:29,119
still plays a role but less important
 

3941
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:31,430
still plays a role but less important
than many wars is the is the fact that

3942
01:06:31,430 --> 01:06:31,440
than many wars is the is the fact that
 

3943
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:32,630
than many wars is the is the fact that
it's really hard to resolve that

3944
01:06:32,630 --> 01:06:32,640
it's really hard to resolve that
 

3945
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,069
it's really hard to resolve that
uncertainty

3946
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
uncertainty
 

3947
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,750
uncertainty
right in theory

3948
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
right in theory
 

3949
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,630
right in theory
ukraine should be able to say look

3950
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:38,640
ukraine should be able to say look
 

3951
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:40,470
ukraine should be able to say look
this is exactly how resolved we are

3952
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480
this is exactly how resolved we are
 

3953
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,549
this is exactly how resolved we are
we're super resolved

3954
01:06:42,549 --> 01:06:42,559
we're super resolved
 

3955
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,549
we're super resolved
and your military is not as strong as

3956
01:06:44,549 --> 01:06:44,559
and your military is not as strong as
 

3957
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,470
and your military is not as strong as
you think it is you mean before the

3958
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:46,480
you think it is you mean before the
 

3959
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:47,829
you think it is you mean before the
conference before the conference

3960

conference before the conference
 

3961
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,349
conference before the conference
everybody should be like you know on the

3962
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:49,359
everybody should be like you know on the
 

3963
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:50,390
everybody should be like you know on the
table here

3964
01:06:50,390 --> 01:06:50,400
table here
 

3965
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,150
table here
no one wants yeah here's your cards

3966
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:52,160
no one wants yeah here's your cards
 

3967
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:54,470
no one wants yeah here's your cards
exactly like that's as a competitor in

3968
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
exactly like that's as a competitor in
 

3969
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,309
exactly like that's as a competitor in
this you can use that uncertainty to

3970
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
this you can use that uncertainty to
 

3971
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:57,990
this you can use that uncertainty to
your advantage i can try to convince you

3972
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
your advantage i can try to convince you
 

3973
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,630
your advantage i can try to convince you
i can bluff yeah all right and so anyone

3974
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640
i can bluff yeah all right and so anyone
 

3975
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,710
i can bluff yeah all right and so anyone
who's ever played poker and bluffed or

3976
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
who's ever played poker and bluffed or
 

3977
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,069
who's ever played poker and bluffed or
called a bluff

3978
01:07:04,069 --> 01:07:04,079
called a bluff
 

3979
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:05,109
called a bluff
that's the inefficiency that's like

3980
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:05,119
that's the inefficiency that's like
 

3981
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,549
that's the inefficiency that's like
that's the analogy in some ways to war

3982
01:07:06,549 --> 01:07:06,559
that's the analogy in some ways to war
 

3983
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,029
that's the analogy in some ways to war
it's not the perfect analogy but it the

3984
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
it's not the perfect analogy but it the
 

3985
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,390
it's not the perfect analogy but it the
the uncertainty in the circumstance you

3986
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:10,400
the uncertainty in the circumstance you
 

3987
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,829
the uncertainty in the circumstance you
don't have to miscalculate the fact that

3988
01:07:11,829 --> 01:07:11,839
don't have to miscalculate the fact that
 

3989
01:07:11,839 --> 01:07:14,710
don't have to miscalculate the fact that
you if you bluff and lose this wasn't

3990
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
you if you bluff and lose this wasn't
 

3991
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,950
you if you bluff and lose this wasn't
that you miscalculated you made an

3992
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:16,960
that you miscalculated you made an
 

3993
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,470
that you miscalculated you made an
optimal choice given the uncertainty of

3994
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
optimal choice given the uncertainty of
 

3995
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,390
optimal choice given the uncertainty of
the situation to take a gamble and that

3996
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:20,400
the situation to take a gamble and that
 

3997
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,630
the situation to take a gamble and that
was a wiser thing for you to do than to

3998
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:22,640
was a wiser thing for you to do than to
 

3999
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,150
was a wiser thing for you to do than to
not bluff

4000
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
not bluff
 

4001
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,950
not bluff
and just to fold or to just not

4002
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:26,960
and just to fold or to just not
 

4003
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:29,109
and just to fold or to just not
paying in that round and so the

4004
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
paying in that round and so the
 

4005
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,950
paying in that round and so the
uncertainty the situation gives both

4006
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
uncertainty the situation gives both
 

4007
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,109
uncertainty the situation gives both
sides incentives to bluff gives neither

4008
01:07:33,109 --> 01:07:33,119
sides incentives to bluff gives neither
 

4009
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,710
sides incentives to bluff gives neither
side an incentive to try to reveal the

4010
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
side an incentive to try to reveal the
 

4011
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,470
side an incentive to try to reveal the
truth and then at some point the other

4012
01:07:36,470 --> 01:07:36,480
truth and then at some point the other
 

4013
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,829
truth and then at some point the other
side says you know what you say you're

4014
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:37,839
side says you know what you say you're
 

4015
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:39,349
side says you know what you say you're
resolved

4016
01:07:39,349 --> 01:07:39,359
resolved
 

4017
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:40,710
resolved
you say you're not you're going to mount

4018
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:40,720
you say you're not you're going to mount
 

4019
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:43,750
you say you're not you're going to mount
an insurgency well guess what

4020
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:43,760
an insurgency well guess what
 

4021
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:44,950
an insurgency well guess what
every other

4022
01:07:44,950 --> 01:07:44,960
every other

every other
you know people on my border has folded

4024
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
you know people on my border has folded
 

4025
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,029
you know people on my border has folded
and you're gonna fold two the minute the

4026
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:51,039
and you're gonna fold two the minute the
 

4027
01:07:51,039 --> 01:07:52,630
and you're gonna fold two the minute the
tanks roll in and the minute the air

4028
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
tanks roll in and the minute the air
 

4029
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,549
tanks roll in and the minute the air

cost of war you might have private

4520
01:16:12,790 --> 01:16:12,800
cost of war you might have private
 

4521
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:15,189
cost of war you might have private
incentives so yes bargains are harder to

4522
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
incentives so yes bargains are harder to
 

4523
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:17,430
incentives so yes bargains are harder to
find but it leads to all these nasty

4524
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:17,440
find but it leads to all these nasty
 

4525
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,950
find but it leads to all these nasty
interactions so early i said there's

4526
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:18,960
interactions so early i said there's
 

4527
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,590
interactions so early i said there's
this interaction between the values

4528
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:21,600
this interaction between the values
 

4529
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,110
this interaction between the values
and the unchecked leaders because those

4530
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:23,120
and the unchecked leaders because those
 

4531
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,590
and the unchecked leaders because those
idiosyncratic values of your leader

4532
01:16:25,590 --> 01:16:25,600
idiosyncratic values of your leader
 

4533
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,030
idiosyncratic values of your leader
become more important when they're

4534
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:27,040
become more important when they're
 

4535
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,510
become more important when they're
unchecked but the uncertainty point you

4536
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
unchecked but the uncertainty point you
 

4537
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,350
unchecked but the uncertainty point you
just made is like a deep point it's to

4538
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
just made is like a deep point it's to
 

4539
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:34,310
just made is like a deep point it's to
say actually that like the fundamental

4540
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:34,320
say actually that like the fundamental
 

4541
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,030
say actually that like the fundamental
problem that all autocrats have is an

4542
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:37,040
problem that all autocrats have is an
 

4543
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,110
problem that all autocrats have is an
information problem because nobody wants

4544
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
information problem because nobody wants
 

4545
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:41,510
information problem because nobody wants
to give them the right information and

4546
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
to give them the right information and
 

4547
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,110
to give them the right information and
they they have very few ways to

4548
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
they they have very few ways to
 

4549
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:45,189
they they have very few ways to
aggregate information if they're not

4550
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
aggregate information if they're not
 

4551
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:48,470
aggregate information if they're not
popular right and so so there's a whole

4552
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:48,480
popular right and so so there's a whole
 

4553
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:49,990
popular right and so so there's a whole
cottage industry of political science

4554
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:50,000
cottage industry of political science
 

4555
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,910
cottage industry of political science
sort of talking about why do

4556
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920
sort of talking about why do
 

4557
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:54,390
sort of talking about why do
like why autocrats love

4558
01:16:54,390 --> 01:16:54,400
like why autocrats love
 

4559
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,149
like why autocrats love
fixed elections and why they love

4560
01:16:56,149 --> 01:16:56,159
fixed elections and why they love
 

4561
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,830
fixed elections and why they love
twitter and why they actually like it in

4562
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
twitter and why they actually like it in
 

4563
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,430
twitter and why they actually like it in
a controlled way is it it solves an

4564
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
a controlled way is it it solves an
 

4565
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,030
a controlled way is it it solves an
information problem like that's your

4566
01:17:01,030 --> 01:17:01,040
information problem like that's your
 

4567
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,390
information problem like that's your
cruci if you're like xi jinping or or or

4568
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:04,400
cruci if you're like xi jinping or or or
 

4569
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,990
cruci if you're like xi jinping or or or
vladimir putin you need to solve an

4570
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
vladimir putin you need to solve an
 

4571
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,750
vladimir putin you need to solve an
information problem just to avoid having

4572
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
information problem just to avoid having
 

4573
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,030
information problem just to avoid having
rebellion on your hands in your own

4574
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
rebellion on your hands in your own
 

4575
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,350
rebellion on your hands in your own
country every day because

4576
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:11,360
country every day because
 

4577
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,430
country every day because
uncertainty kind of gets magnified and

4578
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
uncertainty kind of gets magnified and
 

4579
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,110
uncertainty kind of gets magnified and
you get all this distorted information

4580
01:17:15,110 --> 01:17:15,120
you get all this distorted information
 

4581
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:16,950
you get all this distorted information
in this apparatus of control and so that

4582
01:17:16,950 --> 01:17:16,960
in this apparatus of control and so that
 

4583
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:19,189
in this apparatus of control and so that
so that's like another nasty interaction

4584
01:17:19,189 --> 01:17:19,199
so that's like another nasty interaction
 

4585
01:17:19,199 --> 01:17:20,950
so that's like another nasty interaction
between uncertainty

4586
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:20,960
between uncertainty
 

4587
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,149
between uncertainty
and unchecked leaders is you end up

4588
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
and unchecked leaders is you end up
 

4589
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:26,310
and unchecked leaders is you end up
in this situation where you're getting

4590
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
in this situation where you're getting
 

4591
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,229
in this situation where you're getting
bad information and and you it's not

4592
01:17:28,229 --> 01:17:28,239
bad information and and you it's not
 

4593
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,870
bad information and and you it's not
that you don't you believe your own lies

4594
01:17:30,870 --> 01:17:30,880
that you don't you believe your own lies
 

4595
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,470
that you don't you believe your own lies
it's just that you never you sort of

4596
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:32,480
it's just that you never you sort of
 

4597
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,470
it's just that you never you sort of
believe you're sort of averaging what

4598
01:17:34,470 --> 01:17:34,480
believe you're sort of averaging what
 

4599
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,910
believe you're sort of averaging what
you believe over the available

you believe over the available
 

4601
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,790
you believe over the available

information and you don't realize that
 

4603
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,390
information and you don't realize that
it's such a distorted and biased

01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,400
it's such a distorted and biased
 

4605
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,870
it's such a distorted and biased

01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,550
one of the other things about this time
there was a surprise to me in in the fog

4610
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
there was a surprise to me in in the fog
 

4611
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,870
there was a surprise to me in in the fog
of uncertainty

4612
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:50,880
of uncertainty
 

4613
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:53,030
of uncertainty
how

01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
how
 

4615
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:56,070
how
sort of seemingly

4616
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
sort of seemingly
 

4617
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:58,709
sort of seemingly
likely nuclear war

4618
01:17:58,709 --> 01:17:58,719
likely nuclear war

became
not likely but

not likely but
 

4623
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,310
not likely but
how it less unlikely than before exactly

01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
how it less unlikely than before exactly
 

4625
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,229
how it less unlikely than before exactly
that's a better way to say it it started

4626
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
that's a better way to say it it started
 

4627
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:06,950
that's a better way to say it it started
to

to
 

4629
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:08,709
to
take a random

take a random

01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,470
maybe like it's hard to know but it's
like oh wow we're actually normally

01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:18,480
like oh wow we're actually normally

talking about this as if this is part of

01:18:20,950 --> 01:18:20,960
talking about this as if this is part of
 

4641
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,350
talking about this as if this is part of
the calculus part of the options but

the calculus part of the options but
 

4643
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:25,110
the calculus part of the options but
before we talk about nuclear war because

4644
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:25,120
before we talk about nuclear war because
 

4645
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,430
before we talk about nuclear war because
i'm going to need a drink

4646
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,440
i'm going to need a drink
 

4647
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,709
i'm going to need a drink
do you need to go to the bathroom sure

4648
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
do you need to go to the bathroom sure
 

4649
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:30,630
do you need to go to the bathroom sure
i'll take a break

4650
01:18:30,630 --> 01:18:30,640
i'll take a break
 

4651
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,350
i'll take a break
so back to nuclear war

4652
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
so back to nuclear war
 

4653
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,189
so back to nuclear war
what do you think about this that people

4654
01:18:35,189 --> 01:18:35,199
what do you think about this that people
 

4655
01:18:35,199 --> 01:18:37,910
what do you think about this that people
were nonchalantly speaking about

4656
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
were nonchalantly speaking about
 

4657
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,709
were nonchalantly speaking about
nuclear wars if it doesn't lead to the

4658
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:40,719
nuclear wars if it doesn't lead to the
 

4659
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:43,030
nuclear wars if it doesn't lead to the
potential annihilation of the human

4660
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
potential annihilation of the human
 

4661
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,550
potential annihilation of the human
species

4662
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
species
 

4663
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,430
species
um

4664
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
um
 

4665
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,950
um
what are the chances that our world

4666
01:18:46,950 --> 01:18:46,960
what are the chances that our world
 

4667
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:49,510
what are the chances that our world
descends into nuclear war within your

4668
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
descends into nuclear war within your
 

4669
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,390
descends into nuclear war within your
framework with you you wear many hats

4670
01:18:52,390 --> 01:18:52,400
framework with you you wear many hats
 

4671
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:56,310
framework with you you wear many hats
yeah one is uh sort of

4672
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320
yeah one is uh sort of
 

4673
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,430
yeah one is uh sort of
the

4674
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
the
 

4675
01:18:57,440 --> 01:19:00,470
the
and now uh analyst right and then one is

4676
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
and now uh analyst right and then one is
 

4677
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:02,630
and now uh analyst right and then one is
a human what do you think of the chances

4678
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
a human what do you think of the chances
 

4679
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,229
a human what do you think of the chances
we get to see nuclear war in this

4680
01:19:04,229 --> 01:19:04,239
we get to see nuclear war in this
 

4681
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,390
we get to see nuclear war in this
century well you know the the doomsday

century well you know the the doomsday
 

4683
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,470
century well you know the the doomsday
the official doomsday clock for nuclear

4684
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,480
the official doomsday clock for nuclear
 

4685
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:10,709
the official doomsday clock for nuclear
warfare sits in the lobby of my building

4686
01:19:10,709 --> 01:19:10,719
warfare sits in the lobby of my building
 

4687
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:12,790
warfare sits in the lobby of my building
um the bulletin of atomic scientists

4688
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:12,800
um the bulletin of atomic scientists
 

4689
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,630
um the bulletin of atomic scientists
sort of shares a building with us so

4690
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
sort of shares a building with us so
 

4691
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,310
sort of shares a building with us so
it's it's always there every day can you

4692
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
it's it's always there every day can you
 

4693
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,990
it's it's always there every day can you
describe what the doomsday clock is the

4694
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
describe what the doomsday clock is the
 

4695
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,990
describe what the doomsday clock is the
bulletin of atomic scientists it's

4696
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
bulletin of atomic scientists it's
 

4697
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,750
bulletin of atomic scientists it's
something that this group of physicists

4698
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:21,760
something that this group of physicists
 

4699
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,350
something that this group of physicists
sort of said to sort of mark just how

4700
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:23,360
sort of said to sort of mark just how
 

4701
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,510
sort of said to sort of mark just how
close we are to nuclear catastrophe and

4702
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
close we are to nuclear catastrophe and
 

4703
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,750
close we are to nuclear catastrophe and
they started it decades ago and it's and

4704
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:27,760
they started it decades ago and it's and
 

4705
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:29,030
they started it decades ago and it's and
it's a clock and it's sort of how close

4706
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,040
it's a clock and it's sort of how close
 

4707
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,550
it's a clock and it's sort of how close
are we to midnight where midnight is

4708
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:30,560
are we to midnight where midnight is
 

4709
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,990
are we to midnight where midnight is
nuclear armageddon and or the

4710
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:32,000
nuclear armageddon and or the
 

4711
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,990
nuclear armageddon and or the
destruction of humanity and and it's

4712
01:19:33,990 --> 01:19:34,000
destruction of humanity and and it's
 

4713
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,910
destruction of humanity and and it's
been sitting i mean it's actually it

4714
01:19:35,910 --> 01:19:35,920
been sitting i mean it's actually it
 

4715
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,510
been sitting i mean it's actually it
hasn't moved as close to it hasn't moved

4716
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
hasn't moved as close to it hasn't moved
 

4717
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,110
hasn't moved as close to it hasn't moved
as close to

4718
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:41,120
as close to
 

4719
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,030
as close to
midnight in the last few weeks as it

4720
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
midnight in the last few weeks as it
 

4721
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:45,910
midnight in the last few weeks as it
probably should have only because

4722
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
probably should have only because
 

4723
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,669
probably should have only because
it was already so close there's actually

4724
01:19:47,669 --> 01:19:47,679
it was already so close there's actually
 

4725
01:19:47,679 --> 01:19:49,510
it was already so close there's actually
limited room for it to move for a bunch

4726
01:19:49,510 --> 01:19:49,520
limited room for it to move for a bunch
 

4727
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:51,350
limited room for it to move for a bunch
of other reasons i think it's there's a

4728
01:19:51,350 --> 01:19:51,360
of other reasons i think it's there's a
 

4729
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,709
of other reasons i think it's there's a
whole political thing that once it's

4730
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:52,719
whole political thing that once it's
 

4731
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:54,149
whole political thing that once it's
really hard it's really easy to move it

4732
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
really hard it's really easy to move it
 

4733
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:55,590
really hard it's really easy to move it
closer

4734
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
closer
 

4735
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:56,870
closer
and it's really hard if you're the

4736
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:56,880
and it's really hard if you're the
 

4737
01:19:56,880 --> 01:19:58,149
and it's really hard if you're the
person in charge of that clock to move

4738
01:19:58,149 --> 01:19:58,159
person in charge of that clock to move
 

4739
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:00,149
person in charge of that clock to move
it away right because that's always very

4740
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:00,159
it away right because that's always very
 

4741
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,750
it away right because that's always very
controversial so it always sits there

4742
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760
controversial so it always sits there
 

4743
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,149
controversial so it always sits there
but it it forces you to think about it a

4744
01:20:04,149 --> 01:20:04,159
but it it forces you to think about it a
 

4745
01:20:04,159 --> 01:20:06,070
but it it forces you to think about it a
little bit every day

4746
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
little bit every day
 

4747
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,510
little bit every day
um

4748
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:07,520
um
 

4749
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:10,950
um
and i admit i was

4750
01:20:10,950 --> 01:20:10,960
and i admit i was
 

4751
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:13,750
and i admit i was
nonchalant about it in till recently in

4752
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:13,760
nonchalant about it in till recently in
 

4753
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,430
nonchalant about it in till recently in
a way that many

4754
01:20:15,430 --> 01:20:15,440
a way that many
 

4755
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,189
a way that many
many other people were

4756
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
many other people were
 

4757
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:20,629
many other people were
um i still think the risk is very low

4758
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:20,639
um i still think the risk is very low
 

4759
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:21,510
um i still think the risk is very low
but

4760
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
but
 

4761
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,430
but
um

4762
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
um
 

4763
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,709
um
kind of for the reasons we've talked

4764
01:20:24,709 --> 01:20:24,719
kind of for the reasons we've talked
 

4765
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:25,750
kind of for the reasons we've talked
it's just so

4766
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,760
it's just so
 

4767
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,390
it's just so
you know unimaginably costly that nobody

4768
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:28,400
you know unimaginably costly that nobody
 

4769
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,390
you know unimaginably costly that nobody
wants to go that route so so it's like

4770
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400
wants to go that route so so it's like
 

4771
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,950
wants to go that route so so it's like
the it's like the extreme version of my

4772
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
the it's like the extreme version of my
 

4773
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,870
the it's like the extreme version of my
whole argument with why we most of the

4774
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
whole argument with why we most of the
 

4775
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,550
whole argument with why we most of the
time don't fight is because it's just so

4776
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
time don't fight is because it's just so
 

4777
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,430
time don't fight is because it's just so
damn costly and so this is that's that's

4778
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:39,440
damn costly and so this is that's that's
 

4779
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,750
damn costly and so this is that's that's
the incentive not to use this and and if

4780
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:41,760
the incentive not to use this and and if
 

4781
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,270
the incentive not to use this and and if
they do use it that's the incentive to

4782
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:43,280
they do use it that's the incentive to
 

4783
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,390
they do use it that's the incentive to
use it in a very restrained way

4784
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:46,400
use it in a very restrained way
 

4785
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,270
use it in a very restrained way
um

4786
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,280
um
 

4787
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,590
um
but that's not a lot of but but because

4788
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:49,600
but that's not a lot of but but because
 

4789
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,950
but that's not a lot of but but because
we know we do go to war and there's all

4790
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:50,960
we know we do go to war and there's all
 

4791
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:52,229
we know we do go to war and there's all
these things that interfere with it

4792
01:20:52,229 --> 01:20:52,239
these things that interfere with it
 

4793
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:54,149
these things that interfere with it
including miscalculation and all these

4794
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:54,159
including miscalculation and all these
 

4795
01:20:54,159 --> 01:20:55,830
including miscalculation and all these
human foibles

4796
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:55,840
human foibles
 

4797
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:56,790
human foibles
and and

4798
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:56,800
and and
 

4799
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,709
and and
several of those nuclear powers are not

4800
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
several of those nuclear powers are not
 

4801
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:00,390
several of those nuclear powers are not
accountable leaders

4802
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:00,400
accountable leaders
 

4803
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:02,470
accountable leaders
i think we have to be a lot more worried

4804
01:21:02,470 --> 01:21:02,480
i think we have to be a lot more worried
 

4805
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,470
i think we have to be a lot more worried
than many of us were very recently i

4806
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
than many of us were very recently i
 

4807
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,830
than many of us were very recently i
pointed out earlier like the whole

4808
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
pointed out earlier like the whole
 

4809
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,510
pointed out earlier like the whole
reason we're in this mess is because the

4810
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:07,520
reason we're in this mess is because the
 

4811
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:08,870
reason we're in this mess is because the
only people who have this private

4812
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
only people who have this private
 

4813
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,870
only people who have this private
interest in like having ukraine give up

4814
01:21:10,870 --> 01:21:10,880
interest in like having ukraine give up
 

4815
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,629
interest in like having ukraine give up
its freedom is

4816
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:12,639
its freedom is
 

4817
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:15,590
its freedom is
this russian cabal an elite that

4818
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:15,600
this russian cabal an elite that
 

4819
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:16,870
this russian cabal an elite that
gets their

threatened by
ukrainian democracy

4826

ukrainian democracy
 

4827
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,790
ukrainian democracy
what would how far would they go to hang

4828
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
what would how far would they go to hang
 

4829
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,550
what would how far would they go to hang
on to power

4830
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:26,560
on to power

01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:29,030
on to power
when push came to shove

4832
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
when push came to shove
 

4833
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,510
when push came to shove
is i think the thing that worries me

4834
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:31,520
is i think the thing that worries me
 

4835
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,910
is i think the thing that worries me
the most and is plainly what worries

4836
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:33,920
the most and is plainly what worries
 

4837
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,350
the most and is plainly what worries

very recently around the anniversary of
 

4861

about it was the united states going to
 

4865

01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
on the one hand i think it's almost
 

4869
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:06,950
on the one hand i think it's almost
unimaginable sort of like in the same

4870
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:06,960
unimaginable sort of like in the same
 

4871
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,030
unimaginable sort of like in the same
way i think that a nuclear war and

4872
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,040
way i think that a nuclear war and
 

4873
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,590
way i think that a nuclear war and
complete armageddon is unimaginable but

4874
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:11,600
complete armageddon is unimaginable but
 

4875
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:15,830
complete armageddon is unimaginable but
i remember something that uh

4876
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:15,840
i remember something that uh
 

4877
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,910
i remember something that uh
i when both of those questions get asked

4878
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:17,920
i when both of those questions get asked
 

4879
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,590
i when both of those questions get asked
i remember something i

4880
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
i remember something i
 

4881
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,270
i remember something i
i was in the audience of listening to

4882
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:21,280
i was in the audience of listening to
 

4883
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:24,310
i was in the audience of listening to
some great economists speak about the 20

4884
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
some great economists speak about the 20
 

4885
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,590
some great economists speak about the 20
years ago about the risk of an

4886
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:25,600
years ago about the risk of an
 

4887
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:27,270
years ago about the risk of an
argentina-style financial meltdown of

4888
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:27,280
argentina-style financial meltdown of
 

4889
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:28,870
argentina-style financial meltdown of
the united states like what's the total

4890
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:28,880
the united states like what's the total
 

4891
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:30,790
the united states like what's the total
financial collapse

4892
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
financial collapse
 

4893
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,870
financial collapse
and they said you know what the risk is

4894
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
and they said you know what the risk is
 

4895
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:35,430
and they said you know what the risk is
vanishingly small

4896
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:35,440
vanishingly small
 

4897
01:22:35,440 --> 01:22:37,750
vanishingly small
but that's terrifying because until

4898
01:22:37,750 --> 01:22:37,760
but that's terrifying because until
 

4899
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,229
but that's terrifying because until
recently the answer was zero

4900
01:22:40,229 --> 01:22:40,239
recently the answer was zero
 

4901
01:22:40,239 --> 01:22:42,149
recently the answer was zero
and so the fact that it's not zero

4902
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159
and so the fact that it's not zero
 

4903
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,629
and so the fact that it's not zero
should deeply deeply scare us all and we

4904
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:44,639
should deeply deeply scare us all and we
 

4905
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,870
should deeply deeply scare us all and we
should devote a lot of energy

4906
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
should devote a lot of energy
 

4907
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:49,110
should devote a lot of energy
to making it zero again and that's how i

4908
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:49,120
to making it zero again and that's how i
 

4909
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:50,470
to making it zero again and that's how i
feel about the risk of a civil war in

4910
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:50,480
feel about the risk of a civil war in
 

4911
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:51,910
feel about the risk of a civil war in
the u.s and that's how i feel about the

4912
01:22:51,910 --> 01:22:51,920
the u.s and that's how i feel about the
 

4913
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,790
the u.s and that's how i feel about the
risk of nuclear war is it's higher than

4914
01:22:54,790 --> 01:22:54,800
risk of nuclear war is it's higher than
 

4915
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,390
risk of nuclear war is it's higher than
it used to be and that should terrify us

4916
01:22:56,390 --> 01:22:56,400
it used to be and that should terrify us
 

4917
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:57,189
it used to be and that should terrify us
all

4918
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
all
 

4919
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:59,110
all
to me what terrifies me is that all this

4920
01:22:59,110 --> 01:22:59,120
to me what terrifies me is that all this
 

4921
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,669
to me what terrifies me is that all this
kind of stuff seems to happen

4922
01:23:01,669 --> 01:23:01,679
kind of stuff seems to happen
 

4923
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:03,830
kind of stuff seems to happen
like overnight like super quick and it

like overnight like super quick and it
 

4925
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:06,470
like overnight like super quick and it
escalates super quick when it happens so

4926
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
escalates super quick when it happens so
 

4927
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,189
escalates super quick when it happens so
it's not like

01:23:10,149 --> 01:23:10,159
i don't know
 

4931
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:12,070
i don't know
i don't know what i imagined but it just

4932
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
i don't know what i imagined but it just
 

4933
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,110
i don't know what i imagined but it just
happens

4934
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,120
happens
 

4935
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:15,590
happens
like if a nuclear war happened

4936
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:15,600
like if a nuclear war happened
 

4937
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,189
like if a nuclear war happened
it would be

4938
01:23:17,189 --> 01:23:17,199
it would be
 

4939
01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:19,510
it would be
something like a plane

4940
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:19,520
something like a plane
 

4941
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,629
something like a plane
like in this case with ukraine a nato

4942
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:22,639
like in this case with ukraine a nato
 

4943
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:25,270
like in this case with ukraine a nato
plane shut down over some

4944
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,280
plane shut down over some
 

4945
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:27,430
plane shut down over some
piece of land

4946
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:27,440
piece of land
 

4947
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,750
piece of land
by the russian forces

4948
01:23:29,750 --> 01:23:29,760
by the russian forces
 

4949
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,070
by the russian forces
or so the narrative would go but it

4950
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,080
or so the narrative would go but it
 

4951
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,750
or so the narrative would go but it
doesn't even matter what's true or not

4952
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:33,760
doesn't even matter what's true or not
 

4953
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,229
doesn't even matter what's true or not
in order to spark the first

4954
01:23:36,229 --> 01:23:36,239
in order to spark the first
 

4955
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,830
in order to spark the first
um

4956

um
 

4957
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:39,750
um
moment of escalation and then it just

4958
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
moment of escalation and then it just
 

4959
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,510
moment of escalation and then it just
goes it goes well i think that happens

4960
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
goes it goes well i think that happens
 

4961
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,590
goes it goes well i think that happens
sometimes i mean again it's this thing

4962
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:43,600
sometimes i mean again it's this thing
 

4963
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,189
sometimes i mean again it's this thing
that you know

01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:45,199
that you know
 

4965
01:23:45,199 --> 01:23:47,030
that you know
what social scientists call it selection

4966
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
what social scientists call it selection
 

4967
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,629
what social scientists call it selection
on the dependent variable like there's

4968
01:23:48,629 --> 01:23:48,639
on the dependent variable like there's
 

4969
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,310
on the dependent variable like there's
all these times when that didn't happen

4970
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:50,320
all these times when that didn't happen
 

4971
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,709
all these times when that didn't happen
when it stopped when it escalated one

4972
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
when it stopped when it escalated one
 

4973
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:54,390
when it stopped when it escalated one
step and then people paused or it

4974
01:23:54,390 --> 01:23:54,400
step and then people paused or it
 

4975
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:55,990
step and then people paused or it
escalated two steps and people said whoa

4976
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:56,000
escalated two steps and people said whoa
 

4977
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,189

um
 

4981
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,870
um
and and so we remember the times when it

4982
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
and and so we remember the times when it
 

4983
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,310

01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,320
studying conflict and
 

4999
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,629
studying conflict and
gangs and violence and of these other

5000
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:16,639
gangs and violence and of these other
 

5001
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,430
gangs and violence and of these other
kinds of groups also very sinister

5002
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:19,440
kinds of groups also very sinister
 

5003
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:21,590
kinds of groups also very sinister
um and

5004
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
um and
 

5005
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,350
um and
and most of the time they don't fight

5006
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
and most of the time they don't fight
 

5007
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,189
and most of the time they don't fight
and that escalation doesn't happen so so

5008
01:24:25,189 --> 01:24:25,199
and that escalation doesn't happen so so
 

5009
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:26,950
and that escalation doesn't happen so so
the escalation does happen quickly

5010
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:26,960
the escalation does happen quickly
 

5011
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,189
the escalation does happen quickly
sometimes except when it doesn't which

5012
01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:29,199
sometimes except when it doesn't which
 

5013
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,950
sometimes except when it doesn't which
so we remember the ones when it does

5014
01:24:30,950 --> 01:24:30,960
so we remember the ones when it does
 

5015
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,390
so we remember the ones when it does
it's really important to think about all

5016
01:24:32,390 --> 01:24:32,400
it's really important to think about all
 

5017
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:35,669
it's really important to think about all
that like um

5018
01:24:35,669 --> 01:24:35,679

 

5019

human history is um
had

5036
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:55,280
had
 

5037
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:56,830
had
been defined by

5038
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:56,840
been defined by
 

5039

human history is just peaceful like
 

5043
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:04,070
human history is just peaceful like
farming life

5044
01:25:04,070 --> 01:25:04,080
farming life
 

5045
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,550
farming life
like war we kind of remember the wars

5046
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:06,560
like war we kind of remember the wars
 

5047
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,390
like war we kind of remember the wars
but most of human history is just you

5048
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
but most of human history is just you
 

5049
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:09,990
but most of human history is just you
know is life

5050
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,000
know is life
 

5051
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,830
know is life
yeah and most of the competition between

5052
01:25:11,830 --> 01:25:11,840
yeah and most of the competition between
 

5053
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:13,430
yeah and most of the competition between
nations was like

5054
01:25:13,430 --> 01:25:13,440
nations was like
 

5055
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:14,629
nations was like
blood

5056
01:25:14,629 --> 01:25:14,639
blood
 

5057
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,910
blood
i would say blood thirsty without

5058
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:17,920
i would say blood thirsty without
 

5059
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,590
i would say blood thirsty without
drinking that blood in the sense that it

5060
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
drinking that blood in the sense that it
 

5061
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,629
drinking that blood in the sense that it
was intense it would loathe some

5062
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
was intense it would loathe some
 

5063
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:25,189
was intense it would loathe some
and so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of

5064
01:25:25,189 --> 01:25:25,199
and so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of
 

5065
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:28,390
and so a lot of the rivalry and a lot of
the competition which is also can be

5066
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:28,400
the competition which is also can be
 

5067
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:30,070
the competition which is also can be
problematic in its own ways is not

5068
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
problematic in its own ways is not
 

5069
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,070
problematic in its own ways is not
violent and most of human history is

5070
01:25:32,070 --> 01:25:32,080
violent and most of human history is
 

5071
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:33,830
violent and most of human history is
about the oppression

5072
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
about the oppression
 

5073
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,550
about the oppression
of the majority by a few

5074
01:25:36,550 --> 01:25:36,560
of the majority by a few
 

5075
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:37,350
of the majority by a few
and

5076
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
and
 

5077
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,430
and
the their moments when they rise up and

5078
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
the their moments when they rise up and
 

5079
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:41,350
the their moments when they rise up and
revolt and there's a revolution we

5080
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,360
revolt and there's a revolution we
 

5081
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,030
revolt and there's a revolution we
remember those but most of the time they

5082
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:43,040
remember those but most of the time they
 

5083
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,870
remember those but most of the time they
don't

5084
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
don't
 

5085
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,510
don't
and um and the story of political change

5086
01:25:47,510 --> 01:25:47,520
and um and the story of political change
 

5087
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,830
and um and the story of political change
and transformation and freedom is is

5088
01:25:49,830 --> 01:25:49,840
and transformation and freedom is is
 

5089
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:51,189
and transformation and freedom is is
there's a few revolutions that are

5090
01:25:51,189 --> 01:25:51,199
there's a few revolutions that are
 

5091
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:54,070
there's a few revolutions that are
violent but most of it is actually

5092
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
violent but most of it is actually
 

5093
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:56,390
violent but most of it is actually
revolutions without that kind of violent

5094
01:25:56,390 --> 01:25:56,400
revolutions without that kind of violent
 

5095
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:58,790
revolutions without that kind of violent
revolt revolt most of it is just the

5096
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
revolt revolt most of it is just the
 

5097
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:01,590
revolt revolt most of it is just the
peaceful concession of power by elites

5098
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:01,600
peaceful concession of power by elites
 

5099
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:03,590
peaceful concession of power by elites
to a wider and wider group of people in

5100
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
to a wider and wider group of people in
 

5101
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,510
to a wider and wider group of people in
response to their increased economic

5102
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:05,520
response to their increased economic
 

5103
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:07,030
response to their increased economic
bargaining power their threat that

5104
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,040
bargaining power their threat that
 

5105
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,830
bargaining power their threat that
they're going to march so so even if we

5106
01:26:09,830 --> 01:26:09,840
they're going to march so so even if we
 

5107
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,510
they're going to march so so even if we
want to understand something like

5108
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:11,520
want to understand something like
 

5109
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,470
want to understand something like
the march of freedom over human history

5110
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480
the march of freedom over human history
 

5111
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,550
the march of freedom over human history
i think we can draw this same insight

5112
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
i think we can draw this same insight
 

5113
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,270
i think we can draw this same insight
that that actually we don't

5114
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:19,280
that that actually we don't
 

5115
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:20,470
that that actually we don't
most of the time we don't fight we

5116
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:20,480
most of the time we don't fight we
 

5117
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,550
most of the time we don't fight we
actually concede

5118
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:22,560
actually concede
 

5119
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,390
actually concede
power no you don't you don't

5120
01:26:24,390 --> 01:26:24,400
power no you don't you don't
 

5121
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:25,830
power no you don't you don't
the elite doesn't sort of give power to

5122
01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
the elite doesn't sort of give power to
 

5123
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,910
the elite doesn't sort of give power to
the masses right away they just co-opt

5124
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
the masses right away they just co-opt
 

5125
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,070
the masses right away they just co-opt
the few merchants who could threaten the

5126
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,080
the few merchants who could threaten the
 

5127
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,870
the few merchants who could threaten the
whole thing and bring them into the

5128
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:32,880
whole thing and bring them into the
 

5129
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:34,470
whole thing and bring them into the
circle and then the circle gets a little

5130
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:34,480
circle and then the circle gets a little
 

5131
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,629
circle and then the circle gets a little
bit wider a little bit wider until the

5132
01:26:36,629 --> 01:26:36,639
bit wider a little bit wider until the
 

5133
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:38,550
bit wider a little bit wider until the
circle is ever wide and maybe not ever

5134
01:26:38,550 --> 01:26:38,560
circle is ever wide and maybe not ever
 

5135
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,270
circle is ever wide and maybe not ever
but encompasses most if not all

5136
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
but encompasses most if not all
 

5137
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:44,870
but encompasses most if not all
and that's like a hopeful and optimistic

5138
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
and that's like a hopeful and optimistic
 

5139
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:46,390
and that's like a hopeful and optimistic
trend

5140
01:26:46,390 --> 01:26:46,400
trend
 

5141
01:26:46,400 --> 01:26:47,910
trend
yeah if you look at the plot if you guys

5142
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:47,920
yeah if you look at the plot if you guys
 

5143
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,750
yeah if you look at the plot if you guys
could pull it up of the the wars

5144
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:49,760
could pull it up of the the wars
 

5145
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,750
could pull it up of the the wars
throughout history this so the rate of

5146
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:51,760
throughout history this so the rate of
 

5147
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,350
throughout history this so the rate of
wars throughout history just seemed to

5148
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
wars throughout history just seemed to
 

5149
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:55,669
wars throughout history just seemed to
be decreasing significantly with a few

5150
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:55,679
be decreasing significantly with a few
 

5151
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:56,709
be decreasing significantly with a few
spikes

5152
01:26:56,709 --> 01:26:56,719
spikes
 

5153
01:26:56,719 --> 01:27:00,470
spikes
and the the sort of the expansion

5154
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
and the the sort of the expansion
 

5155
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:02,550
and the the sort of the expansion
it's like half the world is under

5156
01:27:02,550 --> 01:27:02,560
it's like half the world is under
 

5157
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:04,390
it's like half the world is under
authoritarian regimes

5158
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:04,400
authoritarian regimes

probably maybe not the where he's

01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:21,520
probably maybe not the where he's

5183
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,350
been going down down down down down down
down that's just unambiguously and it's

01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:29,360
down that's just unambiguously and it's
 

5185
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:31,430
down that's just unambiguously and it's
mostly because we've created

01:27:31,430 --> 01:27:31,440
mostly because we've created

warfare between groups
 

5193
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,750
warfare between groups
is that less frequent well you know

5194
01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
is that less frequent well you know
 

5195
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,110
is that less frequent well you know
it's not clear that he's right that

it's not clear that he's right that
 

5197
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,110
it's not clear that he's right that
there's fewer wars

5198
01:27:45,110 --> 01:27:45,120
there's fewer wars
 

5199
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,350
there's fewer wars
you might say that there's

5200
01:27:47,350 --> 01:27:47,360
you might say that there's
 

5201
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:49,990
you might say that there's
there the wars are more rare because

5202
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,000
there the wars are more rare because
 

5203
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,110
there the wars are more rare because
they're more costly because their

5204
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,120
they're more costly because their
 

5205
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,950
they're more costly because their
weapons are so brutal

5206
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
weapons are so brutal
 

5207
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:54,550
weapons are so brutal
the costs of war go up as the costs of

5208
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:54,560
the costs of war go up as the costs of
 

5209
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:55,910
the costs of war go up as the costs of
war go up

5210
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
war go up
 

5211
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:57,350
war go up
not entirely but for the most part that

5212
01:27:57,350 --> 01:27:57,360
not entirely but for the most part that
 

5213
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:59,590
not entirely but for the most part that
gives us an incentive not to have them

5214
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
gives us an incentive not to have them
 

5215
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,270
gives us an incentive not to have them
and um but then when they do happen

5216
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,280
and um but then when they do happen
 

5217
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,229
and um but then when they do happen
they're doozies

5218
01:28:04,229 --> 01:28:04,239

 

5219
01:28:04,239 --> 01:28:05,990

so is pinker right i hope he's right but

5220
01:28:05,990 --> 01:28:06,000
so is pinker right i hope he's right but
 

5221
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,390
so is pinker right i hope he's right but
i don't think that officially that trend

5222
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:08,400
i don't think that officially that trend
 

5223
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:11,270
i don't think that officially that trend
is there i think

5224
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280

 

5225
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,350

that we might have you know the same

5226
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:13,360
that we might have you know the same
 

5227
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:14,470
that we might have you know the same
kind of

5228
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:14,480
kind of
 

5229
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,310
kind of
levels of intergroup

5230
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
levels of intergroup
 

5231
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,629
levels of intergroup
violence because

5232
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
violence because
 

5233
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,390
violence because
maybe those five fundamentals that lead

5234
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
maybe those five fundamentals that lead
 

5235
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,030
maybe those five fundamentals that lead
to war have not fundamentally changed

5236
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:23,040
to war have not fundamentally changed
 

5237
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,310
to war have not fundamentally changed
and thus

5238
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:24,320
and thus
 

5239
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,229
and thus
made us given us a more peaceful world

5240
01:28:26,229 --> 01:28:26,239
made us given us a more peaceful world
 

5241
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:27,830
made us given us a more peaceful world
now than a couple hundred years ago

5242
01:28:27,830 --> 01:28:27,840
now than a couple hundred years ago
 

5243
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:29,430
now than a couple hundred years ago
that's something to think about so

5244
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
that's something to think about so
 

5245
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,870
that's something to think about so
obviously looking at his hypothesis

5246
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:30,880
obviously looking at his hypothesis
 

5247
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,030
obviously looking at his hypothesis
looking at his data and others like him

5248
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:33,040
looking at his data and others like him
 

5249
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,510
looking at his data and others like him
but i have noticed one thing which is

5250
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:35,520
but i have noticed one thing which is
 

5251
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,229
but i have noticed one thing which is
the amount of pushback he gets yeah that

5252
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:38,239
the amount of pushback he gets yeah that
 

5253
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,229
the amount of pushback he gets yeah that
there is this this is speaking to the

5254
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
there is this this is speaking to the
 

5255
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,310
there is this this is speaking to the
general point that you made which is

5256
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:42,320
general point that you made which is
 

5257
01:28:42,320 --> 01:28:43,350
general point that you made which is
like we

5258
01:28:43,350 --> 01:28:43,360
like we
 

5259
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,790
like we
over emphasize the anecdotal like the

01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
over emphasize the anecdotal like the
 

5261
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,229
over emphasize the anecdotal like the
and don't

5262
01:28:48,229 --> 01:28:48,239
and don't
 

5263
01:28:48,239 --> 01:28:50,470
and don't
look objectively at the aggregate data

5264
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:50,480
look objectively at the aggregate data
 

5265
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:53,030
look objectively at the aggregate data
as much there's a general cynicism about

5266
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:53,040
as much there's a general cynicism about
 

5267
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,110
as much there's a general cynicism about
the world and not i don't even mean

5268
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:55,120
the world and not i don't even mean
 

5269
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:57,830
the world and not i don't even mean
cynicism it's almost like cynicism porn

5270
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
cynicism it's almost like cynicism porn
 

5271
01:28:57,840 --> 01:28:59,510
cynicism it's almost like cynicism porn
or something like that where people just

5272
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
or something like that where people just
 

5273
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,709
or something like that where people just
get

5274
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:00,719
get
 

5275
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:03,030
get
for some reason they get a little bit

5276
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
for some reason they get a little bit
 

5277
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:06,310
for some reason they get a little bit
excited to talk about the destruction of

01:29:06,310 --> 01:29:06,320
excited to talk about the destruction of
 

5279
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:08,790
excited to talk about the destruction of
human civilization you know in a weird

5280
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:08,800
human civilization you know in a weird
 

5281
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:11,510
human civilization you know in a weird
way like they don't really mean it i

5282
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
way like they don't really mean it i
 

5283
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:13,350
way like they don't really mean it i
think if i were to

5284
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:13,360
think if i were to
 

5285
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,709
think if i were to
like psychoanalyze their geopolitical

5286
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:16,719
like psychoanalyze their geopolitical
 

5287
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:19,270
like psychoanalyze their geopolitical
analysis is i don't i think it's a kind

5288
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280
analysis is i don't i think it's a kind
 

5289
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:20,470
analysis is i don't i think it's a kind
of um

5290
01:29:20,470 --> 01:29:20,480
of um
 

5291
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,629
of um
i don't know maybe it relieves

5292
01:29:22,629 --> 01:29:22,639
i don't know maybe it relieves
 

5293
01:29:22,639 --> 01:29:24,790
i don't know maybe it relieves
the mind to think about death at a

5294
01:29:24,790 --> 01:29:24,800
the mind to think about death at a
 

5295
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,950
the mind to think about death at a
global scale somehow and then you can go

5296
01:29:26,950 --> 01:29:26,960
global scale somehow and then you can go
 

5297
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:27,669
global scale somehow and then you can go
have

5298
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:27,679
have
 

5299
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,510
have
lunch with your kids afterwards and feel

5300
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:29,520
lunch with your kids afterwards and feel
 

5301
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:30,950
lunch with your kids afterwards and feel
a little better about the world i don't

5302
01:29:30,950 --> 01:29:30,960
a little better about the world i don't
 

5303
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,030
a little better about the world i don't
know what it is but that it's not very

5304
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:33,040
know what it is but that it's not very
 

5305
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:35,030
know what it is but that it's not very
scientific it's very kind of personal

5306
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
scientific it's very kind of personal
 

5307
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,149
scientific it's very kind of personal
emotional

5308
01:29:36,149 --> 01:29:36,159
emotional
 

5309
01:29:36,159 --> 01:29:38,550
emotional
and so we shouldn't we should be careful

5310
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
and so we shouldn't we should be careful
 

5311
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,229
and so we shouldn't we should be careful
to look at the world in that way because

5312
01:29:40,229 --> 01:29:40,239
to look at the world in that way because
 

5313
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:41,430
to look at the world in that way because
uh

5314
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:41,440
uh
 

5315
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:44,070
uh
the if you look broadly there is just

5316
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
the if you look broadly there is just
 

5317
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:45,910
the if you look broadly there is just
just like hey you highlight there's a

5318
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:45,920

so
and it's a little bit so they're a

5558
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:33,600
and it's a little bit so they're a
 

5559
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,590
and it's a little bit so they're a
little bit like the u.n security council

5560
01:33:35,590 --> 01:33:35,600
little bit like the u.n security council
 

5561
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,510
little bit like the u.n security council
and peacekeeping forces and sanctions

5562
01:33:37,510 --> 01:33:37,520
and peacekeeping forces and sanctions
 

5563
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,350
and peacekeeping forces and sanctions
regimes it's like the same kinds of

5564
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:39,360
regimes it's like the same kinds of
 

5565
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:41,270
regimes it's like the same kinds of
tools the same parallels

5566
01:33:41,270 --> 01:33:41,280
tools the same parallels
 

5567
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,430
tools the same parallels
and and they're imperfect they don't

5568
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:43,440
and and they're imperfect they don't
 

5569
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:44,629
and and they're imperfect they don't
always work that well and they're

5570
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
always work that well and they're
 

5571
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:45,990
always work that well and they're
unequal right because it's not like

5572
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:46,000
unequal right because it's not like
 

5573
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,590
unequal right because it's not like
they're pursuing this in the interests

01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:47,600
they're pursuing this in the interests
 

5575
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:49,510
they're pursuing this in the interests
of like

5576
01:33:49,510 --> 01:33:49,520
of like
 

5577
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:50,629
of like
blah blah blah

5578
01:33:50,629 --> 01:33:50,639
blah blah blah
 

5579
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:52,310
blah blah blah
um

5580
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
um
 

5581
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,229
um
but it kind of works

5582
01:33:54,229 --> 01:33:54,239
but it kind of works
 

5583
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:57,350
but it kind of works
until it doesn't and and 10 years ago in

5584
01:33:57,350 --> 01:33:57,360
until it doesn't and and 10 years ago in
 

5585
01:33:57,360 --> 01:33:59,110
until it doesn't and and 10 years ago in
you know the mid-1990s there were wars

5586
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
you know the mid-1990s there were wars
 

5587
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,590
you know the mid-1990s there were wars
and this breaks down and i it kind of

5588
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:01,600
and this breaks down and i it kind of
 

5589
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,950
and this breaks down and i it kind of
gave me this perspective on the

5590
01:34:02,950 --> 01:34:02,960
gave me this perspective on the
 

5591
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:04,470
gave me this perspective on the
international institutions and all the

5592

international institutions and all the
 

5593

01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:06,480
tools we've built that we do the same
 

5595
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:08,629
tools we've built that we do the same
things right sanctions

5596
01:34:08,629 --> 01:34:08,639
things right sanctions
 

5597
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:12,390
things right sanctions
are designed to

problems
 

5607
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,430
problems
right and

01:34:19,430 --> 01:34:19,440
right and
 

5609
01:34:19,440 --> 01:34:22,550
right and
mediators are a solution to uncertainty

01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560
mediators are a solution to uncertainty
 

5611
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,390

01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:29,520
of these things can be solutions to
 

5619
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:31,510
of these things can be solutions to
these intangible incentives like these

5620
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:31,520
these intangible incentives like these
 

5621
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:33,990
these intangible incentives like these
preferences for whatever you value and

miss calculations because they will

5624
01:34:36,390 --> 01:34:36,400
miss calculations because they will
 

5625
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,149
miss calculations because they will
punish you for your miscalculation or

they're doing all these things and it

5632
01:34:43,590 --> 01:34:43,600
they're doing all these things and it
 

5633
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:46,950
they're doing all these things and it
made me realize that the comparison to

5634
01:34:46,950 --> 01:34:46,960
made me realize that the comparison to
 

5635
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:48,470
made me realize that the comparison to
the u.n security council and our all our

5636
01:34:48,470 --> 01:34:48,480
the u.n security council and our all our
 

5637
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:49,590
the u.n security council and our all our

day
 

5813
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:36,149
day
which means they all get to be in the

5814
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:36,159
which means they all get to be in the
 

5815

they're all moved elsewhere so the
 

5819
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,629
they're all moved elsewhere so the
government had a role in this

5820

happens to be put in the same spot

5828
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:52,480
happens to be put in the same spot
 

5829
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:54,070
happens to be put in the same spot
and uh

5830
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
and uh
 

5831
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,870
and uh
and a week later the homicide rate has

5832
01:37:56,870 --> 01:37:56,880
and a week later the homicide rate has
 

5833
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,510
and a week later the homicide rate has
is 30 of what it was

5834
01:37:59,510 --> 01:37:59,520
is 30 of what it was
 

5835
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,510
is 30 of what it was
uh it's back to its normal mode

5836
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:01,520
uh it's back to its normal mode
 

5837
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,390
uh it's back to its normal mode
unfortunately not zero right but it's

5838
01:38:04,390 --> 01:38:04,400
unfortunately not zero right but it's
 

5839
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,310
unfortunately not zero right but it's
back to where it was

back to where it was
uh because they

in the maybe the last couple years of a
 

5879
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:50,270
in the maybe the last couple years of a
long-running war so this would have been

and you don't want them to ask questions
 

5989
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,910
and you don't want them to ask questions
or you think they know too much in a way

then you can put a contract out on them
 

6003
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,109
then you can put a contract out on them
and they'll be killed

uh that doesn't happen in colombia

6006
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,360
uh that doesn't happen in colombia
 

6007
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:56,870
uh that doesn't happen in colombia
um it doesn't happen in chicago

6008
01:40:56,870 --> 01:40:56,880
um it doesn't happen in chicago
 

6009
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:57,910
um it doesn't happen in chicago
uh

6010
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:57,920
uh
 

6011
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,590
uh
pro there's no i don't know there's lots

6012
01:40:59,590 --> 01:40:59,600
pro there's no i don't know there's lots
 

6013
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,950
pro there's no i don't know there's lots
of reasons for that i can't say exactly

6014
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
of reasons for that i can't say exactly
 

6015
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,189
of reasons for that i can't say exactly
why i think one reason is like

6016
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:03,199
why i think one reason is like
 

6017
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:05,109
why i think one reason is like
they know what will happen is that there

6018
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:05,119
they know what will happen is that there
 

6019
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,870
they know what will happen is that there
will be consequences that that the

6020
01:41:06,870 --> 01:41:06,880
will be consequences that that the
 

6021
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,950
will be consequences that that the
government will crack down and make them

6022
01:41:08,950 --> 01:41:08,960
government will crack down and make them
 

6023
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:09,750
government will crack down and make them
pay

6024
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:09,760
pay
 

6025
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,350
pay
and so they don't do it

6026
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
and so they don't do it
 

6027
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,109
and so they don't do it
um and

6028
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
um and
 

6029
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:14,870
um and
that's not what happened in mexico you

6030
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
that's not what happened in mexico you
 

6031
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,149
that's not what happened in mexico you
they don't they won't kill like a d

6032
01:41:16,149 --> 01:41:16,159
they don't they won't kill like a d
 

6033
01:41:16,159 --> 01:41:18,310
they don't they won't kill like a d
agent they know that the us has made it

6034
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
agent they know that the us has made it
 

6035
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:20,229
agent they know that the us has made it
clear you kill one of our agents we will

6036
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:20,239
clear you kill one of our agents we will
 

6037
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:22,550
clear you kill one of our agents we will
make you pay and so they they're very

6038
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
make you pay and so they they're very
 

6039
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,750
make you pay and so they they're very
careful to minimize death of american

6040
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:25,760
careful to minimize death of american
 

6041
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,430
careful to minimize death of american
but but you kill journalists and nobody

6042
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
but but you kill journalists and nobody
 

6043
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:29,109
but but you kill journalists and nobody
comes after them or is able to come

6044
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
comes after them or is able to come
 

6045
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:30,950
comes after them or is able to come
after them and so they realize they can

6046
01:41:30,950 --> 01:41:30,960
after them and so they realize they can
 

6047
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,310
after them and so they realize they can
get away with this and that seems to be

6048
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,320
get away with this and that seems to be
 

6049
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,149
get away with this and that seems to be
the equilibrium there that's my my

6050
01:41:34,149 --> 01:41:34,159
the equilibrium there that's my my
 

6051
01:41:34,159 --> 01:41:36,310
the equilibrium there that's my my
that's my initial sense from

6052
01:41:36,310 --> 01:41:36,320
that's my initial sense from
 

6053
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:37,510
that's my initial sense from
and but that's

6054
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:37,520
and but that's
 

6055
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,950
and but that's
we spent a lot of time before we started

6056
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
we spent a lot of time before we started
 

6057
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:40,550
we spent a lot of time before we started
talking to criminals

6058
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:40,560
talking to criminals
 

6059
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:42,070
talking to criminals
you know i we spent a year trying to

6060
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:42,080
you know i we spent a year trying to
 

6061
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:43,990
you know i we spent a year trying to
figure out what was safe before we

6062
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
figure out what was safe before we
 

6063
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,070
figure out what was safe before we
actually and failing we kept there lots

6064
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:46,080
actually and failing we kept there lots
 

6065
01:41:46,080 --> 01:41:47,510
actually and failing we kept there lots
of safe things to do it was also really

6066
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
of safe things to do it was also really
 

6067
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,109
of safe things to do it was also really
hard to figure out how to talk to people

6068
01:41:49,109 --> 01:41:49,119
hard to figure out how to talk to people
 

6069
01:41:49,119 --> 01:41:51,830
hard to figure out how to talk to people
in these organizations and we failed 40

6070
01:41:51,830 --> 01:41:51,840
in these organizations and we failed 40
 

6071
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,590
in these organizations and we failed 40
times before we figured out a way to

6072
01:41:53,590 --> 01:41:53,600
times before we figured out a way to
 

6073
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:56,790
times before we figured out a way to
actually access people is it worth it

6074
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:56,800
actually access people is it worth it
 

6075
01:41:56,800 --> 01:41:58,390
actually access people is it worth it
talking to them if you figure out

6076
01:41:58,390 --> 01:41:58,400
talking to them if you figure out
 

6077
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,990
talking to them if you figure out
because it's not never going to be safe

6078
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
because it's not never going to be safe
 

6079
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,910
because it's not never going to be safe
it's going to be

6080
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:01,920
it's going to be
 

6081
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,669
it's going to be
when you estimate that there's some low

6082
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
when you estimate that there's some low
 

6083
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,510
when you estimate that there's some low
level of risk

6084
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
level of risk
 

6085
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,270
level of risk
like what's the benefit as a researcher

6086
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:07,280
like what's the benefit as a researcher
 

6087
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:11,750
like what's the benefit as a researcher
as a as a as a scholar of humans yeah

6088
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:11,760
as a as a as a scholar of humans yeah
 

6089
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:14,470
as a as a as a scholar of humans yeah
so i actually don't think let's compare

6090
01:42:14,470 --> 01:42:14,480
so i actually don't think let's compare
 

6091
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,229
so i actually don't think let's compare
it to something okay you know i'm in

6092
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
it to something okay you know i'm in
 

6093
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:17,830
it to something okay you know i'm in
austin for the first time and i'm

6094
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:17,840
austin for the first time and i'm

01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,270
austin for the first time and i'm
walking around and there's all these

6096
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,280
walking around and there's all these
 

6097
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,990
walking around and there's all these
people buzzing around on these scooters

6098
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:22,000
people buzzing around on these scooters
 

6099
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,590
people buzzing around on these scooters
without helmets

6100
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:23,600
without helmets
 

6101
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:25,189
without helmets
we need to definitely interview them and

6102
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
we need to definitely interview them and
 

6103
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,870
we need to definitely interview them and
say what the hell is wrong with you so

01:42:28,709 --> 01:42:28,719
nothing i have ever done in my entire
 

6107
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:32,070
nothing i have ever done in my entire
career is riskier is as risky as that

6108
01:42:32,070 --> 01:42:32,080
career is riskier is as risky as that
 

6109
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:34,229
career is riskier is as risky as that
um that's a nice way to compare

6110
01:42:34,229 --> 01:42:34,239
um that's a nice way to compare
 

6111
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:36,470
um that's a nice way to compare
journalism in a war zone and not well

6112
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
journalism in a war zone and not well
 

6113
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:37,669
journalism in a war zone and not well

double jeopardy they've been
 

6233
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,510
double jeopardy they've been
incarcerated for it

6234
01:44:33,510 --> 01:44:33,520

01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
uh and you're just they're just talking

organization people can run away and
then you can't promise to shoot them

6426
01:47:41,430 --> 01:47:41,440
then you can't promise to shoot them
 

6427
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,709
then you can't promise to shoot them
very easily because you don't control

6428
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
very easily because you don't control
 

6429
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,470
very easily because you don't control
all the territory and so what these

6430
01:47:44,470 --> 01:47:44,480
all the territory and so what these
 

6431
01:47:44,480 --> 01:47:46,390
all the territory and so what these
movements do is they try to brainwash

6432
01:47:46,390 --> 01:47:46,400
movements do is they try to brainwash
 

6433
01:47:46,400 --> 01:47:47,270
movements do is they try to brainwash
you

6434
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
you
 

6435
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:48,870
you
and i think what they figured out after

6436
01:47:48,870 --> 01:47:48,880
and i think what they figured out after
 

6437
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:50,390
and i think what they figured out after
years of abducting children you know you

6438
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
years of abducting children you know you
 

6439
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,070
years of abducting children you know you
talk about evil

6440
01:47:52,070 --> 01:47:52,080
talk about evil
 

6441
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:52,950
talk about evil
um

6442
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
um
 

6443
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,470
um
they figured out that you know we have

6444
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:54,480
they figured out that you know we have
 

6445
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:55,830
they figured out that you know we have
to

6446
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:55,840
to
 

6447
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:57,669
to
maybe like i don't know but say like

6448
01:47:57,669 --> 01:47:57,679
maybe like i don't know but say like
 

6449
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,830
maybe like i don't know but say like
maybe one in a hundred will like buy the

6450
01:47:59,830 --> 01:47:59,840
maybe one in a hundred will like buy the
 

6451
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,510
maybe one in a hundred will like buy the
rhetoric so we just have to

6452
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:01,520
rhetoric so we just have to
 

6453
01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:03,910
rhetoric so we just have to
conscript or abduct large number of kids

6454
01:48:03,910 --> 01:48:03,920
conscript or abduct large number of kids
 

6455
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,430
conscript or abduct large number of kids
and then some small number of them will

6456
01:48:05,430 --> 01:48:05,440
and then some small number of them will
 

6457
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:06,629
and then some small number of them will
not run away

6458
01:48:06,629 --> 01:48:06,639
not run away
 

6459
01:48:06,639 --> 01:48:08,790
not run away
and those will be our committed cadres

6460
01:48:08,790 --> 01:48:08,800
and those will be our committed cadres
 

6461
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:11,109
and those will be our committed cadres
and those people can become commanders

6462
01:48:11,109 --> 01:48:11,119
and those people can become commanders
 

6463
01:48:11,119 --> 01:48:12,870
and those people can become commanders
and because they'll buy the propaganda

6464
01:48:12,870 --> 01:48:12,880
and because they'll buy the propaganda
 

6465
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,669
and because they'll buy the propaganda
and they'll buy the messianic messages

6466
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:15,679
and they'll buy the messianic messages
 

6467
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,149
and they'll buy the messianic messages
but but because most people wise up we

6468
01:48:18,149 --> 01:48:18,159
but but because most people wise up we
 

6469
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,830
but but because most people wise up we
have especially as they get older we

6470
01:48:19,830 --> 01:48:19,840
have especially as they get older we
 

6471
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,310
have especially as they get older we
just have to abduct vast numbers of kids

6472
01:48:22,310 --> 01:48:22,320
just have to abduct vast numbers of kids
 

6473
01:48:22,320 --> 01:48:23,830
just have to abduct vast numbers of kids
in order to have a committed cadre and

6474
01:48:23,830 --> 01:48:23,840
in order to have a committed cadre and
 

6475
01:48:23,840 --> 01:48:24,629
in order to have a committed cadre and
so

6476
01:48:24,629 --> 01:48:24,639
so
 

6477
01:48:24,639 --> 01:48:26,870
so
so it has the other benefit of sort of

6478
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
so it has the other benefit of sort of
 

6479
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,709
so it has the other benefit of sort of
being terrifying for the population and

6480
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:28,719
being terrifying for the population and
 

6481
01:48:28,719 --> 01:48:31,590
being terrifying for the population and
being a weapon in itself but i think for

6482
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:31,600
being a weapon in itself but i think for
 

6483
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,790
being a weapon in itself but i think for
them was just primarily a way to solve

6484
01:48:34,790 --> 01:48:34,800
them was just primarily a way to solve
 

6485
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,709
them was just primarily a way to solve
a recruitment problem

6486
01:48:36,709 --> 01:48:36,719
a recruitment problem
 

6487
01:48:36,719 --> 01:48:38,709
a recruitment problem
uh when you're

6488
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:38,719
uh when you're
 

6489
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:40,470
uh when you're
a totally

6490
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
a totally
 

6491
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,709
a totally
uh like

6492
01:48:42,709 --> 01:48:42,719
uh like
 

6493
01:48:42,719 --> 01:48:44,550
uh like
hopeless and

6494
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,560
hopeless and
 

6495
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,790
hopeless and
uh ideologically empty rebel movement so

6496
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
uh ideologically empty rebel movement so
 

6497
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:48,709
uh ideologically empty rebel movement so
in some sense it's

6498
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
in some sense it's
 

6499
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,950
in some sense it's
it's yeah so it that that's maybe the

6500
01:48:50,950 --> 01:48:50,960
it's yeah so it that that's maybe the
 

6501
01:48:50,960 --> 01:48:53,990
it's yeah so it that that's maybe the
short story was a real tragedy i heard

6502
01:48:53,990 --> 01:48:54,000
short story was a real tragedy i heard
 

6503
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,870
short story was a real tragedy i heard
one interview of a dictator

6504
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
one interview of a dictator
 

6505
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,750
one interview of a dictator
uh where the journalist was basically

6506
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
uh where the journalist was basically
 

6507
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,669
uh where the journalist was basically
telling them like how could you be doing

6508
01:49:01,669 --> 01:49:01,679
telling them like how could you be doing
 

6509
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:03,750
telling them like how could you be doing
this

6510
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:03,760
this
 

6511
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,470
this
uh basically calling out all the

6512
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
uh basically calling out all the
 

6513
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,870
uh basically calling out all the
atrocities the person is committing

6514
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:08,880
atrocities the person is committing
 

6515
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,790
atrocities the person is committing
and the dictator was kind of laughing it

6516
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
and the dictator was kind of laughing it
 

6517
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,270
and the dictator was kind of laughing it
off and walked away yeah and like he cut

01:49:13,270 --> 01:49:13,280
off and walked away yeah and like he cut

off and walked away yeah and like he cut
off the interview that feels like a very

6520
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
off the interview that feels like a very
 

6521
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,030
off the interview that feels like a very
unproductive thing to be doing

01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:17,040
unproductive thing to be doing
 

6523
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:18,629
unproductive thing to be doing

6551
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,350

it's a little bit particular the way

6847
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,750
and there's a window of opportunity
that's closing and that they thought was

01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:52,080
persuasive in world war ii i think there
 

6855
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,149
persuasive in world war ii i think there
was an element of a closing window they

6856
01:54:54,149 --> 01:54:54,159
was an element of a closing window they
 

6857
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:56,470

they really thought there was a closing
 

6861
01:54:57,840 --> 01:54:59,669
they really thought there was a closing
window i think the nature of that

6862
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
window i think the nature of that
 

6863
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:01,270
window i think the nature of that
window's different

6864
01:55:01,270 --> 01:55:01,280
window's different
 

6865
01:55:01,280 --> 01:55:02,870
window's different
uh in that

6866
01:55:02,870 --> 01:55:02,880
uh in that
 

6867
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:05,830
uh in that
there was kind of pacifism

6868
01:55:05,830 --> 01:55:05,840
there was kind of pacifism
 

6869
01:55:05,840 --> 01:55:08,870

6871
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,629
and it seems like if um

had to he had to strike now before any

6910
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:51,199
had to he had to strike now before any
 

6911
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:53,189
had to he had to strike now before any
opportunity to sort of

6912
01:55:53,189 --> 01:55:53,199
opportunity to sort of
 

6913
01:55:53,199 --> 01:55:54,950
opportunity to sort of
establish that was possible i think

6914
01:55:54,950 --> 01:55:54,960
establish that was possible i think
 

6915
01:55:54,960 --> 01:55:56,229
establish that was possible i think
that's one

6916
01:55:56,229 --> 01:55:56,239
that's one
 

6917
01:55:56,239 --> 01:55:58,229
that's one
it's an incentive that requires his

6918
01:55:58,229 --> 01:55:58,239
it's an incentive that requires his
 

6919
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:02,070
it's an incentive that requires his
ideology as well how to uh so to avoid

6920
01:56:02,070 --> 01:56:02,080
ideology as well how to uh so to avoid
 

6921
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,149
ideology as well how to uh so to avoid
it yeah within this framework would you

6922
01:56:04,149 --> 01:56:04,159
it yeah within this framework would you
 

6923
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:05,830
it yeah within this framework would you
say is there

6924
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
say is there
 

6925
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,070
say is there
uh

6926
01:56:08,070 --> 01:56:08,080
uh
 

6927
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:08,870
uh
that's

6928
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:08,880
that's
 

6929
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:10,229
that's
you kind of

6930
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:10,239
you kind of
 

6931
01:56:10,239 --> 01:56:12,070
you kind of
provide an explanation but is is there a

6932
01:56:12,070 --> 01:56:12,080
provide an explanation but is is there a
 

6933
01:56:12,080 --> 01:56:14,470
provide an explanation but is is there a
way to avoid it is is violence the way

6934
01:56:14,470 --> 01:56:14,480
way to avoid it is is violence the way
 

6935
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,390
way to avoid it is is violence the way
to avoid it because people kind of tried

6936
01:56:16,390 --> 01:56:16,400
to avoid it because people kind of tried
 

6937
01:56:16,400 --> 01:56:17,589
to avoid it because people kind of tried
rational

6938
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
rational
 

6939
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:18,470
rational
yeah

6940
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
yeah
 

6941
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:19,510
yeah
peace

6942
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:19,520
peace
 

6943
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,149
peace
peaceful kind of usual negotiation and

6944
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:22,159
peaceful kind of usual negotiation and
 

6945
01:56:22,159 --> 01:56:24,550
peaceful kind of usual negotiation and
that led to this war is that unique to

6946
01:56:24,550 --> 01:56:24,560
that led to this war is that unique to
 

6947
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,109
that led to this war is that unique to
this particular or let's say world war

6948
01:56:27,109 --> 01:56:27,119
this particular or let's say world war
 

6949
01:56:27,119 --> 01:56:29,510
this particular or let's say world war
one or world war ii so there's an extra

6950
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
one or world war ii so there's an extra
 

6951
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:32,470
one or world war ii so there's an extra
pressure from germany and both wars the

6952
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:32,480
pressure from germany and both wars the
 

6953
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:34,550
pressure from germany and both wars the
to act okay so we've highlighted that is

6954
01:56:34,550 --> 01:56:34,560
to act okay so we've highlighted that is
 

6955
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:36,550
to act okay so we've highlighted that is
there a way to alleviate that extra

6956
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,560
there a way to alleviate that extra
 

6957
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,870
there a way to alleviate that extra
pressure to act let me use world war one

6958
01:56:38,870 --> 01:56:38,880
pressure to act let me use world war one
 

6959
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:41,270
pressure to act let me use world war one
as an example suppose

6960
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,280
as an example suppose
 

6961
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,189
as an example suppose
as many german generals

6962
01:56:43,189 --> 01:56:43,199
as many german generals
 

6963
01:56:43,199 --> 01:56:44,870
as many german generals
said at that time we have a window of

6964
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
said at that time we have a window of
 

6965
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:47,589
said at that time we have a window of
opportunity before russia

6966
01:56:47,589 --> 01:56:47,599
opportunity before russia
 

6967
01:56:47,599 --> 01:56:49,510
opportunity before russia
where we might not win a war with russia

6968
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
where we might not win a war with russia
 

6969
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,430
where we might not win a war with russia
like so the the probability that we can

6970
01:56:51,430 --> 01:56:51,440
like so the the probability that we can
 

6971
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:53,189
like so the the probability that we can
win a war is going to change a lot in

6972
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
win a war is going to change a lot in
 

6973
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:55,350
win a war is going to change a lot in
the next decade or two

6974
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
the next decade or two
 

6975
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,189
the next decade or two
maybe even the next few years and so if

6976
01:56:57,189 --> 01:56:57,199
maybe even the next few years and so if
 

6977
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,189
maybe even the next few years and so if
we we are in a much better bargaining

6978
01:56:59,189 --> 01:56:59,199
we we are in a much better bargaining
 

6979
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:00,709
we we are in a much better bargaining
position now

6980
01:57:00,709 --> 01:57:00,719
position now
 

6981
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:02,790
position now
both to not use violence but to if

6982
01:57:02,790 --> 01:57:02,800
both to not use violence but to if
 

6983
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,030
both to not use violence but to if
necessarily use violence

6984
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:05,040
necessarily use violence
 

6985
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,550
necessarily use violence
because otherwise russia is going to be

6986
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:06,560
because otherwise russia is going to be
 

6987
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:08,229
because otherwise russia is going to be
extremely powerful in the future and

6988
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
extremely powerful in the future and
 

6989
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:10,310
extremely powerful in the future and
they'll be able to use that power to to

6990
01:57:10,310 --> 01:57:10,320
they'll be able to use that power to to
 

6991
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,310
they'll be able to use that power to to
change the bargaining with us and to

6992
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,320
change the bargaining with us and to
 

6993
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:14,790
change the bargaining with us and to
like hold keep us down

6994
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:14,800
like hold keep us down
 

6995
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,229
like hold keep us down
and

6996
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
and
 

6997
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,070
and
and the thing is is in principle russia

6998
01:57:18,070 --> 01:57:18,080
and the thing is is in principle russia
 

6999
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,830
and the thing is is in principle russia
could say look

7000
01:57:19,830 --> 01:57:19,840
could say look
 

7001
01:57:19,840 --> 01:57:22,790
could say look
we don't want to get invaded right now

7002
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:22,800
we don't want to get invaded right now
 

7003
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:24,470
we don't want to get invaded right now
we know you could invade us we know

7004
01:57:24,470 --> 01:57:24,480
we know you could invade us we know
 

7005
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:25,830
we know you could invade us we know
we're weak we know we'll be strong in

7006
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:25,840
we're weak we know we'll be strong in
 

7007
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:30,709
we're weak we know we'll be strong in
the future we promise to like not

7008
01:57:30,709 --> 01:57:30,719
the future we promise to like not
 

7009
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:33,430
the future we promise to like not
wield our and abuse our or just merely

7010
01:57:33,430 --> 01:57:33,440
wield our and abuse our or just merely
 

7011
01:57:33,440 --> 01:57:35,750
wield our and abuse our or just merely
just sort of take what we can get

7012
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:35,760
just sort of take what we can get
 

7013
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,189
just sort of take what we can get
in the future when we're strong we're

7014
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
in the future when we're strong we're
 

7015
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:39,510
in the future when we're strong we're
going to restrain ourselves in future or

7016
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:39,520
going to restrain ourselves in future or
 

7017
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:40,790
going to restrain ourselves in future or
we're going to hand over something that

7018
01:57:40,790 --> 01:57:40,800
we're going to hand over something that
 

7019
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,629
we're going to hand over something that
makes us powerful because that's the

7020
01:57:42,629 --> 01:57:42,639
makes us powerful because that's the
 

7021
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:43,990
makes us powerful because that's the
bargain that would make us all better

7022
01:57:43,990 --> 01:57:44,000
bargain that would make us all better
 

7023
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,990
bargain that would make us all better
off and the reason

7024
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:46,000
off and the reason
 

7025
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,189
off and the reason
political economists call it a

7026
01:57:47,189 --> 01:57:47,199
political economists call it a
 

7027
01:57:47,199 --> 01:57:49,030
political economists call it a
commitment problem is because that's a

7028
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:49,040
commitment problem is because that's a
 

7029
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:51,189
commitment problem is because that's a
commitment that would solve the problem

7030
01:57:51,189 --> 01:57:51,199
commitment that would solve the problem
 

7031
01:57:51,199 --> 01:57:52,629
commitment that would solve the problem
and they can't make that commitment

7032
01:57:52,629 --> 01:57:52,639
and they can't make that commitment
 

7033
01:57:52,639 --> 01:57:53,830
and they can't make that commitment
because there's nobody who will hold

7034
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:53,840
because there's nobody who will hold
 

7035
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:55,030
because there's nobody who will hold
them accountable

7036
01:57:55,030 --> 01:57:55,040
them accountable

would help you make that commitment is a
 

7051
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:10,790
would help you make that commitment is a
solution all right if that's the core

7052
01:58:10,790 --> 01:58:10,800
solution all right if that's the core
 

7053
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:11,750
solution all right if that's the core

problem
 

7055
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:13,510
problem
um and so that's why you know in

7056
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,520
um and so that's why you know in
 

7057
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:15,750
um and so that's why you know in
medellin

7058
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:15,760
medellin
 

7059
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:18,950
medellin
you know the the the la fasina can do

7060
01:58:18,950 --> 01:58:18,960
you know the the the la fasina can do
 

7061
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:21,910
you know the the the la fasina can do
that they can say listen yes

7062
01:58:21,910 --> 01:58:21,920
that they can say listen yes
 

7063
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:23,189
that they can say listen yes
combo that's strong today is going to be

7064
01:58:23,189 --> 01:58:23,199
combo that's strong today is going to be
 

7065
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:24,629
combo that's strong today is going to be
weak tomorrow

7066

weak tomorrow
 

7067
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:25,990
weak tomorrow
you have an incentive to eliminate this

7068
01:58:25,990 --> 01:58:26,000
you have an incentive to eliminate this
 

7069
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,750
you have an incentive to eliminate this
combo over here but

7070
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760

post
 

7239
02:01:13,199 --> 02:01:14,550
post
conflict agreement and every

7240
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:14,560
conflict agreement and every
 

7241
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:17,990
conflict agreement and every
constitution is like a little bit of

7242
02:01:17,990 --> 02:01:18,000
constitution is like a little bit of

humans

7244
02:01:20,550 --> 02:01:20,560
humans
 

7245
02:01:20,560 --> 02:01:22,709
humans
best effort to

7246
02:01:22,709 --> 02:01:22,719
best effort to
 

7247
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,030
best effort to
find an agreement that's going to

7248
02:01:25,030 --> 02:01:25,040
find an agreement that's going to
 

7249
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:26,950
find an agreement that's going to
protect the interests

7250
02:01:26,950 --> 02:01:26,960
protect the interests
 

7251
02:01:26,960 --> 02:01:29,189
protect the interests
of a group that's

7252
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
of a group that's
 

7253
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,030
of a group that's
temporarily has an interest in violence

7254
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:31,040
temporarily has an interest in violence
 

7255
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:33,030
temporarily has an interest in violence
in order to

7256
02:01:33,030 --> 02:01:33,040
in order to
 

7257
02:01:33,040 --> 02:01:35,189
in order to
to to not be violent

7258
02:01:35,189 --> 02:01:35,199
to to not be violent
 

7259
02:01:35,199 --> 02:01:38,229
to to not be violent
yeah and so there's a lot of ingenuity

7260
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:38,239
yeah and so there's a lot of ingenuity
 

7261
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:40,790
yeah and so there's a lot of ingenuity
and it doesn't always work right

7262
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:40,800
and it doesn't always work right
 

7263
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:42,629
and it doesn't always work right
which actually from a perspective of the

7264
02:01:42,629 --> 02:01:42,639
which actually from a perspective of the
 

7265
02:01:42,639 --> 02:01:43,830
which actually from a perspective of the
group

7266
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:43,840
group
 

7267
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,990
group
threatening violence or actually doing

7268
02:01:45,990 --> 02:01:46,000
threatening violence or actually doing
 

7269
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,990
threatening violence or actually doing
violence is one way to make progress for

7270
02:01:47,990 --> 02:01:48,000
violence is one way to make progress for
 

7271
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:49,990
violence is one way to make progress for
your group we're talking about groups

7272
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
your group we're talking about groups
 

7273
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,510
your group we're talking about groups
bargaining over stuff right we're

7274
02:01:51,510 --> 02:01:51,520
bargaining over stuff right we're
 

7275
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:53,669
bargaining over stuff right we're
talking about russians versus ukraine or

7276
02:01:53,669 --> 02:01:53,679
talking about russians versus ukraine or
 

7277
02:01:53,679 --> 02:01:55,990
talking about russians versus ukraine or
russians versus the west or maybe it's

7278
02:01:55,990 --> 02:01:56,000
russians versus the west or maybe it's
 

7279
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,030
russians versus the west or maybe it's
managing gangs versus one another like

7280
02:01:59,030 --> 02:01:59,040
managing gangs versus one another like
 

7281
02:01:59,040 --> 02:02:00,870
managing gangs versus one another like
they're a lot of their bargaining power

7282
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
they're a lot of their bargaining power
 

7283
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:02,229
they're a lot of their bargaining power
comes from their ability to burn the

7284
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:02,239
comes from their ability to burn the
 

7285
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,430
comes from their ability to burn the
house down

7286
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:03,440
house down
 

7287
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,709
house down
right and so if i want to have more

7288
02:02:04,709 --> 02:02:04,719
right and so if i want to have more
 

7289
02:02:04,719 --> 02:02:07,350
right and so if i want to have more
bargaining power i can just arm a lot

7290
02:02:07,350 --> 02:02:07,360
bargaining power i can just arm a lot
 

7291
02:02:07,360 --> 02:02:09,990
bargaining power i can just arm a lot
and i can threaten violence and so

7292
02:02:09,990 --> 02:02:10,000
and i can threaten violence and so
 

7293
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:10,870
and i can threaten violence and so
the

7294
02:02:10,870 --> 02:02:10,880
the
 

7295
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:13,430
the
strategically wise thing to do i mean

7296
02:02:13,430 --> 02:02:13,440
strategically wise thing to do i mean
 

7297
02:02:13,440 --> 02:02:14,470
strategically wise thing to do i mean
it's terrible it's a terrible

7298
02:02:14,470 --> 02:02:14,480
it's terrible it's a terrible
 

7299
02:02:14,480 --> 02:02:16,550
it's terrible it's a terrible
equilibrium for us to be forced into but

7300
02:02:16,550 --> 02:02:16,560
equilibrium for us to be forced into but
 

7301
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,070
equilibrium for us to be forced into but
the strategically wise thing to do is to

7302
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
the strategically wise thing to do is to
 

7303
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,470
the strategically wise thing to do is to
build up lots of arms to threaten to use

7304
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:20,480
build up lots of arms to threaten to use
 

7305
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:21,990
build up lots of arms to threaten to use
them to credibly threaten to use them

7306
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:22,000
them to credibly threaten to use them
 

7307
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,189
them to credibly threaten to use them
but then

7308
02:02:23,189 --> 02:02:23,199
but then
 

7309
02:02:23,199 --> 02:02:25,030
but then
trust or hope that like your enemy is

7310
02:02:25,030 --> 02:02:25,040
trust or hope that like your enemy is
 

7311
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,270
trust or hope that like your enemy is
going to see reason

7312
02:02:27,270 --> 02:02:27,280
going to see reason
 

7313
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,189
going to see reason
and uh

7314
02:02:29,189 --> 02:02:29,199
and uh
 

7315
02:02:29,199 --> 02:02:31,109
and uh
and and avoid this really terrible

7316
02:02:31,109 --> 02:02:31,119
and and avoid this really terrible
 

7317
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:33,430
and and avoid this really terrible
inefficient thing which is fighting

7318
02:02:33,430 --> 02:02:33,440
inefficient thing which is fighting
 

7319
02:02:33,440 --> 02:02:34,950
inefficient thing which is fighting
but the thing that's going on the whole

7320
02:02:34,950 --> 02:02:34,960
but the thing that's going on the whole
 

7321
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:36,629
but the thing that's going on the whole
time is both of you arming and spending

7322
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
time is both of you arming and spending
 

7323
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,430
time is both of you arming and spending
like 20 of gdp or whatever on arms

7324
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
like 20 of gdp or whatever on arms
 

7325
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,669
like 20 of gdp or whatever on arms
that's pretty inefficient yes

7326
02:02:41,669 --> 02:02:41,679
that's pretty inefficient yes
 

7327
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:44,870
that's pretty inefficient yes
that's the tragedy we don't have war and

7328
02:02:44,870 --> 02:02:44,880
that's the tragedy we don't have war and
 

7329
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:47,589
that's the tragedy we don't have war and
that's good but we have really limited

7330
02:02:47,589 --> 02:02:47,599
that's good but we have really limited
 

7331
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:49,669
that's good but we have really limited
abilities to like incentivize our

7332
02:02:49,669 --> 02:02:49,679
abilities to like incentivize our
 

7333
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:51,910
abilities to like incentivize our
enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves

7334
02:02:51,910 --> 02:02:51,920
enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves
 

7335
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:53,669
enemies not to arm and to keep ourselves
from arming we'd love to agree to just

7336
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
from arming we'd love to agree to just
 

7337
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:57,430
from arming we'd love to agree to just
like both disarm but we can't and so the

7338
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:57,440
like both disarm but we can't and so the
 

7339
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,669
like both disarm but we can't and so the
the masses that we have to arm and then

7340
02:02:59,669 --> 02:02:59,679
the masses that we have to arm and then
 

7341
02:02:59,679 --> 02:03:01,430
the masses that we have to arm and then
we have to threaten all the time yeah

7342
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,440
we have to threaten all the time yeah
 

7343
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,589
we have to threaten all the time yeah
yeah so the threat of violence is costly

7344
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:03,599
yeah so the threat of violence is costly
 

7345
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,910
yeah so the threat of violence is costly
nevertheless you've actually pulled up

7346
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:05,920
nevertheless you've actually pulled up
 

7347
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,990
nevertheless you've actually pulled up
uh that now disappeared a paper that

7348
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:08,000
uh that now disappeared a paper that

7429
02:04:25,199 --> 02:04:27,350
now there isn't any more it's like a
flourishing area of study

7430
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:27,360
flourishing area of study
 

7431
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:29,430
flourishing area of study
but in economics but at the time it

7432
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:29,440
but in economics but at the time it
 

7433
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,350
but in economics but at the time it
wasn't and so there were people like me

7434
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:31,360
wasn't and so there were people like me
 

7435
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,950
wasn't and so there were people like me
and ted who

7436
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:32,960
and ted who
 

7437
02:04:32,960 --> 02:04:35,270
and ted who
were sort of part political scientists

7438
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:35,280
were sort of part political scientists
 

7439
02:04:35,280 --> 02:04:36,629
were sort of part political scientists
because political scientists obviously

7440
02:04:36,629 --> 02:04:36,639
because political scientists obviously
 

7441
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:38,709
because political scientists obviously
been studying this for a long time who

7442
02:04:38,709 --> 02:04:38,719
been studying this for a long time who
 

7443
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:40,310
been studying this for a long time who
started bringing economic tools and

7444
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
started bringing economic tools and
 

7445
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,669
started bringing economic tools and
expertise

7446
02:04:41,669 --> 02:04:41,679
expertise
 

7447
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:43,430
expertise
and like partnerships with political

and like partnerships with political
scientists and adding to it and so we

7450
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
scientists and adding to it and so we
 

7451
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,750
scientists and adding to it and so we
wrote this so after like people have

7452
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:47,760
wrote this so after like people have
 

7453
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:49,669
wrote this so after like people have
been doing this for five or ten years in

7454
02:04:49,669 --> 02:04:49,679
been doing this for five or ten years in
 

7455
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,149
been doing this for five or ten years in
our field we wrote a review article

everybody sees sense and then settles
 

7655
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:06,950
everybody sees sense and then settles
down to this uneasy that's not like we

7656
02:08:06,950 --> 02:08:06,960
down to this uneasy that's not like we
 

7657
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:08,069
down to this uneasy that's not like we
we're right now to think of that as like

7658
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:08,079
we're right now to think of that as like
 

7659
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:09,350
we're right now to think of that as like
a piece and there's certainly no stable

7660
02:08:09,350 --> 02:08:09,360
a piece and there's certainly no stable
 

7661
02:08:09,360 --> 02:08:10,950
a piece and there's certainly no stable
agreement right

7662
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:10,960
agreement right
 

7663
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:14,229
agreement right
um so a stable agreement an amity and

7664
02:08:14,229 --> 02:08:14,239
um so a stable agreement an amity and
 

7665
02:08:14,239 --> 02:08:17,510
um so a stable agreement an amity and
any ability to move on from this

7666
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:17,520
any ability to move on from this
 

7667
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,430
any ability to move on from this
extreme hostility we're not there yet

7668
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,440
extreme hostility we're not there yet
 

7669
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,629
extreme hostility we're not there yet
and that's

7670
02:08:20,629 --> 02:08:20,639
and that's
 

7671
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:22,629
and that's
maybe very far away

7672
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
maybe very far away
 

7673
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:23,589
maybe very far away
but

7674
02:08:23,589 --> 02:08:23,599
but
 

7675
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:25,990
but
this is a good example of

7676
02:08:25,990 --> 02:08:26,000
this is a good example of
 

7677
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:27,910
this is a good example of
two rivals who most of the time have

7678
02:08:27,910 --> 02:08:27,920
two rivals who most of the time have
 

7679
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,430
two rivals who most of the time have
avoided really intense violence so

7680
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:31,440
avoided really intense violence so
 

7681

02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:33,760
you talked about this like most of the
 

7683
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,030
you talked about this like most of the
time yeah rivals just like

7684
02:08:37,030 --> 02:08:37,040
time yeah rivals just like
 

7685
02:08:37,040 --> 02:08:38,950

it's gonna be really hard to find an
 

7705
02:08:57,280 --> 02:08:58,950
it's gonna be really hard to find an
agreement

7706
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:58,960
agreement
 

7707
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,270

7708
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,280
that both sides can feel they can honor
 

7709

7712
02:09:05,030 --> 02:09:05,040
they'll hold to that will enable them to
 

7713
02:09:05,040 --> 02:09:07,990
they'll hold to that will enable them to
move on yeah it feels like a first step

these things in like a dispassionate way
 

7947
02:12:54,800 --> 02:12:56,870
these things in like a dispassionate way
but unfortunately just having enough

but unfortunately just having enough
 

7949
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:58,629
but unfortunately just having enough
conversations even

7950
02:12:58,629 --> 02:12:58,639
conversations even
 

7951
02:12:58,639 --> 02:13:01,109
conversations even
your dispassionate description

7952
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
your dispassionate description
 

7953
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:03,270
your dispassionate description
would be seen as a

7954
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:03,280
would be seen as a
 

7955
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:06,149
would be seen as a
as a as one that's already picked aside

7956
02:13:06,149 --> 02:13:06,159
as a as one that's already picked aside
 

7957
02:13:06,159 --> 02:13:08,790
as a as one that's already picked aside
and i'll say this because there's

7958
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
and i'll say this because there's
 

7959
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,189
and i'll say this because there's
holding these ideals i'll give you

7960
02:13:11,189 --> 02:13:11,199
holding these ideals i'll give you
 

7961
02:13:11,199 --> 02:13:13,430
holding these ideals i'll give you
another example united states

7962
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:13,440
another example united states

02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:22,069
and other like human rights
so it has those ideals

7968
02:13:22,069 --> 02:13:22,079
so it has those ideals
 

7969
02:13:22,079 --> 02:13:23,669
so it has those ideals
and yet it also sees itself as a

7970
02:13:23,669 --> 02:13:23,679

and yet it also sees itself as a
superpower and as a

7972
02:13:25,830 --> 02:13:25,840

for regular people right and uh

8036
02:14:31,189 --> 02:14:31,199
for regular people right and uh
 

8037
02:14:31,199 --> 02:14:32,950
for regular people right and uh
and both sides

8038

sides or right kind of argument i'm just
 

8047
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:42,550
sides or right kind of argument i'm just
sort of saying on a i just think it's a

sort of saying on a i just think it's a
 

8049
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,189
sort of saying on a i just think it's a
factual statement that like neither one

8050
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:45,199
factual statement that like neither one
 

8051

wants to compromise on certain
 

8053
02:14:46,960 --> 02:14:48,229
wants to compromise on certain
principles

8054
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
principles
 

8055
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:50,390
principles
and and they're both

8056
02:14:50,390 --> 02:14:50,400
and and they're both
 

8057
02:14:50,400 --> 02:14:52,390
and and they're both
they both can construct and in some ways

8058
02:14:52,390 --> 02:14:52,400
they both can construct and in some ways
 

8059
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:53,510
they both can construct and in some ways
have very

8060
02:14:53,510 --> 02:14:53,520
have very
 

8061
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,109

reasonable i want to have have
 

8063
02:14:55,119 --> 02:14:57,030
reasonable i want to have have
self-justifications for those principles

8064
02:14:57,030 --> 02:14:57,040
self-justifications for those principles
 

8065
02:14:57,040 --> 02:14:59,030
self-justifications for those principles
and that's why i'm not very hopeful as i

8066
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,040
and that's why i'm not very hopeful as i
 

8067
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,870
and that's why i'm not very hopeful as i
don't see a way

you know in the second part of the book

8096
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,000
you know in the second part of the book
 

8097
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,430
you know in the second part of the book
i talk about what i think have been like

8098
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:35,440
i talk about what i think have been like
 

8099
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,030
i talk about what i think have been like
these persistent like paths to peace and

8100
02:15:37,030 --> 02:15:37,040
these persistent like paths to peace and
 

8101
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:38,149
these persistent like paths to peace and
one of them is increasing

8102
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
one of them is increasing
 

8103
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:40,069
one of them is increasing
interdependence and into relationships

8104
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
interdependence and into relationships
 

8105
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:41,750
interdependence and into relationships
and another one is

8106
02:15:41,750 --> 02:15:41,760
and another one is
 

8107
02:15:41,760 --> 02:15:44,550
and another one is
more checks and balances on power

8108
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:44,560
more checks and balances on power
 

8109
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:45,990
more checks and balances on power
i think there's more but those are

8110
02:15:45,990 --> 02:15:46,000
i think there's more but those are
 

8111
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,510
i think there's more but those are
things too that are really fundamental

8112
02:15:47,510 --> 02:15:47,520
things too that are really fundamental
 

8113
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:50,149
things too that are really fundamental
here because i think those two things

8114
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:50,159
here because i think those two things
 

8115
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:51,589
here because i think those two things
reduce the incentives for war in two

8116
02:15:51,589 --> 02:15:51,599
reduce the incentives for war in two
 

8117
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:53,589
reduce the incentives for war in two
ways one is like right now remember when

8118
02:15:53,589 --> 02:15:53,599
ways one is like right now remember when
 

8119
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:54,870
ways one is like right now remember when
we were talking about this really simple

i'm not even thinking of that that's

8140
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:17,360
i'm not even thinking of that that's
 

8141

in that simple game now in reality

8144
02:16:22,390 --> 02:16:22,400
in that simple game now in reality
 

8145
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,589
in that simple game now in reality
uh

8146
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:23,599
uh
 

8147
02:16:23,599 --> 02:16:25,189
uh
many groups do care about the well-being

8148
02:16:25,189 --> 02:16:25,199
many groups do care about the well-being
 

8149
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:26,870
many groups do care about the well-being
of the other group at least a little bit

8150
02:16:26,870 --> 02:16:26,880
of the other group at least a little bit
 

8151
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:28,950
of the other group at least a little bit
right we're in some sense to the degree

8152
02:16:28,950 --> 02:16:28,960
right we're in some sense to the degree
 

8153
02:16:28,960 --> 02:16:31,030
right we're in some sense to the degree
we first of all if our interests are

8154
02:16:31,030 --> 02:16:31,040
we first of all if our interests are
 

8155
02:16:31,040 --> 02:16:32,790
we first of all if our interests are
intertwined like our economies are

8156
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:32,800
intertwined like our economies are
 

8157
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:33,910

intertwined
 

8159
02:16:33,920 --> 02:16:34,790
intertwined
um

8160
02:16:34,790 --> 02:16:34,800
um
 

8161
02:16:34,800 --> 02:16:35,830
um
that

8162
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:35,840
that
 

8163
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,629
that
that's not a surefire

8164
02:16:38,629 --> 02:16:38,639
that's not a surefire
 

8165
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:40,230
that's not a surefire
way for peace and we shouldn't get

8166
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,240
way for peace and we shouldn't get
 

8167
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,589
way for peace and we shouldn't get
complacent because we have a globally

8168
02:16:41,589 --> 02:16:41,599
complacent because we have a globally
 

8169
02:16:41,599 --> 02:16:42,870
complacent because we have a globally
integrated world but that's going to be

8170
02:16:42,870 --> 02:16:42,880
integrated world but that's going to be
 

8171
02:16:42,880 --> 02:16:44,950
integrated world but that's going to be
a disincentive and if we're socially

8172
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:44,960
a disincentive and if we're socially
 

8173
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:46,469
a disincentive and if we're socially
entwined because we have great social

8174
02:16:46,469 --> 02:16:46,479
entwined because we have great social
 

8175
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:48,950
entwined because we have great social
relationships and linkages and family or

8176
02:16:48,950 --> 02:16:48,960
relationships and linkages and family or
 

8177
02:16:48,960 --> 02:16:50,870
relationships and linkages and family or
we're intermarriage or whatever this is

8178
02:16:50,870 --> 02:16:50,880
we're intermarriage or whatever this is
 

8179
02:16:50,880 --> 02:16:52,549
we're intermarriage or whatever this is
all these things will

8180
02:16:52,549 --> 02:16:52,559
all these things will
 

8181
02:16:52,559 --> 02:16:54,629
all these things will
will will will help and then if we're

8182
02:16:54,629 --> 02:16:54,639
will will will help and then if we're
 

8183
02:16:54,639 --> 02:16:56,469
will will will help and then if we're
ideologically intertwined maybe we share

8184
02:16:56,469 --> 02:16:56,479
ideologically intertwined maybe we share
 

8185
02:16:56,479 --> 02:16:57,270
ideologically intertwined maybe we share
a

8186
02:16:57,270 --> 02:16:57,280
a
 

8187
02:16:57,280 --> 02:16:58,950
a
notions of liberty or maybe we just

8188
02:16:58,950 --> 02:16:58,960
notions of liberty or maybe we just
 

8189
02:16:58,960 --> 02:17:00,790
notions of liberty or maybe we just
share a common notion of humanity so i

8190
02:17:00,790 --> 02:17:00,800
share a common notion of humanity so i
 

8191
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:02,070
share a common notion of humanity so i
think the fact that we're more

8192
02:17:02,070 --> 02:17:02,080
think the fact that we're more
 

8193
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:03,750
think the fact that we're more
integrated than we've ever been on all

8194
02:17:03,750 --> 02:17:03,760
integrated than we've ever been on all

8341
02:19:32,559 --> 02:19:33,669
there's that that feeling and i think
that means there's a lack of

in the region and we were going to track
 

8687
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,870
in the region and we were going to track
a thousand of them down we're going to

8688

a thousand of them down we're going to
 

8689
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:14,150
a thousand of them down we're going to
randomly sample them and then we're

8690

02:33:24,640 --> 02:33:26,469
phenomenon but then there's a question
like how do you actually

9220
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:26,479
like how do you actually
 

9221
02:33:26,479 --> 02:33:28,309
like how do you actually
how do you actually figure out how what

9222
02:33:28,309 --> 02:33:28,319
how do you actually figure out how what

like those services and how do they how
do you comparison shop between the

9230
02:33:35,270 --> 02:33:35,280
do you comparison shop between the
 

9231
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:36,950
do you comparison shop between the
police and the gang

9232
02:33:36,950 --> 02:33:36,960

02:33:39,429 --> 02:33:39,439
um and what would get you to go from the
 

9235
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:41,110
um and what would get you to go from the
gang to the police and then how's the

9236
02:33:41,110 --> 02:33:41,120
gang to the police and then how's the
 

9237
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:42,710
gang to the police and then how's the
gang strategically going to respond to

9238
02:33:42,710 --> 02:33:42,720
gang strategically going to respond to
 

9239
02:33:42,720 --> 02:33:43,429
gang strategically going to respond to
that

9240
02:33:43,429 --> 02:33:43,439
that
 

9241
02:33:43,439 --> 02:33:45,270
that
and what was the impact of previous

9242
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:45,280
and what was the impact of previous
 

9243
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:47,670
and what was the impact of previous
policies to like make state governing

9244
02:33:47,670 --> 02:33:47,680
policies to like make state governing
 

9245
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:48,469
policies to like make state governing
better

9246
02:33:48,469 --> 02:33:48,479
better
 

9247
02:33:48,479 --> 02:33:49,910
better
and how did the gangs react and so

9248
02:33:49,910 --> 02:33:49,920
and how did the gangs react and so
 

9249
02:33:49,920 --> 02:33:51,670
and how did the gangs react and so
that's we had to sort of figure that out

9250
02:33:51,670 --> 02:33:51,680
that's we had to sort of figure that out
 

9251
02:33:51,680 --> 02:33:53,510
that's we had to sort of figure that out
and that that was um so that was just

9252
02:33:53,510 --> 02:33:53,520
and that that was um so that was just
 

9253
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:55,110
and that that was um so that was just
hard in a different way but i don't do

9254
02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,120
hard in a different way but i don't do
 

9255
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:56,550
hard in a different way but i don't do
the emotion emotionally punishing stuff

9256
02:33:56,550 --> 02:33:56,560
the emotion emotionally punishing stuff
 

9257
02:33:56,560 --> 02:33:58,070
the emotion emotionally punishing stuff
i couldn't do any longer

9258
02:33:58,070 --> 02:33:58,080
i couldn't do any longer
 

9259
02:33:58,080 --> 02:34:00,710
i couldn't do any longer
so that's much easier in that sense

9260
02:34:00,710 --> 02:34:00,720
so that's much easier in that sense
 

9261
02:34:00,720 --> 02:34:02,550
so that's much easier in that sense
by the way on um

9262
02:34:02,550 --> 02:34:02,560
by the way on um
 

9263

maybe the reason i can do this work is

9360
02:35:46,630 --> 02:35:46,640
maybe the reason i can do this work is
 

9361
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:48,870
maybe the reason i can do this work is
because i don't think about it a lot

9362
02:35:48,870 --> 02:35:48,880
because i don't think about it a lot
 

9363
02:35:48,880 --> 02:35:51,110
because i don't think about it a lot
your own mortality or even like

your own mortality or even like
 

9365
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:52,870
your own mortality or even like
mortality

9366
02:35:52,870 --> 02:35:52,880
mortality
 

9367
02:35:52,880 --> 02:35:54,790
mortality
yeah well i have to think about death a

9368
02:35:54,790 --> 02:35:54,800
yeah well i have to think about death a
 

9369
02:35:54,800 --> 02:35:56,950
yeah well i have to think about death a
lot so

9370
02:35:56,950 --> 02:35:56,960
lot so
 

9371
02:35:56,960 --> 02:35:58,630
lot so
but there's a way to think about death

9372
02:35:58,630 --> 02:35:58,640
but there's a way to think about death
 

9373
02:35:58,640 --> 02:35:59,349
but there's a way to think about death
like

9374
02:35:59,349 --> 02:35:59,359
like
 

9375
02:35:59,359 --> 02:36:01,510
like
numbers in a calculation when you're

9376
02:36:01,510 --> 02:36:01,520
numbers in a calculation when you're
 

9377
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:04,230
numbers in a calculation when you're
doing geopolitical negotiations and then

9378
02:36:04,230 --> 02:36:04,240
doing geopolitical negotiations and then
 

9379
02:36:04,240 --> 02:36:05,590
doing geopolitical negotiations and then
there's like

9380
02:36:05,590 --> 02:36:05,600
there's like
 

9381
02:36:05,600 --> 02:36:08,469
there's like
a dying child or a dying

9382
02:36:08,469 --> 02:36:08,479
a dying child or a dying
 

9383
02:36:08,479 --> 02:36:10,309
a dying child or a dying
mother yes yeah

02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
mother yes yeah
 

9385
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:11,830
mother yes yeah
i guess i know i'm in a place where

9386
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:11,840
i guess i know i'm in a place where
 

9387
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:13,750
i guess i know i'm in a place where
there's risk and so i

9388
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:13,760
there's risk and so i
 

9389
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:16,630
there's risk and so i
think a lot about

9390
02:36:16,630 --> 02:36:16,640
think a lot about
 

9391
02:36:16,640 --> 02:36:19,750
think a lot about
minimizing any risk such that i i think

9392
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
minimizing any risk such that i i think
 

9393
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:22,469
minimizing any risk such that i i think
i think about mortality enough that i

9394
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
i think about mortality enough that i
 

9395
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:24,150
i think about mortality enough that i
just

9396
02:36:24,150 --> 02:36:24,160
just
 

9397
02:36:24,160 --> 02:36:25,830
just
because i'm kind of an anxious person

9398
02:36:25,830 --> 02:36:25,840
because i'm kind of an anxious person
 

9399
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:27,670
because i'm kind of an anxious person
like i'm kind of a worrywart like in a

9400
02:36:27,670 --> 02:36:27,680
like i'm kind of a worrywart like in a
 

9401
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,670
like i'm kind of a worrywart like in a
way uh

9402
02:36:29,670 --> 02:36:29,680
way uh
 

9403
02:36:29,680 --> 02:36:33,270
way uh
and so i'm really obsessive about

9404
02:36:33,270 --> 02:36:33,280
and so i'm really obsessive about
 

9405
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:35,270
and so i'm really obsessive about
making sure anything that i do is low

9406
02:36:35,270 --> 02:36:35,280
making sure anything that i do is low
 

9407
02:36:35,280 --> 02:36:37,910
making sure anything that i do is low
risk you know so that gives you

9408
02:36:37,910 --> 02:36:37,920
risk you know so that gives you
 

9409
02:36:37,920 --> 02:36:40,070
risk you know so that gives you
something to focus on a number is the

9410
02:36:40,070 --> 02:36:40,080
something to focus on a number is the
 

9411
02:36:40,080 --> 02:36:41,830
something to focus on a number is the
the risk and you're trying to minimize

9412
02:36:41,830 --> 02:36:41,840
the risk and you're trying to minimize
 

9413
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:42,870
the risk and you're trying to minimize
it

9414
02:36:42,870 --> 02:36:42,880
it
 

9415
02:36:42,880 --> 02:36:44,710
it
and yes there's still the existential

9416
02:36:44,710 --> 02:36:44,720
and yes there's still the existential
 

9417
02:36:44,720 --> 02:36:45,830
and yes there's still the existential
dread

9418
02:36:45,830 --> 02:36:45,840
dread
 

9419
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:47,110
dread
your risk

9420
02:36:47,110 --> 02:36:47,120
your risk
 

9421
02:36:47,120 --> 02:36:49,830
your risk
minimization doesn't matter i yeah i've

9422
02:36:49,830 --> 02:36:49,840
minimization doesn't matter i yeah i've
 

9423
02:36:49,840 --> 02:36:51,670
minimization doesn't matter i yeah i've
never been in a life-threatening

that sounds exactly the same because you
 

9439
02:37:05,520 --> 02:37:07,429

dangerous as those people right right
scooter so i've i've actually been a

9444
02:37:11,110 --> 02:37:11,120
scooter so i've i've actually been a
 

9445
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,270
scooter so i've i've actually been a
rock climber for like 25 years with a

9446
02:37:13,270 --> 02:37:13,280
rock climber for like 25 years with a
 

9447
02:37:13,280 --> 02:37:15,910
rock climber for like 25 years with a
long break in the between um but i'm the

9448
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:15,920
long break in the between um but i'm the
 

9449
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:17,750
long break in the between um but i'm the
same way you know actually rock climbing

9450
02:37:17,750 --> 02:37:17,760
same way you know actually rock climbing
 

9451
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,590
same way you know actually rock climbing
is an extremely safe sport if you're

9452
02:37:19,590 --> 02:37:19,600
is an extremely safe sport if you're
 

9453

very careful it but he's free climbing
 

9455
02:37:22,240 --> 02:37:24,070
very careful it but he's free climbing
is the opposite of that but i mean like

9456
02:37:24,070 --> 02:37:24,080

02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:18,389
watched like free solo or anything
there's just too much

9508
02:38:18,389 --> 02:38:18,399
there's just too much
 

9509
02:38:18,399 --> 02:38:20,150
there's just too much
um still not as dangerous as riding a

9510
02:38:20,150 --> 02:38:20,160
um still not as dangerous as riding a
 

9511
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,830
um still not as dangerous as riding a
scooter and awesome yeah absolutely not

9512
02:38:21,830 --> 02:38:21,840
scooter and awesome yeah absolutely not
 

9513
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,270
scooter and awesome yeah absolutely not
gonna let that go

9514
02:38:23,270 --> 02:38:23,280
gonna let that go
 

9515
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:24,070

uh
 

9517
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:26,630
uh
so but even in that it's a risk

9518
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:26,640
so but even in that it's a risk
 

9519
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:28,790
so but even in that it's a risk
minimization in the work that you do

9520
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:28,800
minimization in the work that you do
 

9521
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:29,830
minimization in the work that you do
versus

this and some of the because that was
 

9561
02:39:06,319 --> 02:39:07,910
this and some of the because that was
one of his questions for me like well

9562
02:39:07,910 --> 02:39:07,920
one of his questions for me like well
 

9563
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:09,670
one of his questions for me like well
how can you possibly believe that

how can you possibly believe that
 

9565
02:39:09,680 --> 02:39:11,510

02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:11,520
there's nothing afterwards
 

9567
02:39:11,520 --> 02:39:13,590
there's nothing afterwards
because that's just like too horrible to

9568
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:13,600
because that's just like too horrible to
 

9569
02:39:13,600 --> 02:39:14,630
because that's just like too horrible to
imagine

9570
02:39:14,630 --> 02:39:14,640
imagine
 

9571
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:16,790
imagine
and we we really never saw eye to eye on

9572
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:16,800
and we we really never saw eye to eye on
 

9573
02:39:16,800 --> 02:39:19,270
and we we really never saw eye to eye on
this and my view was like listen like

9574
02:39:19,270 --> 02:39:19,280
this and my view was like listen like
 

9575
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:21,190
this and my view was like listen like
i can't convince myself i believe like i

9576
02:39:21,190 --> 02:39:21,200
i can't convince myself i believe like i
 

9577
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:22,870
i can't convince myself i believe like i
can't convince myself otherwise anything

02:39:25,190 --> 02:39:25,200
else seems completely impossible to me
 

9581
02:39:25,200 --> 02:39:27,270
else seems completely impossible to me
and for some reason i can't understand

9582
02:39:27,270 --> 02:39:27,280
and for some reason i can't understand
 

9583
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:28,950
and for some reason i can't understand
i'm at peace with that like it's never

9584
02:39:28,950 --> 02:39:28,960
i'm at peace with that like it's never
 

9585
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:31,590
i'm at peace with that like it's never
bothered me that one day it's over

9586
02:39:31,590 --> 02:39:31,600
bothered me that one day it's over
 

9587
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:34,230
bothered me that one day it's over
and and i unders the fact that people

9588

and and i unders the fact that people
 

9589
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:36,070
and and i unders the fact that people
have angst about that and that they

9590

02:39:42,070 --> 02:39:42,080
that
 

9599
02:39:42,080 --> 02:39:45,270
that
doesn't consume me or doesn't bother me

9600
02:39:45,270 --> 02:39:45,280
doesn't consume me or doesn't bother me
 

9601

9607
02:39:51,200 --> 02:39:52,309
yep maybe if i was worried but if i was
more worried about it maybe i wouldn't

9608
02:39:52,309 --> 02:39:52,319
more worried about it maybe i wouldn't
 

9609
02:39:52,319 --> 02:39:53,349
more worried about it maybe i wouldn't
be able to do

9610
02:39:53,349 --> 02:39:53,359
be able to do
 

9611

02:43:15,750 --> 02:43:15,760
actually just needed trial and error i
 

9819
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:17,110
actually just needed trial and error i
actually had to try on like three or

this mixture of academia and activism

9824
02:43:21,110 --> 02:43:21,120
this mixture of academia and activism

02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:22,870
this mixture of academia and activism
and research and and international

and research and and international
 

9827
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:24,950
and research and and international
development and how did you know that

9828
02:43:24,950 --> 02:43:24,960
development and how did you know that
 

9829
02:43:24,960 --> 02:43:26,469
development and how did you know that
this was love

9830
02:43:26,469 --> 02:43:26,479
this was love
 

9831
02:43:26,479 --> 02:43:28,070
this was love
when you when you found this kind of

9832
02:43:28,070 --> 02:43:28,080
when you when you found this kind of
 

9833
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,670
when you when you found this kind of
international development like it's

9834
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
international development like it's
 

9835
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:32,710
international development like it's
decade academic context too the key

9836
02:43:32,710 --> 02:43:32,720
decade academic context too the key
 

9837
02:43:32,720 --> 02:43:34,309
decade academic context too the key
lesson was just trial and error which we

9838
02:43:34,309 --> 02:43:34,319
lesson was just trial and error which we
 

9839
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:35,990
lesson was just trial and error which we
all have to engage until until it feels

9840
02:43:35,990 --> 02:43:36,000
all have to engage until until it feels
 

9841
02:43:36,000 --> 02:43:37,910
all have to engage until until it feels
right it's okay all right step one is

9842
02:43:37,910 --> 02:43:37,920
right it's okay all right step one is
 

9843
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,389
right it's okay all right step one is
trial and error but until it feels right

9844
02:43:40,389 --> 02:43:40,399
trial and error but until it feels right
 

9845
02:43:40,399 --> 02:43:42,870
trial and error but until it feels right
because like it often feels right but

9846
02:43:42,870 --> 02:43:42,880
because like it often feels right but
 

9847
02:43:42,880 --> 02:43:44,230
because like it often feels right but
not perfect

9848
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,240
not perfect
 

9849
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:45,030
not perfect
yeah

9850
02:43:45,030 --> 02:43:45,040
yeah

9876
02:44:03,190 --> 02:44:03,200
i was like wait a second i could
 

9877
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:05,190
i was like wait a second i could
actually do that like just

9878
02:44:05,190 --> 02:44:05,200
actually do that like just
 

9879
02:44:05,200 --> 02:44:06,950

i could like research those things and
 

9881
02:44:06,960 --> 02:44:08,309
i could like research those things and
even write the neck those books and

02:44:08,309 --> 02:44:08,319
even write the neck those books and

that's kind of what i did like 25 years

9884
02:44:10,630 --> 02:44:10,640
that's kind of what i did like 25 years
 

9885
02:44:10,640 --> 02:44:12,469
that's kind of what i did like 25 years
later that didn't occur to me right away

9886
02:44:12,469 --> 02:44:12,479
later that didn't occur to me right away
 

9887
02:44:12,479 --> 02:44:14,309
later that didn't occur to me right away
i didn't even know it was possible this

9888
02:44:14,309 --> 02:44:14,319
i didn't even know it was possible this
 

9889
02:44:14,319 --> 02:44:16,309
i didn't even know it was possible this
is the other thing people do people do

9890
02:44:16,309 --> 02:44:16,319
is the other thing people do people do
 

9891
02:44:16,319 --> 02:44:17,429
is the other thing people do people do
their nine-to-five job and then they

9892
02:44:17,429 --> 02:44:17,439
their nine-to-five job and then they
 

9893
02:44:17,439 --> 02:44:19,110
their nine-to-five job and then they
find meeting and everything else they do

9894
02:44:19,110 --> 02:44:19,120
find meeting and everything else they do
 

9895
02:44:19,120 --> 02:44:20,630
find meeting and everything else they do
they're volunteering and their family

9896
02:44:20,630 --> 02:44:20,640
they're volunteering and their family
 

9897
02:44:20,640 --> 02:44:22,070
they're volunteering and their family
and their hobbies and things and that

9898
02:44:22,070 --> 02:44:22,080
and their hobbies and things and that
 

9899
02:44:22,080 --> 02:44:24,870
and their hobbies and things and that
was my social media and um and that's a

9900
02:44:24,870 --> 02:44:24,880
was my social media and um and that's a
 

9901
02:44:24,880 --> 02:44:26,469
was my social media and um and that's a
great path too like i mean that's

9902
02:44:26,469 --> 02:44:26,479
great path too like i mean that's
 

9903
02:44:26,479 --> 02:44:27,750
great path too like i mean that's
because not all of us can just have a

9904
02:44:27,750 --> 02:44:27,760
because not all of us can just have a
 

9905
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,349
because not all of us can just have a
vocation or we don't find it i think and

9906
02:44:29,349 --> 02:44:29,359
vocation or we don't find it i think and
 

9907
02:44:29,359 --> 02:44:30,950
vocation or we don't find it i think and
then you just circumscribe what you do

9908
02:44:30,950 --> 02:44:30,960
then you just circumscribe what you do
 

9909
02:44:30,960 --> 02:44:33,269
then you just circumscribe what you do
in your work and then you go find

9910
02:44:33,269 --> 02:44:33,279
in your work and then you go find
 

9911
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:35,349
in your work and then you go find
um and that's not entirely true because

9912
02:44:35,349 --> 02:44:35,359
um and that's not entirely true because
 

9913
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:37,030
um and that's not entirely true because
everyone in my family does like their

9914
02:44:37,030 --> 02:44:37,040
everyone in my family does like their
 

9915
02:44:37,040 --> 02:44:39,030
everyone in my family does like their
job and get a lot of fulfillment out of

9916
02:44:39,030 --> 02:44:39,040
job and get a lot of fulfillment out of
 

9917
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:41,910
job and get a lot of fulfillment out of
it but um but i think it's not

9918
02:44:41,910 --> 02:44:41,920
it but um but i think it's not
 

9919
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:44,150
it but um but i think it's not
it's that's that's a different path in

9920
02:44:44,150 --> 02:44:44,160
it's that's that's a different path in
 

9921
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,910
it's that's that's a different path in
some ways so it's good to take the leap

9922
02:44:45,910 --> 02:44:45,920
some ways so it's good to take the leap
 

9923
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,670
some ways so it's good to take the leap
and keep trying stuff even when you

9924
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:47,680
and keep trying stuff even when you
 

9925
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,910
and keep trying stuff even when you
found like a little locum

9926
02:44:49,910 --> 02:44:49,920
found like a little locum
 

9927
02:44:49,920 --> 02:44:53,510
found like a little locum
local minima yeah the hardest part was

9928
02:44:53,510 --> 02:44:53,520
local minima yeah the hardest part was
 

9929
02:44:53,520 --> 02:44:55,830
local minima yeah the hardest part was
it got easy after a while it was was

9930
02:44:55,830 --> 02:44:55,840
it got easy after a while it was was
 

9931
02:44:55,840 --> 02:44:57,110

i was like no no here's the logic here's
 

9999
02:45:57,680 --> 02:45:59,429
i was like no no here's the logic here's
what tyler says and then we started

10000
02:45:59,429 --> 02:45:59,439
what tyler says and then we started
 

10001
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:00,710
what tyler says and then we started
doing it and it was so freeing and

10002
02:46:00,710 --> 02:46:00,720
doing it and it was so freeing and
 

10003
02:46:00,720 --> 02:46:02,389
doing it and it was so freeing and
glorious we just go we take so many more

10004
02:46:02,389 --> 02:46:02,399
glorious we just go we take so many more
 

10005
02:46:02,399 --> 02:46:04,950
glorious we just go we take so many more
chances on things yeah and we would and

10006
02:46:04,950 --> 02:46:04,960
chances on things yeah and we would and
 

10007
02:46:04,960 --> 02:46:06,469
chances on things yeah and we would and
if we didn't like it we were walking out

10008
02:46:06,469 --> 02:46:06,479
if we didn't like it we were walking out
 

10009
02:46:06,479 --> 02:46:07,990
if we didn't like it we were walking out
of stuff all the time

10010
02:46:07,990 --> 02:46:08,000
of stuff all the time
 

10011
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:11,110
of stuff all the time
um and so i i think i did that without

10012
02:46:11,110 --> 02:46:11,120
um and so i i think i did that without
 

10013
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:12,950
um and so i i think i did that without
realizing that that's how i like to i

10014
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:12,960
realizing that that's how i like to i
 

10015
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:14,710
realizing that that's how i like to i

yeah and trying to find something else
at like some risk because that's how

10020
02:46:18,389 --> 02:46:18,399
at like some risk because that's how
 

10021
02:46:18,399 --> 02:46:22,790
at like some risk because that's how
wars start without the commitment

10022
02:46:22,790 --> 02:46:22,800

 

10023
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:26,150

you need the commitment otherwise uh no

you need the commitment otherwise uh no
 

10025
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:27,349
you need the commitment otherwise uh no

10026
02:46:27,349 --> 02:46:27,359
that's a different kind of commitment
 

10027
02:46:27,359 --> 02:46:28,710
that's a different kind of commitment
problem that's a different different

10028
02:46:28,710 --> 02:46:28,720
problem that's a different different
 

10029
02:46:28,720 --> 02:46:30,550
problem that's a different different
commitment problem so some of it i'm

10030
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:30,560
commitment problem so some of it i'm
 

10031
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:31,910
commitment problem so some of it i'm
sure there's a balance because i mean

10032
02:46:31,910 --> 02:46:31,920
sure there's a balance because i mean
 

10033
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:33,510

10039
02:46:36,880 --> 02:46:40,150
things and there's some value just
sticking it out because some of the like

10040

10053
02:46:51,680 --> 02:46:53,269

she was very wary of a relationship with

10054
02:46:53,269 --> 02:46:53,279
she was very wary of a relationship with
 

10055
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:56,309
she was very wary of a relationship with
me because i explained to her um

10056
02:46:56,309 --> 02:46:56,319
me because i explained to her um
 

10057
02:46:56,319 --> 02:46:57,750
me because i explained to her um
i hadn't had a relationship longer than

10058
02:46:57,750 --> 02:46:57,760
i hadn't had a relationship longer than
 

10059
02:46:57,760 --> 02:46:59,990
i hadn't had a relationship longer than
two or three months and 11 years

10060
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
two or three months and 11 years
 

10061
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:01,349
two or three months and 11 years
and so she thought this person's on

10062
02:47:01,349 --> 02:47:01,359
and so she thought this person's on
 

10063
02:47:01,359 --> 02:47:03,429
and so she thought this person's on
serious and what i said to her she tells

10064
02:47:03,429 --> 02:47:03,439
serious and what i said to her she tells
 

10065
02:47:03,439 --> 02:47:04,870
serious and what i said to her she tells
the story this is how she tells her she

10066
02:47:04,870 --> 02:47:04,880
the story this is how she tells her she
 

10067
02:47:04,880 --> 02:47:06,150
the story this is how she tells her she
says i didn't believe him when he said

10068
02:47:06,150 --> 02:47:06,160
says i didn't believe him when he said
 

10069
02:47:06,160 --> 02:47:07,670
says i didn't believe him when he said
that i just after two or three months

10070
02:47:07,670 --> 02:47:07,680
that i just after two or three months
 

10071
02:47:07,680 --> 02:47:09,590
that i just after two or three months
you kind of have a good sense

10072
02:47:09,590 --> 02:47:09,600
you kind of have a good sense
 

10073
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:10,950
you kind of have a good sense
whether this is going somewhere and i

10074
02:47:10,950 --> 02:47:10,960
whether this is going somewhere and i
 

10075
02:47:10,960 --> 02:47:12,950
whether this is going somewhere and i
would just decide if it was over so and

10076
02:47:12,950 --> 02:47:12,960
would just decide if it was over so and
 

10077
02:47:12,960 --> 02:47:14,230
would just decide if it was over so and
i walk away so i took this approach to

10078
02:47:14,230 --> 02:47:14,240
i walk away so i took this approach to
 

10079
02:47:14,240 --> 02:47:15,269
i walk away so i took this approach to
dayton like as soon as i thought it

10080
02:47:15,269 --> 02:47:15,279
dayton like as soon as i thought it
 

10081
02:47:15,279 --> 02:47:17,030
dayton like as soon as i thought it
wasn't going to go somewhere

10082
02:47:17,030 --> 02:47:17,040
wasn't going to go somewhere
 

10083
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:18,950
wasn't going to go somewhere
