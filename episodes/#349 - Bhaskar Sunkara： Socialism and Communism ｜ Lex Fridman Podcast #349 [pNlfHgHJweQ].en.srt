let's start with a big broad question

192
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:44,580
let's start with a big broad question
 

193
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,449
let's start with a big broad question
what is socialism how do you like to

194
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:47,459
what is socialism how do you like to
 

195
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,070
what is socialism how do you like to
Define it how do you like to think about

196
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:49,080
Define it how do you like to think about
 

197
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,990
Define it how do you like to think about
it well there's so many socialists out

198
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:51,000
it well there's so many socialists out
 

199
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,809
it well there's so many socialists out
there and we can't seem to agree about

200
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:53,819
there and we can't seem to agree about
 

201
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,850
there and we can't seem to agree about
anything so my definition I'm sure is

202
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:55,860
anything so my definition I'm sure is
 

203
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,649
anything so my definition I'm sure is
you know really just my definition but I

204
00:03:57,649 --> 00:03:57,659
you know really just my definition but I
 

205
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,410
you know really just my definition but I
think at the minimum socialism is about

206
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:00,420
think at the minimum socialism is about
 

207
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,110
think at the minimum socialism is about
making sure that the core necessities of

208
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,120
making sure that the core necessities of
 

209
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,949
making sure that the core necessities of
life

210
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:03,959
life
 

211
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,729
life
food housing education and so on are

212
00:04:07,729 --> 00:04:07,739
food housing education and so on are
 

213
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:09,890
food housing education and so on are
guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of

214
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:09,900
guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of
 

215
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,509
guaranteed to everyone just by virtue of
being born so that those people can

216
00:04:11,509 --> 00:04:11,519
being born so that those people can
 

217
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,030
being born so that those people can
reach their potential and I think that's

218
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,040
reach their potential and I think that's
 

219
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,530
reach their potential and I think that's
a that's a minimum requirement of

220
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:15,540
a that's a minimum requirement of
 

221
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,530
a that's a minimum requirement of
socialism beyond that I think socialism

222
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:18,540
socialism beyond that I think socialism
 

223
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,870
socialism beyond that I think socialism
especially Democratic socialism the type

224
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:20,880
especially Democratic socialism the type
 

225
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,850
especially Democratic socialism the type
of socialism that I believe in is about

226
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:22,860
of socialism that I believe in is about
 

227
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,210
of socialism that I believe in is about
taking democracy from just the political

228
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:26,220
taking democracy from just the political
 

229
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,730
taking democracy from just the political
Democratic realm and extending it into

230
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:28,740
Democratic realm and extending it into
 

231
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,430
Democratic realm and extending it into
economic and social spheres as well so

232
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:31,440
economic and social spheres as well so
 

233
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,990
economic and social spheres as well so
if we think that democracy is a good

234
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,000
if we think that democracy is a good
 

235
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,830
if we think that democracy is a good
thing why do we allow our workplaces to

00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:36,840
thing why do we allow our workplaces to
 

237
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,409

I think at the core it's the idea that

254
00:05:01,909 --> 00:05:01,919
I think at the core it's the idea that
 

255
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,390
I think at the core it's the idea that
we have intrinsic value we are

256
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,400
we have intrinsic value we are
 

257
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,390

different things but this unique
 

263
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,469
different things but this unique
individualness can only Truly Come to

487
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,290
freedom and autonomy are you going to
prioritize the freedom and autonomy of

488
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:00,300
prioritize the freedom and autonomy of
 

489
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,150
prioritize the freedom and autonomy of
the entrepreneur

490
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
the entrepreneur
 

491
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,650
the entrepreneur
um or the capitalist in this case or the

492
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:03,660
um or the capitalist in this case or the
 

493
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,470
um or the capitalist in this case or the
freedom of autonomy of ordinary workers

494
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:06,480
freedom of autonomy of ordinary workers
 

495
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,990
freedom of autonomy of ordinary workers
now you could create a society that

496
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,000
now you could create a society that
 

497
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,590
now you could create a society that
swings so far in the direction of

498
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:12,600
swings so far in the direction of
 

499
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,810
swings so far in the direction of
um prioritizing the freedom of one group

500
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:14,820
um prioritizing the freedom of one group
 

501
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,630
um prioritizing the freedom of one group
or one class or whatever else compared

502
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
or one class or whatever else compared
 

503
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,310
or one class or whatever else compared
to another that you end up in some sort

504
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:19,320
to another that you end up in some sort
 

505
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,710
to another that you end up in some sort
of tyranny now if the state said

506
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:21,720
of tyranny now if the state said
 

507
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,750
of tyranny now if the state said
you know you Lex you're you're a

508
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
you know you Lex you're you're a
 

509
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,550
you know you Lex you're you're a
capitalist so you don't get the right to

510
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:25,560
capitalist so you don't get the right to
 

511
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,250
capitalist so you don't get the right to
vote or we're going to take away your

um things that we think are intrinsic

516
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:33,240
um things that we think are intrinsic
 

517
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,150
um things that we think are intrinsic
human rights now this would be tyranny

518
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:35,160
human rights now this would be tyranny
 

519
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,610
human rights now this would be tyranny
this would be an abridgement of of your

520
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:37,620
this would be an abridgement of of your
 

521
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,550
this would be an abridgement of of your
your rights but shaping your ability in

522
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:40,560
your rights but shaping your ability in
 

523
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,070
your rights but shaping your ability in
the economic sphere to be in an economic

524
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,080
the economic sphere to be in an economic
 

525
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,350
the economic sphere to be in an economic
actor is I think within the realm and

526
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:45,360
actor is I think within the realm and
 

527
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,630
actor is I think within the realm and
scope of democratic politics

528
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:47,640
scope of democratic politics
 

529
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,550
scope of democratic politics
yeah so those are the extremes you're

530
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:49,560
yeah so those are the extremes you're
 

531
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,130
yeah so those are the extremes you're
referring to and uh

532
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,140
referring to and uh
 

533
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,069
referring to and uh
one perspective I like to take on

534
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
one perspective I like to take on
 

535
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,949
one perspective I like to take on
socialism versus capitalism is

536
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:57,959
socialism versus capitalism is
 

537
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,230
socialism versus capitalism is
under each system the extremes of each

538
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,240
under each system the extremes of each
 

539
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,269
under each system the extremes of each
systems and the moderate versions of

540
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:02,279
systems and the moderate versions of
 

541
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:03,889
systems and the moderate versions of
each system

542
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:03,899
each system
 

543
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,009
each system
how can people take advantage of it

544
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:07,019
how can people take advantage of it
 

545
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:09,170
how can people take advantage of it
so it seems like no matter what part of

546
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:09,180
so it seems like no matter what part of
 

547
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,509
so it seems like no matter what part of
human nature is whatever the rules

548
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:11,519
human nature is whatever the rules
 

549
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,949
human nature is whatever the rules
whatever the framework whatever the

550
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
whatever the framework whatever the
 

551
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,150
whatever the framework whatever the
system somebody's going to take

552
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
system somebody's going to take
 

553
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,449
system somebody's going to take
advantage of it and

554
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:17,459
advantage of it and
 

555
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,850
advantage of it and
that's the kind of pragmatic look at it

556
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
that's the kind of pragmatic look at it
 

557
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,490
that's the kind of pragmatic look at it
in practice what actually happens also

558
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:24,500
in practice what actually happens also
 

559
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,230
in practice what actually happens also
the incentives and the human behavior

560
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,240
the incentives and the human behavior
 

561
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,970
the incentives and the human behavior
what actually happens in practice under

562
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:28,980
what actually happens in practice under
 

563
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,490
what actually happens in practice under
these systems so if you have a higher

564
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:31,500
these systems so if you have a higher
 

565
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,889
these systems so if you have a higher
and higher minimum wage and people watch

566
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:33,899
and higher minimum wage and people watch
 

567
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:36,590
and higher minimum wage and people watch
more and more NFL how does that change

568
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:36,600
more and more NFL how does that change
 

569
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,930
more and more NFL how does that change

570
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:38,940

to watch so like it's both how do people

582
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:52,500
to watch so like it's both how do people
 

583
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,050
to watch so like it's both how do people
malicious people that want to take

584
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:54,060
malicious people that want to take
 

585
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,170
malicious people that want to take
advantage maybe not malicious but

586
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:57,180
advantage maybe not malicious but
 

587
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,530
advantage maybe not malicious but
people that like me are lazy and want to

588
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:00,540
people that like me are lazy and want to
 

589
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,009
people that like me are lazy and want to
take advantage uh and people that

590
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:04,019
take advantage uh and people that
 

591
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,470
take advantage uh and people that
also I think like me like I I tend to

592
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
also I think like me like I I tend to
 

593
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,690
also I think like me like I I tend to
believe about myself that I have

594
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:08,700
believe about myself that I have
 

595
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,250
believe about myself that I have
potential

596
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
potential
 

597
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,250
potential
and if I let my laziness naturally take

598
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:13,260
and if I let my laziness naturally take
 

599
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,650
and if I let my laziness naturally take
over which it often does I won't

600
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:15,660
over which it often does I won't
 

601
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,389
over which it often does I won't
materialize the potential

602
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,399
materialize the potential
 

603
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,130
materialize the potential
so if you

604
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,140
so if you
 

605
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,889
so if you
um if you make life too easy for me I

606
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:21,899
um if you make life too easy for me I
 

607
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:23,569
um if you make life too easy for me I
feel like I will never get anything done

608
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:23,579
feel like I will never get anything done
 

609
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,990
feel like I will never get anything done
me personally of course there's a giant

610
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,000
me personally of course there's a giant
 

611
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,230
me personally of course there's a giant
set of circumstances of The Unlucky and

612
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
set of circumstances of The Unlucky and
 

613
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,750
set of circumstances of The Unlucky and
the overburdened and so on okay so how

614
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:32,760
the overburdened and so on okay so how
 

615
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,329
the overburdened and so on okay so how
can people take advantage of each system

616
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:35,339
can people take advantage of each system
 

617
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:37,910
can people take advantage of each system
socialism capitalism so for one thing

618
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:37,920
socialism capitalism so for one thing
 

619
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,769
socialism capitalism so for one thing
people are going to take advantage of

620
00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:39,779
people are going to take advantage of
 

621
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,210
people are going to take advantage of
systems they're going to find loopholes

622
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:41,220
systems they're going to find loopholes
 

623
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,110
systems they're going to find loopholes
they're going to find ways around

624
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,120
they're going to find ways around
 

625
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,530
they're going to find ways around
they're going to find ways to to at

626
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:45,540
they're going to find ways to to at
 

627
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,350
they're going to find ways to to at
times Dominate and chorus others even in

628
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:48,360
times Dominate and chorus others even in
 

629
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,090
times Dominate and chorus others even in
systems meant to get rid of domination

630
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:50,100
systems meant to get rid of domination
 

631
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,009
systems meant to get rid of domination
and coercion that's why we need to

632
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:52,019
and coercion that's why we need to
 

633
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,050
and coercion that's why we need to
design our systems in our such a way

634
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:54,060
design our systems in our such a way
 

635
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,569
design our systems in our such a way
that that it eliminates as many of these

636
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:56,579
that that it eliminates as many of these
 

637
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,190
that that it eliminates as many of these
things as possible and also that's why

638
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,200
things as possible and also that's why
 

639
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,250
things as possible and also that's why
we need democracy we need Freedom so in

640
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:01,260
we need democracy we need Freedom so in
 

641
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,949
we need democracy we need Freedom so in
a Soviet system for instance you have

642
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:03,959
a Soviet system for instance you have
 

643
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,870
a Soviet system for instance you have
the rise of this authoritarian

644
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:05,880
the rise of this authoritarian
 

645
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,329
the rise of this authoritarian
bureaucracy that dominated of course

646
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:08,339
bureaucracy that dominated of course
 

647
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,730
bureaucracy that dominated of course

socialism

1128
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,120
socialism
 

1129
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,110
socialism
we talked about the higher level the

1130
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,120
we talked about the higher level the
 

1131
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,210
we talked about the higher level the
higher kind of vision of socialism the

1132
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:26,220
higher kind of vision of socialism the
 

1133
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,810
higher kind of vision of socialism the
ideals the philosophical ideas

1134
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:28,820
ideals the philosophical ideas
 

1135
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,490
ideals the philosophical ideas
but how does it all fit into the big

1136
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:31,500
but how does it all fit into the big
 

1137
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,090
but how does it all fit into the big
picture historically of ideas of Marxism

1138
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:35,100
picture historically of ideas of Marxism
 

1139
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,710
picture historically of ideas of Marxism
communism

1140
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:36,720
communism
 

1141
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,890
communism
uh and socialism as as it was defined

1142
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:39,900
uh and socialism as as it was defined
 

1143
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,930
uh and socialism as as it was defined
and experienced and implemented in the

1144
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:41,940
and experienced and implemented in the
 

1145
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,430
and experienced and implemented in the
20th century so what's your key

1146
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
20th century so what's your key
 

1147
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,289
20th century so what's your key
differences maybe even just like

1148
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:45,299
differences maybe even just like
 

1149
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:48,830
differences maybe even just like
socialism communism yeah well I hate the

1150
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:48,840
socialism communism yeah well I hate the
 

1151
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,870
socialism communism yeah well I hate the
no true Scotsman sort of response to

1152
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:50,880
no true Scotsman sort of response to
 

1153
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,870
no true Scotsman sort of response to
this which is oh that socialism is bad

1154
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:53,880
this which is oh that socialism is bad
 

1155
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,390
this which is oh that socialism is bad
so it wasn't really socialism and my

1156
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
so it wasn't really socialism and my
 

1157
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,149
so it wasn't really socialism and my
socialism is good so it is socialism

1158
00:22:59,149 --> 00:22:59,159
socialism is good so it is socialism
 

1159
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,090
socialism is good so it is socialism
um but I think that socialism and

1160
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,100
um but I think that socialism and
 

1161
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,510
um but I think that socialism and
communism share a common ancestor which

1162
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:05,520
communism share a common ancestor which
 

1163
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,230
communism share a common ancestor which
is they both emerged out of the turmoil

1164
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:09,240
is they both emerged out of the turmoil
 

1165
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,250
is they both emerged out of the turmoil
and development of late 19th century

1166
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:12,260
and development of late 19th century
 

1167
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:15,230
and development of late 19th century
capitalism and the fact that there was

1168
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:15,240
capitalism and the fact that there was
 

1169
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,210
capitalism and the fact that there was
all these workers parties that were

1170
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:17,220
all these workers parties that were
 

1171
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,510
all these workers parties that were
organizing across the capitalist World

1172
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:20,520
organizing across the capitalist World
 

1173
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,730
organizing across the capitalist World
um so in Europe for instance

1174
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:22,740
um so in Europe for instance
 

1175
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,430
um so in Europe for instance
you had this Mass party called the

1176
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:25,440
you had this Mass party called the
 

1177
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,830
you had this Mass party called the
German Social Democratic party

German Social Democratic party
 

1179
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,830
German Social Democratic party

um in the uh that became probably the
 

1181
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,049
um in the uh that became probably the
most important the most vibrant party in

most important the most vibrant party in
 

1183
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,990
most important the most vibrant party in
Germany in the 1880s and 1890s but they

1184
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
Germany in the 1880s and 1890s but they
 

1185
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,270
Germany in the 1880s and 1890s but they
were locked out a power because Germany

1186
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:38,280
were locked out a power because Germany
 

1187
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,909

paper wanted to go beyond capitalism but
 

1299
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,649

in practice they just manage capitalism
 

1301
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,350
in practice they just manage capitalism
better in the interests of workers

and in practice to me social democracy
 

1309
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,630
and in practice to me social democracy
means trying to insert doses of

means trying to insert doses of
 

1311
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,430
means trying to insert doses of
socialism within capitalism but

1312
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:13,440
socialism within capitalism but
 

1313
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,370
socialism within capitalism but
maintaining capitalism communism meant

this attempt to build a socialism

1316
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:17,940
this attempt to build a socialism
 

1317
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,870
this attempt to build a socialism
outside of capitalism and often

1318
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
outside of capitalism and often
 

1319
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,250
outside of capitalism and often
authoritarian ways in part because of

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:24,260
authoritarian ways in part because of
 

1321
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,169
authoritarian ways in part because of
the ideology of these Communists but in

1322
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:27,179
the ideology of these Communists but in
 

1323
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:28,669
the ideology of these Communists but in
part because of the conditions in which

1324
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:28,679
part because of the conditions in which
 

1325
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:29,930
part because of the conditions in which
they inherited you know they were

1326
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:29,940
they inherited you know they were
 

1327
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,310
they inherited you know they were
inheriting a democracy they were

ruled by the tsars for you know for

1332
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
ruled by the tsars for you know for
 

1333
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,850
ruled by the tsars for you know for
centuries

1334
00:26:37,850 --> 00:26:37,860
centuries
 

1335
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,890
centuries
um and with very little condition like a

1336
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:39,900
um and with very little condition like a
 

1337
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,990
um and with very little condition like a
very weak working class you know very

1338
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,000
very weak working class you know very
 

1339
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,390
very weak working class you know very
you know poor and devastated by War and

1340
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
you know poor and devastated by War and
 

1341
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,430
you know poor and devastated by War and
so on where authoritarianism kind of

1342
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:46,440
so on where authoritarianism kind of
 

1343
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,669
so on where authoritarianism kind of
landed itself uh to those conditions

1344
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
landed itself uh to those conditions
 

1345
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,470
landed itself uh to those conditions
um and then there's me you know then

1346
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:51,480
um and then there's me you know then
 

1347
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,970
um and then there's me you know then
there's Democratic socialists and the

1348
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:52,980
there's Democratic socialists and the
 

1349
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,130
there's Democratic socialists and the
way I would Define it is we like a lot

1350
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:55,140
way I would Define it is we like a lot
 

1351
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,330
way I would Define it is we like a lot
of what the social Democrats

1352
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:56,340
of what the social Democrats
 

1353
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,149
of what the social Democrats
accomplished but we still believe in

00:26:59,149 --> 00:26:59,159
accomplished but we still believe in
 

1355
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,730
accomplished but we still believe in
going Beyond capitalism and not just

1356
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:01,740
going Beyond capitalism and not just
 

1357
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,950
going Beyond capitalism and not just
building socialism within capitalism but

1358
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:03,960
building socialism within capitalism but
 

1359
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,230
building socialism within capitalism but
we believe in this ultimate vision of a

1360
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:06,240
we believe in this ultimate vision of a
 

1361
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,110
we believe in this ultimate vision of a
world after capitalism

1362
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
world after capitalism
 

1363
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,870
world after capitalism
what is that world look like and how is

1364
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:11,880
what is that world look like and how is
 

1365
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,250
what is that world look like and how is
it different from communism actually

1366
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,260
it different from communism actually
 

1367
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,769
it different from communism actually
maybe we can linger before we talk about

1368
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:15,779
maybe we can linger before we talk about
 

1369
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,230
maybe we can linger before we talk about
your vision of democratic socialism

1370
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
your vision of democratic socialism
 

1371
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,890
your vision of democratic socialism
what was wrong with Communism stalinism

1372
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:21,900
what was wrong with Communism stalinism
 

1373
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,630
what was wrong with Communism stalinism
implementation of Communism in the

1374
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:23,640
implementation of Communism in the
 

1375
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,570
implementation of Communism in the
Soviet Union why did it go wrong

1376
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:26,580
Soviet Union why did it go wrong
 

1377
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,730
Soviet Union why did it go wrong
so and in what ways did it not go wrong

1378
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:28,740
so and in what ways did it not go wrong
 

1379
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,070
so and in what ways did it not go wrong
in what ways did it succeed let me start

1380
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:31,080
in what ways did it succeed let me start
 

1381
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,210
in what ways did it succeed let me start
with the second part of that question

1382
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:32,220
with the second part of that question
 

1383
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,490
with the second part of that question
and that's a very difficult one to

1384
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:34,500
and that's a very difficult one to
 

1385
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,049
and that's a very difficult one to
answer in part because

1386
00:27:36,049 --> 00:27:36,059
answer in part because
 

1387
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,710
answer in part because
I morally and ethically am opposed to

00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:41,820
any form of authoritarianism or
 

1391
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,970
any form of authoritarianism or
dictatorship and often when you talk

1392
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:43,980
dictatorship and often when you talk
 

1393
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,730
dictatorship and often when you talk
about the successes of a government or

1394
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:46,740
about the successes of a government or
 

1395
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,769
about the successes of a government or
what it did developmentally that might

1396
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:48,779
what it did developmentally that might
 

1397
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,990
what it did developmentally that might
have been positive we have to abstract

1398
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,000
have been positive we have to abstract
 

1399
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,850
have been positive we have to abstract
ourselves from what we morally believe

1400
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:52,860
ourselves from what we morally believe
 

1401
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,950
ourselves from what we morally believe
and just just kind of look at the record

1402
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
and just just kind of look at the record
 

1403
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,690
and just just kind of look at the record
right

1404
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:56,700
right
 

1405
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,149
right
I would say that the Soviet experiment

1406
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:01,159
I would say that the Soviet experiment
 

1407
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,230
I would say that the Soviet experiment
started off by in Lenin's time as the

started off by in Lenin's time as the
 

1409
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,810
started off by in Lenin's time as the
attempt to kind of just hold a holding

1410
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:08,820
attempt to kind of just hold a holding
 

1411
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,649
attempt to kind of just hold a holding
action

1412
00:28:09,649 --> 00:28:09,659
action
 

1413

moderate socialists anyway but
 

1433
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,310
moderate socialists anyway but
the alternative in their minds was going

1434
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,320
the alternative in their minds was going
 

1435
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,370
the alternative in their minds was going
to be a far-right reaction you know some

1436

to be a far-right reaction you know some

collectivization was a disaster I mean
 

1547
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,230
collectivization was a disaster I mean
first of all I think was built on the

first of all I think was built on the

more productivity when in fact
 

1553
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:52,190
more productivity when in fact
especially in agriculture but in any

especially in agriculture but in any
 

1555
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,510
especially in agriculture but in any
field it's a little bit more complicated

1556
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
field it's a little bit more complicated
 

1557
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,090
field it's a little bit more complicated
than that and it led to millions of

1558
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:56,100
than that and it led to millions of
 

1559
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,830
than that and it led to millions of
deaths you know it led to famine it let

00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:57,840
deaths you know it led to famine it let

a host of other problems
 

1563
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,990
a host of other problems
um industrialization uh in the way that

1564
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:03,000
um industrialization uh in the way that
 

1565
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,789
um industrialization uh in the way that
it happened under Stalin also kind of

1566
00:31:04,789 --> 00:31:04,799
it happened under Stalin also kind of
 

1567
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,850
it happened under Stalin also kind of
unbalanced the Soviet economy to lean

1568
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:07,860
unbalanced the Soviet economy to lean
 

1569
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,669
unbalanced the Soviet economy to lean
too heavy towards heavy industry not

1570
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:10,679
too heavy towards heavy industry not
 

1571
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,490
too heavy towards heavy industry not
enough for medium or Light Industry

1572
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:13,500
enough for medium or Light Industry
 

1573
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,490
enough for medium or Light Industry
um but

1574
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:15,500
um but
 

1575
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,070
um but
this did mean especially the um The

1576
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:19,080
this did mean especially the um The
 

1577
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,310
this did mean especially the um The
Five-Year Plan in industrialization did

1578
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
Five-Year Plan in industrialization did
 

1579
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,630
Five-Year Plan in industrialization did
manage to put Russia on a different

1580
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:25,640
manage to put Russia on a different
 

1581
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:28,010
manage to put Russia on a different
developmental trajectory

1582
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:28,020
developmental trajectory
 

1583
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,389
developmental trajectory
so

1584
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:29,399
so
 

1585
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,389
so
by the time the post-war period came

1586
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:32,399
by the time the post-war period came
 

1587
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,250
by the time the post-war period came
the one it might have gave them the

1588
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:34,260
the one it might have gave them the
 

1589
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,470
the one it might have gave them the
ability to survive the Nazi invasion to

1590
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
ability to survive the Nazi invasion to
 

1591
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,090
ability to survive the Nazi invasion to
begin with it was a complicated question

1592
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:38,100
begin with it was a complicated question
 

1593
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,830
begin with it was a complicated question
and then by the time the post-war period

1594
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:39,840
and then by the time the post-war period
 

1595
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,830
and then by the time the post-war period
came uh Russia had kind of jumped ahead

1596
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:42,840
came uh Russia had kind of jumped ahead
 

1597
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,750
came uh Russia had kind of jumped ahead
of its developmental trajectory in a way

1598
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:44,760
of its developmental trajectory in a way
 

1599
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,850
of its developmental trajectory in a way
that a lot of other countries didn't do

1600
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:46,860
that a lot of other countries didn't do
 

1601
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,470
that a lot of other countries didn't do
there are a few examples like Japan is

1602
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:48,480
there are a few examples like Japan is
 

1603
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,710
there are a few examples like Japan is
one to manage to if you kind of ran a

1604
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:51,720
one to manage to if you kind of ran a
 

1605
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,190
one to manage to if you kind of ran a
scenario where Japan would be in the

1606
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,200
scenario where Japan would be in the
 

1607
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,830
scenario where Japan would be in the
1870s 1880s and ran it 100 times the

1608
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
1870s 1880s and ran it 100 times the
 

1609
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,510
1870s 1880s and ran it 100 times the
Japan of the post-war period is kind of

1610
00:31:59,510 --> 00:31:59,520
Japan of the post-war period is kind of
 

1611
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,789
Japan of the post-war period is kind of
one of the best outcomes right and I

1612
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:01,799
one of the best outcomes right and I
 

1613
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:04,750
one of the best outcomes right and I
think that that you could say that about

1614
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:04,760
think that that you could say that about
 

1615
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,850
think that that you could say that about
Russian Economic Development its ability

1616
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:07,860
Russian Economic Development its ability
 

1617
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,710
Russian Economic Development its ability
to catch up at a certain level to the

1618
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:09,720
to catch up at a certain level to the
 

1619
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,909
to catch up at a certain level to the
West

1620
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:10,919
West
 

1621
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,370
West
and then after that of course um

1622
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:13,380
and then after that of course um
 

1623
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,990
and then after that of course um
later on

1624
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,000
later on
 

1625
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,990
later on
um as economies got more complex as they

1626
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:18,000
um as economies got more complex as they
 

1627
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,750
um as economies got more complex as they
kind of moved Beyond uh regular heavy

1628
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:20,760
kind of moved Beyond uh regular heavy
 

1629
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,909
kind of moved Beyond uh regular heavy

00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:27,480
command system was unable to adapt and
 

1635
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,930
command system was unable to adapt and
cope and ended up falling back behind uh

1636
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:29,940
cope and ended up falling back behind uh
 

1637
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,690

the West Again by the by the 1970s so

1638
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:32,700
the West Again by the by the 1970s so
 

1639
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,789
the West Again by the by the 1970s so
all this is a very long story to say

1640
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
all this is a very long story to say
 

1641
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,130
all this is a very long story to say
that a lot went wrong and Russia the

1642
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:37,140
that a lot went wrong and Russia the
 

1643
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,510
that a lot went wrong and Russia the
economic picture is actually a little

1644
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:38,520
economic picture is actually a little
 

1645
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,389
economic picture is actually a little
bit more complicated politically

1646
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:41,399
bit more complicated politically
 

1647
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,909
bit more complicated politically
um I I think it's just a small party

1648
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
um I I think it's just a small party
 

1649
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,610
um I I think it's just a small party
without much popular support but with

um took power and they felt they
 

1659
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,750
um took power and they felt they
couldn't give back power

1660

couldn't give back power
 

1661
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,169
couldn't give back power

and they kept holding on to power and
 

1663
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,029

justify what he was doing
 

1671
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,590
justify what he was doing
um in the context of the Russian nation

1672
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:12,600
um in the context of the Russian nation
 

1673
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,750
um in the context of the Russian nation
and development but also all the threats

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:14,760
and development but also all the threats
 

1675
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,330
and development but also all the threats
that came from abroad through you know

1676
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:17,340
that came from abroad through you know
 

1677
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,830

the Civil War wasn't just a civil war it

1678
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:18,840
the Civil War wasn't just a civil war it
 

1679
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,169
the Civil War wasn't just a civil war it
was really an invasion by by many um

1680
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:21,179
was really an invasion by by many um
 

1681
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:23,990

Imperial Powers all around the world
 

1683
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,970
Imperial Powers all around the world
um as well so I think a lot of it was

1684
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:25,980
um as well so I think a lot of it was
 

1685
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,310
um as well so I think a lot of it was
conditions and Circumstance

1686
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:28,320
conditions and Circumstance
 

1687
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,490
conditions and Circumstance
um and I guess the the question really

1688
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:31,500
um and I guess the the question really
 

1689
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,669
um and I guess the the question really
is to what role ideology played is there

1690
00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:34,679
is to what role ideology played is there
 

1691
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,049
is to what role ideology played is there
something within the Socialist tradition

1692
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:36,059
something within the Socialist tradition
 

1693
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:37,610
something within the Socialist tradition
that might have lend itself to

1694
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:37,620
that might have lend itself to
 

1695
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,169
that might have lend itself to
authoritarianism and that's that's

1696
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:39,179
authoritarianism and that's that's
 

1697
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,610
authoritarianism and that's that's
something we should you know talk about

1698
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:40,620
something we should you know talk about
 

1699
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,230
something we should you know talk about
and that's really complicated human

1700
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:42,240
and that's really complicated human
 

1701
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,130
and that's really complicated human
question it does seem

1702
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,140
question it does seem
 

1703
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:50,330
question it does seem
that the rhetoric the populism

so good
 

1719
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:13,190
so good
maybe the utopian nature of the idea is

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,200
maybe the utopian nature of the idea is

while not becoming the Soviet Union
 

1885
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:38,870
while not becoming the Soviet Union
while not becoming where

1886
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:38,880
while not becoming where
 

1887
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,710
while not becoming where
um

1888
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:39,720
um
 

1889
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,810
um
basically people are silenced either

1890
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:41,820
basically people are silenced either
 

1891
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:44,270
basically people are silenced either
directly through violence or through the

1892
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:44,280
directly through violence or through the
 

1893
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,069
directly through violence or through the
implied threat of violence and therefore

1894
00:37:46,069 --> 00:37:46,079
implied threat of violence and therefore
 

1895
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:47,030
implied threat of violence and therefore
fear

1896
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
fear
 

1897
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,010

so I think you need to limit the scope

1898
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,020
so I think you need to limit the scope
 

1899
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,530
so I think you need to limit the scope
of where the state is and what the state

1900
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:51,540
of where the state is and what the state
 

1901
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,810
of where the state is and what the state
can do and how the state functions first

1902
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:53,820
can do and how the state functions first
 

1903
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,890
can do and how the state functions first
of all

1904
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:54,900
of all
 

1905
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,270
of all
um now for me a social democracy was

1906
00:37:59,270 --> 00:37:59,280
um now for me a social democracy was
 

1907
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,069
um now for me a social democracy was
like the equivalent of

1908
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:01,079
like the equivalent of
 

1909
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,530
like the equivalent of
um I'll give a football analogy

1910
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:03,540
um I'll give a football analogy
 

1911
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,310
um I'll give a football analogy
um

1912
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
um
 

1913
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,690
um
it was the equivalent of you know

1914
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:05,700
it was the equivalent of you know
 

1915
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,670
it was the equivalent of you know
getting to the Red Zone and then kicking

1916
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
getting to the Red Zone and then kicking
 

1917
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,230
getting to the Red Zone and then kicking
a field goal you know you'll take the

1918
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:09,240
a field goal you know you'll take the
 

1919
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,910
a field goal you know you'll take the
three points but you would have rather

1920
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:10,920
three points but you would have rather
 

1921
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,010
three points but you would have rather
got a touchdown and for me socialism

1922
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:13,020

position the reason why um we should

1958
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:51,900
position the reason why um we should
 

1959
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,630
position the reason why um we should
really move from this analogy but the

1960
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
really move from this analogy but the
 

1961
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,329
really move from this analogy but the
reason why uh I call myself a socialist

1962
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:56,339
reason why uh I call myself a socialist
 

1963

is looking through
 

1965
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,230
is looking through
um history and these examples of social

1966
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
um history and these examples of social
 

1967

capitalists still have the ultimate
 

1977
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:15,410
capitalists still have the ultimate
power which is the ability to withhold

so they could say in the late 1960s and
early 70s

00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:03,420
making it socially owned so that
 

2023
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,630
making it socially owned so that
ordinary workers can control their

and so on
 

2029
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,370
and so on
um now does that mean total State

2030
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:13,380
um now does that mean total State
 

2031
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,050
um now does that mean total State
ownership of everything or a planned

economy I don't think that makes any

2034
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:17,099
economy I don't think that makes any
 

2035
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:18,950
economy I don't think that makes any
sense you know I think that we should

2036
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:18,960
sense you know I think that we should
 

2037
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,890

2039
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,890
live in a society in which markets are
harnessed and regulated and and so on my

2040
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:24,900
harnessed and regulated and and so on my
 

2041
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,510
harnessed and regulated and and so on my
main problem is capitalist ownership in

main problem is capitalist ownership in
 

2043

main problem is capitalist ownership in
part on normative grounds just because I

2044
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:31,980
part on normative grounds just because I
 

2045
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:34,250
part on normative grounds just because I
think that it doesn't make sense that we

2046
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:34,260
think that it doesn't make sense that we
 

2047
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,870
think that it doesn't make sense that we
celebrate democracy and all these other

2048

celebrate democracy and all these other
spheres but we have workplaces that are

00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:38,760
spheres but we have workplaces that are
 

2051
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,589
spheres but we have workplaces that are
just

2052
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:39,599
just
 

2053
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,630

treated like tyrannies
 

2055
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,730
treated like tyrannies
um and in part because I think that

2056
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:43,740
um and in part because I think that
 

2057
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,370
um and in part because I think that
ordinary workers would much prefer a

2058
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:46,380
ordinary workers would much prefer a
 

2059
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,670
ordinary workers would much prefer a
system in which over time they you know

2060
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:49,680
system in which over time they you know
 

2061
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,710
system in which over time they you know
accrued shares in ownership where they

00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,990
accrued shares in ownership where they
got in addition to a base kind of ways

2064
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
got in addition to a base kind of ways
 

2065
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,630
got in addition to a base kind of ways
they got um dividends from their firm

2066
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:56,640
they got um dividends from their firm

being successful
 

2069
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,829
being successful
and that they figured out how to you

2070
00:41:00,829 --> 00:41:00,839
and that they figured out how to you
 

2071
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:02,510
and that they figured out how to you
know large firms they're not going to be

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,810
managements
um once every year or two depending on

2082
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:11,820
um once every year or two depending on
 

2083
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,370
um once every year or two depending on
your operating agreement and so on

2084
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:13,380
your operating agreement and so on
 

2085
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:16,130
your operating agreement and so on
that's kind of my my vision of a

2086
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:16,140
that's kind of my my vision of a
 

2087
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,589
that's kind of my my vision of a
socialist society and this sounds I hope

2088
00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:18,599
socialist society and this sounds I hope
 

2089
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,010
socialist society and this sounds I hope
like agree or disagree like it would not

2090
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:22,020
like agree or disagree like it would not
 

2091
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:24,770
like agree or disagree like it would not
be a crazy leap into year zero right

2092
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:24,780
be a crazy leap into year zero right
 

2093
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,630
be a crazy leap into year zero right
that this could be maybe a way in which

2094
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
that this could be maybe a way in which
 

2095
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,490
that this could be maybe a way in which
we could take a lot of what's existing

2096
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:28,500
we could take a lot of what's existing
 

2097
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,829
we could take a lot of what's existing
in society but then just add this on top

2098
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:30,839
in society but then just add this on top
 

2099
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,670
in society but then just add this on top
but what it would mean is a society

2100
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:33,680
but what it would mean is a society
 

2101
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,370
but what it would mean is a society
without a capitalist class this class

2102
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:37,380
without a capitalist class this class
 

2103
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,010
without a capitalist class this class
hasn't been you know individually these

2104
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,020
hasn't been you know individually these
 

2105
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,250
hasn't been you know individually these
people uh you know haven't been taken to

2106
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:43,260
people uh you know haven't been taken to
 

2107
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,430
people uh you know haven't been taken to
re-education camps or or or whatever

2108
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,440
re-education camps or or or whatever
 

2109
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,310
re-education camps or or or whatever
else but they're just no longer in this

2110
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:49,320
else but they're just no longer in this
 

2111
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,829
else but they're just no longer in this
position and they're now part of the

2112
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:51,839
position and they're now part of the
 

2113
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:53,630
position and they're now part of the
economy in other ways like they'll

2114
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:53,640
economy in other ways like they'll
 

2115
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,370
economy in other ways like they'll
probably be the first set of Highly

2116
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:55,380
probably be the first set of Highly
 

2117
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,530
probably be the first set of Highly
competent uh technocrats and managers

2118
00:41:57,530 --> 00:41:57,540
competent uh technocrats and managers
 

2119
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,329
competent uh technocrats and managers
and and so on they'll probably be very

2120
00:41:59,329 --> 00:41:59,339
and and so on they'll probably be very
 

2121
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,310
and and so on they'll probably be very
well compensated for their for their

00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,320
well compensated for their for their
 

2123

00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:07,310
time and expertise and whatever whatever
else but to me both the Practical end of

2126
00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:07,320
else but to me both the Practical end of
 

2127
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,310
else but to me both the Practical end of
things like uh taking away this ability

2128
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:10,320
things like uh taking away this ability
 

2129
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,950
things like uh taking away this ability
to withhold investment and I'm

2130
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
to withhold investment and I'm
 

2131
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,750
to withhold investment and I'm
increasing our ability to democratically

2132
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:14,760
increasing our ability to democratically
 

2133
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:18,170
increasing our ability to democratically
and shape investment priorities and to

2134
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:18,180
and shape investment priorities and to
 

2135
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,790
and shape investment priorities and to
continue down the road of social

continue down the road of social
 

2137
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,370
continue down the road of social
democracy and on normative grounds by

00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:22,380
democracy and on normative grounds by
 

2139
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,010
democracy and on normative grounds by
kind of egalitarian belief that that

2140
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:25,020
kind of egalitarian belief that that
 

2141
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,109
kind of egalitarian belief that that
Ordinary People should have more stake

2142
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:27,119
Ordinary People should have more stake
 

2143
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:30,829
Ordinary People should have more stake
in their in their lives in the workplace

00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:30,839
in their in their lives in the workplace
 

2145
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,530
in their in their lives in the workplace
um leads me Beyond social democracy to

2146
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:33,540
um leads me Beyond social democracy to
 

2147
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:36,470
um leads me Beyond social democracy to
socialism so there's a tricky thing here

2148
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
socialism so there's a tricky thing here
 

2149
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,950
socialism so there's a tricky thing here
so in in uh Ukraine especially but in

2150
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:39,960
so in in uh Ukraine especially but in
 

2151
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,250
so in in uh Ukraine especially but in
the Soviet Union there's the cool ox

2152
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:43,260
the Soviet Union there's the cool ox
 

2153
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,310
the Soviet Union there's the cool ox
the possible trajectory of fighting for

2154
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:46,320
the possible trajectory of fighting for
 

2155
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,109
the possible trajectory of fighting for
the beautiful message

2156
00:42:48,109 --> 00:42:48,119
the beautiful message
 

2157
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:52,490
the beautiful message
of respecting workers rights

2158
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:52,500

 

2159
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:56,450

has this Dynamic of making an enemy of

has this Dynamic of making an enemy of
 

2161
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,130
has this Dynamic of making an enemy of
the capitalist class

2162
00:42:58,130 --> 00:42:58,140
the capitalist class
 

2163
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,050
the capitalist class
too easily making an enemy of the

2164
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:00,060
too easily making an enemy of the
 

2165
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:03,069
too easily making an enemy of the
capitalist class with a central

2166
00:43:03,069 --> 00:43:03,079
capitalist class with a central
 

2167
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:07,609
capitalist class with a central
leader populist leader that says

2168
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:07,619
leader populist leader that says
 

2169
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:10,190
leader populist leader that says
the rich and the powerful they're taking

2170
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:10,200
the rich and the powerful they're taking
 

2171
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,569
the rich and the powerful they're taking
advantage of you

2172
00:43:11,569 --> 00:43:11,579
advantage of you
 

2173
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:13,490
advantage of you
we need to remove them we need to put

2174
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:13,500
we need to remove them we need to put
 

2175
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:16,309
we need to remove them we need to put
them in camps perhaps uh not said

2176
00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:16,319
them in camps perhaps uh not said
 

2177
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,470
them in camps perhaps uh not said
explicitly until it happens it can

2178
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:18,480
explicitly until it happens it can
 

2179
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,750
explicitly until it happens it can
happen overnight but just putting a

2180
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:20,760
happen overnight but just putting a
 

2181
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,550
happen overnight but just putting a
giant pressure on that capitalist class

2182
00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:22,560
giant pressure on that capitalist class
 

2183
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,910
giant pressure on that capitalist class
and again the Stalin type figure takes

2184
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:25,920
and again the Stalin type figure takes
 

2185
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,970
and again the Stalin type figure takes
hold so I'm trying to understand how the

2186
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:28,980
hold so I'm trying to understand how the
 

2187
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,849
hold so I'm trying to understand how the
mechanism can prevent that

2188
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:31,859
mechanism can prevent that
 

2189
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,030
mechanism can prevent that
and perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias

2190
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:35,040
and perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias
 

2191
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,670
and perhaps I'll sort of reveal my bias
here as I've been reading a

2192
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:37,680
here as I've been reading a
 

2193
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,950
here as I've been reading a
I was going to say too much maybe not

2194
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:39,960
I was going to say too much maybe not
 

2195
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,890
I was going to say too much maybe not
enough but a lot about you know books

2196
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:42,900
enough but a lot about you know books
 

2197
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,510
enough but a lot about you know books
like Stalin's war in Ukraine and just

2198
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:44,520
like Stalin's war in Ukraine and just
 

2199
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,010
like Stalin's war in Ukraine and just
I've been reading a lot about the 30s

2200
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,020
I've been reading a lot about the 30s
 

2201
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,210
I've been reading a lot about the 30s
and the 40s

2202
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:47,220
and the 40s
 

2203
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,550
and the 40s
um for for personal reasons related to

2204
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:49,560
um for for personal reasons related to
 

2205
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,290
um for for personal reasons related to
my travels in Ukraine and all that kind

2206
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:51,300
my travels in Ukraine and all that kind
 

2207
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,309
my travels in Ukraine and all that kind
of stuff so I have a a little bit of a

2208
00:43:55,309 --> 00:43:55,319
of stuff so I have a a little bit of a
 

2209
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,589
of stuff so I have a a little bit of a
focus on the historic implementations of

2210
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
focus on the historic implementations of
 

2211
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:00,050
focus on the historic implementations of
Communism currently without kind of an

2212
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,060
Communism currently without kind of an
 

2213
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,910
Communism currently without kind of an
updated view of all the possible future

2214
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
updated view of all the possible future
 

2215
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,650
updated view of all the possible future
implementations so I just want to lay

2216
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:03,660
implementations so I just want to lay
 

2217
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,829
implementations so I just want to lay
that out there but I worry about the

2218
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:06,839
that out there but I worry about the
 

2219
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,010
that out there but I worry about the
slippery slope into the authoritarian

2220
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:10,020
slippery slope into the authoritarian
 

2221
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,089
slippery slope into the authoritarian
figure that takes this sexy message

2222
00:44:13,089 --> 00:44:13,099
figure that takes this sexy message
 

2223
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:16,250
figure that takes this sexy message
destroys everyone who's powerful in the

2224
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:16,260
destroys everyone who's powerful in the
 

2225
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,950
destroys everyone who's powerful in the
name of the working class and then [\h__\h]

2226
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
name of the working class and then [\h__\h]
 

2227
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,990
name of the working class and then [\h__\h]
the working class afterwards

2228
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:21,000
the working class afterwards
 

2229
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,910
the working class afterwards
so first of all I think it's worth

2230
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:22,920
so first of all I think it's worth
 

2231
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,030
so first of all I think it's worth
remembering that the Socialist movement

2232
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:26,040
remembering that the Socialist movement
 

2233
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,309
remembering that the Socialist movement
had different outcomes across Western

2234
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
had different outcomes across Western
 

2235
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,770
had different outcomes across Western
Europe and and Eastern Europe and in

2236
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:30,780
Europe and and Eastern Europe and in
 

2237
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,150
Europe and and Eastern Europe and in
some of these countries in Western

2238
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
some of these countries in Western
 

2239
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,609
some of these countries in Western
Europe there wasn't actually democracy

2240
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:34,619
Europe there wasn't actually democracy
 

2241
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,589
Europe there wasn't actually democracy
before the workers move in and for the

2242
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:36,599
before the workers move in and for the
 

2243
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,750
before the workers move in and for the
Socialist movement so

2244
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:38,760
Socialist movement so
 

2245
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,930
Socialist movement so
the battle in Sweden for instance was

2246
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:41,940
the battle in Sweden for instance was
 

2247
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,849
the battle in Sweden for instance was
about establishing political democracy

2248
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:43,859
about establishing political democracy
 

2249
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,829
about establishing political democracy
establishing troop representation for

2250
00:44:45,829 --> 00:44:45,839
establishing troop representation for
 

2251
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,150
establishing troop representation for
workers and that's how the parties

2252
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:47,160
workers and that's how the parties
 

2253
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,790
workers and that's how the parties
became popular same thing in Germany too

2254
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:49,800
became popular same thing in Germany too
 

2255
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,609
became popular same thing in Germany too
uh then it was the social Democrats who

2256
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:52,619
uh then it was the social Democrats who
 

2257
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:54,829
uh then it was the social Democrats who
were able to build political democracy

2258
00:44:54,829 --> 00:44:54,839
were able to build political democracy
 

2259
00:44:54,839 --> 00:44:56,750
were able to build political democracy
then on top of that add layers of

2260
00:44:56,750 --> 00:44:56,760
then on top of that add layers of
 

2261
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,250
then on top of that add layers of
economic

2262
00:44:58,250 --> 00:44:58,260
economic
 

2263
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,630
economic
um democracy

2264
00:44:59,630 --> 00:44:59,640
um democracy
 

2265
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,329

um social democracy
the Swedish social Democrats are ruled

2268
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:04,079
the Swedish social Democrats are ruled
 

2269
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,349
the Swedish social Democrats are ruled
basically uninterrupted from the early

2270
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:06,359
basically uninterrupted from the early
 

2271
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,530
basically uninterrupted from the early
1930s until

2272
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:08,540
1930s until
 

2273
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,030
1930s until
1976. it's kind of crazy to think about

2274
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
1976. it's kind of crazy to think about
 

2275
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,410
1976. it's kind of crazy to think about
but they were just in government they

2276
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:12,420
but they were just in government they
 

2277
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,550
but they were just in government they
were the leading member of government

2278
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,560
were the leading member of government
 

2279
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:15,170
were the leading member of government
that a few different Coalition Partners

2280
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:15,180
that a few different Coalition Partners
 

2281
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:17,089
that a few different Coalition Partners
would shift sometimes they were with

2282
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:17,099
would shift sometimes they were with
 

2283
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:18,829
would shift sometimes they were with
their agrarians sometimes they were with

2284
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:18,839
their agrarians sometimes they were with
 

2285
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:22,309
their agrarians sometimes they were with
uh the the Communists briefly but they

2286
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:22,319
uh the the Communists briefly but they
 

2287
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,589
uh the the Communists briefly but they
ruled uninterrupted and they lost an

2288
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:24,599
ruled uninterrupted and they lost an
 

2289
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:26,569
ruled uninterrupted and they lost an
election in 1976 and they just left

2290
00:45:26,569 --> 00:45:26,579
election in 1976 and they just left
 

2291
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,550
election in 1976 and they just left
power and then they got back into power

2292
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:28,560
power and then they got back into power
 

2293
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,650
power and then they got back into power
in the 80s so so in other words like

2294
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:30,660
in the 80s so so in other words like
 

2295
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,109
in the 80s so so in other words like
they created a democratic system of

2296
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
they created a democratic system of
 

2297
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:34,670
they created a democratic system of
course with mass support of Working

2298
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:34,680
course with mass support of Working
 

2299
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,370
course with mass support of Working
Class People then they truly honored the

2300
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:37,380
Class People then they truly honored the
 

2301
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,589
Class People then they truly honored the
system because when they lost power they

2302
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:39,599
system because when they lost power they
 

2303
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,290
system because when they lost power they
lost power they left left power there's

2304
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,300
lost power they left left power there's
 

2305
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:45,170
lost power they left left power there's
plenty of cases like that across

00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,180
plenty of cases like that across
 

2307
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,609
plenty of cases like that across

now Russia I think a lot of what

2320
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
now Russia I think a lot of what
 

2321
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,690
now Russia I think a lot of what
happened had to do with the fact that it

2322
00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:02,700
happened had to do with the fact that it
 

2323
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,910
happened had to do with the fact that it
was never a democratic country it was

2324
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:04,920
was never a democratic country it was
 

2325
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,270
was never a democratic country it was
ruled by a party and the party itself

ruled by a party and the party itself
 

2327
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,490
ruled by a party and the party itself
was very easy to shift from a somewhat

was very easy to shift from a somewhat

Democratic party in London's day to an
 

2331
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,530
Democratic party in London's day to an
authoritarian one in Russia and there

2332
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,540
authoritarian one in Russia and there
 

2333
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,910
authoritarian one in Russia and there
was no distinction then between the

2334
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:16,920
was no distinction then between the
 

2335
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,349
was no distinction then between the
party and the state so your

2336
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:18,359
party and the state so your
 

2337
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:20,450
party and the state so your
authoritarian party then became

2338
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:20,460
authoritarian party then became
 

2339
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,910
authoritarian party then became
authoritarian total control over the

2340
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:22,920
authoritarian total control over the
 

2341
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:27,349
authoritarian total control over the
entirety of the state now the fact that

2342
00:46:27,349 --> 00:46:27,359
entirety of the state now the fact that
 

2343
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,750
entirety of the state now the fact that
the Soviet system involved total State

2344
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
the Soviet system involved total State
 

2345
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,050
the Soviet system involved total State
ownership of production meant that the

00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:33,060
ownership of production meant that the
 

2347
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:35,030
ownership of production meant that the

authoritarianism of the party State
 

2349
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,430
authoritarianism of the party State
could go even deeper into the lives of

2350
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:37,440
could go even deeper into the lives of
 

2351
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,410
could go even deeper into the lives of
ordinary people compared to other

ordinary people compared to other
 

2353
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,329
ordinary people compared to other
horrific

2354
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:41,339
horrific
 

2355
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:43,190
horrific
um dictatorships like pinochets Chile

2356
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
um dictatorships like pinochets Chile
 

2357
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,010
um dictatorships like pinochets Chile
and so on when maybe you could find some

2358
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,020
and so on when maybe you could find some
 

2359
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,349
and so on when maybe you could find some
Solace like just at home or whatever

2360
00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:48,359
Solace like just at home or whatever
 

2361
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:49,790
Solace like just at home or whatever
else you didn't have the same sort of

00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:49,800
else you didn't have the same sort of
 

2363
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,890
else you didn't have the same sort of
totalitarian you know

2364
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:51,900
totalitarian you know
 

2365
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,270
totalitarian you know
um uh like control of people's lives

2366

um uh like control of people's lives
 

2367
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,609
um uh like control of people's lives
um but I would say that that that

2368
00:46:58,609 --> 00:46:58,619
um but I would say that that that
 

2369
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,050
um but I would say that that that
socialism self has yield different

2370
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:00,060
socialism self has yield different
 

2371
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,190
socialism self has yield different
outcomes now in the question of

2372
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:01,200
outcomes now in the question of
 

2373
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,630
outcomes now in the question of
polarization

2374
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
polarization
 

2375
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,970
polarization
I guess that implies that this

2376
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:04,980
I guess that implies that this
 

2377
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,750
I guess that implies that this
polarization this distinction

2378
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:07,760
polarization this distinction
 

2379
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,030
polarization this distinction
is a distinction that isn't real in

system based on class division whether
 

2407
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,370
system based on class division whether
you're supported or oppose it I think

2408
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:43,380
you're supported or oppose it I think
 

2409
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,510
you're supported or oppose it I think
you should we should acknowledge it's

you should we should acknowledge it's
 

2411

based on class division
 

2413
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:48,349
based on class division
that is the thing creating that

00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:48,359
that is the thing creating that
 

2415
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:51,290
that is the thing creating that
polarization now I think what a lot of

2416
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:51,300
polarization now I think what a lot of
 

2417
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,589
polarization now I think what a lot of
what socialists try to do is we try to

2418
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:54,599
what socialists try to do is we try to
 

2419
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,250
what socialists try to do is we try to
take bits of working class opposition to

2420
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:58,260
take bits of working class opposition to
 

2421
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,069
take bits of working class opposition to
capitalism to their lives to the way

00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:03,470
capitalism to their lives to the way
they're treated at work and so on and

2424
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:03,480
they're treated at work and so on and
 

2425
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,410
they're treated at work and so on and
yes we do try to organize on those bases

2426
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:06,420
yes we do try to organize on those bases
 

2427
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,290
yes we do try to organize on those bases
to help workers take Collective action

2428
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:09,300
to help workers take Collective action
 

2429
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:12,730
to help workers take Collective action
to help them organize and political

2430
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:12,740
to help them organize and political
 

2431
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:15,950
to help them organize and political
parties and someone to represent their

2432
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:15,960
parties and someone to represent their
 

2433
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,829
parties and someone to represent their
their interest economic and otherwise

2434
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:18,839
their interest economic and otherwise
 

2435
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:21,050
their interest economic and otherwise
but the contradiction

2436
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,060
but the contradiction
 

2437
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:24,050
but the contradiction
exist to begin with and if anything this

2438
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,060
exist to begin with and if anything this
 

2439
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,849
exist to begin with and if anything this
system which I'm proposing Democratic

2440
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:25,859
system which I'm proposing Democratic
 

2441
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,609
system which I'm proposing Democratic
socialism would be kind of a resolution

2442
00:48:28,609 --> 00:48:28,619
socialism would be kind of a resolution
 

2443
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:31,130
socialism would be kind of a resolution
of this this this conflict this dilemma

2444
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:31,140
of this this this conflict this dilemma
 

2445
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,930
of this this this conflict this dilemma
this thing that has always existed since

2446
00:48:32,930 --> 00:48:32,940
this thing that has always existed since
 

2447
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,089
this thing that has always existed since
you know Chieftain and follower and and

2448
00:48:35,089 --> 00:48:35,099
you know Chieftain and follower and and
 

2449
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:37,010
you know Chieftain and follower and and
so on we've had class division since the

2450
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:37,020
so on we've had class division since the
 

2451
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,809
so on we've had class division since the
Neolithic Revolution you know I think

2452
00:48:38,809 --> 00:48:38,819
Neolithic Revolution you know I think
 

2453
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:41,450
Neolithic Revolution you know I think
this is a democratic Road out of that

2454
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:41,460
this is a democratic Road out of that
 

2455
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,370
this is a democratic Road out of that
that tension and that division of

2456
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,380
that tension and that division of
 

2457
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,650
that tension and that division of
humanity into people who own and people

2458
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:45,660
humanity into people who own and people
 

2459
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,510
humanity into people who own and people
have nothing to give but their ability

2460
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:47,520
have nothing to give but their ability
 

2461
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,730
have nothing to give but their ability
to work so that sort of that idea is

2462
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:49,740
to work so that sort of that idea is
 

2463
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,890
to work so that sort of that idea is
grounded in uh is all going all the way

2464
00:48:51,890 --> 00:48:51,900
grounded in uh is all going all the way
 

2465
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,990
grounded in uh is all going all the way
back to Marx that all of human history

2466
00:48:53,990 --> 00:48:54,000
back to Marx that all of human history
 

2467
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,210
back to Marx that all of human history
can be told through the lens of class

2468
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:56,220
can be told through the lens of class
 

2469
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:59,210
can be told through the lens of class
struggle is there some sense can you

00:48:59,210 --> 00:48:59,220
struggle is there some sense can you
 

2471
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,069
struggle is there some sense can you
still man the case that this class

2472
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:01,079
still man the case that this class
 

2473
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,190
still man the case that this class
difference is over exaggerated

2474
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:04,200
difference is over exaggerated
 

2475
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,510
difference is over exaggerated
that

2476
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:05,520
that
 

2477
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,550
that
there's a difference

2478
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:07,560
there's a difference
 

2479
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,490
there's a difference
but it's not the difference of the

2480
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:10,500
but it's not the difference of the
 

2481
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,530
but it's not the difference of the
abuser and the abused

2482
00:49:12,530 --> 00:49:12,540
abuser and the abused
 

2483
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,410
abuser and the abused
it's more of a difference of

2484
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:15,420
it's more of a difference of
 

2485
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,829
it's more of a difference of
uh people that were successful and

2486
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:18,839
uh people that were successful and
 

2487
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:20,990
uh people that were successful and
people that were less successful so I'll

2488
00:49:20,990 --> 00:49:21,000
people that were less successful so I'll
 

2489
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,510
people that were less successful so I'll
play Devil's Advocate which is a that

2490
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:23,520
play Devil's Advocate which is a that
 

2491
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,770
play Devil's Advocate which is a that
maybe

2492
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:24,780
maybe
 

2493
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:26,870
maybe
one could argue that it's purest

00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
one could argue that it's purest

things have happened one a bunch of

00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:35,940
things have happened one a bunch of
 

2503
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:38,870
things have happened one a bunch of
socialists and workers have organized to

2504
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
socialists and workers have organized to
 

2505
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,730
socialists and workers have organized to
guarantee certain rights for Working

2506
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:40,740
guarantee certain rights for Working
 

2507
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,670
guarantee certain rights for Working
Class People certain protections so then

2508
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
Class People certain protections so then
 

2509
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,370
Class People certain protections so then
our system now there are certain safety

2510
00:49:46,370 --> 00:49:46,380
our system now there are certain safety

safety regulations all that kind of
 

2521
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:00,530
safety regulations all that kind of
stuff yeah and all those things are

00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:00,540
stuff yeah and all those things are

in my mind doses of socialism within

00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:05,210
in my mind doses of socialism within
capitalism because what you're doing is

2526
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:05,220
capitalism because what you're doing is
 

2527
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,790
capitalism because what you're doing is
you are taking the autonomy of

00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:07,800
you are taking the autonomy of
 

2529
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,170
you are taking the autonomy of
capitalists to do whatever they want

2530
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:09,180
capitalists to do whatever they want
 

2531
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,809
capitalists to do whatever they want
with the people contracted to them

2532
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:11,819
with the people contracted to them
 

2533
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:13,970
with the people contracted to them
and the only thing stopping them is you

2534
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:13,980
and the only thing stopping them is you
 

2535
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,010
and the only thing stopping them is you
know them potentially being able to go

2536
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:16,020
know them potentially being able to go
 

2537
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:18,050
know them potentially being able to go
to another employer but even then it's

2538
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:18,060
to another employer but even then it's
 

2539
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:19,910
to another employer but even then it's
kind of a potentially a race to the

2540
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
kind of a potentially a race to the
 

2541
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,130
kind of a potentially a race to the
bottom if you know you you can't get

2542
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:22,140
bottom if you know you you can't get
 

2543
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,470
bottom if you know you you can't get
more than uh two dollars an hour from

00:50:24,470 --> 00:50:24,480
more than uh two dollars an hour from
 

2545
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,930
more than uh two dollars an hour from
any employer in your in your Market

2546
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:26,940
any employer in your in your Market
 

2547
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,910
any employer in your in your Market
you're gonna have to you know live with

you're gonna have to you know live with
 

2549
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,849
you're gonna have to you know live with
it so one factor is we have built in

2550
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:31,859
it so one factor is we have built in
 

2551
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:35,809
it so one factor is we have built in
those Productions so we've taken enough

2552
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:35,819
those Productions so we've taken enough
 

2553
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:38,990
those Productions so we've taken enough
socialism into capitalism that you could

2554
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:39,000
socialism into capitalism that you could
 

2555
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,030
socialism into capitalism that you could
say that at a certain point maybe it

2556
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
say that at a certain point maybe it
 

2557
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,770
say that at a certain point maybe it
makes a qualitative difference and not

2558
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:42,780
makes a qualitative difference and not
 

2559
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,089
makes a qualitative difference and not
just a quantitative difference in

2560
00:50:44,089 --> 00:50:44,099
just a quantitative difference in
 

2561
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:46,609
just a quantitative difference in
people's lives the other thing is over

2562
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:46,619
people's lives the other thing is over
 

2563
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,950
people's lives the other thing is over
time we've gotten wealthier and more

2564
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:48,960
time we've gotten wealthier and more
 

2565
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,950
time we've gotten wealthier and more
productive as a society

2566
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:51,960
productive as a society
 

2567
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,710
productive as a society
so maybe at some point the quantitative

2568
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
so maybe at some point the quantitative
 

2569
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,930
so maybe at some point the quantitative
difference of just more and more wealth

2570
00:50:56,930 --> 00:50:56,940
difference of just more and more wealth
 

2571
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:00,290
difference of just more and more wealth
means that even if in the abstract the

2572
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:00,300
means that even if in the abstract the
 

2573
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,329
means that even if in the abstract the
division between a worker and a

2574
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:02,339
division between a worker and a
 

2575
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:04,490
division between a worker and a
capitalist is real if that worker is

2576
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:04,500
capitalist is real if that worker is
 

2577
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,870
capitalist is real if that worker is
earning you know a quarter million

2578
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:05,880
earning you know a quarter million
 

2579
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:08,089
earning you know a quarter million
dollars a year and has a good life and

2580
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:08,099
dollars a year and has a good life and
 

2581
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:10,490
dollars a year and has a good life and
only has to clock in 35 hours a week 30

2582
00:51:10,490 --> 00:51:10,500
only has to clock in 35 hours a week 30
 

2583
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,630
only has to clock in 35 hours a week 30
hours a week

2584
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:11,640
hours a week
 

2585
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,270
hours a week
and has you know four weeks of vacation

2586
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:14,280
and has you know four weeks of vacation
 

2587
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,150
and has you know four weeks of vacation
then like isn't it just like an abstract

2588
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:17,160
then like isn't it just like an abstract
 

2589
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,250
then like isn't it just like an abstract

00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
um difference so I think you could level
 

2593
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,670
um difference so I think you could level
those two arguments what I would say is

2594
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:22,680
those two arguments what I would say is
 

2595
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,490
those two arguments what I would say is
that one

2596
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:25,500
that one
 

2597
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,329
that one
um

2598
00:51:26,329 --> 00:51:26,339
um
 

2599
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:28,130
um
a lot of these rights that we have

2600
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:28,140
a lot of these rights that we have
 

2601
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,410
a lot of these rights that we have
fought for are constantly being eroded

2602
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:30,420
fought for are constantly being eroded
 

2603
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,450

and they're under attacked in part

2604
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:32,460
and they're under attacked in part
 

2605
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,130
and they're under attacked in part
because the economic power the

2606
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:34,140
because the economic power the
 

2607
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:36,230
because the economic power the
capitalists have bleeds into our

constant lobbying for all sorts of labor
 

2613
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:45,290
constant lobbying for all sorts of labor
market deregulations and and so on

market deregulations and and so on
 

2615
00:51:45,300 --> 00:51:47,750
market deregulations and and so on
um I fundamentally believe

2616
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
um I fundamentally believe
 

2617
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,829
um I fundamentally believe
that

2618
00:51:48,829 --> 00:51:48,839
that
 

2619
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,290
that
if tomorrow all those regulations went

00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:51,300
if tomorrow all those regulations went
 

2621
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:54,349
if tomorrow all those regulations went
away capitalists would fight to pay

2622
00:51:54,349 --> 00:51:54,359
away capitalists would fight to pay
 

2623
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,089
away capitalists would fight to pay
people as little as possible and we'll

2624
00:51:56,089 --> 00:51:56,099
people as little as possible and we'll
 

2625
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:59,089
people as little as possible and we'll
be back in 19th century capitalism and

2626
00:51:59,089 --> 00:51:59,099
be back in 19th century capitalism and
 

2627
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,069
be back in 19th century capitalism and
not because they're bad people because

00:52:01,069 --> 00:52:01,079
not because they're bad people because

not because they're bad people because
if I'm running a firm and all of a

2630
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:04,140
if I'm running a firm and all of a
 

2631
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:06,470
if I'm running a firm and all of a
sudden my competition is paying is is

2632
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
sudden my competition is paying is is
 

2633
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,750
sudden my competition is paying is is
able to find a labor pool and is paying

2634
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:08,760
able to find a labor pool and is paying
 

2635
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,089
able to find a labor pool and is paying
people less than me I'm going to be

2636
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:11,099
people less than me I'm going to be
 

2637
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,349
people less than me I'm going to be
undercut because they'll be able to take

2638
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:12,359
undercut because they'll be able to take
 

2639
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:14,690
undercut because they'll be able to take
some of that extra savings and invest

2640
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:14,700
some of that extra savings and invest
 

2641
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,089
some of that extra savings and invest
into new technology or whatever else and

2642
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:17,099
into new technology or whatever else and
 

2643
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:19,010
into new technology or whatever else and
they'll gobble up my market share before

2644
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,020
they'll gobble up my market share before
 

2645
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,390
they'll gobble up my market share before
long

2646
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:20,400
long
 

2647
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,670
long
um and then also beyond that I do think

2648
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:22,680
um and then also beyond that I do think
 

2649
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,309
um and then also beyond that I do think
there's a normative question here which

2650
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:25,319
there's a normative question here which
 

2651
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:26,210
there's a normative question here which
is

2652
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:26,220
is
 

2653
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:30,049
is
now do we believe that ordinary people

2654
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:30,059
now do we believe that ordinary people
 

2655
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:32,109
now do we believe that ordinary people
have a capacity

2656
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:32,119
have a capacity
 

2657
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:34,849
have a capacity
to be able to make certain decisions

2658
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:34,859
to be able to make certain decisions
 

2659
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,410
to be able to make certain decisions
about their work do we believe they know

2660
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:36,420
about their work do we believe they know
 

2661
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,470
about their work do we believe they know
more about their work than their bosses

2662
00:52:39,470 --> 00:52:39,480
more about their work than their bosses
 

2663
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,390
more about their work than their bosses
um now I don't think that's not true at

2664
00:52:41,390 --> 00:52:41,400
um now I don't think that's not true at
 

2665
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,609
um now I don't think that's not true at
every level but I think there's no doubt

2666
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:43,619
every level but I think there's no doubt
 

2667
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:46,809
every level but I think there's no doubt
that in workplaces workers know how to

2668
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:46,819
that in workplaces workers know how to
 

2669
00:52:46,819 --> 00:52:49,849
that in workplaces workers know how to
productively do their tasks in ways that

2670
00:52:49,849 --> 00:52:49,859
productively do their tasks in ways that
 

2671
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:51,410
productively do their tasks in ways that
their manager might not know I think

2672
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:51,420
their manager might not know I think
 

2673
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:53,030
their manager might not know I think
we've all been in workplaces where we've

2674
00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:53,040
we've all been in workplaces where we've
 

2675
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,490
we've all been in workplaces where we've
had managers who kind of don't know what

2676
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:55,500
had managers who kind of don't know what
 

2677
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:58,670
had managers who kind of don't know what
you do or what what whatever else

2678
00:52:58,670 --> 00:52:58,680
you do or what what whatever else
 

2679
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,770
you do or what what whatever else
um and I think that collectively if

2680
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:00,780
um and I think that collectively if
 

2681
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,670
um and I think that collectively if
incentivized we could uh have them one

2682
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:04,680
incentivized we could uh have them one
 

2683
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,270
incentivized we could uh have them one
instead of hoarding or that information

2684
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:08,280
instead of hoarding or that information
 

2685
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:09,829
instead of hoarding or that information
um since they're getting a stake in in

2686
00:53:09,829 --> 00:53:09,839
um since they're getting a stake in in
 

2687
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,410
um since they're getting a stake in in
production and and so on they'd be able

2688
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:12,420
production and and so on they'd be able
 

2689
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,329
production and and so on they'd be able
to more freely share it and be able to

2690
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:14,339
to more freely share it and be able to
 

2691
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:16,309
to more freely share it and be able to
reshape how their day-to-day work

2692
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
reshape how their day-to-day work
 

2693
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,990
reshape how their day-to-day work
happens

2694
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
happens
 

2695
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,329
happens
and also with with elect demanders you

2696
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:20,339
and also with with elect demanders you
 

2697
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:21,950
and also with with elect demanders you
kind of take it up the the chain I think

2698
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:21,960
kind of take it up the the chain I think
 

2699
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,130
kind of take it up the the chain I think
you would have perfectly efficient uh

2700
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:25,140
you would have perfectly efficient uh
 

2701
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,130
you would have perfectly efficient uh
market-based firms

2702
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:28,140
market-based firms
 

2703
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,230
market-based firms
um that that could exist without

2704
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:30,240
um that that could exist without
 

2705
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,510
um that that could exist without
capitalists so there's a I mean there's

2706
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:32,520
capitalists so there's a I mean there's
 

2707
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,930
capitalists so there's a I mean there's
a lot of uh things to say

2708
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:35,940
a lot of uh things to say
 

2709
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:38,690
a lot of uh things to say
maybe within just very very low level

2710
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:38,700
maybe within just very very low level
 

2711
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,089
maybe within just very very low level
question of if the workers are running

2712
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:41,099
question of if the workers are running
 

2713
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:43,370
question of if the workers are running
the show

2714
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:43,380
the show

the show
there's a brutal truth to the fact that

2716
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:46,319
there's a brutal truth to the fact that
 

2717
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,109
there's a brutal truth to the fact that
some people are better and the workers

2718
00:53:48,109 --> 00:53:48,119
some people are better and the workers
 

2719
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,130
some people are better and the workers
know this

2720
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:49,140
know this
 

2721
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:51,410
know this
that's the Steve Jobs a players you want

2722
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:51,420
that's the Steve Jobs a players you want
 

2723
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,790
that's the Steve Jobs a players you want
to have all the a players in the room

2724
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800
to have all the a players in the room
 

2725
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,790
to have all the a players in the room
because one B player can poison the pool

2726
00:53:55,790 --> 00:53:55,800
because one B player can poison the pool
 

2727
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,950
because one B player can poison the pool
because then everybody gets demotivated

2728
00:53:57,950 --> 00:53:57,960
because then everybody gets demotivated
 

2729
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:01,150
because then everybody gets demotivated
by like uh

2730
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:01,160
by like uh
 

2731
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,569

00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:05,579
by the nature of that
 

2733
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:09,230
by the nature of that
lack of excellence and competence this

2734
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
lack of excellence and competence this
 

2735
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:12,230
lack of excellence and competence this
is just to take sort of a crude Devil's

2736
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:12,240
is just to take sort of a crude Devil's

are the workers going to be able to
remove the incompetent from the pool

involves the market you need two things
 

2753
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,230
involves the market you need two things
one is the micro level you need the

2754
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:33,240
one is the micro level you need the
 

2755
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,950
one is the micro level you need the
ability to uh fire people and for them

2756
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:36,960
ability to uh fire people and for them
 

2757
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,890
ability to uh fire people and for them
to exit firms which might be a slower

00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:43,260
process in a Cooperative based firms
 

2761
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,990
process in a Cooperative based firms
than it is in a capitalist firm without

than it is in a capitalist firm without
 

2763
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,030
than it is in a capitalist firm without
a union but if you're probably akin to

2764
00:54:47,030 --> 00:54:47,040
a union but if you're probably akin to
 

2765
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,470
a union but if you're probably akin to
the process that would happen in a

00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:48,480
the process that would happen in a
 

2767
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:50,030
the process that would happen in a

um

2772
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:52,140
um
 

2773
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:53,870
um
so you need that and then at the macro

2774
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:53,880
so you need that and then at the macro
 

2775
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:57,170
so you need that and then at the macro
level you need firm failure you need to

2776
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:57,180
level you need firm failure you need to
 

2777
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,049
level you need firm failure you need to
avoid a dilemma that happened in Soviet

2778
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
avoid a dilemma that happened in Soviet
 

2779
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,990
avoid a dilemma that happened in Soviet
style economies which was soft budget

2780
00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:03,000
style economies which was soft budget
 

2781

you know constraints and

2782
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:05,880
you know constraints and
 

2783
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,970
you know constraints and
um firms basically not being allowed to

2784
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:07,980
um firms basically not being allowed to
 

2785
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,010
um firms basically not being allowed to
fail because the government was

2786
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:10,020
fail because the government was
 

2787
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:11,750
fail because the government was
committed to Full Employment the firms

2788
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:11,760
committed to Full Employment the firms
 

2789
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,549
committed to Full Employment the firms
employed people so even inefficient

2790
00:55:13,549 --> 00:55:13,559
employed people so even inefficient
 

2791
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:15,170
employed people so even inefficient
firms were at the end of the day they

2792
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:15,180
firms were at the end of the day they
 

2793
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:17,270
firms were at the end of the day they
knew they were going to be propped up by

2794
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
knew they were going to be propped up by
 

2795
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,890
knew they were going to be propped up by
the government and they would be given

2796
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:18,900
the government and they would be given
 

2797
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,329
the government and they would be given
all the resources they would need no

2798
00:55:20,329 --> 00:55:20,339
all the resources they would need no
 

2799
00:55:20,339 --> 00:55:22,130
all the resources they would need no
matter how efficient inefficiently they

2800
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:22,140
matter how efficient inefficiently they
 

2801
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:24,049
matter how efficient inefficiently they
were using those resources to maintain

2802
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:24,059
were using those resources to maintain
 

2803
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:26,329
were using those resources to maintain
employment so I think you need you need

2804
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:26,339
employment so I think you need you need
 

2805
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:29,450
employment so I think you need you need
both do you worry about this idea of

2806
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:29,460
both do you worry about this idea of
 

2807
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,250
both do you worry about this idea of
firing people

2808
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,260
firing people
 

2809
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,650
firing people
man I'm uncomfortable with the idea I

2810
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:33,660
man I'm uncomfortable with the idea I
 

2811
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:35,930
man I'm uncomfortable with the idea I
hate it but I also know it's extremely

2812
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:35,940
hate it but I also know it's extremely
 

2813
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,910
hate it but I also know it's extremely
necessary

2814
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
necessary
 

2815
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,130
necessary
so is there something about a collective

2816
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:40,140
so is there something about a collective
 

2817
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,370
so is there something about a collective
a socialist system that makes firing you

2818
00:55:43,370 --> 00:55:43,380
a socialist system that makes firing you
 

2819
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,910
a socialist system that makes firing you
said it might be slower might it become

2820
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:45,920
said it might be slower might it become
 

2821
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,030
said it might be slower might it become
extremely slow too much friction isn't

2822
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:50,040
extremely slow too much friction isn't
 

2823
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:52,010
extremely slow too much friction isn't
there a tension between respecting the

2824
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:52,020
there a tension between respecting the
 

2825
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,430
there a tension between respecting the
rights of a human being and saying like

2826
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:55,440
rights of a human being and saying like
 

2827
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,010
rights of a human being and saying like
you need to step up uh maybe sort of

2828
00:55:58,010 --> 00:55:58,020
you need to step up uh maybe sort of
 

2829
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,049
you need to step up uh maybe sort of
deposit the carrot like you really like

2830
00:56:00,049 --> 00:56:00,059
deposit the carrot like you really like
 

2831

00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:02,819
to really encourage fellow workers know
 

2833
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:05,390
to really encourage fellow workers know
when they're there's a person that's not

they
but isn't the person that's not doing a

but isn't the person that's not doing a

firing in their self-interest

firing in their self-interest
 

2849
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:20,809
firing in their self-interest
well I think there would be certain so

2850
00:56:20,809 --> 00:56:20,819
well I think there would be certain so
 

2851
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:22,849
well I think there would be certain so
maybe another way to to put it is think

2852
00:56:22,849 --> 00:56:22,859
maybe another way to to put it is think
 

2853
00:56:22,859 --> 00:56:24,230
maybe another way to to put it is think
about like if you're a partner at a law

2854
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
about like if you're a partner at a law
 

2855
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,370
about like if you're a partner at a law
firm right

2856
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:25,380
firm right
 

2857
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,750
firm right
um I don't really know how law firms

2858
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:26,760
um I don't really know how law firms
 

2859
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,069
um I don't really know how law firms
work so I probably shouldn't use this

2860
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
work so I probably shouldn't use this
 

2861
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:30,530
work so I probably shouldn't use this
analogy but but correct me if I'm wrong

2862
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:30,540
analogy but but correct me if I'm wrong
 

2863
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,329
analogy but but correct me if I'm wrong
but let's say your partner you kind of

2864
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:32,339
but let's say your partner you kind of
 

2865
00:56:32,339 --> 00:56:33,890
but let's say your partner you kind of
have equity in your Law Firm or

2866
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:33,900
have equity in your Law Firm or

00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:39,240
let's say you're um going to be fired
 

2871

00:56:40,619 --> 00:56:42,650
from your Law Firm or they're laying off
people or whatever else they'll they

2874
00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:42,660
people or whatever else they'll they
 

2875
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,270
people or whatever else they'll they
could just get rid of you but they would

2876
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:44,280
could just get rid of you but they would
 

2877
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,770
could just get rid of you but they would
also have to figure out how to kind of

2878
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:45,780
also have to figure out how to kind of
 

2879
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,010
also have to figure out how to kind of
buy you out too after a certain point so

2880
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:49,020
buy you out too after a certain point so
 

2881
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:52,130
buy you out too after a certain point so
I think that like in a in a Cooperative

2882
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:52,140
I think that like in a in a Cooperative
 

2883
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:54,950
I think that like in a in a Cooperative
firm you'd probably have a system where

2884
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:54,960
firm you'd probably have a system where
 

2885
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,890
firm you'd probably have a system where
you after a certain point of working

2886
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:57,900
you after a certain point of working
 

2887
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,750
you after a certain point of working
productively you probably have a period

2888
00:56:59,750 --> 00:56:59,760
productively you probably have a period
 

2889
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,270
productively you probably have a period
where you get fired really quickly uh no

2890
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:02,280
where you get fired really quickly uh no
 

2891
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,530
where you get fired really quickly uh no
matter what but once you do a job

2892
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:03,540
matter what but once you do a job
 

2893
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:07,910
matter what but once you do a job
security kicks in you would be able to

2894
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:07,920
security kicks in you would be able to
 

2895
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:10,190
security kicks in you would be able to
um you know it would be a process it

2896
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:10,200
um you know it would be a process it
 

2897
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,010
um you know it would be a process it
would probably be like you know a day or

2898
00:57:13,010 --> 00:57:13,020
would probably be like you know a day or
 

2899
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,690
would probably be like you know a day or
two process to figure it out or maybe

2900
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:14,700
two process to figure it out or maybe
 

2901
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,010
two process to figure it out or maybe
they would have a progressive discipline

2902
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:16,020
they would have a progressive discipline
 

2903
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:18,710
they would have a progressive discipline
process which is first you have to get

2904
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
process which is first you have to get
 

2905
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,609
process which is first you have to get
at a verbal feedback and then maybe a

2906
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:22,619
at a verbal feedback and then maybe a
 

2907
00:57:22,619 --> 00:57:24,170
at a verbal feedback and then maybe a
written performance review then you

2908
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:24,180
written performance review then you
 

2909
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,490
written performance review then you
could be fired I mean that's how it

2910
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:25,500
could be fired I mean that's how it
 

2911
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:27,170
could be fired I mean that's how it
works in a lot of workplaces with either

2912
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:27,180
works in a lot of workplaces with either
 

2913
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:30,829
works in a lot of workplaces with either
unions or with just basic job security

2914
00:57:30,829 --> 00:57:30,839
unions or with just basic job security
 

2915
00:57:30,839 --> 00:57:32,510
unions or with just basic job security
um in most countries that's how it works

2916
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:32,520
um in most countries that's how it works
 

2917
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,890
um in most countries that's how it works
because there's not at will employment

2918
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:33,900
because there's not at will employment
 

2919
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:36,589
because there's not at will employment
in most countries so I think that that

2920
00:57:36,589 --> 00:57:36,599
in most countries so I think that that
 

2921
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:39,950
in most countries so I think that that
the real tension is

2922
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:39,960
the real tension is
 

2923
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,530
the real tension is
if you fire someone if you're condemning

2924
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:42,540
if you fire someone if you're condemning
 

2925
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,290
if you fire someone if you're condemning
them to destitution then morally you you

2926
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:45,300
them to destitution then morally you you
 

2927
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,910
them to destitution then morally you you
really feel something there as you

2928
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:46,920
really feel something there as you
 

2929
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:48,710
really feel something there as you
should as a human being concerned about

2930
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:48,720
should as a human being concerned about
 

2931
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,349
should as a human being concerned about
other other people but in a social

2932
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
other other people but in a social
 

2933
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,930
other other people but in a social
system or even basic Social Democratic

2934
00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:53,940
system or even basic Social Democratic
 

2935
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,210
system or even basic Social Democratic
system there would be mechanisms to take

2936
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:56,220
system there would be mechanisms to take
 

2937
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,150
system there would be mechanisms to take
care of that person so one if a firm is

2938
00:57:59,150 --> 00:57:59,160
care of that person so one if a firm is
 

2939
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:00,829
care of that person so one if a firm is
failing for any reason they're getting

2940
00:58:00,829 --> 00:58:00,839
failing for any reason they're getting
 

2941
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:03,370
failing for any reason they're getting
out compete or whatever whatever else

2942
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:03,380
out compete or whatever whatever else
 

2943
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,790
out compete or whatever whatever else
those workers would then land in the

2944
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:07,800
those workers would then land in the
 

2945
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,470
those workers would then land in the
hands just for a little bit of the state

2946
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:09,480
hands just for a little bit of the state
 

2947
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,290
hands just for a little bit of the state
right and there could be active labor

2948
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:12,300
right and there could be active labor
 

2949
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:14,089
right and there could be active labor
market policies to retrain people to go

2950
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:14,099
market policies to retrain people to go
 

2951
00:58:14,099 --> 00:58:16,010
market policies to retrain people to go
into expanding sectors or your sector is

2952
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:16,020
into expanding sectors or your sector is
 

2953
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,809
into expanding sectors or your sector is
now obsolete but here you have these

2954
00:58:17,809 --> 00:58:17,819
now obsolete but here you have these
 

2955
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,270
now obsolete but here you have these
skills you're going to be trained and

2956
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,280
skills you're going to be trained and
 

2957
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,069
skills you're going to be trained and
and here are some resources to kind of

2958
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
and here are some resources to kind of
 

2959
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,329
and here are some resources to kind of
help you along your training and then

2960
00:58:23,329 --> 00:58:23,339
help you along your training and then
 

2961
00:58:23,339 --> 00:58:25,549
help you along your training and then
there's a bunch of firms hiring so go on

2962
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:25,559
there's a bunch of firms hiring so go on
 

2963
00:58:25,559 --> 00:58:27,290
there's a bunch of firms hiring so go on
your way and then also just with an

2964
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:27,300
your way and then also just with an
 

2965
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,510
your way and then also just with an
expanded welfare state being destitute

2966
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
expanded welfare state being destitute
 

2967
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,670
expanded welfare state being destitute
in certain countries being unemployed in

2968
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
in certain countries being unemployed in
 

2969
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,089
in certain countries being unemployed in
certain countries is easier than in

2970
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:35,099
certain countries is easier than in
 

2971
00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:38,210
certain countries is easier than in
other countries or situations so you

2972
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,220
other countries or situations so you
 

2973
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,390
other countries or situations so you
know you still can fall back on on that

2974
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:41,400
know you still can fall back on on that
 

2975
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,289
know you still can fall back on on that
mechanism and also in my vision of of

2976
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:45,299
mechanism and also in my vision of of
 

2977
00:58:45,299 --> 00:58:47,569
mechanism and also in my vision of of
um of Market socialism a democratic

2978
00:58:47,569 --> 00:58:47,579
um of Market socialism a democratic
 

2979
00:58:47,579 --> 00:58:49,849
um of Market socialism a democratic
socialism uh there would be an expanded

2980
00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:49,859
socialism uh there would be an expanded
 

2981
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,049
socialism uh there would be an expanded
State sector

2982
00:58:51,049 --> 00:58:51,059
State sector
 

2983
00:58:51,059 --> 00:58:53,569
State sector
um not not anything you can imagine but

2984
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:53,579
um not not anything you can imagine but
 

2985
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:55,069
um not not anything you can imagine but
the way in which there's more of a state

2986
00:58:55,069 --> 00:58:55,079
the way in which there's more of a state
 

2987
00:58:55,079 --> 00:58:56,930
the way in which there's more of a state
sector in countries like Norway or

2988
00:58:56,930 --> 00:58:56,940
sector in countries like Norway or
 

2989
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,270
sector in countries like Norway or
Denmark than there is in the US so there

2990
00:58:59,270 --> 00:58:59,280
Denmark than there is in the US so there
 

2991
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,910
Denmark than there is in the US so there
would be you know various forms of state

2992
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:01,920
would be you know various forms of state
 

2993
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,849
would be you know various forms of state
employment and whatever whatever else

2994
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:04,859
employment and whatever whatever else
 

2995
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:07,250
employment and whatever whatever else
um so I mean I think that the real

2996
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:07,260
um so I mean I think that the real
 

2997
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,589
um so I mean I think that the real
question is should being bad at your job

2998
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:09,599
question is should being bad at your job
 

2999
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,589
question is should being bad at your job
or getting fired for any reason or

3000
00:59:12,589 --> 00:59:12,599
or getting fired for any reason or
 

3001
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,510
or getting fired for any reason or
getting laid off should that be a cause

3002
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:14,520
getting laid off should that be a cause
 

3003
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,970
getting laid off should that be a cause
to have you you know totally lose your

3004
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:16,980
to have you you know totally lose your
 

3005
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:19,069
to have you you know totally lose your
shirt or maybe should you just have to

3006
00:59:19,069 --> 00:59:19,079
shirt or maybe should you just have to
 

3007
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,289
shirt or maybe should you just have to
rebound maybe you have less money for

3008
00:59:21,289 --> 00:59:21,299
rebound maybe you have less money for
 

3009
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:23,690
rebound maybe you have less money for
consumption or whatever else and you'll

3010
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:23,700
consumption or whatever else and you'll
 

3011
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:25,609
consumption or whatever else and you'll
be on your way onto bigger and better

3012
00:59:25,609 --> 00:59:25,619
be on your way onto bigger and better
 

3013
00:59:25,619 --> 00:59:28,190
be on your way onto bigger and better
things you know in a in a few months so

3014
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:28,200
things you know in a in a few months so
 

3015
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,170
things you know in a in a few months so
a strong social net

3016
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:30,180
a strong social net
 

3017
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,990
a strong social net
in many ways make it uh more efficient

3018
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:33,000
in many ways make it uh more efficient
 

3019
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,030
in many ways make it uh more efficient
to fire people who are not good at their

3020
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:35,040
to fire people who are not good at their
 

3021
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,450
to fire people who are not good at their
job because then they won't be

3022
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:38,460
job because then they won't be
 

3023
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,069
job because then they won't be
um that won't actually significantly

3024
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
um that won't actually significantly
 

3025
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,750
um that won't actually significantly
damage their quality of life they have a

3026
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
damage their quality of life they have a
 

3027
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,609
damage their quality of life they have a
chance to find a job at which they can

the

the
 

3035
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,150
the
there's a tension here as well so you

3036
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:53,160
there's a tension here as well so you
 

3037
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:54,530
there's a tension here as well so you
said that there's an equality between

3038
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:54,540
said that there's an equality between
 

3039
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,089
said that there's an equality between
the classes

the classes

the classes
the capitalist class in the working

3042
00:59:57,530 --> 00:59:57,540
the capitalist class in the working
 

3043
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,990
the capitalist class in the working
class and sort of there's a lot of ways

3044
00:59:59,990 --> 01:00:00,000
class and sort of there's a lot of ways
 

3045
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,430
class and sort of there's a lot of ways
you can maybe correct me on the numbers

3046
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
you can maybe correct me on the numbers
 

3047
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,230
you can maybe correct me on the numbers
but you could say that the top one

3048
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:03,240
but you could say that the top one
 

3049
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,910
but you could say that the top one
percent of Americans have more wealth

3050
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:04,920
percent of Americans have more wealth
 

3051
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,890
percent of Americans have more wealth
than the bottom 50 percent that's not

3052
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:06,900
than the bottom 50 percent that's not
 

3053
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:09,170
than the bottom 50 percent that's not
talking about perhaps capitalist class

3054
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,180
talking about perhaps capitalist class
 

3055
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,309
talking about perhaps capitalist class
and um

3056
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:10,319
and um
 

3057
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,289
and um
and the working class but it's a good

3058
01:00:12,289 --> 01:00:12,299
and the working class but it's a good
 

3059
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:13,970
and the working class but it's a good
sort of estimate right

3060
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:13,980
sort of estimate right
 

3061
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:17,210
sort of estimate right
the flip side of that if you just look

3062
01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:17,220
the flip side of that if you just look
 

3063
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,930
the flip side of that if you just look
at countries that have more economic

3064
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:20,940
at countries that have more economic
 

3065
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:24,530
at countries that have more economic
freedom versus less economic freedom

3066
01:00:24,530 --> 01:00:24,540
freedom versus less economic freedom
 

3067
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,349
freedom versus less economic freedom
more capitalism versus less capitalism

3068
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
more capitalism versus less capitalism
 

3069
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,930
more capitalism versus less capitalism
their GDP seems to be significantly

3070
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:29,940
their GDP seems to be significantly
 

3071
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,609
their GDP seems to be significantly
higher

3072
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:31,619
higher
 

3073
01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:34,670
higher
and so at the local level you might say

3074
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:34,680
and so at the local level you might say
 

3075
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,150
and so at the local level you might say
that the there's an inequality but if

3076
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
that the there's an inequality but if
 

3077
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:40,250
that the there's an inequality but if
you look historically over decades it

3078
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:40,260
you look historically over decades it
 

3079
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:42,770
you look historically over decades it
seems like the more capitalism there is

3080
01:00:42,770 --> 01:00:42,780
seems like the more capitalism there is
 

3081
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,349
seems like the more capitalism there is
the higher the GDP grows and therefore

3082
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:45,359
the higher the GDP grows and therefore
 

3083
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:47,450
the higher the GDP grows and therefore
the level of

3084
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:47,460
the level of
 

3085
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,549
the level of
uh the quality of life and the basic

3086
01:00:49,549 --> 01:00:49,559
uh the quality of life and the basic
 

3087
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:52,430
uh the quality of life and the basic
income the basic wealth the average even

3088
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:52,440
income the basic wealth the average even
 

3089
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,410
income the basic wealth the average even
including the working class goes up over

3090
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:54,420
including the working class goes up over
 

3091
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,289
including the working class goes up over
time can you see like both sides of this

3092
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:57,299
time can you see like both sides of this
 

3093
01:00:57,299 --> 01:00:59,030
time can you see like both sides of this
so I could definitely accept some of

3094
01:00:59,030 --> 01:00:59,040
so I could definitely accept some of
 

3095
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,370
so I could definitely accept some of
that premise one uh within capitalism

3096
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:01,380
that premise one uh within capitalism
 

3097
01:01:01,380 --> 01:01:02,809
that premise one uh within capitalism
right

3098
01:01:02,809 --> 01:01:02,819
right
 

3099
01:01:02,819 --> 01:01:05,690
right
um You want a bigger pie and then if you

3100
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:05,700
um You want a bigger pie and then if you
 

3101
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:08,030
um You want a bigger pie and then if you
divide up that pie you know you'll even

3102
01:01:08,030 --> 01:01:08,040
divide up that pie you know you'll even
 

3103
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,089
divide up that pie you know you'll even
if if the bottom 10 or the working class

3104
01:01:11,089 --> 01:01:11,099
if if the bottom 10 or the working class
 

3105
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,030
if if the bottom 10 or the working class
share uh let's say is is

3106
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:14,040
share uh let's say is is
 

3107
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,490
share uh let's say is is
um is less as a percentage it's still

3108
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:16,500
um is less as a percentage it's still
 

3109
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,309
um is less as a percentage it's still
more in in in raw terms so it's better

3110
01:01:19,309 --> 01:01:19,319
more in in in raw terms so it's better
 

3111
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:21,410
more in in in raw terms so it's better
for for everyone

3112
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:21,420
for for everyone
 

3113
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,230
for for everyone
the part that I would dispute is

3114
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,240
the part that I would dispute is
 

3115
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,210
the part that I would dispute is
more economic freedom versus less

3116
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:26,220
more economic freedom versus less
 

3117
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,130
more economic freedom versus less
economic freedom so there's obviously

3118
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:28,140
economic freedom so there's obviously
 

3119
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,809
economic freedom so there's obviously
some countries in which

3120
01:01:29,809 --> 01:01:29,819
some countries in which
 

3121
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,430
some countries in which
capitalism doesn't work and maybe

3122
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:33,440
capitalism doesn't work and maybe
 

3123
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,690
capitalism doesn't work and maybe
economic freedom plays a role like if

3124
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:35,700
economic freedom plays a role like if
 

3125
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,690
economic freedom plays a role like if
you're in a country like Egypt or India

3126
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:38,700
you're in a country like Egypt or India
 

3127
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,210
you're in a country like Egypt or India
with a highly or previously highly

01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,220
with a highly or previously highly
 

3129
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,309
with a highly or previously highly
bureaucratic system so you need to get

3130
01:01:43,309 --> 01:01:43,319
bureaucratic system so you need to get
 

3131
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:46,130
bureaucratic system so you need to get
licenses to do anything and you need to

3132
01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:46,140
licenses to do anything and you need to
 

3133
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,109
licenses to do anything and you need to
run things through the state or you need

3134
01:01:48,109 --> 01:01:48,119
run things through the state or you need
 

3135
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:49,789
run things through the state or you need
to bribe someone to get an incorporation

3136
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:49,799
to bribe someone to get an incorporation
 

3137
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:52,250
to bribe someone to get an incorporation
done or whatever else that's in case of

3138
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:52,260
done or whatever else that's in case of
 

3139
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:54,049
done or whatever else that's in case of
which I would accept the premise of okay

3140
01:01:54,049 --> 01:01:54,059
which I would accept the premise of okay
 

3141
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:56,210
which I would accept the premise of okay
economic freedom to to take

3142
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:56,220
economic freedom to to take
 

3143
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,710
economic freedom to to take
entrepreneurial risk to start something

3144
01:01:57,710 --> 01:01:57,720
entrepreneurial risk to start something
 

3145
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,630
entrepreneurial risk to start something
new is limited

3146
01:01:59,630 --> 01:01:59,640
new is limited
 

3147
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:02,030
new is limited
um there's all sorts of factors in which

3148
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:02,040
um there's all sorts of factors in which
 

3149
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,349
um there's all sorts of factors in which
it's too

3150
01:02:03,349 --> 01:02:03,359
it's too
 

3151
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:06,650
it's too
um you know too difficult uh to

3152
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:06,660
um you know too difficult uh to
 

3153
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:07,250
um you know too difficult uh to
um

3154
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:07,260
um

01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,910
um
to start a firm and it benefits

3156
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:10,920
to start a firm and it benefits
 

3157
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,349
to start a firm and it benefits
um no one really except for whatever

3158
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:12,359
um no one really except for whatever
 

3159
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,990
um no one really except for whatever
bureaucracy might be might be um you

3160
01:02:14,990 --> 01:02:15,000
bureaucracy might be might be um you
 

3161
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,349
bureaucracy might be might be um you
know taking their 15 cut

3162
01:02:18,349 --> 01:02:18,359
know taking their 15 cut
 

3163
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:20,870
know taking their 15 cut
um but in general I think in advanced

3164
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:20,880
um but in general I think in advanced
 

3165
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,549
um but in general I think in advanced
economies it doesn't really work that

3166
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:22,559
economies it doesn't really work that
 

3167
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:25,430
economies it doesn't really work that
way so think about it this way

3168
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
way so think about it this way
 

3169
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,789
way so think about it this way
if you're pretend like we're back I'm

this is you know a good a good example

3174
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:33,540
this is you know a good a good example
 

3175
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,809
this is you know a good a good example
let's say you're back in the 1970s in

um
 

3205
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,049
um
you would probably and assuming you

3206
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:12,059
you would probably and assuming you
 

3207
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:13,609
you would probably and assuming you
can't just flee or shut down or whatever

01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:16,200
else you'd probably find ways to use
 

3211
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,630
else you'd probably find ways to use
labor-saving technology right that that

3212
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:19,640
labor-saving technology right that that
 

3213

technology and to utilize people's times
 

3219
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,549
technology and to utilize people's times
better so they're more productive at

01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,990
it was combined with a certain type of
um a pattern rage bargaining so I'll

3232
01:03:44,990 --> 01:03:45,000
um a pattern rage bargaining so I'll
 

3233
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:46,670
um a pattern rage bargaining so I'll
explain this really simply but let's

3234
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:46,680
explain this really simply but let's
 

3235
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,809
explain this really simply but let's
pretend that

3236
01:03:47,809 --> 01:03:47,819
pretend that

01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,370
with three different companies I would
say on Automotive sector and I'll just

3244
01:03:58,370 --> 01:03:58,380
say on Automotive sector and I'll just
 

3245

now all these workers in your your
 

3251
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:11,329

is members and they're all paid
 

3257
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:18,950
is members and they're all paid
um the same and the union is setting

3258
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
um the same and the union is setting
 

3259
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,569
um the same and the union is setting
through marketing the union is setting

3260
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:20,579
through marketing the union is setting
 

3261
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:22,609
through marketing the union is setting
the wages across the sector

the wages across the sector
 

3263
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:25,010
the wages across the sector
but the unions and let's say GM is the

3264
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:25,020
but the unions and let's say GM is the
 

3265
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:27,650
but the unions and let's say GM is the
most productive uh of these companies

3266
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:27,660
most productive uh of these companies
 

3267
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,049
most productive uh of these companies
Ford is number two Chrysler is number

3268
01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:30,059
Ford is number two Chrysler is number

01:04:30,059 --> 01:04:33,770
Ford is number two Chrysler is number
three the Unions would intentionally set

3270
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:33,780
three the Unions would intentionally set
 

3271
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,390
three the Unions would intentionally set
the wages

3272
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:35,400
the wages
 

3273
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,670
the wages
um set their Benchmark to forward in the

3274
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:37,680
um set their Benchmark to forward in the
 

3275
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,750
um set their Benchmark to forward in the
middle

3276
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:38,760
middle
 

3277
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:41,630
middle
so what that would do is say to Ford

3278
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:41,640
so what that would do is say to Ford
 

3279
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,250
so what that would do is say to Ford
okay Ford will stay in business because

01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:47,040
Chryslers probably might go out of
 

3285
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,849
Chryslers probably might go out of
business uh because you know they won't

3286
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:49,859
business uh because you know they won't
 

3287
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:51,530
business uh because you know they won't
be able to meet the demand so they'll

3288
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,540
be able to meet the demand so they'll
 

3289
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:52,910
be able to meet the demand so they'll
have to really adapt really quickly they

3290
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:52,920
have to really adapt really quickly they
 

3291
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:54,109

3555
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:38,930
gained fully employed so often unions
will uh try to select their wage demands

3556
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:38,940
will uh try to select their wage demands
 

3557
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,149
will uh try to select their wage demands
at such a level that it ensures that

01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:41,159
at such a level that it ensures that

through uh collective bargaining keep
 

3575

through uh collective bargaining keep
increasing the wage keep increasing the

3576
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:04,380
increasing the wage keep increasing the
 

3577
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,390
increasing the wage keep increasing the
interest

3578
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:05,400
interest
 

3579
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,090
interest
of the worker until it suffocates the

of the worker until it suffocates the
 

3581
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,590

company that it doesn't die immediately
but it dies in like five years so that

3584
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:13,620
but it dies in like five years so that
 

3585
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,350
but it dies in like five years so that
might still serve the interest of the

3586
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:15,360
might still serve the interest of the
 

3587
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,550
might still serve the interest of the

worker
 

3589
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,350
worker
but it doesn't serve the interest of

but it doesn't serve the interest of
 

3591
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,450
but it doesn't serve the interest of
society as a whole that's creating cool

society as a whole that's creating cool
 

3593
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,229
society as a whole that's creating cool
stuff and increasing so a market that's

01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:24,239
stuff and increasing so a market that's
 

3595
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:25,910
stuff and increasing so a market that's

operating and increasing cool stuff and
 

3597
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,890
operating and increasing cool stuff and
constantly innovating and so on and uh

3598
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:27,900
constantly innovating and so on and uh

01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:32,750
increasing the quality of life in
general I disagree with the premise

3604
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:32,760
general I disagree with the premise
 

3605
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,370
general I disagree with the premise
because I think you're even taking your

3606
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:34,380
because I think you're even taking your
 

3607
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:36,370
because I think you're even taking your
example that would be better for society

3608
01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:36,380
example that would be better for society
 

3609
01:11:36,380 --> 01:11:40,010
example that would be better for society
if a firm cannot pay its workers a

3610
01:11:40,010 --> 01:11:40,020
if a firm cannot pay its workers a
 

3611
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,490
if a firm cannot pay its workers a
living wage but its competitors can then

3612
01:11:43,490 --> 01:11:43,500
living wage but its competitors can then
 

3613
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,130
living wage but its competitors can then
that firm should will either figure out

3614
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,140
that firm should will either figure out
 

3615
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,990
that firm should will either figure out
a way to innovate develop new techniques

3616
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:48,000
a way to innovate develop new techniques
 

3617
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,590
a way to innovate develop new techniques
new markets new ways to be productive or

3618
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
new markets new ways to be productive or
 

3619
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,750
new markets new ways to be productive or
it should go out of business and it

3620
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:53,760
it should go out of business and it
 

3621
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,610
it should go out of business and it
would be better for it to go out of

3622
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:55,620
would be better for it to go out of
 

3623
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:58,370
would be better for it to go out of
business than to stay in business or to

3624
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:58,380
business than to stay in business or to
 

3625
01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:00,830
business than to stay in business or to
be artificially kept in business in any

3626
01:12:00,830 --> 01:12:00,840
be artificially kept in business in any
 

3627
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:02,450
be artificially kept in business in any
sort of way

3628
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:02,460
sort of way
 

3629
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:04,850
sort of way
um and yeah so let me that's so that's

3630
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:04,860
um and yeah so let me that's so that's
 

3631
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,290
um and yeah so let me that's so that's
the Chrysler in my old

3632
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:06,300
the Chrysler in my old
 

3633
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,149
the Chrysler in my old
um centralized environment yeah right

3634
01:12:08,149 --> 01:12:08,159
um centralized environment yeah right
 

3635
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:09,770
um centralized environment yeah right
but but then there is you know

3636
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:09,780
but but then there is you know
 

3637
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:13,250
but but then there is you know
Innovation costs money too so the flip

3638
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:13,260
Innovation costs money too so the flip
 

3639
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:14,890
Innovation costs money too so the flip
side of that

3640
01:12:14,890 --> 01:12:14,900
side of that
 

3641
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,990
side of that
I think to play Devil's Advocate is that

3642
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
I think to play Devil's Advocate is that
 

3643
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,149
I think to play Devil's Advocate is that
it incentivizes automotive industry is

3644
01:12:20,149 --> 01:12:20,159
it incentivizes automotive industry is
 

3645
01:12:20,159 --> 01:12:22,130
it incentivizes automotive industry is
it probably a good example of that it

3646
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:22,140
it probably a good example of that it
 

3647
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,630
it probably a good example of that it
incentivizes

3648
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:23,640
incentivizes
 

3649
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,990
incentivizes
uh cutting costs everywhere and sort of

3650
01:12:26,990 --> 01:12:27,000
uh cutting costs everywhere and sort of
 

3651
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,510
uh cutting costs everywhere and sort of
whatever that's been making you money

3652
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:28,520
whatever that's been making you money
 

3653
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:30,950
whatever that's been making you money
currently figuring out how to do that

3654
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:30,960
currently figuring out how to do that
 

3655
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,390
currently figuring out how to do that
really well

3656
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:32,400
really well
 

3657
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,430
really well
without investing into the long-term

3658
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:34,440
without investing into the long-term

01:12:38,930 --> 01:12:38,940
different ways it can pivot all the
 

3663
01:12:38,940 --> 01:12:40,130
different ways it can pivot all the
different interesting things it could do

3664
01:12:40,130 --> 01:12:40,140
different interesting things it could do
 

3665
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:42,530
different interesting things it could do
in terms of investing into r d whenever

3666
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:42,540
in terms of investing into r d whenever
 

3667
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:43,790
in terms of investing into r d whenever
there's more and more and more pressure

3668
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:43,800
there's more and more and more pressure
 

3669
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:47,330
there's more and more and more pressure
I'm paying a living wage for the workers

I'm paying a living wage for the workers
 

3671
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:50,810
I'm paying a living wage for the workers
it might not again it might suffocate

3672
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:50,820
it might not again it might suffocate
 

3673
01:12:50,820 --> 01:12:54,430
it might not again it might suffocate
and die over the next 5 10 20 years

3674
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:54,440
and die over the next 5 10 20 years
 

3675
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,350
and die over the next 5 10 20 years
uh which might be

3676
01:12:57,350 --> 01:12:57,360
uh which might be
 

3677
01:12:57,360 --> 01:12:59,450
uh which might be
a good destructive force from a

3678
01:12:59,450 --> 01:12:59,460
a good destructive force from a
 

3679
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:01,550
a good destructive force from a
capitalist perspective but it might rob

3680
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:01,560
capitalist perspective but it might rob
 

3681
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,550
capitalist perspective but it might rob
us of the Einstein of a company right of

3682
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:04,560
us of the Einstein of a company right of
 

3683
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:06,530
us of the Einstein of a company right of
the of the flourishing that the company

3684
01:13:06,530 --> 01:13:06,540
the of the flourishing that the company
 

3685
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:08,510
the of the flourishing that the company
and the workers within it

3686
01:13:08,510 --> 01:13:08,520
and the workers within it
 

3687

and the workers within it
can do over a period of 5 10 20 years

can do over a period of 5 10 20 years
 

3689
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,070
can do over a period of 5 10 20 years
well this is just a problem with a lot

3690
01:13:13,070 --> 01:13:13,080
well this is just a problem with a lot
 

3691
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,510
well this is just a problem with a lot
of capitalism which is about

3692
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:14,520
of capitalism which is about
 

3693
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:16,910
of capitalism which is about
short-termism right because the same

3694
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:16,920
short-termism right because the same
 

3695
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,010
short-termism right because the same
thing could be said from you starting a

3696
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:19,020
thing could be said from you starting a
 

3697
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,570
thing could be said from you starting a
company you have a plan for it to make a

3698
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:20,580
company you have a plan for it to make a
 

3699
01:13:20,580 --> 01:13:23,090
company you have a plan for it to make a
lot of money but your investors want you

3700
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:23,100
lot of money but your investors want you
 

3701
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,850
lot of money but your investors want you
want dividends right away so you have to

3702
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:25,860
want dividends right away so you have to
 

3703
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:27,290
want dividends right away so you have to
uh

3704
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,300
uh
 

3705
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,830
uh
take away from your long-term r d or

3706
01:13:30,830 --> 01:13:30,840
take away from your long-term r d or
 

3707
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,229
take away from your long-term r d or
other plans and deliver short-term uh

3708
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:33,239
other plans and deliver short-term uh
 

3709
01:13:33,239 --> 01:13:35,750
other plans and deliver short-term uh
dividends that's often why a lot of I

3710
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:35,760
dividends that's often why a lot of I
 

3711
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:38,570
dividends that's often why a lot of I
think r d is often rooted in state

3712
01:13:38,570 --> 01:13:38,580
think r d is often rooted in state
 

3713
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,970
think r d is often rooted in state
institutions and research and whatever

3714
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:40,980
institutions and research and whatever
 

3715
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:43,550
institutions and research and whatever
else is being drawn on and and also I

3716
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:43,560
else is being drawn on and and also I
 

3717
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,649
else is being drawn on and and also I
think that that's a reason why

3718
01:13:45,649 --> 01:13:45,659
think that that's a reason why
 

3719
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,990
think that that's a reason why
you know the state has some sort of role

3720
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:48,000
you know the state has some sort of role
 

3721
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,510
you know the state has some sort of role
in fostering firms in either a my

3722
01:13:50,510 --> 01:13:50,520
in fostering firms in either a my
 

3723
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,189
in fostering firms in either a my
version of a socialist economy or a

3724
01:13:52,189 --> 01:13:52,199
version of a socialist economy or a
 

3725
01:13:52,199 --> 01:13:54,290
version of a socialist economy or a
capitalist economy or whatever else to

3726
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:54,300
capitalist economy or whatever else to
 

3727
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:57,530
capitalist economy or whatever else to
help with these time Horizon uh problems

3728
01:13:57,530 --> 01:13:57,540
help with these time Horizon uh problems
 

3729
01:13:57,540 --> 01:14:00,770
help with these time Horizon uh problems
so I won't dispute that workers could

3730
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:00,780
so I won't dispute that workers could
 

3731
01:14:00,780 --> 01:14:02,570
so I won't dispute that workers could
play a role or wage demands could play a

3732
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:02,580
play a role or wage demands could play a
 

3733
01:14:02,580 --> 01:14:05,209
play a role or wage demands could play a
role in time Horizon problems but more

3734
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:05,219
role in time Horizon problems but more
 

3735
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:07,370
role in time Horizon problems but more
often than that it's coming from

3736
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:07,380
often than that it's coming from
 

3737
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:10,310
often than that it's coming from
investors it's coming from just a host

3738
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
investors it's coming from just a host
 

3739
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,990
investors it's coming from just a host
of other Market pressures that people

3740
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
of other Market pressures that people
 

3741
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,390
of other Market pressures that people
might might have and I would say that in

3742
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
might might have and I would say that in
 

3743
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,110
might might have and I would say that in
the real world a lot of investment funds

3744
01:14:18,110 --> 01:14:18,120
the real world a lot of investment funds
 

3745
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:21,470
the real world a lot of investment funds
don't come from just retained earnings

3746
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:21,480
don't come from just retained earnings
 

3747
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:24,169
don't come from just retained earnings
it comes from a lot of you know sources

3748
01:14:24,169 --> 01:14:24,179
it comes from a lot of you know sources
 

3749
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:26,330
it comes from a lot of you know sources
so I think this is a problem that could

3750
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:26,340
so I think this is a problem that could
 

3751
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,370
so I think this is a problem that could
be solved through public policy but

3752
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:28,380
be solved through public policy but
 

3753
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,590
be solved through public policy but
definitely exists today as well so you

3754
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:30,600
definitely exists today as well so you
 

3755
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,149
definitely exists today as well so you
mentioned living wage

3756
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
mentioned living wage
 

3757
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:35,090
mentioned living wage
is there is there a tension between a

3758
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:35,100
is there is there a tension between a
 

3759
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,290
is there is there a tension between a
living wage

3760
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:36,300
living wage
 

3761
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:37,910
living wage
and maybe you could speak to what a

3762
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
and maybe you could speak to what a
 

3763
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:42,290
and maybe you could speak to what a
living wage means and the workers owning

3764
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:42,300
living wage means and the workers owning
 

3765
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,010
living wage means and the workers owning
all of the profit of the company

3766
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:45,020
all of the profit of the company
 

3767
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:49,250
all of the profit of the company
sort of uh this kind of spectrum no I

3768
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,260
sort of uh this kind of spectrum no I
 

3769
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:51,229
sort of uh this kind of spectrum no I
guess the spectrum is from

3770
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:51,239
guess the spectrum is from
 

3771
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:55,010
guess the spectrum is from
like no no minimum wage the lowest

3772
01:14:55,010 --> 01:14:55,020
like no no minimum wage the lowest
 

3773
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:56,870
like no no minimum wage the lowest
possible thing you could pay to a worker

3774
01:14:56,870 --> 01:14:56,880
possible thing you could pay to a worker
 

3775
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:58,729
possible thing you could pay to a worker
than somewhere in that spectrum is a

3776
01:14:58,729 --> 01:14:58,739
than somewhere in that spectrum is a
 

3777
01:14:58,739 --> 01:15:01,910
than somewhere in that spectrum is a
living wage and then at the at the top

3778
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
living wage and then at the at the top
 

3779
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:04,130
living wage and then at the at the top
is like uh all of the profit from the

3780
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:04,140
is like uh all of the profit from the
 

3781
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:06,649
is like uh all of the profit from the
companies owned by the workers

3782
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:06,659
companies owned by the workers
 

3783
01:15:06,659 --> 01:15:09,169
companies owned by the workers
so split to the workers

3784
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:09,179
so split to the workers
 

3785
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:11,510
so split to the workers
I mean I think that any society is going

3786
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:11,520
I mean I think that any society is going
 

3787
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:14,030
I mean I think that any society is going
to have to make distributional

3788
01:15:14,030 --> 01:15:14,040
to have to make distributional
 

3789
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,649
to have to make distributional
um choices

3790
01:15:15,649 --> 01:15:15,659
um choices
 

3791
01:15:15,659 --> 01:15:18,470
um choices
um you could have imagined a variety of

3792
01:15:18,470 --> 01:15:18,480
um you could have imagined a variety of
 

3793
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,149
um you could have imagined a variety of
capitalism in which workers are paid

3794
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:20,159
capitalism in which workers are paid
 

3795
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:22,250
capitalism in which workers are paid
quite little but there's extremely high

3796
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:22,260
quite little but there's extremely high
 

3797
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,470
quite little but there's extremely high
taxation and there's redistribution

3798
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
taxation and there's redistribution
 

3799
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,689
taxation and there's redistribution
after the fact you can imagine a system

3800
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:26,699
after the fact you can imagine a system
 

3801
01:15:26,699 --> 01:15:28,850
after the fact you can imagine a system
in which there's less taxation after the

3802
01:15:28,850 --> 01:15:28,860
in which there's less taxation after the
 

3803
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:30,649
in which there's less taxation after the
fact but there's more guarantees and

3804
01:15:30,649 --> 01:15:30,659
fact but there's more guarantees and
 

3805
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:32,390
fact but there's more guarantees and
regulations how much people are paid

3806
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
regulations how much people are paid
 

3807
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,370
regulations how much people are paid
before the fact

3808
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:34,380
before the fact
 

3809
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:38,750
before the fact
in my vision of a social Society there

3810
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:38,760
in my vision of a social Society there
 

3811
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,390
in my vision of a social Society there
would be some other way that unions work

3812
01:15:41,390 --> 01:15:41,400
would be some other way that unions work
 

3813
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,669
would be some other way that unions work
and in my exempt these centralized uh

3814
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
and in my exempt these centralized uh
 

3815
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,310
and in my exempt these centralized uh
bargaining Unions would work that

3816
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:46,320
bargaining Unions would work that
 

3817
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:49,010
bargaining Unions would work that

um
there could be benchmarks set for

01:15:56,930 --> 01:15:56,940
there could be benchmarks set for
 

3827
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:00,229
there could be benchmarks set for
different occupations or wages and the

3828

different occupations or wages and the
 

3829
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:01,490
different occupations or wages and the
reason why you would want to Benchmark

3830
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:01,500
reason why you would want to Benchmark
 

3831
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:04,189
reason why you would want to Benchmark
at a worker controlled firm is that you

3832
01:16:04,189 --> 01:16:04,199
at a worker controlled firm is that you

01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,169
at a worker controlled firm is that you
don't want workers self-exporting

dollars an hour that's minimum but on
 

3853
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,110

top of that you get

3854
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
top of that you get
 

3855
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,810

they could get their 50 million dollars
their three percent loan if you have

their three percent loan if you have
 

3915
01:17:38,219 --> 01:17:40,370
their three percent loan if you have
some crazy blue sky idea and you manage

VC would offer today so I only kind of
 

3925
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:52,370

go into these details not because to say

go into these details not because to say
 

3927
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:53,149
go into these details not because to say
that

3928
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:53,159
that
 

3929
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:56,510
that
a system doesn't have to in advance

3930
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:56,520
a system doesn't have to in advance
 

3931
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:58,870
a system doesn't have to in advance

map out all the different possibilities
 

3933
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,570
map out all the different possibilities
but I think it does have to be willing

3934
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:02,580
but I think it does have to be willing
 

3935
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:05,209
but I think it does have to be willing
to accept a lot of things we know today

3936
01:18:05,209 --> 01:18:05,219
to accept a lot of things we know today
 

3937
01:18:05,219 --> 01:18:07,010

you know I can't give you a version of
socialism that's everything's going to

3940
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:09,060
socialism that's everything's going to
 

3941
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:10,850
socialism that's everything's going to
be fine we're going to live harmoniously

3942
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:10,860
be fine we're going to live harmoniously
 

3943
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,250
be fine we're going to live harmoniously
and we won't have these sort of tensions

3944
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:13,260
and we won't have these sort of tensions
 

3945
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,830
and we won't have these sort of tensions
and you know you could hunt in the

3946
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:15,840
and you know you could hunt in the
 

3947
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,689
and you know you could hunt in the
evening and you know fish in the you

01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:20,040
know afternoon and write criticism you
 

3951
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:22,310
know afternoon and write criticism you
know whatever else

3952
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:22,320
know whatever else
 

3953
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,350
know whatever else
um I do hope that there's Horizons

3954
01:18:24,350 --> 01:18:24,360
um I do hope that there's Horizons
 

3955
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,350
um I do hope that there's Horizons
Beyond this that we can aspire to I do

3956
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:27,360
Beyond this that we can aspire to I do
 

3957
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:30,169
Beyond this that we can aspire to I do
have those Visions but for now I think

3958
01:18:30,169 --> 01:18:30,179
have those Visions but for now I think
 

3959
01:18:30,179 --> 01:18:33,350
have those Visions but for now I think
our task as socialists is to imagine a

3960
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:33,360
our task as socialists is to imagine a
 

3961
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,750
our task as socialists is to imagine a
you know five minutes after you know

3962
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:35,760
you know five minutes after you know
 

3963
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,689
you know five minutes after you know
midnight like what what can we do right

3964
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:38,699
midnight like what what can we do right
 

3965
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:40,610
midnight like what what can we do right
away within our lifetime

3966
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:40,620
away within our lifetime
 

3967
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,310
away within our lifetime
um Vision so that means

3968
01:18:43,310 --> 01:18:43,320
um Vision so that means
 

3969
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,950
um Vision so that means
through some level of central planning

3970
01:18:45,950 --> 01:18:45,960
through some level of central planning
 

3971
01:18:45,960 --> 01:18:48,950
through some level of central planning
reallocating resources to the workers

3972
01:18:48,950 --> 01:18:48,960
reallocating resources to the workers
 

3973
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,310
reallocating resources to the workers
so I think the primary mechanism in this

3974
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
so I think the primary mechanism in this
 

3975
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,430
so I think the primary mechanism in this
private sector under socialism would be

3976
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:55,440
private sector under socialism would be
 

3977
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,229
private sector under socialism would be
a market mechanism firms competing

3978
01:18:57,229 --> 01:18:57,239
a market mechanism firms competing
 

3979
01:18:57,239 --> 01:18:59,270
a market mechanism firms competing
against each other to expand uh

3980
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
against each other to expand uh
 

3981
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:01,370
against each other to expand uh
connected to a system of public

3982
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:01,380
connected to a system of public
 

3983
01:19:01,380 --> 01:19:04,310
connected to a system of public
financing but even at that level the

3984
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
financing but even at that level the
 

3985
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:05,750
financing but even at that level the
individual

3986
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:05,760
individual
 

3987
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,149
individual
um bankers and and public Banks and so

3988
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:08,159
um bankers and and public Banks and so
 

3989
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,209
um bankers and and public Banks and so
on would be operating based on their own

3990
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:10,219
on would be operating based on their own
 

3991
01:19:10,219 --> 01:19:13,550
on would be operating based on their own
rationality and the state would

3992
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:13,560
rationality and the state would
 

3993
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:17,209
rationality and the state would
certainly shape investment decisions but

3994
01:19:17,209 --> 01:19:17,219
certainly shape investment decisions but
 

3995
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,850
certainly shape investment decisions but
maybe no more than they do in a lot of

3996
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:19,860
maybe no more than they do in a lot of
 

3997
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:21,950
maybe no more than they do in a lot of
capitalist systems so the state might

3998
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:21,960
capitalist systems so the state might
 

3999
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,570
capitalist systems so the state might
already today and a lot of countries

4000
01:19:23,570 --> 01:19:23,580
already today and a lot of countries
 

4001
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:24,590
already today and a lot of countries
decide

4002
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:24,600
decide
 

4003
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,390
decide
you know we want to invest in Green

4004
01:19:26,390 --> 01:19:26,400
you know we want to invest in Green
 

4005
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,330
you know we want to invest in Green
Technology so it's going to be favorable

4006
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:29,340
Technology so it's going to be favorable
 

4007
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,130
Technology so it's going to be favorable
rates for people or tax credits for

4008
01:19:31,130 --> 01:19:31,140
rates for people or tax credits for
 

4009
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,930
rates for people or tax credits for
people investing in Green Technology so

4010
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:32,940
people investing in Green Technology so
 

4011
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:35,270
people investing in Green Technology so
the state already shapes investment

4012
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
the state already shapes investment
 

4013
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,649
the state already shapes investment
um I think what should be centrally

4014
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:36,659
um I think what should be centrally
 

4015
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:38,990
um I think what should be centrally
planned and this is where like I'm proud

4016
01:19:38,990 --> 01:19:39,000
planned and this is where like I'm proud
 

4017
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,970
planned and this is where like I'm proud
to sound like an old school socialist is

4018
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:40,980
to sound like an old school socialist is
 

4019
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:44,030
to sound like an old school socialist is

um natural monopolies of lots of types

4024
01:19:49,790 --> 01:19:49,800
um natural monopolies of lots of types
 

4025
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,530
um natural monopolies of lots of types
uh you know I think can be done very

4026
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:51,540
uh you know I think can be done very
 

4027
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:53,630
uh you know I think can be done very
well through

4028
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:53,640
well through
 

4029
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:55,010
well through
um through planning and we already have

4030
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:55,020
um through planning and we already have
 

4031
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:57,350
um through planning and we already have
plenty of examples but a lot of this

4032
01:19:57,350 --> 01:19:57,360
plenty of examples but a lot of this
 

4033
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,930
plenty of examples but a lot of this
Society I think would be would be the

4034
01:19:59,930 --> 01:19:59,940
Society I think would be would be the
 

4035
01:19:59,940 --> 01:20:03,290
Society I think would be would be the
the private sphere of worker controlled

4036
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:03,300
the private sphere of worker controlled
 

4037
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,390
the private sphere of worker controlled
cooperatives uh competing against each

4038
01:20:05,390 --> 01:20:05,400
cooperatives uh competing against each
 

4039
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,330
cooperatives uh competing against each
other weak firms failing uh successful

4040
01:20:08,330 --> 01:20:08,340
other weak firms failing uh successful
 

4041
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,550
other weak firms failing uh successful
firms expanded and the banks you're

4042
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
firms expanded and the banks you're
 

4043
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,229
firms expanded and the banks you're
saying publicly or privately owned

4044
01:20:12,229 --> 01:20:12,239
saying publicly or privately owned
 

4045
01:20:12,239 --> 01:20:13,910
saying publicly or privately owned
publicly owned

4046
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
publicly owned
 

4047
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,130
publicly owned
let's just put it all on the table that

4048
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:16,140
let's just put it all on the table that
 

4049
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,870
let's just put it all on the table that
it's almost guaranteed that every system

4050
01:20:17,870 --> 01:20:17,880
it's almost guaranteed that every system
 

4051
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,970
it's almost guaranteed that every system
has corruption so I guess the bigger

4052
01:20:19,970 --> 01:20:19,980
has corruption so I guess the bigger
 

4053
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:22,130
has corruption so I guess the bigger
question is which system has more

4054
01:20:22,130 --> 01:20:22,140
question is which system has more
 

4055
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,470
question is which system has more
corruption uh

4056
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
corruption uh
 

4057
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,870
corruption uh
the this this one with Central planning

4058
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:26,880
the this this one with Central planning
 

4059
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,510
the this this one with Central planning
and worker cooperatives versus uh

4060
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
and worker cooperatives versus uh
 

4061
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,510
and worker cooperatives versus uh
unfettered capitalism or any flavor of

4062
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:32,520
unfettered capitalism or any flavor of
 

4063
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,729
unfettered capitalism or any flavor of
capitalism I think any system has

4064
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:34,739
capitalism I think any system has
 

4065
01:20:34,739 --> 01:20:37,850
capitalism I think any system has
potential for corruption I think it it

4066
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:37,860
potential for corruption I think it it
 

4067
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:40,010
potential for corruption I think it it
depends on like how good your civil

4068
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:40,020
depends on like how good your civil
 

4069
01:20:40,020 --> 01:20:42,410
depends on like how good your civil
service is how how much oversight do you

4070
01:20:42,410 --> 01:20:42,420
service is how how much oversight do you
 

4071
01:20:42,420 --> 01:20:44,689
service is how how much oversight do you
have to resolve a problem once it arises

4072
01:20:44,689 --> 01:20:44,699
have to resolve a problem once it arises
 

4073
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:46,370
have to resolve a problem once it arises
how does corruption happen in the social

4074
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:46,380
how does corruption happen in the social
 

4075
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,310
how does corruption happen in the social
system so you have to again I I

4076
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:49,320
system so you have to again I I
 

4077
01:20:49,320 --> 01:20:51,410
system so you have to again I I
apologize but the large-scale examples

4078
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:51,420
apologize but the large-scale examples
 

4079
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,410
apologize but the large-scale examples
of it so we can we can look at Soviet

4080
01:20:54,410 --> 01:20:54,420
of it so we can we can look at Soviet
 

4081
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,630
of it so we can we can look at Soviet
Union China and Sweden

4082
01:20:56,630 --> 01:20:56,640
Union China and Sweden
 

4083
01:20:56,640 --> 01:21:00,169
Union China and Sweden
uh fundamentally different nations and

4084
01:21:00,169 --> 01:21:00,179
uh fundamentally different nations and
 

4085
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,270
uh fundamentally different nations and
histories and peoples and economic

4086
01:21:02,270 --> 01:21:02,280
histories and peoples and economic
 

4087
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,850
histories and peoples and economic
systems and political systems but all

4088
01:21:04,850 --> 01:21:04,860
systems and political systems but all
 

4089
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:08,930
systems and political systems but all
could be called in part socialists

4090
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:08,940
could be called in part socialists
 

4091
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,649
could be called in part socialists
and so what you know there there's a

4092
01:21:12,649 --> 01:21:12,659
and so what you know there there's a
 

4093
01:21:12,659 --> 01:21:14,689
and so what you know there there's a
ridiculous almost caricature of

4094
01:21:14,689 --> 01:21:14,699
ridiculous almost caricature of
 

4095
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:16,910
ridiculous almost caricature of
corruption in the Soviet system the

4096
01:21:16,910 --> 01:21:16,920
corruption in the Soviet system the
 

4097
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,970
corruption in the Soviet system the
gigantic bureaucracy that's built

4098
01:21:19,970 --> 01:21:19,980
gigantic bureaucracy that's built
 

4099
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:24,470
gigantic bureaucracy that's built
um where somehow corruption seeps in

4100
01:21:24,470 --> 01:21:24,480
um where somehow corruption seeps in
 

4101
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,290
um where somehow corruption seeps in
through kind of

4102
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:26,300
through kind of
 

4103
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:28,970
through kind of
dispersion of responsibility

4104
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:28,980
dispersion of responsibility
 

4105
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,070
dispersion of responsibility
that nobody's really responsible for the

4106
01:21:31,070 --> 01:21:31,080
that nobody's really responsible for the
 

4107
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:32,030
that nobody's really responsible for the
corruption

4108
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,040
corruption
 

4109
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:33,890
corruption
I just had a conversation with Ed

4110
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:33,900
I just had a conversation with Ed
 

4111
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:36,890
I just had a conversation with Ed
Calderon who fought the the cartels in

4112
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:36,900
Calderon who fought the the cartels in
 

4113
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:38,870
Calderon who fought the the cartels in
Mexico and there's a huge amount of

4114
01:21:38,870 --> 01:21:38,880
Mexico and there's a huge amount of
 

4115
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,970
Mexico and there's a huge amount of
corruption in my in Mexico but it's it's

4116
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:40,980
corruption in my in Mexico but it's it's
 

4117
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:42,709
corruption in my in Mexico but it's it's
not like even seen as corruption you're

4118
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:42,719
not like even seen as corruption you're
 

4119
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:44,149
not like even seen as corruption you're
you understand when the cop pulls you

4120
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
you understand when the cop pulls you
 

4121
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,189
you understand when the cop pulls you
over you give this much money and so on

4122
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:46,199
over you give this much money and so on
 

4123
01:21:46,199 --> 01:21:48,470
over you give this much money and so on
and so that kind of seems to happen in

4124
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:48,480
and so that kind of seems to happen in
 

4125
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:50,209
and so that kind of seems to happen in
certain systems and it seems to have

4126
01:21:50,209 --> 01:21:50,219
certain systems and it seems to have
 

4127
01:21:50,219 --> 01:21:54,110
certain systems and it seems to have
happened in Social systems more than in

4128
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,120
happened in Social systems more than in
 

4129
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,510
happened in Social systems more than in
capital systems in the 20th century or

4130
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:56,520
capital systems in the 20th century or
 

4131
01:21:56,520 --> 01:21:58,189
capital systems in the 20th century or
maybe I'm wrong on that no I mean I

4132
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:58,199
maybe I'm wrong on that no I mean I
 

4133
01:21:58,199 --> 01:21:59,870
maybe I'm wrong on that no I mean I
think in a lot of countries it's seen as

4134

think in a lot of countries it's seen as
 

4135

think in a lot of countries it's seen as
the cost of doing business right now in

4136
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:03,420
the cost of doing business right now in
 

4137
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,990
the cost of doing business right now in
particular countries built on a system

4138
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
particular countries built on a system
 

4139
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,970
particular countries built on a system
of central planning or just State

4140
01:22:07,970 --> 01:22:07,980
of central planning or just State
 

4141
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,250
of central planning or just State
allocation resources for the state both

4142
01:22:10,250 --> 01:22:10,260
allocation resources for the state both
 

4143
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,649
allocation resources for the state both
producers and and allocates and things

4144
01:22:12,649 --> 01:22:12,659
producers and and allocates and things
 

4145
01:22:12,659 --> 01:22:15,290

run through bureaucracies

4146
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:15,300
run through bureaucracies
 

4147
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,930
run through bureaucracies
then I think you're you're much more apt

4148
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:17,940
then I think you're you're much more apt
 

4149
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:21,169
then I think you're you're much more apt
to have corruption than in a system with

4150
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:21,179
to have corruption than in a system with
 

4151
01:22:21,179 --> 01:22:24,350
to have corruption than in a system with
just a smaller Sphere for the state so

4152
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:24,360
just a smaller Sphere for the state so
 

4153
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:26,689
just a smaller Sphere for the state so
for example if you're in a hypothetical

4154
01:22:26,689 --> 01:22:26,699
for example if you're in a hypothetical
 

4155
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:28,610
for example if you're in a hypothetical
version of the U.S you might see a lot

4156
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:28,620
version of the U.S you might see a lot
 

4157
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:30,530
version of the U.S you might see a lot
more corruption like the post office but

4158
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:30,540
more corruption like the post office but
 

4159
01:22:30,540 --> 01:22:31,669
more corruption like the post office but
you know you wouldn't have that

4160
01:22:31,669 --> 01:22:31,679
you know you wouldn't have that
 

4161
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:33,649
you know you wouldn't have that
corruption in your workplace so you kind

4162
01:22:33,649 --> 01:22:33,659
corruption in your workplace so you kind
 

4163
01:22:33,659 --> 01:22:37,130
corruption in your workplace so you kind
of learned to go around that

4164
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:37,140
of learned to go around that
 

4165
01:22:37,140 --> 01:22:37,790
of learned to go around that
um

4166
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:37,800
um
 

4167
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,610
um
for one thing even in state sectors you

4168
01:22:40,610 --> 01:22:40,620
for one thing even in state sectors you
 

4169
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,530
for one thing even in state sectors you
can have and as often is the case in

4170
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:42,540
can have and as often is the case in
 

4171
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:45,470
can have and as often is the case in
Democratic countries you have

4172
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:45,480
Democratic countries you have
 

4173
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:48,530
Democratic countries you have
um a transparent Civil Service where

4174
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:48,540
um a transparent Civil Service where
 

4175
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:51,530
um a transparent Civil Service where
people who are corrupt are prosecuted by

01:22:51,530 --> 01:22:51,540
people who are corrupt are prosecuted by
 

4177
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,229
people who are corrupt are prosecuted by
judges where it's frowned upon and it

4178
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
judges where it's frowned upon and it
 

4179
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:57,470
judges where it's frowned upon and it
just over time it goes away so you go

4180
01:22:57,470 --> 01:22:57,480
just over time it goes away so you go
 

4181
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,330
just over time it goes away so you go
from having political machines that were

4182
01:22:59,330 --> 01:22:59,340
from having political machines that were
 

4183
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:00,950
from having political machines that were
tied to certain you know had friends

4184
01:23:00,950 --> 01:23:00,960
tied to certain you know had friends
 

4185

today that would be a huge Scandal and

4192
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,120
today that would be a huge Scandal and
 

4193
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:11,149
today that would be a huge Scandal and
unheard of right so I think over time

4194
01:23:11,149 --> 01:23:11,159
unheard of right so I think over time
 

4195
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:13,490
unheard of right so I think over time
having a a

truly meritocratic civil service can be
 

4203
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:23,030
truly meritocratic civil service can be
implemented anywhere I think though in

4204
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
implemented anywhere I think though in
 

4205
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,950
implemented anywhere I think though in
the Soviet Union the extra

4206

the Soviet Union the extra
 

4207
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,649
the Soviet Union the extra
little bit that that happened was you

4208
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:27,659
little bit that that happened was you
 

4209
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:29,330
little bit that that happened was you
had a bureaucracy that just had so much

4210
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:29,340
had a bureaucracy that just had so much
 

4211
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:32,330
had a bureaucracy that just had so much
power because the bureaucracy was

4212
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:32,340
power because the bureaucracy was
 

4213
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:33,950
power because the bureaucracy was
producing and distributing everything

4214
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:33,960
producing and distributing everything
 

4215
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:35,270
producing and distributing everything
and everyone was relying on the

4216
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
and everyone was relying on the
 

4217
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,430
and everyone was relying on the
bureaucracy with jobs the way to social

4218
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
bureaucracy with jobs the way to social
 

4219
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,290
bureaucracy with jobs the way to social
advancement uh was through the

4220
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:39,300
advancement uh was through the
 

4221
01:23:39,300 --> 01:23:40,850
advancement uh was through the
bureaucracies so you end up with people

4222
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:40,860
bureaucracies so you end up with people
 

4223
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:42,950
bureaucracies so you end up with people
like Khrushchev you know people going

4224
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
like Khrushchev you know people going
 

4225
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,810
like Khrushchev you know people going
from peasants to

01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:50,149
countries just through like getting
hooked up in the bureaucracy and

01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
hooked up in the bureaucracy and
 

4233
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:53,330
hooked up in the bureaucracy and
advancing within it um and you know not

4234
01:23:53,330 --> 01:23:53,340
advancing within it um and you know not
 

4235
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,890
advancing within it um and you know not
all these were bad people I don't think

4236
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:54,900
all these were bad people I don't think
 

4237
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,270
all these were bad people I don't think
Khrushchev was that bad of a person or

4238
01:23:56,270 --> 01:23:56,280
Khrushchev was that bad of a person or
 

4239
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,010
Khrushchev was that bad of a person or
Gorbachev you know they they but this is

4240
01:23:58,010 --> 01:23:58,020
Gorbachev you know they they but this is
 

4241
01:23:58,020 --> 01:23:59,630
Gorbachev you know they they but this is
their mechanism to advancement in

4242
01:23:59,630 --> 01:23:59,640
their mechanism to advancement in
 

4243
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:03,050
their mechanism to advancement in
systems like this in the vision of

4244
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:03,060
systems like this in the vision of
 

4245
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:05,330
systems like this in the vision of
democratic socialism that I propose

4246
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:05,340
democratic socialism that I propose
 

4247
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,430
democratic socialism that I propose
the state doesn't have that overriding

4248
01:24:07,430 --> 01:24:07,440
the state doesn't have that overriding
 

4249
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:09,709
the state doesn't have that overriding
uh Power to begin with but I think in

4250
01:24:09,709 --> 01:24:09,719
uh Power to begin with but I think in
 

4251
01:24:09,719 --> 01:24:11,270
uh Power to begin with but I think in
either case you know

4252
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
either case you know
 

4253
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:13,010
either case you know
um corruption has arose in many

4254
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:13,020
um corruption has arose in many
 

4255
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:14,510
um corruption has arose in many
different systems and has been

4256
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:14,520
different systems and has been
 

4257
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,130
different systems and has been
successfully

4258
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:16,140
successfully
 

4259
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:17,750
successfully
um dealt with I think on the

4260
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
um dealt with I think on the
 

4261
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,669
um dealt with I think on the
developmental trajectory of even

4262
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
developmental trajectory of even
 

4263
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,169
developmental trajectory of even
countries today that we think of as

4264
01:24:21,169 --> 01:24:21,179
countries today that we think of as
 

4265
01:24:21,179 --> 01:24:22,970
countries today that we think of as
being very corrupt

4266
01:24:22,970 --> 01:24:22,980
being very corrupt
 

4267
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:25,610
being very corrupt
um corruption will will

4268
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:25,620
um corruption will will
 

4269
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:28,610
um corruption will will
um you know fade away as well but you

4270
01:24:28,610 --> 01:24:28,620
um you know fade away as well but you
 

4271
01:24:28,620 --> 01:24:29,810
um you know fade away as well but you
definitely need

4272
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:29,820
definitely need
 

4273
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,570
definitely need
a system in which

4274
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:32,580
a system in which
 

4275
01:24:32,580 --> 01:24:35,149
a system in which
um individuals act

4276
01:24:35,149 --> 01:24:35,159
um individuals act
 

4277
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:37,729
um individuals act
um individual are incentivized to act

4278
01:24:37,729 --> 01:24:37,739
um individual are incentivized to act
 

4279
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:41,149
um individual are incentivized to act
rationally so if you're in a system in

4280
01:24:41,149 --> 01:24:41,159
rationally so if you're in a system in
 

4281
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,689
rationally so if you're in a system in
which cops who are corrupt are

4282
01:24:43,689 --> 01:24:43,699
which cops who are corrupt are
 

4283
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:46,189
which cops who are corrupt are
prosecuted and investigated and there's

4284

corruption over time if people are
 

4295
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:00,830
corruption over time if people are
punished if you're in a system in which

4296
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:00,840
punished if you're in a system in which
 

4297
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,450
punished if you're in a system in which
if you're running a firm you're the

4298
01:25:02,450 --> 01:25:02,460
if you're running a firm you're the
 

4299
01:25:02,460 --> 01:25:04,430
if you're running a firm you're the
manager of a firm and elected manager

4300
01:25:04,430 --> 01:25:04,440
manager of a firm and elected manager
 

4301
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,830
manager of a firm and elected manager
and everyone at that firm is trying for

4302
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:06,840
and everyone at that firm is trying for
 

4303
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,689
and everyone at that firm is trying for
more efficiency and trying for more

4304
01:25:08,689 --> 01:25:08,699
more efficiency and trying for more
 

4305
01:25:08,699 --> 01:25:10,910
more efficiency and trying for more
excess profits or whatever else at the

4306
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:10,920
excess profits or whatever else at the
 

4307
01:25:10,920 --> 01:25:12,410
excess profits or whatever else at the
end of the day you know dividends at the

4308
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:12,420
end of the day you know dividends at the
 

4309
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,330
end of the day you know dividends at the
end of the day then if you try to hire

4310
01:25:14,330 --> 01:25:14,340
end of the day then if you try to hire
 

4311
01:25:14,340 --> 01:25:15,830
end of the day then if you try to hire
your nephew and he's not good at your

4312
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:15,840
your nephew and he's not good at your
 

4313
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,630
your nephew and he's not good at your
job you're not going to win re-election

4314
01:25:17,630 --> 01:25:17,640
job you're not going to win re-election
 

4315
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:19,610
job you're not going to win re-election
right so you you shouldn't

4316
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:19,620
right so you you shouldn't
 

4317
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:22,370
right so you you shouldn't
I think no system should rely on a

4318
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:22,380
I think no system should rely on a
 

4319
01:25:22,380 --> 01:25:25,070
I think no system should rely on a
change in culture that come naturally or

4320
01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:25,080
change in culture that come naturally or
 

4321
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,770
change in culture that come naturally or
some sort of individual altruism I think

4322
01:25:27,770 --> 01:25:27,780
some sort of individual altruism I think
 

4323
01:25:27,780 --> 01:25:29,750
some sort of individual altruism I think
the systems have to be constructed in

4324
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:29,760
the systems have to be constructed in
 

4325
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,430
the systems have to be constructed in
such a way that it's not rational to

4326
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:31,440
such a way that it's not rational to
 

4327
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,610
such a way that it's not rational to
behave poorly in sort of from a

4328
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:34,620
behave poorly in sort of from a
 

4329
01:25:34,620 --> 01:25:36,410
behave poorly in sort of from a
theoretical perspective

4330
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:36,420
theoretical perspective
 

4331
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,689
theoretical perspective
either socialist or capitalist system

4332
01:25:38,689 --> 01:25:38,699
either socialist or capitalist system
 

4333
01:25:38,699 --> 01:25:39,770
either socialist or capitalist system
can have

4334
01:25:39,770 --> 01:25:39,780
can have
 

4335
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:42,709
can have
can have either culture

4336
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
can have either culture
 

4337
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:45,890
can have either culture
but it seems like if you prior to

4338
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:45,900
but it seems like if you prior to
 

4339
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:49,070
but it seems like if you prior to
prioritize meritocracy

4340
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:49,080
prioritize meritocracy
 

4341
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,189
prioritize meritocracy
if the people that are good whatever the

4342
01:25:52,189 --> 01:25:52,199
if the people that are good whatever the
 

4343
01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:54,470
if the people that are good whatever the
good means in terms of Integrity in

4344
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
good means in terms of Integrity in
 

4345
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:55,910
good means in terms of Integrity in
terms of performance in terms of

4346
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
terms of performance in terms of
 

4347
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:59,689
terms of performance in terms of
competence it's it seems like that leads

4348
01:25:59,689 --> 01:25:59,699
competence it's it seems like that leads
 

4349
01:25:59,699 --> 01:26:02,030
competence it's it seems like that leads
to a less corrupt system and it seems

4350
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:02,040
to a less corrupt system and it seems
 

4351
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,189
to a less corrupt system and it seems
like capitalism there's all kinds of

4352
01:26:04,189 --> 01:26:04,199
like capitalism there's all kinds of
 

4353
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:06,590
like capitalism there's all kinds of
flavors of capitalism but capitalism

4354
01:26:06,590 --> 01:26:06,600
flavors of capitalism but capitalism
 

4355
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,010
flavors of capitalism but capitalism
because it does prioritize meritocracy

4356
01:26:10,010 --> 01:26:10,020
because it does prioritize meritocracy
 

4357
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:13,129
because it does prioritize meritocracy
more often leads to less corruption so

4358
01:26:13,129 --> 01:26:13,139
more often leads to less corruption so
 

4359
01:26:13,139 --> 01:26:14,629
more often leads to less corruption so
that's that's not a question of

4360
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:14,639
that's that's not a question of
 

4361
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,070
that's that's not a question of
political or economic systems the

4362
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:16,080
political or economic systems the
 

4363
01:26:16,080 --> 01:26:18,530
political or economic systems the
question of what kind of stuff do you

4364
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:18,540
question of what kind of stuff do you
 

4365
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,090
question of what kind of stuff do you
talk about that leads to a culture of

4366
01:26:20,090 --> 01:26:20,100
talk about that leads to a culture of
 

4367
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:21,709
talk about that leads to a culture of
less corruption

4368
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:21,719
less corruption
 

4369
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,050
less corruption
first of all I think in Theory maybe

4370
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:24,060
first of all I think in Theory maybe
 

4371
01:26:24,060 --> 01:26:26,689
first of all I think in Theory maybe
capitalism words meritocracy

4372
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:26,699
capitalism words meritocracy
 

4373
01:26:26,699 --> 01:26:30,290
capitalism words meritocracy
but I think in practice anyone watching

4374
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:30,300
but I think in practice anyone watching
 

4375
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,209
but I think in practice anyone watching
this or you and me would think of some

4376
01:26:32,209 --> 01:26:32,219
this or you and me would think of some
 

4377
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,370
this or you and me would think of some
of the people we know that were the

4378
01:26:34,370 --> 01:26:34,380
of the people we know that were the
 

4379
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:35,810
of the people we know that were the
hardest and they're often you know

4380
01:26:35,810 --> 01:26:35,820
hardest and they're often you know
 

4381
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,370
hardest and they're often you know
Working Class People working the food

4382
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:37,380
Working Class People working the food
 

4383
01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:40,370
Working Class People working the food
service industry or whatever else right

4384
01:26:40,370 --> 01:26:40,380
service industry or whatever else right
 

4385
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:42,890
service industry or whatever else right
um I I think we we don't have

4386
01:26:42,890 --> 01:26:42,900
um I I think we we don't have
 

4387
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,810
um I I think we we don't have
um in practice I don't think we actually

4388
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:44,820
um in practice I don't think we actually
 

4389
01:26:44,820 --> 01:26:47,570
um in practice I don't think we actually
live in a society that rewards people

4390
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:47,580
live in a society that rewards people
 

4391
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,729
live in a society that rewards people
for hard work I think we reward people

4392
01:26:49,729 --> 01:26:49,739
for hard work I think we reward people
 

4393
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:52,910
for hard work I think we reward people
for a combination of accidents of birth

4394
01:26:52,910 --> 01:26:52,920
for a combination of accidents of birth
 

4395
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,450
for a combination of accidents of birth
plus hard work

4396
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:55,460
plus hard work
 

4397
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:59,030
plus hard work
let me push back because uh yes so I

4398
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
let me push back because uh yes so I
 

4399
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:01,250
let me push back because uh yes so I
agree with you but let me push back on

4400
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:01,260
agree with you but let me push back on
 

4401
01:27:01,260 --> 01:27:03,950
agree with you but let me push back on
on a subtle point because I like to draw

4402
01:27:03,950 --> 01:27:03,960
on a subtle point because I like to draw
 

4403
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:05,870
on a subtle point because I like to draw
the difference between hard work

4404
01:27:05,870 --> 01:27:05,880
the difference between hard work
 

4405
01:27:05,880 --> 01:27:09,050
the difference between hard work
and meritocracy because as a person who

4406
01:27:09,050 --> 01:27:09,060
and meritocracy because as a person who
 

4407
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,510
and meritocracy because as a person who
works really hard like I work crazy hard

4408
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:11,520
works really hard like I work crazy hard
 

4409
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:13,850
works really hard like I work crazy hard
but I've also worked with a lot of

4410
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:13,860
but I've also worked with a lot of
 

4411
01:27:13,860 --> 01:27:16,129
but I've also worked with a lot of
people they're just much better than me

4412
01:27:16,129 --> 01:27:16,139
people they're just much better than me
 

4413
01:27:16,139 --> 01:27:19,669
people they're just much better than me
it's a hard work does not equal skill

4414
01:27:19,669 --> 01:27:19,679
it's a hard work does not equal skill
 

4415
01:27:19,679 --> 01:27:22,550
it's a hard work does not equal skill
good productive I just want to kind of

4416
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
good productive I just want to kind of
 

4417
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,470
good productive I just want to kind of
draw that distinction but I agree with

4418
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
draw that distinction but I agree with
 

4419
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:25,189
draw that distinction but I agree with
you

4420
01:27:25,189 --> 01:27:25,199
you
 

4421
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:28,189
you
I don't think our society Rewards

4422
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:28,199
I don't think our society Rewards
 

4423
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:32,570
I don't think our society Rewards
uh directly hard work or even high skill

4424
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:32,580
uh directly hard work or even high skill
 

4425
01:27:32,580 --> 01:27:34,310
uh directly hard work or even high skill
there's many examples at least we can

4426
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
there's many examples at least we can
 

4427
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:37,070
there's many examples at least we can
see that it does not do so so we have an

4428
01:27:37,070 --> 01:27:37,080
see that it does not do so so we have an
 

4429
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:39,169
see that it does not do so so we have an
unequal distribution of talent of course

4430
01:27:39,169 --> 01:27:39,179
unequal distribution of talent of course
 

4431
01:27:39,179 --> 01:27:42,229
unequal distribution of talent of course
so if we lived in society in which there

4432
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
so if we lived in society in which there
 

4433
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:45,290
so if we lived in society in which there
was some level of acceptable inequality

4434
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:45,300
was some level of acceptable inequality
 

4435
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:46,610
was some level of acceptable inequality
and it's a normative kind of the

4436
01:27:46,610 --> 01:27:46,620
and it's a normative kind of the
 

4437
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,169
and it's a normative kind of the
question of how much we would say is

4438
01:27:48,169 --> 01:27:48,179
question of how much we would say is
 

4439
01:27:48,179 --> 01:27:50,390
question of how much we would say is
acceptable right

4440
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:50,400
acceptable right
 

4441
01:27:50,400 --> 01:27:52,910
acceptable right
um and that inequality was based on this

4442
01:27:52,910 --> 01:27:52,920
um and that inequality was based on this
 

4443
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,570
um and that inequality was based on this
unequal distribution of talent then I

4444
01:27:56,570 --> 01:27:56,580
unequal distribution of talent then I
 

4445
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:58,370
unequal distribution of talent then I
think that would be fine with me right

4446
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:58,380
think that would be fine with me right
 

4447
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,930
think that would be fine with me right
that would actually be a meritocracy

4448
01:27:59,930 --> 01:27:59,940
that would actually be a meritocracy
 

4449
01:27:59,940 --> 01:28:02,750
that would actually be a meritocracy
what I see in the U.S is often

4450
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:02,760
what I see in the U.S is often
 

4451
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:05,390
what I see in the U.S is often
okay so if you are a upper middle class

4452

radical forms of Socialism or on the
 

4611
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,610
radical forms of Socialism or on the
other hand to kind of roll back to you

4612
01:30:58,610 --> 01:30:58,620
other hand to kind of roll back to you
 

4613
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:00,530
other hand to kind of roll back to you
know more capitalist forms of of

4614
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:00,540
know more capitalist forms of of
 

4615
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,810
know more capitalist forms of of
government so I think that again you

4616
01:31:02,810 --> 01:31:02,820
government so I think that again you
 

4617
01:31:02,820 --> 01:31:04,610
government so I think that again you
can't try to make up a perfect system

4618
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:04,620
can't try to make up a perfect system
 

4619
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:08,390
can't try to make up a perfect system
and try to implement it you have to you

4620
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:08,400
and try to implement it you have to you
 

4621
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,510
and try to implement it you have to you
know do it as a process democratically

4622
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
know do it as a process democratically
 

4623
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,570
know do it as a process democratically
and and so on so just philosophically in

4624
01:31:14,570 --> 01:31:14,580
and and so on so just philosophically in
 

4625
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:15,649
and and so on so just philosophically in
your gut

4626
01:31:15,649 --> 01:31:15,659
your gut
 

4627
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:18,590
your gut
you're more concerned about the innate

4628
01:31:18,590 --> 01:31:18,600
you're more concerned about the innate
 

4629
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,189
you're more concerned about the innate
equal value of human beings versus the

4630
01:31:22,189 --> 01:31:22,199
equal value of human beings versus the
 

4631
01:31:22,199 --> 01:31:24,709
equal value of human beings versus the
efficiency of this wonderful mechanism

4632
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:24,719
efficiency of this wonderful mechanism
 

4633
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,689
efficiency of this wonderful mechanism
that we call human civilization are

4634
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:26,699
that we call human civilization are
 

4635
01:31:26,699 --> 01:31:28,070
that we call human civilization are
producing cool stuff

4636
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,080
producing cool stuff
 

4637
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:30,770
producing cool stuff
just like a gut if we were sitting at a

4638
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:30,780
just like a gut if we were sitting at a
 

4639
01:31:30,780 --> 01:31:33,709
just like a gut if we were sitting at a
bar that's where the gut feeling you

4640
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:33,719
bar that's where the gut feeling you
 

4641
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:35,689
bar that's where the gut feeling you
come with of course your mind is open

4642
01:31:35,689 --> 01:31:35,699
come with of course your mind is open
 

4643
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:38,209
come with of course your mind is open
but you you want to protect the equal

4644
01:31:38,209 --> 01:31:38,219
but you you want to protect the equal
 

4645
01:31:38,219 --> 01:31:40,850
but you you want to protect the equal
value of humans

4646
01:31:40,850 --> 01:31:40,860
value of humans
 

4647
01:31:40,860 --> 01:31:42,229
value of humans
so I don't want to fight the

4648
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:42,239
so I don't want to fight the
 

4649
01:31:42,239 --> 01:31:44,390
so I don't want to fight the
hypothetical so I'll say equality I am

4650
01:31:44,390 --> 01:31:44,400
hypothetical so I'll say equality I am
 

4651
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:46,550
hypothetical so I'll say equality I am
concerned with with equality but I don't

4652
01:31:46,550 --> 01:31:46,560
concerned with with equality but I don't
 

4653
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,830
concerned with with equality but I don't
think the two are necessarily always in

4654
01:31:48,830 --> 01:31:48,840
think the two are necessarily always in
 

4655
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:52,250
think the two are necessarily always in
tension but but also when you think

4656
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:52,260
tension but but also when you think
 

4657
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:53,689
tension but but also when you think
about all the great things that human

4658
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:53,699
about all the great things that human
 

4659
01:31:53,699 --> 01:31:56,530
about all the great things that human
beings have produced

4660
01:31:56,530 --> 01:31:56,540
beings have produced
 

4661
01:31:56,540 --> 01:31:59,750
beings have produced
often I think people today just look at

4662
01:31:59,750 --> 01:31:59,760
often I think people today just look at
 

4663
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,930
often I think people today just look at
the end outcome like we go to the

4664
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:02,940
the end outcome like we go to the
 

4665
01:32:02,940 --> 01:32:05,709
the end outcome like we go to the
pyramids and we'll Marvel at the

4666
01:32:05,709 --> 01:32:05,719
pyramids and we'll Marvel at the
 

4667
01:32:05,719 --> 01:32:08,030
pyramids and we'll Marvel at the
pyramids and and the human achievement

4668
01:32:08,030 --> 01:32:08,040
pyramids and and the human achievement
 

4669
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:09,830
pyramids and and the human achievement
that it took to make it happen but we

4670
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:09,840
that it took to make it happen but we
 

4671
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:12,110
that it took to make it happen but we
won't you know stop to think about all

4672
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:12,120
won't you know stop to think about all
 

4673
01:32:12,120 --> 01:32:14,270
won't you know stop to think about all
the suffering that went into the making

4674
01:32:14,270 --> 01:32:14,280
the suffering that went into the making
 

4675
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:17,030
the suffering that went into the making
of that thing so I think we kind of lean

4676
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
of that thing so I think we kind of lean
 

4677
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,010
of that thing so I think we kind of lean
in the opposite direction where we model

4678
01:32:19,010 --> 01:32:19,020
in the opposite direction where we model
 

4679
01:32:19,020 --> 01:32:20,990
in the opposite direction where we model
at our achievements but we don't often

4680
01:32:20,990 --> 01:32:21,000
at our achievements but we don't often
 

4681
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,450
at our achievements but we don't often
think about the suffering or

4682
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:23,460
think about the suffering or
 

4683
01:32:23,460 --> 01:32:24,830
think about the suffering or
exploitation that went into certain

4684
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:24,840
exploitation that went into certain
 

4685
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,270
exploitation that went into certain
human achievements I would love a

4686
01:32:26,270 --> 01:32:26,280
human achievements I would love a
 

4687
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,610
human achievements I would love a
society in which

4688
01:32:27,610 --> 01:32:27,620
society in which
 

4689
01:32:27,620 --> 01:32:32,209
society in which
we could Marvel at things and not have

4690
01:32:32,209 --> 01:32:32,219
we could Marvel at things and not have
 

4691
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:33,830
we could Marvel at things and not have
to worry about the exportation that was

4692
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
to worry about the exportation that was
 

4693
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:34,850
to worry about the exportation that was
involved because there was no

4694
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:34,860
involved because there was no
 

4695
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,709
involved because there was no
exploitation or oppression involved

4696
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
exploitation or oppression involved
 

4697
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,290
exploitation or oppression involved
there was just human Ingenuity and

4698
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:39,300
there was just human Ingenuity and
 

4699
01:32:39,300 --> 01:32:41,870
there was just human Ingenuity and
creativity and collaboration and to the

4700
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:41,880
creativity and collaboration and to the
 

4701
01:32:41,880 --> 01:32:43,850
creativity and collaboration and to the
degree which you may disagree to the

4702
01:32:43,850 --> 01:32:43,860
degree which you may disagree to the
 

4703
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,530
degree which you may disagree to the
degree there's a tension between the two

4704
01:32:45,530 --> 01:32:45,540
degree there's a tension between the two
 

4705
01:32:45,540 --> 01:32:47,689
degree there's a tension between the two
at least give equal way to the

4706
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:47,699
at least give equal way to the
 

4707
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:49,810
at least give equal way to the
consideration of the suffering

4708
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:49,820
consideration of the suffering
 

4709
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:52,490
consideration of the suffering
and don't just marvel at the beauty of

4710
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:52,500
and don't just marvel at the beauty of
 

4711
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,470
and don't just marvel at the beauty of
the Creations to the degree there is a

4712
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
the Creations to the degree there is a
 

4713
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,030
the Creations to the degree there is a
tension between them what what Stalin

4714
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:56,040
tension between them what what Stalin
 

4715
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:57,530
tension between them what what Stalin
did actually too it's not just capitals

4716
01:32:57,530 --> 01:32:57,540
did actually too it's not just capitals
 

4717
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:59,209
did actually too it's not just capitals
but what Stalin did was he sacrificed

4718
01:32:59,209 --> 01:32:59,219
but what Stalin did was he sacrificed
 

4719
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:01,189
but what Stalin did was he sacrificed
whole Generations because he thought

4720
01:33:01,189 --> 01:33:01,199
whole Generations because he thought
 

4721
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:03,110
whole Generations because he thought
that he was building something for the

4722
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
that he was building something for the
 

4723
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:05,330
that he was building something for the
future for future Russians to to enjoy

4724
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:05,340
future for future Russians to to enjoy
 

4725

4727
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:10,610
and for future people of the world to to
enjoy and actually that analogy that I

4728
01:33:10,610 --> 01:33:10,620
enjoy and actually that analogy that I
 

4729
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:13,370
enjoy and actually that analogy that I

which I think you mentioned in the
 

4749
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,129
which I think you mentioned in the
context of

4750
01:33:37,129 --> 01:33:37,139
context of
 

4751
01:33:37,139 --> 01:33:39,050
context of
a social democracy that freedom of

which I think is something that caught
 

4761
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,410
which I think is something that caught
my ear a little bit because if you think

4762
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:48,420
my ear a little bit because if you think
 

4763
01:33:48,420 --> 01:33:51,070
my ear a little bit because if you think
about the Soviet Union one of the ways

4764
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:51,080
about the Soviet Union one of the ways
 

4765
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:55,129
about the Soviet Union one of the ways
uh that the authoritarian regime was

4766
01:33:55,129 --> 01:33:55,139
uh that the authoritarian regime was
 

4767
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:56,870
uh that the authoritarian regime was

have to live through war and that is one
 

5259
01:43:17,159 --> 01:43:19,790
have to live through war and that is one
thing that as uh countries have gotten

5260
01:43:19,790 --> 01:43:19,800
thing that as uh countries have gotten
 

5261
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:21,830
thing that as uh countries have gotten
more developed

5262
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
more developed
 

5263
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,450
more developed
um as the world has changed we've

5264
01:43:23,450 --> 01:43:23,460
um as the world has changed we've
 

5265
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:25,430
um as the world has changed we've
actually seen less and less war like I

5266
01:43:25,430 --> 01:43:25,440

won't dispute Pinker on on this I think
 

5269
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:29,629
won't dispute Pinker on on this I think
it's true

5270
01:43:29,629 --> 01:43:29,639
it's true
 

5271
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:32,390
it's true
um obviously Putin's invasion of Ukraine

5272
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:32,400
um obviously Putin's invasion of Ukraine
 

5273

5275
01:43:34,739 --> 01:43:37,010
and you know the conflict in Ethiopia is
like kind of an exception but on the on

5276
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:37,020
like kind of an exception but on the on
 

5277
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:38,990
like kind of an exception but on the on
the whole I think we're we're going in

01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:39,000
the whole I think we're we're going in
 

5279
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,810
the whole I think we're we're going in
that in that uh Direction but I think

5280
01:43:41,810 --> 01:43:41,820
that in that uh Direction but I think
 

5281
01:43:41,820 --> 01:43:43,810
that in that uh Direction but I think
it's always been you know a major

5282
01:43:43,810 --> 01:43:43,820
it's always been you know a major
 

5283
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:46,250
it's always been you know a major
organizing plank of socialists uh

5284

against a war and against just kind of
 

5287
01:43:48,060 --> 01:43:49,729
against a war and against just kind of
this sense of

5288
01:43:49,729 --> 01:43:49,739
this sense of
 

5289
01:43:49,739 --> 01:43:51,830
this sense of
right-wing nationalism and national

5290
01:43:51,830 --> 01:43:51,840
right-wing nationalism and national
 

5291
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,129
right-wing nationalism and national
identity that often leads to war and

5292
01:43:55,129 --> 01:43:55,139
identity that often leads to war and
 

5293
01:43:55,139 --> 01:43:56,570
identity that often leads to war and
obviously not everyone on the right has

5294
01:43:56,570 --> 01:43:56,580
obviously not everyone on the right has
 

5295
01:43:56,580 --> 01:43:58,310
obviously not everyone on the right has
embraced that a lot of Libertarians are

5296
01:43:58,310 --> 01:43:58,320
embraced that a lot of Libertarians are
 

5297
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:01,669
embraced that a lot of Libertarians are
consistently anti-war as well but I

5298
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:01,679
consistently anti-war as well but I
 

5299
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,609
consistently anti-war as well but I
think the right ideologically has been

5300
01:44:04,609 --> 01:44:04,619
think the right ideologically has been
 

5301
01:44:04,619 --> 01:44:06,290
think the right ideologically has been
associated with war even if some

5302
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:06,300
associated with war even if some

then there's the military industrial

5306
01:44:10,729 --> 01:44:10,739
then there's the military industrial
 

5307
01:44:10,739 --> 01:44:12,649
then there's the military industrial
complex which is the financial machine

5308
01:44:12,649 --> 01:44:12,659
complex which is the financial machine
 

5309
01:44:12,659 --> 01:44:16,609
complex which is the financial machine
of the whole thing I I presume

5310
01:44:16,609 --> 01:44:16,619
of the whole thing I I presume
 

5311
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:19,430
of the whole thing I I presume
well well since a lot of that is

5312
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,440
well well since a lot of that is
 

5313
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,350
well well since a lot of that is
government what's the relationship to

5314
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
government what's the relationship to
 

5315
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,990
government what's the relationship to
socialism and the military-industrial

complex
 

5319
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:27,229
complex
well a lot of it's government contracts

5320
01:44:27,229 --> 01:44:27,239
well a lot of it's government contracts
 

5321
01:44:27,239 --> 01:44:28,850
well a lot of it's government contracts
but it's privately produced right by

01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:28,860
but it's privately produced right by
 

5323
01:44:28,860 --> 01:44:31,010

01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:31,020
companies like Lockheed Martin and
 

5325
01:44:31,020 --> 01:44:32,390
companies like Lockheed Martin and
things like that

5326
01:44:32,390 --> 01:44:32,400
things like that
 

5327
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:34,370
things like that
um you could draw a very crude

5328
01:44:34,370 --> 01:44:34,380
um you could draw a very crude
 

5329
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:36,169
um you could draw a very crude
materialist connection between any of

materialist connection between any of
 

5331
01:44:36,179 --> 01:44:38,149
materialist connection between any of
these things and to kind of prove an

5332
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
these things and to kind of prove an
 

5333
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:40,729
these things and to kind of prove an
ideological point but we could produce

5334
01:44:40,729 --> 01:44:40,739
ideological point but we could produce
 

5335
01:44:40,739 --> 01:44:42,410
ideological point but we could produce
just as many arms and then just bury

5336
01:44:42,410 --> 01:44:42,420
just as many arms and then just bury
 

5337
01:44:42,420 --> 01:44:44,510
just as many arms and then just bury
them or never fire them off or whatever

5338
01:44:44,510 --> 01:44:44,520
them or never fire them off or whatever
 

5339
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:47,090
them or never fire them off or whatever
whatever else obviously there are

5340
01:44:47,090 --> 01:44:47,100
whatever else obviously there are
 

5341
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:50,450
whatever else obviously there are
companies that have a vested interest in

01:44:50,450 --> 01:44:50,460
companies that have a vested interest in
 

5343
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:53,689

um heightening up tensions or saying
 

5345
01:44:53,699 --> 01:44:55,250
um heightening up tensions or saying
that we need to buy a new weapon system

5346
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:55,260
that we need to buy a new weapon system
 

5347
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:57,050
that we need to buy a new weapon system
to be prepared for a conventional war

5348
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:57,060
to be prepared for a conventional war
 

5349
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:59,870
to be prepared for a conventional war
with China Russia uh meanwhile I think

5350
01:44:59,870 --> 01:44:59,880
with China Russia uh meanwhile I think
 

5351
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:01,370
with China Russia uh meanwhile I think
we all know that if there's going to be

5352
01:45:01,370 --> 01:45:01,380
we all know that if there's going to be
 

5353
01:45:01,380 --> 01:45:02,750
we all know that if there's going to be
conventional war between these countries

5354
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:02,760
conventional war between these countries
 

5355
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,189
conventional war between these countries
like it's gonna

5356
01:45:04,189 --> 01:45:04,199
like it's gonna
 

5357
01:45:04,199 --> 01:45:06,350
like it's gonna
you know it's going to lead to something

5358
01:45:06,350 --> 01:45:06,360
you know it's going to lead to something
 

5359
01:45:06,360 --> 01:45:08,090
you know it's going to lead to something
worse

5360
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:08,100
worse
 

5361
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:10,850
worse
um and and you know no amount of

5362
01:45:10,850 --> 01:45:10,860
um and and you know no amount of
 

5363
01:45:10,860 --> 01:45:12,590
um and and you know no amount of
advanced fighter jets is going to make a

5364
01:45:12,590 --> 01:45:12,600
advanced fighter jets is going to make a

make a difference
 

5367
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:18,350
make a difference
um but I try to avoid crude or causal

5368
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:18,360
um but I try to avoid crude or causal
 

5369
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:20,450
um but I try to avoid crude or causal
connections even though there are

5370
01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:20,460
connections even though there are
 

5371

years but in the long run people will
 

5483
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:33,950
years but in the long run people will
say the same about nation states and

5521
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:22,250
is only now beginning before we're in
prehistory yeah but in the future like

5522
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:22,260
prehistory yeah but in the future like
 

5523

posterity will will remember and I think
that it will be easier to sign

5534
01:48:37,129 --> 01:48:37,139
that it will be easier to sign
 

5535
01:48:37,139 --> 01:48:39,649
that it will be easier to sign
um you know certain people the role of

5543
01:48:46,380 --> 01:48:48,470
contentious topic off topic of Ukraine
or whatever else but the idea that you

5544
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
or whatever else but the idea that you
 

5545
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,810
or whatever else but the idea that you
know one government or man would launch

5546
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:50,820
know one government or man would launch
 

5547
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:54,350
know one government or man would launch
a you know more to recover you know um

5548
01:48:54,350 --> 01:48:54,360
a you know more to recover you know um
 

5549
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:56,930
a you know more to recover you know um
or to take you you know several hundred

5550
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:56,940
or to take you you know several hundred
 

5551
01:48:56,940 --> 01:48:59,450
or to take you you know several hundred
square miles of territory and tens of

5552
01:48:59,450 --> 01:48:59,460
square miles of territory and tens of
 

5553
01:48:59,460 --> 01:49:01,010
square miles of territory and tens of
thousands of people die I think seems

5554
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:01,020
thousands of people die I think seems
 

5555
01:49:01,020 --> 01:49:03,169
thousands of people die I think seems
absurd to us many people today luckily

5556
01:49:03,169 --> 01:49:03,179
absurd to us many people today luckily
 

5557
01:49:03,179 --> 01:49:05,930
absurd to us many people today luckily
but it would not have seemed absurd 50

5558
01:49:05,930 --> 01:49:05,940
but it would not have seemed absurd 50
 

5559
01:49:05,940 --> 01:49:07,370
but it would not have seemed absurd 50
60 years ago it would have just been a

01:49:07,370 --> 01:49:07,380
60 years ago it would have just been a
 

5561
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:08,629
60 years ago it would have just been a
normal thing right this kind of

5562
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
normal thing right this kind of
 

5563

01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:10,260
territorial disputes and so on and I
 

5565
01:49:10,260 --> 01:49:11,450
territorial disputes and so on and I
think you know projecting in the future

5566
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:11,460
think you know projecting in the future
 

5567
01:49:11,460 --> 01:49:13,609
think you know projecting in the future
I think within our lifetimes we'll live

5568
01:49:13,609 --> 01:49:13,619
I think within our lifetimes we'll live
 

5569
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,050
I think within our lifetimes we'll live
to see

um that kind of conflict be uh
 

5573
01:49:17,719 --> 01:49:20,629
um that kind of conflict be uh
eradicated and in part you could say

5574
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
eradicated and in part you could say
 

5575
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:21,530
eradicated and in part you could say
that

5576
01:49:21,530 --> 01:49:21,540
that
 

5577
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:23,810
that
like why I think it's because of popular

01:49:25,550 --> 01:49:25,560
pressure and organization so you could
 

5581
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,590
pressure and organization so you could
say kind of the pro worker socialist

5582

5585
01:49:29,580 --> 01:49:31,669
organizing part of it making it less
normal if you're a capitalist you could

5586
01:49:31,669 --> 01:49:31,679
normal if you're a capitalist you could
 

5587
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:34,370
normal if you're a capitalist you could
say well markets are more interlinked so

5588
01:49:34,370 --> 01:49:34,380

01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:09,290
primitive communism
imperialism maybe slave Society

5718
01:52:09,290 --> 01:52:09,300
imperialism maybe slave Society
 

5719
01:52:09,300 --> 01:52:11,149
imperialism maybe slave Society
feudalism

5720
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:11,159
feudalism
 

5721
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:14,209
feudalism
uh defined by mercantilism

5722
01:52:14,209 --> 01:52:14,219
uh defined by mercantilism
 

5723
01:52:14,219 --> 01:52:17,930
uh defined by mercantilism
and then capitalism and socialism and

5724
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:17,940
and then capitalism and socialism and
 

5725
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:21,709
and then capitalism and socialism and
finally uh stateless communism communism

5726
01:52:21,709 --> 01:52:21,719
finally uh stateless communism communism
 

5727
01:52:21,719 --> 01:52:24,350
finally uh stateless communism communism
is am I there I miss something there I

5728
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:24,360
is am I there I miss something there I
 

5729
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,370
is am I there I miss something there I
mean I think that was that was close

5730
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:25,380
mean I think that was that was close
 

5731
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,890
mean I think that was that was close
enough I mean I think that's definitely

5732
01:52:26,890 --> 01:52:26,900
enough I mean I think that's definitely
 

5733
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:31,129
enough I mean I think that's definitely
uh true of of Marxist theory that the

5734
01:52:31,129 --> 01:52:31,139
uh true of of Marxist theory that the
 

5735
01:52:31,139 --> 01:52:33,410
uh true of of Marxist theory that the
contradictions of capitalism

5736
01:52:33,410 --> 01:52:33,420
contradictions of capitalism
 

5737
01:52:33,420 --> 01:52:35,950
contradictions of capitalism
the fact that it has brought together

5738
01:52:35,950 --> 01:52:35,960
the fact that it has brought together
 

5739
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:40,490
the fact that it has brought together
all these workers uh all these materials

5740
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:40,500
all these workers uh all these materials
 

5741
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,590
all these workers uh all these materials
and whatever else and it's now allowing

5742
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:42,600
and whatever else and it's now allowing
 

5743
01:52:42,600 --> 01:52:44,330
and whatever else and it's now allowing
it to socially create wealth on a mass

5744
01:52:44,330 --> 01:52:44,340
it to socially create wealth on a mass
 

5745
01:52:44,340 --> 01:52:45,530
it to socially create wealth on a mass
scale

5746
01:52:45,530 --> 01:52:45,540
scale
 

5747
01:52:45,540 --> 01:52:48,890
scale
but that wealth is that process is being

5748
01:52:48,890 --> 01:52:48,900
but that wealth is that process is being
 

5749
01:52:48,900 --> 01:52:52,310
but that wealth is that process is being
privately uh directed and also the

5750
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:52,320
privately uh directed and also the
 

5751
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:54,709
privately uh directed and also the
Surplus is being privately kind of

5752
01:52:54,709 --> 01:52:54,719
Surplus is being privately kind of
 

5753
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:55,970
Surplus is being privately kind of
appropriated

5754
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:55,980
appropriated
 

5755
01:52:55,980 --> 01:52:57,830
appropriated
um is a contradiction and that would

5756
01:52:57,830 --> 01:52:57,840
um is a contradiction and that would
 

5757
01:52:57,840 --> 01:53:00,169
um is a contradiction and that would
lead to uh some sort of rebellion or

5758
01:53:00,169 --> 01:53:00,179
lead to uh some sort of rebellion or
 

5759
01:53:00,179 --> 01:53:02,510
lead to uh some sort of rebellion or
revolution or change and we'll have and

5760
01:53:02,510 --> 01:53:02,520
revolution or change and we'll have and
 

5761
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:04,310
revolution or change and we'll have and
eventually this contradiction would be

5762
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:04,320
eventually this contradiction would be
 

5763
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:05,810
eventually this contradiction would be
ephetter on production too so we would

5764
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:05,820
ephetter on production too so we would
 

5765
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:08,629
ephetter on production too so we would
have to move uh into socialist uh

5766
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:08,639
have to move uh into socialist uh
 

5767
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,850
have to move uh into socialist uh
Society but actually just to backtrack

5768
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:10,860
Society but actually just to backtrack
 

5769
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:13,250
Society but actually just to backtrack
so in terms of contradiction so it

5770
01:53:13,250 --> 01:53:13,260
so in terms of contradiction so it
 

5771
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:15,129
so in terms of contradiction so it
starts when we're in a village

5772
01:53:15,129 --> 01:53:15,139
starts when we're in a village
 

5773
01:53:15,139 --> 01:53:17,270
starts when we're in a village
hunter-gatherers that's what you call

5774
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
hunter-gatherers that's what you call
 

5775
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:19,010
hunter-gatherers that's what you call
primitive communism where everyone's

5776
01:53:19,010 --> 01:53:19,020
primitive communism where everyone's
 

5777
01:53:19,020 --> 01:53:21,470
primitive communism where everyone's
kind of equal it's kind of a collective

5778
01:53:21,470 --> 01:53:21,480
kind of equal it's kind of a collective
 

5779
01:53:21,480 --> 01:53:23,810
kind of equal it's kind of a collective
right all right maybe you could just

5780
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:23,820
right all right maybe you could just
 

5781
01:53:23,820 --> 01:53:25,669
right all right maybe you could just
just let me hold on a second and then

5782
01:53:25,669 --> 01:53:25,679
just let me hold on a second and then
 

5783
01:53:25,679 --> 01:53:27,590
just let me hold on a second and then
inequalities form of different flavors

5784
01:53:27,590 --> 01:53:27,600
inequalities form of different flavors
 

5785
01:53:27,600 --> 01:53:30,050
inequalities form of different flavors
so that's what imperialism is is one

5786
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:30,060
so that's what imperialism is is one
 

5787
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:31,850
so that's what imperialism is is one
dude Rises to the top and has some

5788
01:53:31,850 --> 01:53:31,860
dude Rises to the top and has some
 

5789
01:53:31,860 --> 01:53:34,609
dude Rises to the top and has some
control of different flavor that's what

5790
01:53:34,609 --> 01:53:34,619
control of different flavor that's what
 

5791
01:53:34,619 --> 01:53:36,649
control of different flavor that's what
feudalism with when you have one dude at

5792
01:53:36,649 --> 01:53:36,659
feudalism with when you have one dude at
 

5793
01:53:36,659 --> 01:53:39,590
feudalism with when you have one dude at
the top and you have Merchants doing

5794
01:53:39,590 --> 01:53:39,600
the top and you have Merchants doing
 

5795
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:41,629
the top and you have Merchants doing
some trading and so on and then that

5796
01:53:41,629 --> 01:53:41,639
some trading and so on and then that
 

5797
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:43,609
some trading and so on and then that
leads to capitalism we have private

5798
01:53:43,609 --> 01:53:43,619
leads to capitalism we have private
 

5799
01:53:43,619 --> 01:53:46,189
leads to capitalism we have private
ownership of companies and they do some

5800
01:53:46,189 --> 01:53:46,199
ownership of companies and they do some
 

5801
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:48,169
ownership of companies and they do some
they they result in some kind of class

5802
01:53:48,169 --> 01:53:48,179
they they result in some kind of class
 

5803
01:53:48,179 --> 01:53:50,629
they they result in some kind of class
inequality and eventually

5804
01:53:50,629 --> 01:53:50,639
inequality and eventually
 

5805
01:53:50,639 --> 01:53:54,169
inequality and eventually
that results in a revolution that says

5806
01:53:54,169 --> 01:53:54,179
that results in a revolution that says
 

5807
01:53:54,179 --> 01:53:56,750
that results in a revolution that says
no that's this inequality is not okay

5808
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:56,760
no that's this inequality is not okay
 

5809
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,490
no that's this inequality is not okay
it's not natural it doesn't respect the

5810
01:53:58,490 --> 01:53:58,500
it's not natural it doesn't respect the
 

5811
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,870
it's not natural it doesn't respect the
value of human beings and therefore it

5812
01:53:59,870 --> 01:53:59,880
value of human beings and therefore it
 

5813
01:53:59,880 --> 01:54:03,050
value of human beings and therefore it
goes to socialism where there is

5814
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:03,060
goes to socialism where there is
 

5815
01:54:03,060 --> 01:54:05,209
goes to socialism where there is
under Marx's View

5816
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:05,219
under Marx's View
 

5817
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:08,030
under Marx's View
I guess some role for the state

5818
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:08,040
I guess some role for the state
 

5819
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,890
I guess some role for the state
the state is doing some redistribution

5820
01:54:09,890 --> 01:54:09,900
the state is doing some redistribution
 

5821
01:54:09,900 --> 01:54:13,330
the state is doing some redistribution
and then the pure communism at the end

5822
01:54:13,330 --> 01:54:13,340
and then the pure communism at the end
 

5823
01:54:13,340 --> 01:54:19,189
and then the pure communism at the end
is when it's uh uh you know like it's a

5824
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
is when it's uh uh you know like it's a
 

5825
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,629
is when it's uh uh you know like it's a
collective where there's no State

5826
01:54:20,629 --> 01:54:20,639
collective where there's no State
 

5827
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:22,310
collective where there's no State
centralized power

5828
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:22,320
centralized power
 

5829
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:24,830
centralized power
so is this what's part of that is wrong

5830
01:54:24,830 --> 01:54:24,840
so is this what's part of that is wrong
 

5831
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:27,410
so is this what's part of that is wrong
no I think and broadly the Marxist

5832
01:54:27,410 --> 01:54:27,420
no I think and broadly the Marxist
 

5833
01:54:27,420 --> 01:54:30,229
no I think and broadly the Marxist
theory of History

5834
01:54:30,229 --> 01:54:30,239
theory of History
 

5835
01:54:30,239 --> 01:54:33,530
theory of History
is about different types different modes

5836
01:54:33,530 --> 01:54:33,540
is about different types different modes
 

5837
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:37,189
is about different types different modes
of of production that existed various

5838
01:54:37,189 --> 01:54:37,199
of of production that existed various
 

5839
01:54:37,199 --> 01:54:39,410
of of production that existed various
times

5840
01:54:39,410 --> 01:54:39,420
times
 

5841
01:54:39,420 --> 01:54:41,390
times
um based on material

5842
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:41,400
um based on material
 

5843
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,270
um based on material
um conditions so in the early times in

5844
01:54:44,270 --> 01:54:44,280
um conditions so in the early times in
 

5845
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:46,669
um conditions so in the early times in
this this Theory

5846
01:54:46,669 --> 01:54:46,679
this this Theory
 

5847
01:54:46,679 --> 01:54:48,109
this this Theory
um there was not much Surplus being

5848
01:54:48,109 --> 01:54:48,119
um there was not much Surplus being
 

5849
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:49,850
um there was not much Surplus being
generated right and there was generally

5850
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:49,860
generated right and there was generally
 

5851
01:54:49,860 --> 01:54:51,890
generated right and there was generally
egalitarian societies

5852
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:51,900
egalitarian societies
 

5853
01:54:51,900 --> 01:54:53,810
egalitarian societies
and then

5854
01:54:53,810 --> 01:54:53,820
and then
 

5855
01:54:53,820 --> 01:54:56,990
and then
um as we became agricultural as Society

5856
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:57,000
um as we became agricultural as Society
 

5857
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,209
um as we became agricultural as Society
developed there was more Surplus being

5858
01:54:59,209 --> 01:54:59,219
developed there was more Surplus being
 

5859
01:54:59,219 --> 01:55:00,410
developed there was more Surplus being
produced

5860
01:55:00,410 --> 01:55:00,420
produced
 

5861
01:55:00,420 --> 01:55:02,750
produced
then there was a group of people the

5862
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:02,760
then there was a group of people the
 

5863
01:55:02,760 --> 01:55:06,229
then there was a group of people the
ruling classes of their their age that

5864
01:55:06,229 --> 01:55:06,239
ruling classes of their their age that
 

5865
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:08,930
ruling classes of their their age that
controlled and distributed that

5866
01:55:08,930 --> 01:55:08,940
controlled and distributed that
 

5867
01:55:08,940 --> 01:55:11,030
controlled and distributed that
that controlled that division of labor

5868
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,040
that controlled that division of labor
 

5869
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,189
that controlled that division of labor
and appropriated more of that Surplus

5870
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
and appropriated more of that Surplus
 

5871
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,930
and appropriated more of that Surplus
for themselves and they weren't involved

5872
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:14,940
for themselves and they weren't involved
 

5873
01:55:14,940 --> 01:55:17,390
for themselves and they weren't involved
in productive labor in early print of

5874
01:55:17,390 --> 01:55:17,400
in productive labor in early print of
 

5875
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:18,709
in productive labor in early print of
society everybody's involved in

5876
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:18,719
society everybody's involved in
 

5877
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,890
society everybody's involved in
productive labor later on you had casts

5878
01:55:21,890 --> 01:55:21,900
productive labor later on you had casts
 

5879
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,990
productive labor later on you had casts
of priests who did nothing but kind of

5880
01:55:23,990 --> 01:55:24,000
of priests who did nothing but kind of
 

5881
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,149
of priests who did nothing but kind of
pray and write and and kind of lecture

5882
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:26,159
pray and write and and kind of lecture
 

5883
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:28,729
pray and write and and kind of lecture
people all day right and you had

5884
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:28,739
people all day right and you had
 

5885
01:55:28,739 --> 01:55:31,070
people all day right and you had
um Kings and rulers and bureaucrats and

5886
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:31,080
um Kings and rulers and bureaucrats and
 

5887
01:55:31,080 --> 01:55:32,629
um Kings and rulers and bureaucrats and
traitors and so on you have a more

5888
01:55:32,629 --> 01:55:32,639
traitors and so on you have a more
 

5889
01:55:32,639 --> 01:55:34,910
traitors and so on you have a more
complex division of labor but also more

5890
01:55:34,910 --> 01:55:34,920
complex division of labor but also more
 

5891
01:55:34,920 --> 01:55:36,410
complex division of labor but also more
inequity

5892
01:55:36,410 --> 01:55:36,420
inequity
 

5893
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:39,530
inequity
um driving out of that

5894
01:55:39,530 --> 01:55:39,540
um driving out of that
 

5895
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:40,250
um driving out of that
um

5896
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:40,260
um
 

5897
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:42,550
um
capitalism was a revolutionary system

5898
01:55:42,550 --> 01:55:42,560
capitalism was a revolutionary system
 

5899
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,709
capitalism was a revolutionary system
because it took away one it made us

5900
01:55:45,709 --> 01:55:45,719
because it took away one it made us
 

5901
01:55:45,719 --> 01:55:47,930
because it took away one it made us
tremendously more productive right it

5902
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:47,940
tremendously more productive right it
 

5903
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:50,090
tremendously more productive right it
expanded production beyond our wildest

5904
01:55:50,090 --> 01:55:50,100
expanded production beyond our wildest
 

5905
01:55:50,100 --> 01:55:53,590
expanded production beyond our wildest
imaginations but it also no longer bound

5906
01:55:53,590 --> 01:55:53,600
imaginations but it also no longer bound
 

5907
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:57,229

uh workers to their lord or manner or

5908
01:55:57,229 --> 01:55:57,239
uh workers to their lord or manner or
 

5909
01:55:57,239 --> 01:55:59,510
uh workers to their lord or manner or
whatever else they were now free to move

5910
01:55:59,510 --> 01:55:59,520
whatever else they were now free to move
 

5911
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:01,430
whatever else they were now free to move
free to engage in contracts with

01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:01,440
free to engage in contracts with
 

5913
01:56:01,440 --> 01:56:05,270
free to engage in contracts with
employers and and and so on

5914
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:05,280
employers and and and so on
 

5915
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,250
employers and and and so on
um but even though workers are now

5916
01:56:07,250 --> 01:56:07,260
um but even though workers are now
 

5917
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:09,410
um but even though workers are now
producing all this tremendous wealth and

5918
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:09,420
producing all this tremendous wealth and
 

5919
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,149
producing all this tremendous wealth and
even though productive forces had been

5920
01:56:11,149 --> 01:56:11,159
even though productive forces had been
 

5921
01:56:11,159 --> 01:56:12,729
even though productive forces had been
matured in such a way

5922
01:56:12,729 --> 01:56:12,739
matured in such a way
 

5923
01:56:12,739 --> 01:56:17,930
matured in such a way
they were ultimately taken away from all

5924
01:56:17,930 --> 01:56:17,940
they were ultimately taken away from all
 

5925
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:19,250
they were ultimately taken away from all
the wealth they were created they got

5926
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:19,260
the wealth they were created they got
 

5927
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:20,990
the wealth they were created they got
some of it back they were in wealthy

5928
01:56:20,990 --> 01:56:21,000
some of it back they were in wealthy
 

5929
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,330
some of it back they were in wealthy
societies but they were all there

5930
01:56:23,330 --> 01:56:23,340
societies but they were all there
 

5931
01:56:23,340 --> 01:56:24,770
societies but they were all there
collectively together producing this

5932
01:56:24,770 --> 01:56:24,780
collectively together producing this
 

5933
01:56:24,780 --> 01:56:28,310
collectively together producing this
well and that was a potent Force so Marx

5934
01:56:28,310 --> 01:56:28,320
well and that was a potent Force so Marx
 

5935
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:30,470
well and that was a potent Force so Marx
theorized that would lead to a

5936
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
theorized that would lead to a
 

5937
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:32,810
theorized that would lead to a
revolution or change in a in a socialist

01:56:32,810 --> 01:56:32,820
revolution or change in a in a socialist
 

5939
01:56:32,820 --> 01:56:35,390
revolution or change in a in a socialist
Direction I think in fact what we saw

5940
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,400
Direction I think in fact what we saw
 

5941
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,450
Direction I think in fact what we saw
was that

5942
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:37,460
was that
 

5943
01:56:37,460 --> 01:56:40,609
was that
yes workers are dependent on

5944
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:40,619
yes workers are dependent on
 

5945
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,729
yes workers are dependent on
on capitalists are depend on workers

5946
01:56:43,729 --> 01:56:43,739
on capitalists are depend on workers
 

5947
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:47,030
on capitalists are depend on workers
but the dependency is

5948
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:47,040
but the dependency is
 

5949
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:47,570
but the dependency is
um

5950
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:47,580
um
 

5951
01:56:47,580 --> 01:56:49,370
um
obviously symmetrical in the sense that

5952
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:49,380
obviously symmetrical in the sense that
 

5953
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:50,750
obviously symmetrical in the sense that
workers are also dependent on

5954
01:56:50,750 --> 01:56:50,760
workers are also dependent on
 

5955
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:51,890
workers are also dependent on
capitalists but in fact it's an

5956
01:56:51,890 --> 01:56:51,900
capitalists but in fact it's an
 

5957
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,750
capitalists but in fact it's an
asymmetrical dependency and that

5958
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:53,760
asymmetrical dependency and that
 

5959
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,570
asymmetrical dependency and that
ordinary workers need their jobs more

5960
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:56,580
ordinary workers need their jobs more
 

5961
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:59,030
ordinary workers need their jobs more
than capitalists need the contribution

5962
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,040
than capitalists need the contribution
 

5963
01:56:59,040 --> 01:57:02,330
than capitalists need the contribution
of individual workers

5964
01:57:02,330 --> 01:57:02,340
of individual workers
 

5965
01:57:02,340 --> 01:57:04,189
of individual workers
so it became kind of a collective action

5966
01:57:04,189 --> 01:57:04,199
so it became kind of a collective action
 

5967
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:05,450
so it became kind of a collective action
problem

5968
01:57:05,450 --> 01:57:05,460
problem
 

5969
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:08,090
problem
where you would need the massive workers

5970
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,100
where you would need the massive workers
 

5971
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,709
where you would need the massive workers
to get together decide to change things

5972
01:57:09,709 --> 01:57:09,719
to get together decide to change things
 

5973
01:57:09,719 --> 01:57:11,570
to get together decide to change things
but also people be afraid because they'd

5974
01:57:11,570 --> 01:57:11,580
but also people be afraid because they'd
 

5975
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:13,010
but also people be afraid because they'd
be dependent on their jobs for their

01:57:13,010 --> 01:57:13,020
be dependent on their jobs for their
 

5977
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:15,530
be dependent on their jobs for their
livelihood and so on so Revolution

5978
01:57:15,530 --> 01:57:15,540
livelihood and so on so Revolution
 

5979
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:18,410
livelihood and so on so Revolution
became a lot harder than people thought

5980
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:18,420
became a lot harder than people thought
 

5981
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:21,649
became a lot harder than people thought
especially in Democratic countries where

5982
01:57:21,649 --> 01:57:21,659
especially in Democratic countries where
 

5983
01:57:21,659 --> 01:57:23,810
especially in Democratic countries where
workers had certain outlets and certain

know it's no surprise that where you did
 

5989
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,390
know it's no surprise that where you did
have socialist revolutions they were in

5990
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:29,400
have socialist revolutions they were in
 

5991
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:30,830
have socialist revolutions they were in
places like

5992
01:57:30,830 --> 01:57:30,840
places like
 

5993
01:57:30,840 --> 01:57:33,169
places like
um the third world postcolonial colonial

5994
01:57:33,169 --> 01:57:33,179
um the third world postcolonial colonial

like uh GA Cohen and others
 

6013
01:57:56,159 --> 01:57:59,089
like uh GA Cohen and others
um there is a certain inevitability to

um there is a certain inevitability to
 

6015
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:02,390
um there is a certain inevitability to
socialism after capitalism the way that

socialism after capitalism the way that

I would put it myself is I kind of have

6018
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
I would put it myself is I kind of have
 

6019
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,430
I would put it myself is I kind of have
a more I guess you could say like

6020
01:58:07,430 --> 01:58:07,440
a more I guess you could say like
 

6021
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:08,810
a more I guess you could say like
kantian view of it like I think

6022
01:58:08,810 --> 01:58:08,820
kantian view of it like I think
 

6023
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:11,089
kantian view of it like I think
socialism is something that ought to

6024
01:58:11,089 --> 01:58:11,099
socialism is something that ought to
 

6025
01:58:11,099 --> 01:58:11,930
socialism is something that ought to
happen

6026
01:58:11,930 --> 01:58:11,940
happen
 

6027
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:14,990
happen
but it's not something that necessarily

6028
01:58:14,990 --> 01:58:15,000
but it's not something that necessarily
 

6029
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:19,310
but it's not something that necessarily
will happen and we'll need to organize

6030
01:58:19,310 --> 01:58:19,320
will happen and we'll need to organize
 

6031
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:22,990
will happen and we'll need to organize
and persuade and also potentially again

6032
01:58:22,990 --> 01:58:23,000
and persuade and also potentially again
 

6033
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:26,030
and persuade and also potentially again
the key part of any social system that's

6034
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:26,040
the key part of any social system that's
 

6035
01:58:26,040 --> 01:58:29,570
the key part of any social system that's
Democratic is you have to allow for the

6036
01:58:29,570 --> 01:58:29,580
Democratic is you have to allow for the
 

6037
01:58:29,580 --> 01:58:32,330
Democratic is you have to allow for the
possibility of a democratic revision to

6038
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:32,340
possibility of a democratic revision to
 

6039
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:34,609
possibility of a democratic revision to

02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:28,310
underestimated it's easy to see the
contradictions in the system but can you

6192
02:01:28,310 --> 02:01:28,320
contradictions in the system but can you
 

6193
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,010
contradictions in the system but can you
see its mechanisms of stability

6194
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:31,020
see its mechanisms of stability
 

6195
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:32,330
see its mechanisms of stability
um the way in which

um the way in which
um Mass Collective action or revolution

6198
02:01:34,490 --> 02:01:34,500
um Mass Collective action or revolution
 

6199
02:01:34,500 --> 02:01:36,709
um Mass Collective action or revolution
is more of the exception or the the norm

6200
02:01:36,709 --> 02:01:36,719
is more of the exception or the the norm
 

6201
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:39,410
is more of the exception or the the norm
could you imagine if your marks not only

6202
02:01:39,410 --> 02:01:39,420
could you imagine if your marks not only
 

6203
02:01:39,420 --> 02:01:41,089
could you imagine if your marks not only
how much wealth the system would produce

6204
02:01:41,089 --> 02:01:41,099
how much wealth the system would produce
 

6205
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:43,310
how much wealth the system would produce
over time uh which I think he could have

6206
02:01:43,310 --> 02:01:43,320
over time uh which I think he could have
 

6207
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:46,070
over time uh which I think he could have
imagined but also developments like the

6208
02:01:46,070 --> 02:01:46,080
imagined but also developments like the
 

6209
02:01:46,080 --> 02:01:48,290
imagined but also developments like the
welfare state and mass democracy and

6210
02:01:48,290 --> 02:01:48,300
welfare state and mass democracy and
 

6211
02:01:48,300 --> 02:01:50,390
welfare state and mass democracy and
universal suffrage which might have

6212
02:01:50,390 --> 02:01:50,400
universal suffrage which might have
 

6213
02:01:50,400 --> 02:01:53,330
universal suffrage which might have
changed how workers um relate to the

6214
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:53,340
changed how workers um relate to the
 

6215
02:01:53,340 --> 02:01:55,129
changed how workers um relate to the
system or operate

6216
02:01:55,129 --> 02:01:55,139
system or operate
 

6217
02:01:55,139 --> 02:01:56,930
system or operate
um within it so I think it's just it's

6218
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:56,940
um within it so I think it's just it's
 

6219
02:01:56,940 --> 02:01:59,089
um within it so I think it's just it's
just the transition part that I think

6220
02:01:59,089 --> 02:01:59,099
just the transition part that I think
 

6221
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:01,430
just the transition part that I think
wasn't spelled out properly but I think

6222
02:02:01,430 --> 02:02:01,440
wasn't spelled out properly but I think
 

6223
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:02,810
wasn't spelled out properly but I think
in either case

6224
02:02:02,810 --> 02:02:02,820
in either case
 

6225
02:02:02,820 --> 02:02:06,530
in either case
as socialists we can assume that history

6226
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:06,540
as socialists we can assume that history
 

6227
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:08,689
as socialists we can assume that history
is working in our favor we just need to

6228
02:02:08,689 --> 02:02:08,699
is working in our favor we just need to
 

6229
02:02:08,699 --> 02:02:10,790
is working in our favor we just need to
kind of hold out and wait for the

6230
02:02:10,790 --> 02:02:10,800
kind of hold out and wait for the
 

6231
02:02:10,800 --> 02:02:13,729
kind of hold out and wait for the
inevitable uh Revolution we have to

6232
02:02:13,729 --> 02:02:13,739
inevitable uh Revolution we have to
 

6233
02:02:13,739 --> 02:02:16,609
inevitable uh Revolution we have to
convince people of both one the struggle

6234
02:02:16,609 --> 02:02:16,619
convince people of both one the struggle
 

6235
02:02:16,619 --> 02:02:18,589
convince people of both one the struggle
for day-to-day reforms and why it's

6236
02:02:18,589 --> 02:02:18,599
for day-to-day reforms and why it's
 

6237
02:02:18,599 --> 02:02:20,149
for day-to-day reforms and why it's
important to be politically organized

6238
02:02:20,149 --> 02:02:20,159
important to be politically organized
 

6239
02:02:20,159 --> 02:02:22,250
important to be politically organized
why it's important to be a member of a

6240
02:02:22,250 --> 02:02:22,260
why it's important to be a member of a
 

6241
02:02:22,260 --> 02:02:25,310
why it's important to be a member of a
union or to advocate for things like a

6242
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:25,320
union or to advocate for things like a
 

6243
02:02:25,320 --> 02:02:27,350
union or to advocate for things like a
universal healthcare or whatever else to

6244
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:27,360
universal healthcare or whatever else to
 

6245
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:29,510
universal healthcare or whatever else to
try to kind of build the cohesion and

6246
02:02:29,510 --> 02:02:29,520
try to kind of build the cohesion and
 

6247
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:32,330
try to kind of build the cohesion and
sense of self of the the class

6248
02:02:32,330 --> 02:02:32,340
sense of self of the the class
 

6249
02:02:32,340 --> 02:02:34,729
sense of self of the the class
I then ultimately

6250
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:34,739
I then ultimately
 

6251
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:36,709
I then ultimately
for the desirability once we accomplish

6252
02:02:36,709 --> 02:02:36,719
for the desirability once we accomplish
 

6253
02:02:36,719 --> 02:02:38,810
for the desirability once we accomplish
it once we build social democracy of

6254
02:02:38,810 --> 02:02:38,820
it once we build social democracy of
 

6255
02:02:38,820 --> 02:02:40,850
it once we build social democracy of
going Beyond social democracy which is

6256
02:02:40,850 --> 02:02:40,860
going Beyond social democracy which is
 

6257
02:02:40,860 --> 02:02:42,709
going Beyond social democracy which is
of course the challenge now I don't

6258
02:02:42,709 --> 02:02:42,719
of course the challenge now I don't
 

6259
02:02:42,719 --> 02:02:44,089
of course the challenge now I don't
think it requires leadership from the

02:02:46,669 --> 02:02:46,679
outside I think there are plenty of
 

6263
02:02:46,679 --> 02:02:48,830
outside I think there are plenty of
organic leaders that have emerged from

02:02:48,830 --> 02:02:48,840
organic leaders that have emerged from
 

6265
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:50,510
organic leaders that have emerged from
the working class that have advocated

02:02:50,510 --> 02:02:50,520
the working class that have advocated
 

6267
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,290
the working class that have advocated
for for socialism uh from the working

for for socialism uh from the working
 

6269
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:58,370
for for socialism uh from the working
class and if you look at the class

6270
02:02:58,370 --> 02:02:58,380
class and if you look at the class
 

6271
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:01,129
class and if you look at the class
composition during the Glory Days of the

6272
02:03:01,129 --> 02:03:01,139
composition during the Glory Days of the
 

6273
02:03:01,139 --> 02:03:03,350
composition during the Glory Days of the
European socialist parties I mean this

6274
02:03:03,350 --> 02:03:03,360
European socialist parties I mean this
 

6275
02:03:03,360 --> 02:03:06,229
European socialist parties I mean this
was very much a working class

6276
02:03:06,229 --> 02:03:06,239
was very much a working class
 

6277
02:03:06,239 --> 02:03:08,270
was very much a working class
um parties and organizations it's only

6278
02:03:08,270 --> 02:03:08,280
um parties and organizations it's only
 

6279
02:03:08,280 --> 02:03:09,890
um parties and organizations it's only
been the last like 30 years it's been

6280
02:03:09,890 --> 02:03:09,900
been the last like 30 years it's been
 

6281
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:12,290
been the last like 30 years it's been
taken over by professionals and you know

6282
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:12,300
taken over by professionals and you know
 

6283
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,250
taken over by professionals and you know
not

6284
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,260
not
 

6285
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:15,709
not
on coincidentally you know they they

6286
02:03:15,709 --> 02:03:15,719
on coincidentally you know they they
 

6287
02:03:15,719 --> 02:03:18,290
on coincidentally you know they they
have um uh accomplished very little in

6288
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:18,300
have um uh accomplished very little in
 

6289
02:03:18,300 --> 02:03:19,910
have um uh accomplished very little in
those those 30 years

6290
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
those those 30 years
 

6291
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,649
those those 30 years
so that's the Practical in the program

6292
02:03:21,649 --> 02:03:21,659
so that's the Practical in the program
 

6293
02:03:21,659 --> 02:03:24,169
so that's the Practical in the program
can we actually jump to the

6294
02:03:24,169 --> 02:03:24,179
can we actually jump to the
 

6295
02:03:24,179 --> 02:03:26,510
can we actually jump to the
to the at the horizon

6296
02:03:26,510 --> 02:03:26,520
to the at the horizon
 

6297
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,550
to the at the horizon
as you mentioned uh as a social

6298
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:28,560
as you mentioned uh as a social
 

6299
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,530
as you mentioned uh as a social
democratulate you focus on the policies

6300
02:03:30,530 --> 02:03:30,540
democratulate you focus on the policies
 

6301
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:32,089
democratulate you focus on the policies
of today but you also have a vision and

6302
02:03:32,089 --> 02:03:32,099
of today but you also have a vision and
 

6303
02:03:32,099 --> 02:03:34,850
of today but you also have a vision and
dream of a future and so Marx did as

6304
02:03:34,850 --> 02:03:34,860
dream of a future and so Marx did as
 

6305
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:37,129
dream of a future and so Marx did as
well so the perfect communism at the end

6306
02:03:37,129 --> 02:03:37,139
well so the perfect communism at the end
 

6307
02:03:37,139 --> 02:03:40,370
well so the perfect communism at the end
can you can you describe that world and

6308
02:03:40,370 --> 02:03:40,380
can you can you describe that world and
 

6309
02:03:40,380 --> 02:03:43,129
can you can you describe that world and
also is there elements that world that's

6310
02:03:43,129 --> 02:03:43,139
also is there elements that world that's
 

6311
02:03:43,139 --> 02:03:47,270
also is there elements that world that's
that has elements of anarchism so again

6312
02:03:47,270 --> 02:03:47,280
that has elements of anarchism so again
 

6313
02:03:47,280 --> 02:03:49,250
that has elements of anarchism so again
like I said there's Michael Mouse next

6314
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:49,260
like I said there's Michael Mouse next
 

6315
02:03:49,260 --> 02:03:52,970
like I said there's Michael Mouse next
door so uh like a narco communism I

6316
02:03:52,970 --> 02:03:52,980
door so uh like a narco communism I
 

6317
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:54,050
door so uh like a narco communism I
don't even know if I'm using that term

6318
02:03:54,050 --> 02:03:54,060
don't even know if I'm using that term
 

6319
02:03:54,060 --> 02:03:56,810
don't even know if I'm using that term
correctly but basically no central

6320
02:03:56,810 --> 02:03:56,820
correctly but basically no central
 

6321
02:03:56,820 --> 02:03:58,790
correctly but basically no central
control can you describe what that world

6322
02:03:58,790 --> 02:03:58,800
control can you describe what that world
 

6323
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:01,030
control can you describe what that world
looks like yeah I think the traditional

6324
02:04:01,030 --> 02:04:01,040
looks like yeah I think the traditional
 

6325
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,890
looks like yeah I think the traditional
socialist vision of kind of if you want

6326
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:03,900
socialist vision of kind of if you want
 

6327
02:04:03,900 --> 02:04:06,050
socialist vision of kind of if you want
to call it full communism would be very

6328
02:04:06,050 --> 02:04:06,060
to call it full communism would be very
 

6329
02:04:06,060 --> 02:04:07,970
to call it full communism would be very
similar to the anarchist

6330
02:04:07,970 --> 02:04:07,980
similar to the anarchist
 

6331
02:04:07,980 --> 02:04:11,990
similar to the anarchist
um vision of a world without uh coercion

6332
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:12,000
um vision of a world without uh coercion
 

6333
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:14,689
um vision of a world without uh coercion
Mass abundance and so on I myself don't

6334
02:04:14,689 --> 02:04:14,699
Mass abundance and so on I myself don't
 

6335
02:04:14,699 --> 02:04:16,850
Mass abundance and so on I myself don't
share that Vision

6336
02:04:16,850 --> 02:04:16,860
share that Vision
 

6337
02:04:16,860 --> 02:04:17,510
share that Vision
um

02:04:17,510 --> 02:04:17,520
um
 

6339
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,830
um
I believe that we will always need to

6340
02:04:21,830 --> 02:04:21,840
I believe that we will always need to
 

6341
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:26,109
I believe that we will always need to
have a state in some form as a way to

that the other all other political
questions would be resolved and I think

6358
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
questions would be resolved and I think
 

6359
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:44,570
questions would be resolved and I think
that's a lot behind a lot of the

communism after politics
I don't think there will be an after

02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:49,980
I don't think there will be an after
 

6367

I don't think there will be an after

I'll give you another Northeast example
 

6371
02:04:54,840 --> 02:04:57,950
I'll give you another Northeast example
let's say me and you were trying to with

let's say me and you were trying to with
 

6373
02:04:57,960 --> 02:04:59,089
let's say me and you were trying to with
different groups of people we're trying

6374
02:04:59,089 --> 02:04:59,099
different groups of people we're trying
 

6375
02:04:59,099 --> 02:05:01,250
different groups of people we're trying
to figure out how to build a crossing of

6376
02:05:01,250 --> 02:05:01,260
to figure out how to build a crossing of
 

6377
02:05:01,260 --> 02:05:04,010
to figure out how to build a crossing of
the Hudson River and for various reasons

6378
02:05:04,010 --> 02:05:04,020
the Hudson River and for various reasons
 

6379
02:05:04,020 --> 02:05:05,750
the Hudson River and for various reasons
you and the people around you want to

6380
02:05:05,750 --> 02:05:05,760
you and the people around you want to
 

6381

you and the people around you want to
build a bridge me and the people around

6383
02:05:07,679 --> 02:05:10,689
build a bridge me and the people around
me need uh want to build a tunnel

6384
02:05:10,689 --> 02:05:10,699
me need uh want to build a tunnel
 

6385
02:05:10,699 --> 02:05:13,550
me need uh want to build a tunnel
that's a question that you will probably

6386
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:13,560
that's a question that you will probably
 

6387
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:15,890
that's a question that you will probably
need a mediation for right you'll need

6388
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:15,900
need a mediation for right you'll need
 

6389
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:18,229
need a mediation for right you'll need
one it's a big project so there'll be a

6390
02:05:18,229 --> 02:05:18,239
one it's a big project so there'll be a
 

6391
02:05:18,239 --> 02:05:19,910
one it's a big project so there'll be a
very complex division of labor and so on

6392
02:05:19,910 --> 02:05:19,920
very complex division of labor and so on
 

6393
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:22,609
very complex division of labor and so on
but even beyond that just politically

6394
02:05:22,609 --> 02:05:22,619
but even beyond that just politically
 

6395
02:05:22,619 --> 02:05:24,890
but even beyond that just politically
um you will need the state to mediate

6396
02:05:24,890 --> 02:05:24,900
um you will need the state to mediate
 

6397
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,209
um you will need the state to mediate
the difference you'll need to have a

6398
02:05:26,209 --> 02:05:26,219
the difference you'll need to have a
 

6399
02:05:26,219 --> 02:05:28,189
the difference you'll need to have a
vote have a vote that people trust have

6400
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:28,199
vote have a vote that people trust have
 

6401
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:30,169
vote have a vote that people trust have
institutions of people trust

6402
02:05:30,169 --> 02:05:30,179
institutions of people trust
 

6403
02:05:30,179 --> 02:05:32,570
institutions of people trust
um and and so on to make a decision

6404
02:05:32,570 --> 02:05:32,580
um and and so on to make a decision
 

6405
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:35,209
um and and so on to make a decision
Society is never going to go beyond that

6406
02:05:35,209 --> 02:05:35,219
Society is never going to go beyond that
 

6407
02:05:35,219 --> 02:05:36,470
Society is never going to go beyond that
decision making you don't think it's

6408
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,480
decision making you don't think it's
 

6409
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:38,629
decision making you don't think it's
possible outside of the state to create

6410
02:05:38,629 --> 02:05:38,639
possible outside of the state to create
 

6411
02:05:38,639 --> 02:05:41,510
possible outside of the state to create
stable voting mechanisms

6412
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
stable voting mechanisms
 

6413
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,550
stable voting mechanisms
or as human nature can always seep into

6414
02:05:43,550 --> 02:05:43,560
or as human nature can always seep into
 

6415
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:44,450
or as human nature can always seep into
that

6416
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:44,460
that
 

6417
02:05:44,460 --> 02:05:47,870
that
I just wonder why we would have to if

6418
02:05:47,870 --> 02:05:47,880
I just wonder why we would have to if
 

6419
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:50,089
I just wonder why we would have to if
the state is democratic and responsive

6420
02:05:50,089 --> 02:05:50,099
the state is democratic and responsive
 

6421
02:05:50,099 --> 02:05:52,729
the state is democratic and responsive
the state is an authoritarian

6422
02:05:52,729 --> 02:05:52,739
the state is an authoritarian
 

6423
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:54,589
the state is an authoritarian
so it might not be called a state but it

6424
02:05:54,589 --> 02:05:54,599
so it might not be called a state but it
 

6425
02:05:54,599 --> 02:05:56,089
so it might not be called a state but it
would function as a state right but why

6426
02:05:56,089 --> 02:05:56,099
would function as a state right but why
 

6427
02:05:56,099 --> 02:05:57,470
would function as a state right but why
not just call it a state but in other

6428
02:05:57,470 --> 02:05:57,480
not just call it a state but in other
 

6429
02:05:57,480 --> 02:05:59,450
not just call it a state but in other
words like if you don't have something

6430
02:05:59,450 --> 02:05:59,460
words like if you don't have something
 

6431
02:05:59,460 --> 02:06:01,850
words like if you don't have something
like that then don't you have a greater

6432
02:06:01,850 --> 02:06:01,860
like that then don't you have a greater
 

6433
02:06:01,860 --> 02:06:04,250
like that then don't you have a greater
risk of tyranny or Tyrant emerging in

6434
02:06:04,250 --> 02:06:04,260
risk of tyranny or Tyrant emerging in
 

6435
02:06:04,260 --> 02:06:06,589
risk of tyranny or Tyrant emerging in
the vacuum so I think people's fear of

6436
02:06:06,589 --> 02:06:06,599
the vacuum so I think people's fear of
 

6437
02:06:06,599 --> 02:06:09,530
the vacuum so I think people's fear of
this state is what would happen if the

6438
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:09,540
this state is what would happen if the
 

6439
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:11,270
this state is what would happen if the
state had too much power and I think

6440
02:06:11,270 --> 02:06:11,280
state had too much power and I think
 

6441
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:12,890
state had too much power and I think
that's legitimate Fair that's why we

6442
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:12,900
that's legitimate Fair that's why we
 

6443
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:14,930
that's legitimate Fair that's why we
have Democratic kind of checks on state

6444
02:06:14,930 --> 02:06:14,940
have Democratic kind of checks on state
 

6445
02:06:14,940 --> 02:06:17,990
have Democratic kind of checks on state
power and and certain guarantees and of

6446
02:06:17,990 --> 02:06:18,000
power and and certain guarantees and of
 

6447
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:19,790
power and and certain guarantees and of
freedom and so on

6448
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:19,800
freedom and so on
 

6449
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:21,229
freedom and so on
but

6450
02:06:21,229 --> 02:06:21,239
but
 

6451
02:06:21,239 --> 02:06:23,450
but
yeah I guess I just wonder I'm more

6452
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:23,460
yeah I guess I just wonder I'm more
 

6453
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,270
yeah I guess I just wonder I'm more
afraid of the vacuum and not having a

6454
02:06:26,270 --> 02:06:26,280
afraid of the vacuum and not having a
 

6455
02:06:26,280 --> 02:06:28,609
afraid of the vacuum and not having a
democratic responsive State and and what

6456
02:06:28,609 --> 02:06:28,619
democratic responsive State and and what
 

6457
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:30,169
democratic responsive State and and what
the world would turn into and also I'm

6458
02:06:30,169 --> 02:06:30,179
the world would turn into and also I'm
 

6459
02:06:30,179 --> 02:06:31,850
the world would turn into and also I'm
just not a utopian thinker if that makes

6460
02:06:31,850 --> 02:06:31,860
just not a utopian thinker if that makes
 

6461
02:06:31,860 --> 02:06:34,729
just not a utopian thinker if that makes
sense like I I like to think that

6462
02:06:34,729 --> 02:06:34,739
sense like I I like to think that
 

6463
02:06:34,739 --> 02:06:38,209
sense like I I like to think that
Dominique egalitarian thinker I'm a

6464
02:06:38,209 --> 02:06:38,219
Dominique egalitarian thinker I'm a
 

6465
02:06:38,219 --> 02:06:40,850
Dominique egalitarian thinker I'm a
socialist but

6466
02:06:40,850 --> 02:06:40,860
socialist but
 

6467
02:06:40,860 --> 02:06:43,430
socialist but
my mind just goes to like you know I

6468
02:06:43,430 --> 02:06:43,440
my mind just goes to like you know I
 

6469
02:06:43,440 --> 02:06:46,010
my mind just goes to like you know I
could see a vision of the future that I

6470
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:46,020
could see a vision of the future that I
 

6471
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:48,589
could see a vision of the future that I
would like like 50 60 years from now

6472
02:06:48,589 --> 02:06:48,599
would like like 50 60 years from now
 

6473
02:06:48,599 --> 02:06:51,290
would like like 50 60 years from now
um maybe there's some sort of future of

6474
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:51,300
um maybe there's some sort of future of
 

6475
02:06:51,300 --> 02:06:54,950
um maybe there's some sort of future of
super abundance and Automation and

6476
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:54,960
super abundance and Automation and
 

6477
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,870
super abundance and Automation and
there's some sort of techno utopian

6478
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880
there's some sort of techno utopian
 

6479
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,089
there's some sort of techno utopian
future we don't want some of those

6480
02:06:59,089 --> 02:06:59,099
future we don't want some of those
 

6481
02:06:59,099 --> 02:07:02,089
future we don't want some of those
things that that would exist in my

6482
02:07:02,089 --> 02:07:02,099
things that that would exist in my
 

6483
02:07:02,099 --> 02:07:04,790
things that that would exist in my
um you know five minutes from now vision

6484
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
um you know five minutes from now vision
 

6485
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:08,870
um you know five minutes from now vision
of socialism but I just don't see it and

6486
02:07:08,870 --> 02:07:08,880
of socialism but I just don't see it and
 

6487
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:12,709
of socialism but I just don't see it and
in general I'm kind of wary of visions

6488
02:07:12,709 --> 02:07:12,719
in general I'm kind of wary of visions
 

6489
02:07:12,719 --> 02:07:15,649
in general I'm kind of wary of visions
of change that seem like they're not

6490
02:07:15,649 --> 02:07:15,659
of change that seem like they're not
 

6491
02:07:15,659 --> 02:07:18,410
of change that seem like they're not
built off little thing pieces that we

6492
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:18,420
built off little thing pieces that we
 

6493
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:20,209
built off little thing pieces that we
have now and not built of history and

6494
02:07:20,209 --> 02:07:20,219
have now and not built of history and
 

6495
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:21,830
have now and not built of history and
experience and whatever else like I

6496
02:07:21,830 --> 02:07:21,840
experience and whatever else like I
 

6497
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,810
experience and whatever else like I
don't want a year or zero I don't even

6498
02:07:23,810 --> 02:07:23,820
don't want a year or zero I don't even
 

6499
02:07:23,820 --> 02:07:26,270
don't want a year or zero I don't even
like the term prehistory because I think

6500
02:07:26,270 --> 02:07:26,280
like the term prehistory because I think
 

6501
02:07:26,280 --> 02:07:27,470
like the term prehistory because I think
there's a lot

6502
02:07:27,470 --> 02:07:27,480
there's a lot
 

6503
02:07:27,480 --> 02:07:30,350
there's a lot
in history that I want you know I want I

6504
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:30,360
in history that I want you know I want I
 

6505
02:07:30,360 --> 02:07:31,850
in history that I want you know I want I
want Shakespeare under socialism you

6506
02:07:31,850 --> 02:07:31,860
want Shakespeare under socialism you
 

6507
02:07:31,860 --> 02:07:33,410

6509
02:07:33,420 --> 02:07:35,990
know I want I want a lot of things that
that I think we should be grateful for

6510
02:07:35,990 --> 02:07:36,000
that I think we should be grateful for
 

6511
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:38,510
that I think we should be grateful for
um there's a part of tradition that I

6512
02:07:38,510 --> 02:07:38,520
um there's a part of tradition that I
 

6513
02:07:38,520 --> 02:07:40,729
um there's a part of tradition that I
think that exists that's hierarchical

6514
02:07:40,729 --> 02:07:40,739
think that exists that's hierarchical
 

6515
02:07:40,739 --> 02:07:42,589
think that exists that's hierarchical
and exploitative and whatever else but

6516
02:07:42,589 --> 02:07:42,599
and exploitative and whatever else but
 

6517
02:07:42,599 --> 02:07:44,149
and exploitative and whatever else but
there's another part of tradition that's

6518
02:07:44,149 --> 02:07:44,159
there's another part of tradition that's
 

6519
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,250
there's another part of tradition that's
our sense of place and belonging and our

6520
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:46,260
our sense of place and belonging and our
 

6521
02:07:46,260 --> 02:07:48,350
our sense of place and belonging and our
connection with the past and hopefully

6522
02:07:48,350 --> 02:07:48,360
connection with the past and hopefully
 

6523
02:07:48,360 --> 02:07:51,470
connection with the past and hopefully
the the future and I I want to keep that

6524
02:07:51,470 --> 02:07:51,480
the the future and I I want to keep that
 

6525
02:07:51,480 --> 02:07:54,830
the the future and I I want to keep that
yeah so you're worried about Revolution

6526
02:07:54,830 --> 02:07:54,840
yeah so you're worried about Revolution
 

6527
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,689
yeah so you're worried about Revolution
or otherwise the vacuum being created

6528
02:07:56,689 --> 02:07:56,699
or otherwise the vacuum being created
 

6529
02:07:56,699 --> 02:07:59,089
or otherwise the vacuum being created
and you're worried about the

6530
02:07:59,089 --> 02:07:59,099
and you're worried about the
 

6531
02:07:59,099 --> 02:08:00,890
and you're worried about the
the things that might fill that vacuum

6532
02:08:00,890 --> 02:08:00,900
the things that might fill that vacuum
 

6533
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:03,890
the things that might fill that vacuum
so the anarchists often worry

6534
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:03,900
so the anarchists often worry
 

6535
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:06,109
so the anarchists often worry
about the

6536
02:08:06,109 --> 02:08:06,119
about the
 

6537
02:08:06,119 --> 02:08:08,270
about the
the same mechanism of the state that

6538
02:08:08,270 --> 02:08:08,280
the same mechanism of the state that
 

6539
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:09,950
the same mechanism of the state that
controls voting

6540
02:08:09,950 --> 02:08:09,960
controls voting
 

6541
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:12,350
controls voting
or keeps voting robust and resilient and

6542
02:08:12,350 --> 02:08:12,360
or keeps voting robust and resilient and
 

6543
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:14,990
or keeps voting robust and resilient and
stable the same mechanism also having a

6544
02:08:14,990 --> 02:08:15,000
stable the same mechanism also having a
 

6545
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,209
stable the same mechanism also having a
monopoly on violence

6546
02:08:17,209 --> 02:08:17,219
monopoly on violence
 

6547
02:08:17,219 --> 02:08:19,490
monopoly on violence
and so that's the tension so they're

6548
02:08:19,490 --> 02:08:19,500
and so that's the tension so they're
 

6549
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,430
and so that's the tension so they're
very they get very nervous about a

6550
02:08:22,430 --> 02:08:22,440
very they get very nervous about a
 

6551
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:24,169
very they get very nervous about a
central place having a monopoly on

6552
02:08:24,169 --> 02:08:24,179
central place having a monopoly on
 

6553
02:08:24,179 --> 02:08:26,750
central place having a monopoly on
violence whereas if there is going to be

6554
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:26,760
violence whereas if there is going to be
 

6555
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:28,609
violence whereas if there is going to be
a place within Monopoly on violence

6556
02:08:28,609 --> 02:08:28,619
a place within Monopoly on violence
 

6557
02:08:28,619 --> 02:08:31,070
a place within Monopoly on violence
let's just say we temporarily take that

6558
02:08:31,070 --> 02:08:31,080
let's just say we temporarily take that
 

6559
02:08:31,080 --> 02:08:32,390
let's just say we temporarily take that
for granted

6560
02:08:32,390 --> 02:08:32,400
for granted
 

6561
02:08:32,400 --> 02:08:37,070
for granted
should it not be a place with a skilled

6562
02:08:37,070 --> 02:08:37,080
should it not be a place with a skilled
 

6563
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:39,649
should it not be a place with a skilled
elected accountable transparent civil

6564
02:08:39,649 --> 02:08:39,659
elected accountable transparent civil
 

6565
02:08:39,659 --> 02:08:42,770
elected accountable transparent civil
service with a democratic mandate and so

6566
02:08:42,770 --> 02:08:42,780
service with a democratic mandate and so
 

6567
02:08:42,780 --> 02:08:45,890
service with a democratic mandate and so
on yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll put uh

6568
02:08:45,890 --> 02:08:45,900
on yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll put uh
 

6569
02:08:45,900 --> 02:08:47,810
on yeah yeah yeah yeah we'll put uh
speaking of AI just just to go on that

6570
02:08:47,810 --> 02:08:47,820
speaking of AI just just to go on that
 

6571
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:49,669
speaking of AI just just to go on that
tangent do you think it's possible to

6572
02:08:49,669 --> 02:08:49,679
tangent do you think it's possible to
 

6573
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:50,990
tangent do you think it's possible to
have a future world at least for 50

6574
02:08:50,990 --> 02:08:51,000
have a future world at least for 50
 

6575
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,890
have a future world at least for 50
years 50 100 years

6577
02:08:54,900 --> 02:08:59,390

where AI there's an AI sort of central

6578
02:08:59,390 --> 02:08:59,400
where AI there's an AI sort of central
 

6579

where AI there's an AI sort of central
planning

6580
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:00,840
planning
 

6581
02:09:00,840 --> 02:09:04,370
planning
sort of the we remove some of the human

6582
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,380
sort of the we remove some of the human
 

6583
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:06,830
sort of the we remove some of the human
elements that I think get us into a lot

6584
02:09:06,830 --> 02:09:06,840
elements that I think get us into a lot
 

6585
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:09,530
elements that I think get us into a lot
of trouble like you could you can take a

6586
02:09:09,530 --> 02:09:09,540
of trouble like you could you can take a
 

6587
02:09:09,540 --> 02:09:11,450
of trouble like you could you can take a
perspective on the Soviet Union then the

6588
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:11,460
perspective on the Soviet Union then the
 

6589
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:14,209
perspective on the Soviet Union then the
flaws of the system there have less to

6590
02:09:14,209 --> 02:09:14,219
flaws of the system there have less to
 

6591
02:09:14,219 --> 02:09:16,129
flaws of the system there have less to
do with the different ideologies more to

6592
02:09:16,129 --> 02:09:16,139
do with the different ideologies more to
 

6593
02:09:16,139 --> 02:09:18,470
do with the different ideologies more to
do with the humans and the vacuums and

6594
02:09:18,470 --> 02:09:18,480
do with the humans and the vacuums and
 

6595
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:20,030
do with the humans and the vacuums and
how humans fill vacuums and the

6596
02:09:20,030 --> 02:09:20,040
how humans fill vacuums and the
 

6597
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:22,490
how humans fill vacuums and the
corrupting nature power and so on if we

6598
02:09:22,490 --> 02:09:22,500
corrupting nature power and so on if we
 

6599
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:25,609
corrupting nature power and so on if we
have ai that it's it's more data driven

6600
02:09:25,609 --> 02:09:25,619
have ai that it's it's more data driven
 

6601
02:09:25,619 --> 02:09:28,070
have ai that it's it's more data driven
and it's not susceptible to the human

6602
02:09:28,070 --> 02:09:28,080
and it's not susceptible to the human
 

6603
02:09:28,080 --> 02:09:30,169
and it's not susceptible to the human
elements is it possible to imagine such

6604
02:09:30,169 --> 02:09:30,179
elements is it possible to imagine such
 

6605
02:09:30,179 --> 02:09:31,669
elements is it possible to imagine such
a world almost like a from a Sci-Fi

6606
02:09:31,669 --> 02:09:31,679
a world almost like a from a Sci-Fi
 

6607
02:09:31,679 --> 02:09:33,890
a world almost like a from a Sci-Fi
perspective maybe in the future you can

6608
02:09:33,890 --> 02:09:33,900
perspective maybe in the future you can
 

6609
02:09:33,900 --> 02:09:35,990
perspective maybe in the future you can
imagine certain calculation problems

6610
02:09:35,990 --> 02:09:36,000
imagine certain calculation problems
 

6611
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:38,270
imagine certain calculation problems
that Rose during Central planning solve

6612
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:38,280
that Rose during Central planning solve
 

6613
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,510
that Rose during Central planning solve
through advanced computing

6614
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:40,520
through advanced computing
 

6615
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:44,270
through advanced computing
but I would say that there's another

6616
02:09:44,270 --> 02:09:44,280
but I would say that there's another
 

6617
02:09:44,280 --> 02:09:45,770
but I would say that there's another
whole set of problems with the system

6618
02:09:45,770 --> 02:09:45,780
whole set of problems with the system
 

6619
02:09:45,780 --> 02:09:48,050
whole set of problems with the system
that were incentive problems and I'm not

6620
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:48,060
that were incentive problems and I'm not
 

6621
02:09:48,060 --> 02:09:50,330
that were incentive problems and I'm not
sure how that advanced Computing would

6622
02:09:50,330 --> 02:09:50,340
sure how that advanced Computing would
 

6623
02:09:50,340 --> 02:09:52,850
sure how that advanced Computing would
solve the incentive problems of how do

6624
02:09:52,850 --> 02:09:52,860
solve the incentive problems of how do
 

6625
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:54,950
solve the incentive problems of how do
you get people to actually produce

6626
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
you get people to actually produce
 

6627
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,830
you get people to actually produce
things that other people want

6628
02:09:57,830 --> 02:09:57,840
things that other people want
 

6629
02:09:57,840 --> 02:09:59,149
things that other people want
um kind of that informational question

6630
02:09:59,149 --> 02:09:59,159
um kind of that informational question
 

6631
02:09:59,159 --> 02:10:01,070
um kind of that informational question
and how do you communicate without

6632
02:10:01,070 --> 02:10:01,080
and how do you communicate without
 

6633
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:03,290
and how do you communicate without
endless meetings or someone reading your

6634
02:10:03,290 --> 02:10:03,300
endless meetings or someone reading your
 

6635
02:10:03,300 --> 02:10:06,169
endless meetings or someone reading your
brain yeah what do you actually want

6636
02:10:06,169 --> 02:10:06,179
brain yeah what do you actually want
 

6637
02:10:06,179 --> 02:10:08,149
brain yeah what do you actually want
um so so there's there's that kind of

6638
02:10:08,149 --> 02:10:08,159
um so so there's there's that kind of
 

6639
02:10:08,159 --> 02:10:09,410
um so so there's there's that kind of
informational question but then there's

6640
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:09,420
informational question but then there's
 

6641
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:11,870
informational question but then there's
the incentive of you know how do you get

6642
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:11,880
the incentive of you know how do you get
 

6643
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,209
the incentive of you know how do you get
people to work efficiently at work and

6644
02:10:14,209 --> 02:10:14,219
people to work efficiently at work and
 

6645
02:10:14,219 --> 02:10:17,330
people to work efficiently at work and
how do you get uh firms to

6646
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:17,340
how do you get uh firms to
 

6647
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,689
how do you get uh firms to
um to use their resources that they're

6648
02:10:20,689 --> 02:10:20,699
um to use their resources that they're
 

6649
02:10:20,699 --> 02:10:23,149
um to use their resources that they're
getting more more efficiently and I

6650
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:23,159
getting more more efficiently and I
 

6651
02:10:23,159 --> 02:10:24,350
getting more more efficiently and I
think

6652
02:10:24,350 --> 02:10:24,360
think
 

6653
02:10:24,360 --> 02:10:26,510
think
so solving the calculation problem

6654
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:26,520
so solving the calculation problem
 

6655
02:10:26,520 --> 02:10:29,209
so solving the calculation problem
solves some of these questions but not

6656
02:10:29,209 --> 02:10:29,219
solves some of these questions but not
 

6657
02:10:29,219 --> 02:10:30,709
solves some of these questions but not
all of them

6658
02:10:30,709 --> 02:10:30,719
all of them
 

6659
02:10:30,719 --> 02:10:33,410
all of them
but you know that's kind of a who knows

6660
02:10:33,410 --> 02:10:33,420
but you know that's kind of a who knows
 

6661
02:10:33,420 --> 02:10:34,669
but you know that's kind of a who knows
but if you're a vision of the future

6662
02:10:34,669 --> 02:10:34,679
but if you're a vision of the future
 

6663
02:10:34,679 --> 02:10:36,649
but if you're a vision of the future
requires some sort of

6664
02:10:36,649 --> 02:10:36,659
requires some sort of
 

6665
02:10:36,659 --> 02:10:38,870
requires some sort of
leap into a technological unknown that's

6666
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:38,880
leap into a technological unknown that's
 

6667
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:41,149
leap into a technological unknown that's
very hard to advocate for it today it's

6668
02:10:41,149 --> 02:10:41,159
very hard to advocate for it today it's
 

6669
02:10:41,159 --> 02:10:43,129
very hard to advocate for it today it's
exciting to consider the possibility of

6670
02:10:43,129 --> 02:10:43,139
exciting to consider the possibility of
 

6671
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:45,950
exciting to consider the possibility of
Technology empowering uh a better

6672
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:45,960
Technology empowering uh a better
 

6673
02:10:45,960 --> 02:10:49,070
Technology empowering uh a better
reallocation of resources if if you care

6674
02:10:49,070 --> 02:10:49,080
reallocation of resources if if you care
 

6675
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:50,709
reallocation of resources if if you care
about a kind of

6676
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:50,719
about a kind of
 

6677
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:53,930
about a kind of
uh the innate value of human beings and

6678
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:53,940
uh the innate value of human beings and
 

6679
02:10:53,940 --> 02:10:55,910
uh the innate value of human beings and
think of the mechanism of reallocation

6680
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:55,920
think of the mechanism of reallocation
 

6681
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,870
think of the mechanism of reallocation
resources good way to empower that

6682
02:10:58,870 --> 02:10:58,880
resources good way to empower that
 

6683
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,270
resources good way to empower that
equality that it's nice to remove the

6684
02:11:02,270 --> 02:11:02,280
equality that it's nice to remove the
 

6685
02:11:02,280 --> 02:11:04,010
equality that it's nice to remove the
human element from that like if you work

6686
02:11:04,010 --> 02:11:04,020
human element from that like if you work
 

6687
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:05,209
human element from that like if you work
really hard

6688
02:11:05,209 --> 02:11:05,219
really hard
 

6689
02:11:05,219 --> 02:11:08,149
really hard
and you're really good at your job it's

6690
02:11:08,149 --> 02:11:08,159
and you're really good at your job it's
 

6691
02:11:08,159 --> 02:11:10,250
and you're really good at your job it's
nice to be really data driven in

6692
02:11:10,250 --> 02:11:10,260
nice to be really data driven in
 

6693
02:11:10,260 --> 02:11:13,129
nice to be really data driven in
allocating more resources to you

6694
02:11:13,129 --> 02:11:13,139
allocating more resources to you
 

6695
02:11:13,139 --> 02:11:14,270
allocating more resources to you
so

6696
02:11:14,270 --> 02:11:14,280
so
 

6697
02:11:14,280 --> 02:11:17,209
so
kind of like I kind of think that the

6698
02:11:17,209 --> 02:11:17,219
kind of like I kind of think that the
 

6699
02:11:17,219 --> 02:11:19,669
kind of like I kind of think that the
agency part requires

6700
02:11:19,669 --> 02:11:19,679
agency part requires
 

6701
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:21,649
agency part requires
human beings and conscious human

6702
02:11:21,649 --> 02:11:21,659
human beings and conscious human
 

6703
02:11:21,659 --> 02:11:24,410
human beings and conscious human
activity so I think if you have a sort

6704
02:11:24,410 --> 02:11:24,420
activity so I think if you have a sort
 

6705
02:11:24,420 --> 02:11:25,189
activity so I think if you have a sort
of

6706
02:11:25,189 --> 02:11:25,199
of
 

6707
02:11:25,199 --> 02:11:27,649
of
planning system that works

6708
02:11:27,649 --> 02:11:27,659
planning system that works
 

6709
02:11:27,659 --> 02:11:29,689
planning system that works
um and let's say the technology is there

6710
02:11:29,689 --> 02:11:29,699
um and let's say the technology is there
 

6711
02:11:29,699 --> 02:11:31,010
um and let's say the technology is there
for it to work

6712
02:11:31,010 --> 02:11:31,020
for it to work
 

6713
02:11:31,020 --> 02:11:33,050
for it to work
I would want it to be Democratic

6714
02:11:33,050 --> 02:11:33,060
I would want it to be Democratic
 

6715
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:34,910
I would want it to be Democratic
planning in such a way there is a human

6716
02:11:34,910 --> 02:11:34,920
planning in such a way there is a human
 

6717
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,290
planning in such a way there is a human
element there is some debate and

6718
02:11:36,290 --> 02:11:36,300
element there is some debate and
 

6719
02:11:36,300 --> 02:11:38,990
element there is some debate and
deliberation Society and also even in my

6720
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:39,000
deliberation Society and also even in my
 

6721
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,270
deliberation Society and also even in my
vision of socialism with the state

6722
02:11:41,270 --> 02:11:41,280
vision of socialism with the state
 

6723
02:11:41,280 --> 02:11:43,850
vision of socialism with the state
sector and state Investments and so on I

6724
02:11:43,850 --> 02:11:43,860
sector and state Investments and so on I
 

6725
02:11:43,860 --> 02:11:45,169
sector and state Investments and so on I
want there to be more public discussion

6726
02:11:45,169 --> 02:11:45,179
want there to be more public discussion
 

6727
02:11:45,179 --> 02:11:47,089
want there to be more public discussion
and debate about certain things so it's

6728
02:11:47,089 --> 02:11:47,099
and debate about certain things so it's
 

6729
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:49,250
and debate about certain things so it's
not just left to technocrats because

6730
02:11:49,250 --> 02:11:49,260
not just left to technocrats because
 

6731
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:51,770
not just left to technocrats because
you'd want to live in society where

6732
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:51,780
you'd want to live in society where
 

6733
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:53,450
you'd want to live in society where
you're you just find out the next day

6734
02:11:53,450 --> 02:11:53,460
you're you just find out the next day
 

6735
02:11:53,460 --> 02:11:54,950
you're you just find out the next day
that there's some massive infrastructure

6736
02:11:54,950 --> 02:11:54,960
that there's some massive infrastructure
 

6737
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:57,649
that there's some massive infrastructure
project that you haven't you know had a

6738
02:11:57,649 --> 02:11:57,659
project that you haven't you know had a
 

6739
02:11:57,659 --> 02:11:59,030
project that you haven't you know had a
chance to

6740
02:11:59,030 --> 02:11:59,040
chance to
 

6741
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:00,890
chance to
think about or debate or feel like

6742
02:12:00,890 --> 02:12:00,900
think about or debate or feel like
 

6743
02:12:00,900 --> 02:12:02,570
think about or debate or feel like
you're participating

6744
02:12:02,570 --> 02:12:02,580
you're participating
 

6745
02:12:02,580 --> 02:12:05,629
you're participating
in you know and and debate is not just

6746
02:12:05,629 --> 02:12:05,639
in you know and and debate is not just
 

6747
02:12:05,639 --> 02:12:08,270
in you know and and debate is not just
facts and logic that's that's why if if

6748
02:12:08,270 --> 02:12:08,280
facts and logic that's that's why if if
 

6749
02:12:08,280 --> 02:12:10,250
facts and logic that's that's why if if
the whole universe was about facts and

6750
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:10,260
the whole universe was about facts and
 

6751
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,810
the whole universe was about facts and
logic computers could do a better job of

6752
02:12:11,810 --> 02:12:11,820
logic computers could do a better job of
 

6753
02:12:11,820 --> 02:12:13,550
logic computers could do a better job of
that there's something about humans

6754
02:12:13,550 --> 02:12:13,560
that there's something about humans
 

6755
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:16,370
that there's something about humans
debating each other that goes into the

6756
02:12:16,370 --> 02:12:16,380
debating each other that goes into the
 

6757
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,649
debating each other that goes into the
difficult gray areas of

6758
02:12:18,649 --> 02:12:18,659
difficult gray areas of
 

6759
02:12:18,659 --> 02:12:21,109
difficult gray areas of
of what it means to be human or what it

6760
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:21,119
of what it means to be human or what it
 

6761
02:12:21,119 --> 02:12:24,290
of what it means to be human or what it
means to have a life that's worth living

6762
02:12:24,290 --> 02:12:24,300
means to have a life that's worth living
 

6763
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:24,950
means to have a life that's worth living
um

6764
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:24,960
um
 

6765
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:28,370
um
that requires humanity and I'm also

6766
02:12:28,370 --> 02:12:28,380
that requires humanity and I'm also
 

6767
02:12:28,380 --> 02:12:30,229
that requires humanity and I'm also
worried about while I'm excited by the

6768
02:12:30,229 --> 02:12:30,239
worried about while I'm excited by the
 

6769
02:12:30,239 --> 02:12:32,570
worried about while I'm excited by the
possibility of AI controlling everything

6770
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:32,580
possibility of AI controlling everything
 

6771
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:35,629
possibility of AI controlling everything
half joking but the reason I'm really

6772
02:12:35,629 --> 02:12:35,639
half joking but the reason I'm really
 

6773
02:12:35,639 --> 02:12:38,390
half joking but the reason I'm really
terrified of that is because usually

6774
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
terrified of that is because usually
 

6775
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,850
terrified of that is because usually
there's a possibility of a human taking

6776
02:12:40,850 --> 02:12:40,860
there's a possibility of a human taking
 

6777
02:12:40,860 --> 02:12:43,250
there's a possibility of a human taking
control of that system so you you now

6778
02:12:43,250 --> 02:12:43,260
control of that system so you you now
 

6779
02:12:43,260 --> 02:12:44,390
control of that system so you you now
start to get the same kind of

6780
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:44,400
start to get the same kind of
 

6781
02:12:44,400 --> 02:12:47,450
start to get the same kind of
authoritarian thing well I am a human

6782
02:12:47,450 --> 02:12:47,460
authoritarian thing well I am a human
 

6783
02:12:47,460 --> 02:12:49,850
authoritarian thing well I am a human
I'm smart enough to be able to uh

6784
02:12:49,850 --> 02:12:49,860
I'm smart enough to be able to uh
 

6785
02:12:49,860 --> 02:12:52,550
I'm smart enough to be able to uh
control this AI system and I will do

6786
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:52,560
control this AI system and I will do
 

6787
02:12:52,560 --> 02:12:55,430
control this AI system and I will do
based on what this AI system says uh

6788
02:12:55,430 --> 02:12:55,440
based on what this AI system says uh
 

6789
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:57,410
based on what this AI system says uh
what's good for you it's kind of like

6790
02:12:57,410 --> 02:12:57,420
what's good for you it's kind of like
 

6791
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,450
what's good for you it's kind of like
talking down to people and then use that

6792
02:12:59,450 --> 02:12:59,460
talking down to people and then use that
 

6793
02:12:59,460 --> 02:13:01,729
talking down to people and then use that
AI system to now have the same kind of

6794
02:13:01,729 --> 02:13:01,739
AI system to now have the same kind of
 

6795
02:13:01,739 --> 02:13:04,189
AI system to now have the same kind of
thing as holiday more in 1930s and also

6796
02:13:04,189 --> 02:13:04,199
thing as holiday more in 1930s and also
 

6797
02:13:04,199 --> 02:13:06,890
thing as holiday more in 1930s and also
our preferences might change so an AI

6798
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:06,900
our preferences might change so an AI
 

6799
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:10,250
our preferences might change so an AI
system might say the goal of humanity is

6800
02:13:10,250 --> 02:13:10,260
system might say the goal of humanity is
 

6801
02:13:10,260 --> 02:13:12,709
system might say the goal of humanity is
to just increase infinitely efficiency

6802
02:13:12,709 --> 02:13:12,719
to just increase infinitely efficiency
 

6803
02:13:12,719 --> 02:13:16,069
to just increase infinitely efficiency
or or increase output whereas we might

6804
02:13:16,069 --> 02:13:16,079
or or increase output whereas we might
 

6805
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:19,550
or or increase output whereas we might
collectively decide that you know we we

6806
02:13:19,550 --> 02:13:19,560
collectively decide that you know we we
 

6807
02:13:19,560 --> 02:13:21,950
collectively decide that you know we we
have enough and we want to you know have

6808
02:13:21,950 --> 02:13:21,960
have enough and we want to you know have
 

6809
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:24,229
have enough and we want to you know have
a trade-off right and I think that you

6810
02:13:24,229 --> 02:13:24,239
a trade-off right and I think that you
 

6811
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,030
a trade-off right and I think that you
know we need a system that allows for

6812
02:13:26,030 --> 02:13:26,040
know we need a system that allows for
 

6813
02:13:26,040 --> 02:13:27,530
know we need a system that allows for
people to make

6814
02:13:27,530 --> 02:13:27,540
people to make
 

6815
02:13:27,540 --> 02:13:30,169
people to make
certain trade-offs

6816
02:13:30,169 --> 02:13:30,179
certain trade-offs
 

6817
02:13:30,179 --> 02:13:34,189
certain trade-offs
and have more of this uh Leisure that

6818
02:13:34,189 --> 02:13:34,199
and have more of this uh Leisure that
 

6819
02:13:34,199 --> 02:13:35,810
and have more of this uh Leisure that
I've been learning about from you this

6820
02:13:35,810 --> 02:13:35,820
I've been learning about from you this
 

6821
02:13:35,820 --> 02:13:38,030
I've been learning about from you this
is a very interesting concept Leisure

6822
02:13:38,030 --> 02:13:38,040
is a very interesting concept Leisure
 

6823
02:13:38,040 --> 02:13:39,470
is a very interesting concept Leisure
I'm gonna have to how do you spell that

6824

unions like we talked about
 

6855
02:14:12,300 --> 02:14:14,629
unions like we talked about
what are some ideas here what are some

6856
02:14:14,629 --> 02:14:14,639
what are some ideas here what are some
 

6857
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:16,129
what are some ideas here what are some
ideas there's especially policy

6858
02:14:16,129 --> 02:14:16,139
ideas there's especially policy
 

6859
02:14:16,139 --> 02:14:17,810
ideas there's especially policy
especially exciting to you

6860

well I think that hours reduction has

6862
02:14:20,510 --> 02:14:20,520
well I think that hours reduction has
 

6863
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:22,550
well I think that hours reduction has
always been an important demand for

6864
02:14:22,550 --> 02:14:22,560
always been an important demand for
 

6865
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:23,870
always been an important demand for
socialists

6866
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:23,880
socialists
 

6867
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:26,450
socialists
um so I mean it's been a reality in in

6868
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:26,460
um so I mean it's been a reality in in
 

6869
02:14:26,460 --> 02:14:28,129
um so I mean it's been a reality in in
certain countries like France and in

6870
02:14:28,129 --> 02:14:28,139
certain countries like France and in
 

6871
02:14:28,139 --> 02:14:30,530
certain countries like France and in
recent uh decades

6872
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:30,540
recent uh decades
 

6873
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:33,169
recent uh decades
where part of the logic is

6874
02:14:33,169 --> 02:14:33,179
where part of the logic is
 

6875
02:14:33,179 --> 02:14:34,669
where part of the logic is
if you have a bunch of people working

6876
02:14:34,669 --> 02:14:34,679
if you have a bunch of people working
 

6877
02:14:34,679 --> 02:14:38,270
if you have a bunch of people working
for 40 plus hours a week and you also

6878
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:38,280
for 40 plus hours a week and you also
 

6879
02:14:38,280 --> 02:14:39,709
for 40 plus hours a week and you also
have some unemployed people who would

6880
02:14:39,709 --> 02:14:39,719
have some unemployed people who would
 

6881
02:14:39,719 --> 02:14:41,870
have some unemployed people who would
like more employment then it's not a

6882
02:14:41,870 --> 02:14:41,880
like more employment then it's not a
 

6883
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,930
like more employment then it's not a
zero-sum game you could reduce hours to

6884
02:14:44,930 --> 02:14:44,940
zero-sum game you could reduce hours to
 

6885
02:14:44,940 --> 02:14:47,689
zero-sum game you could reduce hours to
35 hours and still maintain the same

6886
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:47,699
35 hours and still maintain the same
 

6887
02:14:47,699 --> 02:14:50,330
35 hours and still maintain the same
output by employing more people to kind

6888
02:14:50,330 --> 02:14:50,340
output by employing more people to kind
 

6889
02:14:50,340 --> 02:14:54,350
output by employing more people to kind
of fill the the slack in in hours so one

6890
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:54,360
of fill the the slack in in hours so one
 

6891
02:14:54,360 --> 02:14:56,330
of fill the the slack in in hours so one
I think it's a solidaristic thing in

6892
02:14:56,330 --> 02:14:56,340
I think it's a solidaristic thing in
 

6893
02:14:56,340 --> 02:14:58,390
I think it's a solidaristic thing in
working class movements being unemployed

6894
02:14:58,390 --> 02:14:58,400
working class movements being unemployed
 

6895
02:14:58,400 --> 02:15:02,629
working class movements being unemployed
and employed workers I also think that

6896
02:15:02,629 --> 02:15:02,639
and employed workers I also think that
 

6897
02:15:02,639 --> 02:15:04,790
and employed workers I also think that
um yeah it gives people more time so

6898
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:04,800
um yeah it gives people more time so
 

6899
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:07,669
um yeah it gives people more time so
Marx was a big advocate in his day of um

6900
02:15:07,669 --> 02:15:07,679
Marx was a big advocate in his day of um
 

6901
02:15:07,679 --> 02:15:09,290
Marx was a big advocate in his day of um
a 10 hour

6902
02:15:09,290 --> 02:15:09,300
a 10 hour
 

6903
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:12,530
a 10 hour
um a bill in in in the UK that would

6904
02:15:12,530 --> 02:15:12,540
um a bill in in in the UK that would
 

6905
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:15,709
um a bill in in in the UK that would
reduce the hours of working time

6906
02:15:15,709 --> 02:15:15,719
reduce the hours of working time
 

6907
02:15:15,719 --> 02:15:18,890
reduce the hours of working time
and reduce child or eliminated or renews

6908
02:15:18,890 --> 02:15:18,900
and reduce child or eliminated or renews
 

6909
02:15:18,900 --> 02:15:20,870
and reduce child or eliminated or renews
child labor and and other things as well

6910
02:15:20,870 --> 02:15:20,880
child labor and and other things as well
 

6911
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,850
child labor and and other things as well
and part of it was

6912
02:15:22,850 --> 02:15:22,860
and part of it was
 

6913
02:15:22,860 --> 02:15:24,770
and part of it was
this is a radical demand because it's

6914
02:15:24,770 --> 02:15:24,780
this is a radical demand because it's
 

6915
02:15:24,780 --> 02:15:26,750
this is a radical demand because it's
reducing the sphere as we saw of

6916
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:26,760
reducing the sphere as we saw of
 

6917
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:29,390
reducing the sphere as we saw of
exploitation so it's putting limits on

6918
02:15:29,390 --> 02:15:29,400
exploitation so it's putting limits on
 

6919
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:31,729
exploitation so it's putting limits on
on how much time the capitalist can take

6920
02:15:31,729 --> 02:15:31,739
on how much time the capitalist can take
 

6921
02:15:31,739 --> 02:15:33,350
on how much time the capitalist can take
from ordinary workers and how much

6922
02:15:33,350 --> 02:15:33,360
from ordinary workers and how much
 

6923
02:15:33,360 --> 02:15:36,050
from ordinary workers and how much
Freedom they would they would have

6924
02:15:36,050 --> 02:15:36,060
Freedom they would they would have
 

6925
02:15:36,060 --> 02:15:39,050
Freedom they would they would have
um with Healthcare one I just think it's

6926
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:39,060
um with Healthcare one I just think it's
 

6927
02:15:39,060 --> 02:15:42,410
um with Healthcare one I just think it's
a a government Health Care System you

6928
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:42,420
a a government Health Care System you
 

6929
02:15:42,420 --> 02:15:43,669
a a government Health Care System you
know you could tell me that you don't

6930
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
know you could tell me that you don't
 

6931
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,470
know you could tell me that you don't
want it in the U.S but you can't tell me

6932
02:15:45,470 --> 02:15:45,480
want it in the U.S but you can't tell me
 

6933
02:15:45,480 --> 02:15:47,089
want it in the U.S but you can't tell me
it doesn't work because we've seen it

6934
02:15:47,089 --> 02:15:47,099
it doesn't work because we've seen it
 

6935
02:15:47,099 --> 02:15:49,550
it doesn't work because we've seen it
work in every other major industrial

6936
02:15:49,550 --> 02:15:49,560
work in every other major industrial
 

6937
02:15:49,560 --> 02:15:51,830
work in every other major industrial
system in different forms so what does

6938
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:51,840
system in different forms so what does
 

6939
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,330
system in different forms so what does
that usually involve what does Universal

6940
02:15:53,330 --> 02:15:53,340
that usually involve what does Universal
 

6941
02:15:53,340 --> 02:15:55,310
that usually involve what does Universal
Health Care involve so there's different

6942
02:15:55,310 --> 02:15:55,320
Health Care involve so there's different
 

6943
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:58,609
Health Care involve so there's different
varieties in the UK for instance they

6944
02:15:58,609 --> 02:15:58,619
varieties in the UK for instance they
 

6945
02:15:58,619 --> 02:16:01,069
varieties in the UK for instance they
have a National Health Service in which

6946
02:16:01,069 --> 02:16:01,079
have a National Health Service in which
 

6947
02:16:01,079 --> 02:16:04,970
have a National Health Service in which
medical personnels and hospitals are run

6948
02:16:04,970 --> 02:16:04,980
medical personnels and hospitals are run
 

6949
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:07,129
medical personnels and hospitals are run
directly by the state it's almost like a

6950
02:16:07,129 --> 02:16:07,139
directly by the state it's almost like a
 

6951
02:16:07,139 --> 02:16:08,810
directly by the state it's almost like a
mini Soviet system to be honest but just

6952
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:08,820
mini Soviet system to be honest but just
 

6953
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:10,910
mini Soviet system to be honest but just
for healthcare it works pretty well just

6954
02:16:10,910 --> 02:16:10,920
for healthcare it works pretty well just
 

6955
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,430
for healthcare it works pretty well just
for healthcare

6956
02:16:13,430 --> 02:16:13,440
for healthcare
 

6957
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:16,069
for healthcare
um and I think it's one example of the

6958
02:16:16,069 --> 02:16:16,079
um and I think it's one example of the
 

6959
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:17,870
um and I think it's one example of the
way in which you could actually take the

6960
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:17,880
way in which you could actually take the
 

6961
02:16:17,880 --> 02:16:19,129
way in which you could actually take the
market so I give you a vision of

6962
02:16:19,129 --> 02:16:19,139
market so I give you a vision of
 

6963
02:16:19,139 --> 02:16:20,450
market so I give you a vision of
socialism that involves a lot of Market

6964
02:16:20,450 --> 02:16:20,460
socialism that involves a lot of Market
 

6965
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:22,129
socialism that involves a lot of Market
but I think there's certain spheres

6966
02:16:22,129 --> 02:16:22,139
but I think there's certain spheres
 

6967
02:16:22,139 --> 02:16:24,109
but I think there's certain spheres
where you could remove the market from

6968
02:16:24,109 --> 02:16:24,119
where you could remove the market from
 

6969
02:16:24,119 --> 02:16:25,910
where you could remove the market from
and still have

6970
02:16:25,910 --> 02:16:25,920
and still have
 

6971
02:16:25,920 --> 02:16:27,770
and still have
um an efficient system

6972
02:16:27,770 --> 02:16:27,780
um an efficient system
 

6973
02:16:27,780 --> 02:16:31,669
um an efficient system
um in part because you know this is a

6974
02:16:31,669 --> 02:16:31,679
um in part because you know this is a
 

6975
02:16:31,679 --> 02:16:35,450
um in part because you know this is a
area in which we

6976
02:16:35,450 --> 02:16:35,460
area in which we
 

6977
02:16:35,460 --> 02:16:37,790
area in which we
people don't have

6978
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:37,800
people don't have
 

6979
02:16:37,800 --> 02:16:39,290
people don't have
obviously for cosmetic procedures

6980
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:39,300
obviously for cosmetic procedures
 

6981
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:41,450
obviously for cosmetic procedures
whatever they have preferences but for

6982
02:16:41,450 --> 02:16:41,460
whatever they have preferences but for
 

6983

pass something you're trying to make a
 

7301
02:22:20,700 --> 02:22:22,010
pass something you're trying to make a
change like Obamacare was supposed to

7302
02:22:22,010 --> 02:22:22,020
change like Obamacare was supposed to
 

7303
02:22:22,020 --> 02:22:23,510
change like Obamacare was supposed to
have a public option everybody's been

7304
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:23,520
have a public option everybody's been
 

7305
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:24,830
have a public option everybody's been
running on a public option in the

7306
02:22:24,830 --> 02:22:24,840
running on a public option in the
 

7307
02:22:24,840 --> 02:22:27,110
running on a public option in the
Democratic party for 12 13 years why

7308
02:22:27,110 --> 02:22:27,120
Democratic party for 12 13 years why
 

7309
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:29,090
Democratic party for 12 13 years why
don't we have a public option

7310
02:22:29,090 --> 02:22:29,100
don't we have a public option
 

7311
02:22:29,100 --> 02:22:30,530
don't we have a public option
um people know that if people have the

7312
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:30,540
um people know that if people have the
 

7313
02:22:30,540 --> 02:22:32,690
um people know that if people have the
choice of buying into a government plan

7314
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:32,700
choice of buying into a government plan
 

7315
02:22:32,700 --> 02:22:34,969
choice of buying into a government plan
they might just keep that might be the

7316
02:22:34,969 --> 02:22:34,979
they might just keep that might be the
 

7317
02:22:34,979 --> 02:22:37,429
they might just keep that might be the
slow road to really having Universal

7318
02:22:37,429 --> 02:22:37,439
slow road to really having Universal
 

7319
02:22:37,439 --> 02:22:39,110
slow road to really having Universal
Health Care so I think a lot of it's

7320
02:22:39,110 --> 02:22:39,120
Health Care so I think a lot of it's
 

7321
02:22:39,120 --> 02:22:40,250
Health Care so I think a lot of it's
opposition

7322
02:22:40,250 --> 02:22:40,260
opposition
 

7323
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:42,290
opposition
do you like that idea the public option

7324
02:22:42,290 --> 02:22:42,300
do you like that idea the public option
 

7325
02:22:42,300 --> 02:22:45,110
do you like that idea the public option
maybe you can like because is there

7326
02:22:45,110 --> 02:22:45,120
maybe you can like because is there
 

7327
02:22:45,120 --> 02:22:47,270
maybe you can like because is there
complexities like pre-existing

7328
02:22:47,270 --> 02:22:47,280
complexities like pre-existing
 

7329
02:22:47,280 --> 02:22:49,070
complexities like pre-existing
conditions

7330
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:49,080
conditions
 

7331
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:52,370
conditions
so isn't a public option

7332
02:22:52,370 --> 02:22:52,380
so isn't a public option
 

7333
02:22:52,380 --> 02:22:54,469
so isn't a public option
mean you can not have any insurance

7334
02:22:54,469 --> 02:22:54,479
mean you can not have any insurance
 

7335
02:22:54,479 --> 02:22:56,690
mean you can not have any insurance
until you get into trouble

7336
02:22:56,690 --> 02:22:56,700
until you get into trouble
 

7337
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:58,550
until you get into trouble
and then you can if it covers

7338
02:22:58,550 --> 02:22:58,560
and then you can if it covers
 

7339
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,929
and then you can if it covers
pre-existing conditions just start

7340
02:22:59,929 --> 02:22:59,939
pre-existing conditions just start
 

7341
02:22:59,939 --> 02:23:01,550
pre-existing conditions just start
paying for insurance then therefore

7342
02:23:01,550 --> 02:23:01,560
paying for insurance then therefore
 

7343
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:02,770
paying for insurance then therefore
young people don't pay for insurance

7344
02:23:02,770 --> 02:23:02,780
young people don't pay for insurance
 

7345
02:23:02,780 --> 02:23:07,309
young people don't pay for insurance
isn't it better to go full in I don't

7346
02:23:07,309 --> 02:23:07,319
isn't it better to go full in I don't
 

7347
02:23:07,319 --> 02:23:08,870
isn't it better to go full in I don't
support a public option in part because

7348
02:23:08,870 --> 02:23:08,880
support a public option in part because
 

7349
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,790
support a public option in part because
I think if we allow politicians to just

7350
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:10,800
I think if we allow politicians to just
 

7351
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,830
I think if we allow politicians to just
say hey I support a public option well

7352
02:23:12,830 --> 02:23:12,840
say hey I support a public option well
 

7353
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:15,710
say hey I support a public option well
it's just kind of a way to Signal your

7354
02:23:15,710 --> 02:23:15,720
it's just kind of a way to Signal your
 

7355
02:23:15,720 --> 02:23:17,030
it's just kind of a way to Signal your
support for Universal Health Care would

7356
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:17,040
support for Universal Health Care would
 

7357
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,469
support for Universal Health Care would
give us nothing and I think that's what

7358
02:23:18,469 --> 02:23:18,479
give us nothing and I think that's what
 

7359
02:23:18,479 --> 02:23:20,929
give us nothing and I think that's what
we saw under with Biden a lot of other

7360
02:23:20,929 --> 02:23:20,939
we saw under with Biden a lot of other
 

7361
02:23:20,939 --> 02:23:22,969
we saw under with Biden a lot of other
politicians that have supported uh

7362
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:22,979
politicians that have supported uh
 

7363
02:23:22,979 --> 02:23:25,190
politicians that have supported uh
public option I think in practice if a

7364
02:23:25,190 --> 02:23:25,200
public option I think in practice if a
 

7365
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:26,809
public option I think in practice if a
public option is defined in such a way

7366
02:23:26,809 --> 02:23:26,819
public option is defined in such a way
 

7367
02:23:26,819 --> 02:23:28,849
public option is defined in such a way
that it just means

7368
02:23:28,849 --> 02:23:28,859
that it just means
 

7369
02:23:28,859 --> 02:23:30,590
that it just means
you you

7370
02:23:30,590 --> 02:23:30,600
you you
 

7371
02:23:30,600 --> 02:23:33,590
you you
um you know by default can just opt in

7372
02:23:33,590 --> 02:23:33,600
um you know by default can just opt in
 

7373
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:35,270
um you know by default can just opt in
to a public plan and let's say

7374
02:23:35,270 --> 02:23:35,280
to a public plan and let's say
 

7375
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:36,410
to a public plan and let's say
hypothetically you don't even have to

7376
02:23:36,410 --> 02:23:36,420
hypothetically you don't even have to
 

7377
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:38,690
hypothetically you don't even have to
pay for it then it's just a back door to

7378
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:38,700
pay for it then it's just a back door to
 

7379
02:23:38,700 --> 02:23:40,429
pay for it then it's just a back door to
universal healthcare really quickly

7380
02:23:40,429 --> 02:23:40,439
universal healthcare really quickly
 

7381
02:23:40,439 --> 02:23:42,050
universal healthcare really quickly
because I think the vast majority of

7382
02:23:42,050 --> 02:23:42,060
because I think the vast majority of
 

7383
02:23:42,060 --> 02:23:43,610
because I think the vast majority of
people who aren't currently covered and

7384
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:43,620
people who aren't currently covered and
 

7385
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:45,469
people who aren't currently covered and
also a lot of employers to be honest

7386
02:23:45,469 --> 02:23:45,479
also a lot of employers to be honest
 

7387
02:23:45,479 --> 02:23:47,030
also a lot of employers to be honest
would probably drop their private

7388
02:23:47,030 --> 02:23:47,040
would probably drop their private
 

7389
02:23:47,040 --> 02:23:48,590
would probably drop their private
coverage if they knew their employees

7390
02:23:48,590 --> 02:23:48,600
coverage if they knew their employees
 

7391
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:50,809
coverage if they knew their employees
can just get a public option and maybe

7392
02:23:50,809 --> 02:23:50,819
can just get a public option and maybe
 

7393
02:23:50,819 --> 02:23:52,190
can just get a public option and maybe
would only provide supplemental

7394
02:23:52,190 --> 02:23:52,200
would only provide supplemental
 

7395
02:23:52,200 --> 02:23:55,010
would only provide supplemental
insurance or or whatever else

7396
02:23:55,010 --> 02:23:55,020
insurance or or whatever else
 

7397
02:23:55,020 --> 02:23:58,550
insurance or or whatever else
um but I think the broad overarching

7398
02:23:58,550 --> 02:23:58,560
um but I think the broad overarching
 

7399
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,349
um but I think the broad overarching
point of all these demands is to say

7400
02:24:00,349 --> 02:24:00,359
point of all these demands is to say
 

7401
02:24:00,359 --> 02:24:01,270
point of all these demands is to say
that

7402
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:01,280
that
 

7403
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:03,710
that
socialists need to be really connected

7404
02:24:03,710 --> 02:24:03,720
socialists need to be really connected
 

7405
02:24:03,720 --> 02:24:06,410
socialists need to be really connected
to the day-to-day struggles of people to

7406
02:24:06,410 --> 02:24:06,420
to the day-to-day struggles of people to
 

7407
02:24:06,420 --> 02:24:08,090
to the day-to-day struggles of people to
just improve their lives

7408
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:08,100
just improve their lives
 

7409
02:24:08,100 --> 02:24:10,670
just improve their lives
so if you're feeling like you're paying

7410
02:24:10,670 --> 02:24:10,680
so if you're feeling like you're paying
 

7411
02:24:10,680 --> 02:24:13,370
so if you're feeling like you're paying
400 500 on the Obamacare market for

7412
02:24:13,370 --> 02:24:13,380
400 500 on the Obamacare market for
 

7413
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:15,349
400 500 on the Obamacare market for
health insurance and that's hampering

7414
02:24:15,349 --> 02:24:15,359
health insurance and that's hampering
 

7415
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:16,670
health insurance and that's hampering
your ability to do what you want to do

7416
02:24:16,670 --> 02:24:16,680
your ability to do what you want to do
 

7417
02:24:16,680 --> 02:24:18,410
your ability to do what you want to do
in your life then maybe you would

7418
02:24:18,410 --> 02:24:18,420
in your life then maybe you would
 

7419
02:24:18,420 --> 02:24:20,990
in your life then maybe you would
support a candidate who's for Universal

7420
02:24:20,990 --> 02:24:21,000
support a candidate who's for Universal
 

7421
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:23,450
support a candidate who's for Universal
Health Care if you feel like you're

7422
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:23,460
Health Care if you feel like you're
 

7423
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:26,510
Health Care if you feel like you're
struggling to find work that you could

7424
02:24:26,510 --> 02:24:26,520
struggling to find work that you could
 

7425
02:24:26,520 --> 02:24:28,429
struggling to find work that you could
afford to pay your rent with or whatever

7426
02:24:28,429 --> 02:24:28,439
afford to pay your rent with or whatever
 

7427
02:24:28,439 --> 02:24:30,110
afford to pay your rent with or whatever
else maybe it'll support a candidate

7428
02:24:30,110 --> 02:24:30,120
else maybe it'll support a candidate
 

7429
02:24:30,120 --> 02:24:32,270
else maybe it'll support a candidate
committed to

it's like these day-to-day concerns need
 

7441
02:24:44,819 --> 02:24:46,790
it's like these day-to-day concerns need
to be connected to the more abstract and

also free and it just feels like in
 

7559
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,889
also free and it just feels like in
terms of order of operation I would just

7560
02:26:57,889 --> 02:26:57,899
terms of order of operation I would just
 

7561
02:26:57,899 --> 02:27:01,070
terms of order of operation I would just
start with K-12 education improving it

7562
02:27:01,070 --> 02:27:01,080
start with K-12 education improving it
 

7563
02:27:01,080 --> 02:27:04,130
start with K-12 education improving it
and and whatever else then

7564
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:04,140
and and whatever else then
 

7565
02:27:04,140 --> 02:27:06,230
and and whatever else then
College after but I'm not opposed to it

7566
02:27:06,230 --> 02:27:06,240
College after but I'm not opposed to it
 

7567
02:27:06,240 --> 02:27:09,230
College after but I'm not opposed to it
so does that improving K-12 education

7568
02:27:09,230 --> 02:27:09,240
so does that improving K-12 education
 

7569
02:27:09,240 --> 02:27:11,690
so does that improving K-12 education
does that mean investing more into it is

7570
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:11,700
does that mean investing more into it is
 

7571
02:27:11,700 --> 02:27:13,550
does that mean investing more into it is
it as simple as just increasing the

7572
02:27:13,550 --> 02:27:13,560
it as simple as just increasing the
 

7573
02:27:13,560 --> 02:27:16,010
it as simple as just increasing the
amount of money that's invested in the

7574
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:16,020
amount of money that's invested in the
 

7575
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:18,110
amount of money that's invested in the
in public education in general when it

7576
02:27:18,110 --> 02:27:18,120
in public education in general when it
 

7577
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:19,730
in public education in general when it
comes to the public sector or any any

7578
02:27:19,730 --> 02:27:19,740
comes to the public sector or any any
 

7579
02:27:19,740 --> 02:27:21,349
comes to the public sector or any any
sphere that you're investing in uh

7580
02:27:21,349 --> 02:27:21,359
sphere that you're investing in uh
 

7581
02:27:21,359 --> 02:27:22,550
sphere that you're investing in uh
obviously it's not just as simple as

7582
02:27:22,550 --> 02:27:22,560
obviously it's not just as simple as
 

7583
02:27:22,560 --> 02:27:25,670
obviously it's not just as simple as
throwing money at a problem I do think

7584
02:27:25,670 --> 02:27:25,680
throwing money at a problem I do think
 

7585
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:28,670
throwing money at a problem I do think
we have a lot of schools that are um

7586

underfunded but we have other schools
 

7589
02:27:30,899 --> 02:27:32,510
underfunded but we have other schools
that are adequately funded but the

7590
02:27:32,510 --> 02:27:32,520
that are adequately funded but the
 

7591
02:27:32,520 --> 02:27:34,610
that are adequately funded but the
conditions in which those schools are

7592
02:27:34,610 --> 02:27:34,620
conditions in which those schools are
 

7593
02:27:34,620 --> 02:27:35,990
conditions in which those schools are
like the neighborhoods they're in and

7594
02:27:35,990 --> 02:27:36,000
like the neighborhoods they're in and
 

7595
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,690
like the neighborhoods they're in and
what's going on in society

7596
02:27:38,690 --> 02:27:38,700
what's going on in society
 

7597
02:27:38,700 --> 02:27:40,610
what's going on in society
um the problems are so deep that it's

7598
02:27:40,610 --> 02:27:40,620
um the problems are so deep that it's
 

7599
02:27:40,620 --> 02:27:42,410
um the problems are so deep that it's
impossible for just education to solve

7600
02:27:42,410 --> 02:27:42,420
impossible for just education to solve
 

7601
02:27:42,420 --> 02:27:44,150
impossible for just education to solve
everything and I think especially a lot

7602

02:27:59,270 --> 02:27:59,280
give them
 

7615
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:01,790
give them
everything they need to to succeed so

7616
02:28:01,790 --> 02:28:01,800
everything they need to to succeed so
 

7617
02:28:01,800 --> 02:28:04,010
everything they need to to succeed so
sometimes we I think put too much weight

7618
02:28:04,010 --> 02:28:04,020
sometimes we I think put too much weight
 

7619
02:28:04,020 --> 02:28:06,170
sometimes we I think put too much weight
on on education

7620
02:28:06,170 --> 02:28:06,180
on on education
 

7621
02:28:06,180 --> 02:28:07,910
on on education
and of course you can Define education

7622
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
and of course you can Define education
 

7623
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:10,250
and of course you can Define education
more broadly which is like

7624
02:28:10,250 --> 02:28:10,260
more broadly which is like
 

7625
02:28:10,260 --> 02:28:12,050
more broadly which is like
the care

7626
02:28:12,050 --> 02:28:12,060
the care
 

7627
02:28:12,060 --> 02:28:14,830
the care
of the flourishing of the young mind

7628
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:14,840
of the flourishing of the young mind
 

7629
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:17,809
of the flourishing of the young mind
whatever that is yeah whatever you call

whatever that is yeah whatever you call
this early yeah a lot of it starts with

02:28:19,370 --> 02:28:19,380
this early yeah a lot of it starts with
 

7633
02:28:19,380 --> 02:28:22,670
this early yeah a lot of it starts with
so New York City at least we do have

7634
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:22,680
so New York City at least we do have
 

7635
02:28:22,680 --> 02:28:26,210
so New York City at least we do have
um Universal Pre-K so from H3 onward you

7636
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:26,220
um Universal Pre-K so from H3 onward you
 

7637
02:28:26,220 --> 02:28:28,910
um Universal Pre-K so from H3 onward you
you have the option for that I mean it's

7638
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:28,920
you have the option for that I mean it's
 

7639
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:30,950
you have the option for that I mean it's
important for kids socialization you

7640
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:30,960
important for kids socialization you
 

7641
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:33,650
important for kids socialization you
know their parents are now able to you

7642
02:28:33,650 --> 02:28:33,660
know their parents are now able to you
 

7643
02:28:33,660 --> 02:28:35,570
know their parents are now able to you
know know that they could go to work or

7644
02:28:35,570 --> 02:28:35,580
know know that they could go to work or
 

7645
02:28:35,580 --> 02:28:37,309
know know that they could go to work or
do something else and have their you

7646
02:28:37,309 --> 02:28:37,319
do something else and have their you
 

7647
02:28:37,319 --> 02:28:39,170
do something else and have their you
know have their kids taken care of

7648
02:28:39,170 --> 02:28:39,180
know have their kids taken care of
 

7649
02:28:39,180 --> 02:28:40,550
know have their kids taken care of
um there's a lot of measures like that

7650
02:28:40,550 --> 02:28:40,560
um there's a lot of measures like that
 

7651
02:28:40,560 --> 02:28:43,250
um there's a lot of measures like that
that we could do to to equalize things

7652
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:43,260
that we could do to to equalize things
 

7653
02:28:43,260 --> 02:28:44,990
that we could do to to equalize things
and again

7654
02:28:44,990 --> 02:28:45,000
and again
 

7655
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,030
and again
for Libertarians in the audience you

7656
02:28:47,030 --> 02:28:47,040
for Libertarians in the audience you
 

7657
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:48,650
for Libertarians in the audience you
know some of this stuff is scary because

7658
02:28:48,650 --> 02:28:48,660
know some of this stuff is scary because
 

7659
02:28:48,660 --> 02:28:51,830
know some of this stuff is scary because
it's obviously more State involved State

7660
02:28:51,830 --> 02:28:51,840
it's obviously more State involved State
 

7661
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:53,510
it's obviously more State involved State
involved in pre-K

7662
02:28:53,510 --> 02:28:53,520
involved in pre-K
 

7663
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:55,910
involved in pre-K
State it's already very involved in K-12

7664
02:28:55,910 --> 02:28:55,920
State it's already very involved in K-12
 

7665
02:28:55,920 --> 02:28:58,250
State it's already very involved in K-12
more investment into State institutions

7666
02:28:58,250 --> 02:28:58,260
more investment into State institutions
 

7667
02:28:58,260 --> 02:29:01,790
more investment into State institutions
like um our our state universities and

7668
02:29:01,790 --> 02:29:01,800
like um our our state universities and
 

7669
02:29:01,800 --> 02:29:04,010
like um our our state universities and
in college but for me it's not a

7670
02:29:04,010 --> 02:29:04,020
in college but for me it's not a
 

7671
02:29:04,020 --> 02:29:06,469
in college but for me it's not a
question of State versus non-state it's

7672
02:29:06,469 --> 02:29:06,479
question of State versus non-state it's
 

7673
02:29:06,479 --> 02:29:08,270
question of State versus non-state it's
a question of

7674
02:29:08,270 --> 02:29:08,280
a question of
 

7675
02:29:08,280 --> 02:29:11,570
a question of
um you know good outcomes for for people

7676
02:29:11,570 --> 02:29:11,580
um you know good outcomes for for people
 

7677
02:29:11,580 --> 02:29:14,809
um you know good outcomes for for people
and it just happens to be that for

7678
02:29:14,809 --> 02:29:14,819
and it just happens to be that for
 

7679
02:29:14,819 --> 02:29:17,750
and it just happens to be that for
Working Class People

7680
02:29:17,750 --> 02:29:17,760
Working Class People
 

7681
02:29:17,760 --> 02:29:18,770
Working Class People
um

7682
02:29:18,770 --> 02:29:18,780
um
 

7683
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:20,750
um

for upper middle class people for others

02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:29,270
for upper middle class people for others
they can afford to pay for their own

like Obamacare like schemes where you

7696
02:29:33,110 --> 02:29:33,120
like Obamacare like schemes where you
 

7697
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,670
like Obamacare like schemes where you
just get a subsidy and you pay the rest

7698
02:29:34,670 --> 02:29:34,680
just get a subsidy and you pay the rest
 

7699

the bottom 40 plus of the population
 

7703
02:29:39,420 --> 02:29:41,450
the bottom 40 plus of the population
they really don't have any options so

7704
02:29:41,450 --> 02:29:41,460
they really don't have any options so
 

7705
02:29:41,460 --> 02:29:43,910
they really don't have any options so
they prioritize other things they end up

7706
02:29:43,910 --> 02:29:43,920
they prioritize other things they end up
 

7707
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:45,950
they prioritize other things they end up
with with some sort of injury or health

7708
02:29:45,950 --> 02:29:45,960
with with some sort of injury or health
 

7709
02:29:45,960 --> 02:29:47,570
with with some sort of injury or health
problem or whatever else and it's it's

7710
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:47,580
problem or whatever else and it's it's
 

7711
02:29:47,580 --> 02:29:49,250
problem or whatever else and it's it's
bad for everyone in society but

7712
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:49,260
bad for everyone in society but
 

7713
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:50,570
bad for everyone in society but
especially bad for the people at the

7714
02:29:50,570 --> 02:29:50,580
especially bad for the people at the
 

7715
02:29:50,580 --> 02:29:52,730
especially bad for the people at the
bottom of the the labor market so I saw

7716
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:52,740
bottom of the the labor market so I saw
 

7717
02:29:52,740 --> 02:29:54,889
bottom of the the labor market so I saw
various estimates for socialist programs

7718
02:29:54,889 --> 02:29:54,899
various estimates for socialist programs
 

7719
02:29:54,899 --> 02:29:56,570
various estimates for socialist programs
like Social Security expansion free

7720
02:29:56,570 --> 02:29:56,580
like Social Security expansion free
 

7721
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:57,530
like Social Security expansion free
college

7722
02:29:57,530 --> 02:29:57,540
college
 

7723
02:29:57,540 --> 02:30:01,010
college
uh Medicare for all will cost upwards of

7724
02:30:01,010 --> 02:30:01,020
uh Medicare for all will cost upwards of
 

7725
02:30:01,020 --> 02:30:03,710
uh Medicare for all will cost upwards of
40 trillion dollars over 10 years for

7726
02:30:03,710 --> 02:30:03,720
40 trillion dollars over 10 years for
 

7727
02:30:03,720 --> 02:30:05,990
40 trillion dollars over 10 years for
zero okay to give argue with those

7728
02:30:05,990 --> 02:30:06,000
zero okay to give argue with those
 

7729
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:09,050
zero okay to give argue with those
numbers and so on but so there's a cost

7730
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:09,060
numbers and so on but so there's a cost
 

7731
02:30:09,060 --> 02:30:14,030
numbers and so on but so there's a cost
there's a taxpayer cost what are

7732
02:30:14,030 --> 02:30:14,040
there's a taxpayer cost what are
 

7733
02:30:14,040 --> 02:30:16,490
there's a taxpayer cost what are
given the weight of that cost

7734
02:30:16,490 --> 02:30:16,500
given the weight of that cost
 

7735
02:30:16,500 --> 02:30:18,590
given the weight of that cost
uh can you still make the case with

7736
02:30:18,590 --> 02:30:18,600
uh can you still make the case with
 

7737
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:20,389
uh can you still make the case with
these programs and then can you try to

7738
02:30:20,389 --> 02:30:20,399
these programs and then can you try to
 

7739
02:30:20,399 --> 02:30:22,670
these programs and then can you try to
make the case against them that the cost

7740
02:30:22,670 --> 02:30:22,680
make the case against them that the cost
 

7741
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:26,270
make the case against them that the cost
is too high so I I will not argue with

7742
02:30:26,270 --> 02:30:26,280
is too high so I I will not argue with
 

7743
02:30:26,280 --> 02:30:27,410
is too high so I I will not argue with
you on the numbers because you just

7744
02:30:27,410 --> 02:30:27,420
you on the numbers because you just
 

7745
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:28,550
you on the numbers because you just
threat random numbers I do think

7746
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
threat random numbers I do think
 

7747
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,950
threat random numbers I do think
universal healthcare if Done Right can

7748
02:30:30,950 --> 02:30:30,960
universal healthcare if Done Right can
 

7749
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:32,570
universal healthcare if Done Right can
be basically cost neutral I think it's

7750
02:30:32,570 --> 02:30:32,580
be basically cost neutral I think it's
 

7751
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:34,670
be basically cost neutral I think it's
an exception because we spend a

7752
02:30:34,670 --> 02:30:34,680
an exception because we spend a
 

7753
02:30:34,680 --> 02:30:37,010
an exception because we spend a
tremendous amount of money on on Health

7754
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:37,020
tremendous amount of money on on Health
 

7755
02:30:37,020 --> 02:30:38,929
tremendous amount of money on on Health
Care a huge percentage of our GDP so I

7756
02:30:38,929 --> 02:30:38,939
Care a huge percentage of our GDP so I
 

7757
02:30:38,939 --> 02:30:40,429
Care a huge percentage of our GDP so I
think it could be done in a way that's

7758
02:30:40,429 --> 02:30:40,439
think it could be done in a way that's
 

7759
02:30:40,439 --> 02:30:41,750
think it could be done in a way that's
close to

7760
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
close to
 

7761
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:44,570
close to
um class neutral so especially can you

7762
02:30:44,570 --> 02:30:44,580
um class neutral so especially can you
 

7763
02:30:44,580 --> 02:30:46,670
um class neutral so especially can you
argue on the numbers without arguing on

7764
02:30:46,670 --> 02:30:46,680
argue on the numbers without arguing on
 

7765
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:48,590
argue on the numbers without arguing on
the numbers you're saying just your gut

7766
02:30:48,590 --> 02:30:48,600
the numbers you're saying just your gut
 

7767
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:50,929
the numbers you're saying just your gut
says that there's a lot of depending on

7768
02:30:50,929 --> 02:30:50,939
says that there's a lot of depending on
 

7769
02:30:50,939 --> 02:30:53,270
says that there's a lot of depending on
how these programs are done there's a

7770
02:30:53,270 --> 02:30:53,280
how these programs are done there's a
 

7771
02:30:53,280 --> 02:30:55,130
how these programs are done there's a
lot of variance in how much it will

7772
02:30:55,130 --> 02:30:55,140
lot of variance in how much it will
 

7773
02:30:55,140 --> 02:30:56,210
lot of variance in how much it will
actually cost there's a lot of

7774
02:30:56,210 --> 02:30:56,220
actually cost there's a lot of
 

7775
02:30:56,220 --> 02:30:57,650
actually cost there's a lot of
bureaucracy in Billing right now in our

7776
02:30:57,650 --> 02:30:57,660
bureaucracy in Billing right now in our
 

7777
02:30:57,660 --> 02:30:59,330
bureaucracy in Billing right now in our
Healthcare sector for example that would

7778
02:30:59,330 --> 02:30:59,340
Healthcare sector for example that would
 

7779
02:30:59,340 --> 02:31:00,410
Healthcare sector for example that would
be

7780
02:31:00,410 --> 02:31:00,420
be
 

7781
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:02,389
be
um eliminated

7782
02:31:02,389 --> 02:31:02,399
um eliminated
 

7783
02:31:02,399 --> 02:31:04,190
um eliminated
um there's a lot of costs that are

7784
02:31:04,190 --> 02:31:04,200
um there's a lot of costs that are
 

7785
02:31:04,200 --> 02:31:06,230
um there's a lot of costs that are
spiraling upward of Provider costs from

7786
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:06,240
spiraling upward of Provider costs from
 

7787
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,969
spiraling upward of Provider costs from
both Doctors Hospitals but also

7788
02:31:07,969 --> 02:31:07,979
both Doctors Hospitals but also

02:31:07,979 --> 02:31:10,250
both Doctors Hospitals but also
Pharmaceuticals of drug costs that

7790
02:31:10,250 --> 02:31:10,260
Pharmaceuticals of drug costs that
 

7791
02:31:10,260 --> 02:31:12,650
Pharmaceuticals of drug costs that
insurance companies shoulder because the

7792
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:12,660
insurance companies shoulder because the
 

7793
02:31:12,660 --> 02:31:14,870
insurance companies shoulder because the
their market share is too fragmented to

7794
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
their market share is too fragmented to
 

7795
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,809
their market share is too fragmented to
really negotiate hard

7796
02:31:17,809 --> 02:31:17,819
really negotiate hard
 

7797
02:31:17,819 --> 02:31:19,429
really negotiate hard
um Medicare could sometimes negotiate

7798
02:31:19,429 --> 02:31:19,439
um Medicare could sometimes negotiate
 

7799
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:20,870
um Medicare could sometimes negotiate
better rates but a Medicare for all

7800
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:20,880
better rates but a Medicare for all
 

7801
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:22,309
better rates but a Medicare for all
would negotiate even better rates so I

7802
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:22,319
would negotiate even better rates so I
 

7803
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:23,750
would negotiate even better rates so I
think there's a cost spiral that we can

7804
02:31:23,750 --> 02:31:23,760
think there's a cost spiral that we can
 

7805
02:31:23,760 --> 02:31:25,610
think there's a cost spiral that we can
adjust with more government

7806
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:25,620
adjust with more government
 

7807
02:31:25,620 --> 02:31:27,590
adjust with more government
um involvement and there's a reason why

7808
02:31:27,590 --> 02:31:27,600
um involvement and there's a reason why
 

7809
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,570
um involvement and there's a reason why
we spend a bigger share of our GDP on

7810
02:31:29,570 --> 02:31:29,580
we spend a bigger share of our GDP on
 

7811
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:32,510
we spend a bigger share of our GDP on
health care than other places but but

7812
02:31:32,510 --> 02:31:32,520
health care than other places but but
 

7813
02:31:32,520 --> 02:31:34,490
health care than other places but but
let me just accept the broad premise

7814
02:31:34,490 --> 02:31:34,500
let me just accept the broad premise
 

7815
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:37,010
let me just accept the broad premise
that social programs cost money

7816
02:31:37,010 --> 02:31:37,020
that social programs cost money
 

7817
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:38,450
that social programs cost money
um

7818
02:31:38,450 --> 02:31:38,460
um
 

7819
02:31:38,460 --> 02:31:40,010
um
now

7820
02:31:40,010 --> 02:31:40,020
now
 

7821
02:31:40,020 --> 02:31:43,429
now
I think that that one for ordinary

7822
02:31:43,429 --> 02:31:43,439
I think that that one for ordinary
 

7823
02:31:43,439 --> 02:31:46,550
I think that that one for ordinary
people most of them

7824
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:46,560
people most of them
 

7825
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:49,010
people most of them
the trade-off of even hypothetically if

7826
02:31:49,010 --> 02:31:49,020
the trade-off of even hypothetically if
 

7827
02:31:49,020 --> 02:31:51,290
the trade-off of even hypothetically if
if taxes on

7828
02:31:51,290 --> 02:31:51,300
if taxes on
 

7829
02:31:51,300 --> 02:31:52,730
if taxes on
um lower middle class and Working Class

7830
02:31:52,730 --> 02:31:52,740
um lower middle class and Working Class
 

7831
02:31:52,740 --> 02:31:56,389
um lower middle class and Working Class
People in certain cases go up the

7832
02:31:56,389 --> 02:31:56,399
People in certain cases go up the
 

7833
02:31:56,399 --> 02:31:57,590
People in certain cases go up the
trade-off would still be in their

7834
02:31:57,590 --> 02:31:57,600
trade-off would still be in their
 

7835
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:59,990
trade-off would still be in their
benefit because they're the ones who

7836
02:31:59,990 --> 02:32:00,000
benefit because they're the ones who
 

7837
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,630
benefit because they're the ones who
currently who would be consuming more of

7838
02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:02,640
currently who would be consuming more of
 

7839
02:32:02,640 --> 02:32:05,990
currently who would be consuming more of
those goods and also our tax system and

7840
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,000
those goods and also our tax system and
 

7841
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,510
those goods and also our tax system and
whatnot is Progressive so the the rich

7842
02:32:08,510 --> 02:32:08,520
whatnot is Progressive so the the rich
 

7843
02:32:08,520 --> 02:32:10,550
whatnot is Progressive so the the rich
will pay pay more

7844
02:32:10,550 --> 02:32:10,560
will pay pay more
 

7845
02:32:10,560 --> 02:32:13,010
will pay pay more
the majority will consume

7846
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:13,020
the majority will consume
 

7847
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:15,950
the majority will consume
um more of them also I think a lot of

7848
02:32:15,950 --> 02:32:15,960
um more of them also I think a lot of
 

7849
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:17,750
um more of them also I think a lot of
these programs are the Bedrock of a

7850
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:17,760
these programs are the Bedrock of a
 

7851
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,490
these programs are the Bedrock of a
healthy Society

7852
02:32:19,490 --> 02:32:19,500
healthy Society
 

7853
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:23,809
healthy Society
so one reason for example that we have

7854
02:32:23,809 --> 02:32:23,819
so one reason for example that we have
 

7855
02:32:23,819 --> 02:32:25,969
so one reason for example that we have
um so much crime and violence in the US

7856
02:32:25,969 --> 02:32:25,979
um so much crime and violence in the US
 

7857
02:32:25,979 --> 02:32:27,830
um so much crime and violence in the US
there's lots of you know cultural and

7858
02:32:27,830 --> 02:32:27,840
there's lots of you know cultural and
 

7859
02:32:27,840 --> 02:32:30,650
there's lots of you know cultural and
other causes with our level of gun

7860
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:30,660
other causes with our level of gun
 

7861
02:32:30,660 --> 02:32:33,170
other causes with our level of gun
ownership American history and and so on

7862
02:32:33,170 --> 02:32:33,180
ownership American history and and so on
 

7863
02:32:33,180 --> 02:32:36,770
ownership American history and and so on
but one one really important factor is

7864
02:32:36,770 --> 02:32:36,780
but one one really important factor is
 

7865
02:32:36,780 --> 02:32:39,110
but one one really important factor is
just the level of poverty and inequality

7866
02:32:39,110 --> 02:32:39,120
just the level of poverty and inequality
 

7867
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:40,849
just the level of poverty and inequality
in the US compared to other other

7868
02:32:40,849 --> 02:32:40,859
in the US compared to other other
 

7869
02:32:40,859 --> 02:32:43,250
in the US compared to other other
countries that combined with guns and

7870
02:32:43,250 --> 02:32:43,260
countries that combined with guns and
 

7871
02:32:43,260 --> 02:32:45,650
countries that combined with guns and
and other factors means we live in more

7872
02:32:45,650 --> 02:32:45,660
and other factors means we live in more
 

7873
02:32:45,660 --> 02:32:47,809
and other factors means we live in more
violent unequal societies if you know a

7874
02:32:47,809 --> 02:32:47,819
violent unequal societies if you know a
 

7875
02:32:47,819 --> 02:32:50,389
violent unequal societies if you know a
European would be shocked by the fact

7876
02:32:50,389 --> 02:32:50,399
European would be shocked by the fact
 

7877
02:32:50,399 --> 02:32:52,910
European would be shocked by the fact
that in even some of our our nicest

7878
02:32:52,910 --> 02:32:52,920
that in even some of our our nicest
 

7879
02:32:52,920 --> 02:32:55,429
that in even some of our our nicest
areas and our and cities and elsewhere

7880
02:32:55,429 --> 02:32:55,439
areas and our and cities and elsewhere
 

7881
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:56,630
areas and our and cities and elsewhere
because there's a lot of rural violence

7882
02:32:56,630 --> 02:32:56,640
because there's a lot of rural violence
 

7883
02:32:56,640 --> 02:33:00,050
because there's a lot of rural violence
too it's just normal to have gun uh

7884
02:33:00,050 --> 02:33:00,060
too it's just normal to have gun uh
 

7885
02:33:00,060 --> 02:33:02,330
too it's just normal to have gun uh
violence it's normal to have uh

7886
02:33:02,330 --> 02:33:02,340
violence it's normal to have uh
 

7887
02:33:02,340 --> 02:33:05,150
violence it's normal to have uh
drug-related violence you know the we

7888
02:33:05,150 --> 02:33:05,160
drug-related violence you know the we
 

7889
02:33:05,160 --> 02:33:07,910
drug-related violence you know the we
have what like four or 500 people some

7890
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:07,920
have what like four or 500 people some
 

7891
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:10,190
have what like four or 500 people some
years in like Baltimore like a city of

02:33:10,190 --> 02:33:10,200
years in like Baltimore like a city of
 

7893
02:33:10,200 --> 02:33:12,590

like crazy because you're not gonna go

7902
02:33:21,770 --> 02:33:21,780
like crazy because you're not gonna go

whatever else like the the rot goes very

7908
02:33:27,889 --> 02:33:27,899
whatever else like the the rot goes very
 

7909
02:33:27,899 --> 02:33:30,469
whatever else like the the rot goes very
deep and a welfare state is one way to

7910
02:33:30,469 --> 02:33:30,479
deep and a welfare state is one way to
 

7911
02:33:30,479 --> 02:33:34,250
deep and a welfare state is one way to
to live in a better Society for everyone

to live in a better Society for everyone
 

7913
02:33:34,260 --> 02:33:36,590
to live in a better Society for everyone
um there's been plenty of of studies uh

7914
02:33:36,590 --> 02:33:36,600
um there's been plenty of of studies uh
 

7915
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:38,030
um there's been plenty of of studies uh
there's one book called the spirit level

7916
02:33:38,030 --> 02:33:38,040
there's one book called the spirit level
 

7917
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:40,790
there's one book called the spirit level
on um on inequality that was quite

7918
02:33:40,790 --> 02:33:40,800
on um on inequality that was quite
 

7919
02:33:40,800 --> 02:33:42,770
on um on inequality that was quite
popular that just notes that inequality

7920
02:33:42,770 --> 02:33:42,780
popular that just notes that inequality
 

7921

is really terrible for the psyches

7922
02:33:45,889 --> 02:33:45,899

poor so I think uh spending some more
 

7927
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:53,450
poor so I think uh spending some more
money living in more just Society is is

7928
02:33:53,450 --> 02:33:53,460
money living in more just Society is is
 

7929
02:33:53,460 --> 02:33:55,849
money living in more just Society is is
doable there's different ways to to

7930
02:33:55,849 --> 02:33:55,859

7931
02:33:55,859 --> 02:33:57,889
doable there's different ways to to
address certain costs

7932
02:33:57,889 --> 02:33:57,899
address certain costs
 

7933
02:33:57,899 --> 02:34:00,290
address certain costs
um spirals one reason why our welfare

7934
02:34:00,290 --> 02:34:00,300
um spirals one reason why our welfare
 

7935
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:02,570
um spirals one reason why our welfare
states are getting more and more

7936
02:34:02,570 --> 02:34:02,580
states are getting more and more
 

7937
02:34:02,580 --> 02:34:04,429
states are getting more and more
expensive is in part just because our

7938
02:34:04,429 --> 02:34:04,439
expensive is in part just because our
 

7939
02:34:04,439 --> 02:34:07,370
expensive is in part just because our
population is is aging but many of the

7940
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:07,380
population is is aging but many of the
 

7941
02:34:07,380 --> 02:34:09,530
population is is aging but many of the
same people who say we can't afford

7942
02:34:09,530 --> 02:34:09,540
same people who say we can't afford
 

7943
02:34:09,540 --> 02:34:12,410
same people who say we can't afford
um more in our welfare states because

7944
02:34:12,410 --> 02:34:12,420
um more in our welfare states because
 

7945
02:34:12,420 --> 02:34:13,670
um more in our welfare states because
um you know we're already spending so

7946
02:34:13,670 --> 02:34:13,680
um you know we're already spending so
 

7947
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:14,870
um you know we're already spending so
much on Social Security and all these

7948
02:34:14,870 --> 02:34:14,880
much on Social Security and all these
 

7949
02:34:14,880 --> 02:34:16,550
much on Social Security and all these
other entitlements are the same people

7950
02:34:16,550 --> 02:34:16,560
other entitlements are the same people
 

7951
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:20,750
other entitlements are the same people
also for one you know closing borders so

7952
02:34:20,750 --> 02:34:20,760
also for one you know closing borders so
 

7953
02:34:20,760 --> 02:34:23,870
also for one you know closing borders so
immigrants can't come in uh to to help

7954
02:34:23,870 --> 02:34:23,880
immigrants can't come in uh to to help
 

7955
02:34:23,880 --> 02:34:26,330
immigrants can't come in uh to to help
build the economy and to fill gaps in

7956
02:34:26,330 --> 02:34:26,340
build the economy and to fill gaps in
 

7957
02:34:26,340 --> 02:34:29,270
build the economy and to fill gaps in
the economy and also who aren't for

02:34:29,270 --> 02:34:29,280
the economy and also who aren't for
 

7959
02:34:29,280 --> 02:34:30,650
the economy and also who aren't for
things that'll make it easier to have

7960
02:34:30,650 --> 02:34:30,660
things that'll make it easier to have
 

7961
02:34:30,660 --> 02:34:34,130
things that'll make it easier to have
kids you know I'm uh 33 years old I have

7962
02:34:34,130 --> 02:34:34,140
kids you know I'm uh 33 years old I have
 

7963
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:35,690
kids you know I'm uh 33 years old I have
a lot of friends

7964
02:34:35,690 --> 02:34:35,700
a lot of friends
 

7965
02:34:35,700 --> 02:34:37,790
a lot of friends
um who have been putting them off having

7966
02:34:37,790 --> 02:34:37,800
um who have been putting them off having
 

7967
02:34:37,800 --> 02:34:39,950
um who have been putting them off having
kids until they save up x amount of

7968
02:34:39,950 --> 02:34:39,960
kids until they save up x amount of
 

7969
02:34:39,960 --> 02:34:41,450
kids until they save up x amount of
dollars even though they have someone

7970
02:34:41,450 --> 02:34:41,460
dollars even though they have someone
 

7971
02:34:41,460 --> 02:34:44,270
dollars even though they have someone
they could you know uh raise raise

7972
02:34:44,270 --> 02:34:44,280
they could you know uh raise raise
 

7973
02:34:44,280 --> 02:34:46,130
they could you know uh raise raise
children with

7974
02:34:46,130 --> 02:34:46,140
children with
 

7975
02:34:46,140 --> 02:34:48,110
children with
um because they can't afford the cost of

7976
02:34:48,110 --> 02:34:48,120
um because they can't afford the cost of
 

7977
02:34:48,120 --> 02:34:50,389
um because they can't afford the cost of
child care they can't they can't you

7978
02:34:50,389 --> 02:34:50,399
child care they can't they can't you
 

7979
02:34:50,399 --> 02:34:51,710
child care they can't they can't you
know their job probably won't give them

7980
02:34:51,710 --> 02:34:51,720
know their job probably won't give them
 

7981
02:34:51,720 --> 02:34:53,750
know their job probably won't give them
more than four or six weeks of of um

7982
02:34:53,750 --> 02:34:53,760
more than four or six weeks of of um
 

7983
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:55,849
more than four or six weeks of of um
family leave or whatever else like this

7984
02:34:55,849 --> 02:34:55,859
family leave or whatever else like this
 

7985
02:34:55,859 --> 02:34:58,010
family leave or whatever else like this
is not the case in other other countries

7986
02:34:58,010 --> 02:34:58,020
is not the case in other other countries
 

7987
02:34:58,020 --> 02:34:59,809
is not the case in other other countries
so I think there's all sorts of benefits

7988
02:34:59,809 --> 02:34:59,819
so I think there's all sorts of benefits
 

7989
02:34:59,819 --> 02:35:03,170
so I think there's all sorts of benefits
from having a bigger uh welfare state

7990
02:35:03,170 --> 02:35:03,180
from having a bigger uh welfare state
 

7991
02:35:03,180 --> 02:35:05,929
from having a bigger uh welfare state
but yes there are costs and there are

7992
02:35:05,929 --> 02:35:05,939
but yes there are costs and there are
 

7993
02:35:05,939 --> 02:35:07,849
but yes there are costs and there are
going to be certain trade-offs it's not

7994
02:35:07,849 --> 02:35:07,859
going to be certain trade-offs it's not
 

7995
02:35:07,859 --> 02:35:10,370
going to be certain trade-offs it's not
a magical thing where you could just you

7996
02:35:10,370 --> 02:35:10,380
a magical thing where you could just you
 

7997
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:12,110
a magical thing where you could just you
know have everything without trade-offs

7998
02:35:12,110 --> 02:35:12,120
know have everything without trade-offs
 

7999
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:15,410
know have everything without trade-offs
so in a progressive Tech system

8000
02:35:15,410 --> 02:35:15,420
so in a progressive Tech system
 

8001
02:35:15,420 --> 02:35:17,210
so in a progressive Tech system
is there

8002
02:35:17,210 --> 02:35:17,220
is there
 

8003
02:35:17,220 --> 02:35:20,630
is there
to to push back on the costs here

8004
02:35:20,630 --> 02:35:20,640
to to push back on the costs here
 

8005
02:35:20,640 --> 02:35:24,469
to to push back on the costs here
is there a point at which taxing the

8006
02:35:24,469 --> 02:35:24,479
is there a point at which taxing the
 

8007
02:35:24,479 --> 02:35:25,730
is there a point at which taxing the
rich

8008
02:35:25,730 --> 02:35:25,740
rich
 

8009
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:27,950
rich
uh is counterproductive in the long term

8010
02:35:27,950 --> 02:35:27,960
uh is counterproductive in the long term
 

8011
02:35:27,960 --> 02:35:29,450
uh is counterproductive in the long term
so in the short term there might be a

8012
02:35:29,450 --> 02:35:29,460
so in the short term there might be a
 

8013
02:35:29,460 --> 02:35:32,929
so in the short term there might be a
net benefit of increasing taxes

8014
02:35:32,929 --> 02:35:32,939
net benefit of increasing taxes
 

8015
02:35:32,939 --> 02:35:34,610
net benefit of increasing taxes
um because the programs the middle class

8016
02:35:34,610 --> 02:35:34,620
um because the programs the middle class
 

8017
02:35:34,620 --> 02:35:36,770
um because the programs the middle class
the lower middle class gets is more

8018
02:35:36,770 --> 02:35:36,780
the lower middle class gets is more
 

8019
02:35:36,780 --> 02:35:38,110
the lower middle class gets is more
beneficial

8020
02:35:38,110 --> 02:35:38,120
beneficial
 

8021
02:35:38,120 --> 02:35:41,150
beneficial
is there is there a negative side to

8022
02:35:41,150 --> 02:35:41,160
is there is there a negative side to
 

8023
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:42,830
is there is there a negative side to
taxing the rich

8024
02:35:42,830 --> 02:35:42,840
taxing the rich
 

8025
02:35:42,840 --> 02:35:45,770
taxing the rich
in theory yes of course so one would be

8026
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:45,780
in theory yes of course so one would be
 

8027
02:35:45,780 --> 02:35:47,750
in theory yes of course so one would be
um if you tax the rich so much

8028
02:35:47,750 --> 02:35:47,760
um if you tax the rich so much
 

8029
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:49,849
um if you tax the rich so much
they change their consumption patterns

8030
02:35:49,849 --> 02:35:49,859
they change their consumption patterns
 

8031
02:35:49,859 --> 02:35:51,950
they change their consumption patterns
and that has negative impacts on the

8032
02:35:51,950 --> 02:35:51,960
and that has negative impacts on the
 

8033
02:35:51,960 --> 02:35:54,530
and that has negative impacts on the
economy as a whole that you like you

8034
02:35:54,530 --> 02:35:54,540
economy as a whole that you like you
 

8035
02:35:54,540 --> 02:35:56,389
economy as a whole that you like you
would have to kind of really model it

8036
02:35:56,389 --> 02:35:56,399
would have to kind of really model it
 

8037
02:35:56,399 --> 02:35:57,710
would have to kind of really model it
out but there would be a certain point

8038
02:35:57,710 --> 02:35:57,720
out but there would be a certain point
 

8039
02:35:57,720 --> 02:36:01,250
out but there would be a certain point
in which the consumption changes might

8040
02:36:01,250 --> 02:36:01,260
in which the consumption changes might
 

8041
02:36:01,260 --> 02:36:04,309
in which the consumption changes might
have net detrimental effects

8042
02:36:04,309 --> 02:36:04,319
have net detrimental effects
 

8043
02:36:04,319 --> 02:36:07,130
have net detrimental effects
um I think that's more unlikely and the

8044
02:36:07,130 --> 02:36:07,140
um I think that's more unlikely and the
 

8045
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:09,530
um I think that's more unlikely and the
more likely scenario is you tax

8046
02:36:09,530 --> 02:36:09,540
more likely scenario is you tax
 

8047
02:36:09,540 --> 02:36:12,650
more likely scenario is you tax
corporations and and other

8048
02:36:12,650 --> 02:36:12,660
corporations and and other
 

8049
02:36:12,660 --> 02:36:15,889
corporations and and other
um uh wealthy you know people in society

8050
02:36:15,889 --> 02:36:15,899
um uh wealthy you know people in society
 

8051
02:36:15,899 --> 02:36:17,389
um uh wealthy you know people in society
to the point that

8052
02:36:17,389 --> 02:36:17,399
to the point that
 

8053
02:36:17,399 --> 02:36:20,929
to the point that
um they have potentially less money for

8054
02:36:20,929 --> 02:36:20,939
um they have potentially less money for
 

8055
02:36:20,939 --> 02:36:23,210
um they have potentially less money for
productive investment because you're in

8056
02:36:23,210 --> 02:36:23,220
productive investment because you're in
 

8057
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:25,309
productive investment because you're in
a capital Society so you're relying on

8058
02:36:25,309 --> 02:36:25,319
a capital Society so you're relying on
 

8059
02:36:25,319 --> 02:36:26,809
a capital Society so you're relying on
capitalists to invest

8060
02:36:26,809 --> 02:36:26,819
capitalists to invest
 

8061
02:36:26,819 --> 02:36:28,610
capitalists to invest
so you kind of don't want to be in the

8062
02:36:28,610 --> 02:36:28,620
so you kind of don't want to be in the
 

8063
02:36:28,620 --> 02:36:30,710
so you kind of don't want to be in the
worst of Both Worlds where you've gone

8064
02:36:30,710 --> 02:36:30,720
worst of Both Worlds where you've gone
 

8065
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:32,510
worst of Both Worlds where you've gone
too far for capitalism but not far

8066
02:36:32,510 --> 02:36:32,520
too far for capitalism but not far
 

8067
02:36:32,520 --> 02:36:34,130
too far for capitalism but not far
enough for socialism

8068
02:36:34,130 --> 02:36:34,140
enough for socialism
 

8069
02:36:34,140 --> 02:36:37,010
enough for socialism
um and my vision of course of socialism

8070
02:36:37,010 --> 02:36:37,020
um and my vision of course of socialism
 

8071
02:36:37,020 --> 02:36:39,170
um and my vision of course of socialism
that's one reason why we'd have to take

8072
02:36:39,170 --> 02:36:39,180
that's one reason why we'd have to take
 

8073
02:36:39,180 --> 02:36:41,510
that's one reason why we'd have to take
the investment function away from

8074
02:36:41,510 --> 02:36:41,520
the investment function away from
 

8075
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:43,969
the investment function away from
kaplers there has to be if you're gonna

8076
02:36:43,969 --> 02:36:43,979
kaplers there has to be if you're gonna
 

8077
02:36:43,979 --> 02:36:46,190
kaplers there has to be if you're gonna
make it so hard for them that they can't

8078
02:36:46,190 --> 02:36:46,200
make it so hard for them that they can't
 

8079
02:36:46,200 --> 02:36:49,010
make it so hard for them that they can't
invest or they can't employ labor the

8080
02:36:49,010 --> 02:36:49,020
invest or they can't employ labor the
 

8081
02:36:49,020 --> 02:36:50,690
invest or they can't employ labor the
way they're employing now you have to

8082
02:36:50,690 --> 02:36:50,700
way they're employing now you have to
 

8083
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:53,210
way they're employing now you have to
create another mechanism for Supply to

8084
02:36:53,210 --> 02:36:53,220
create another mechanism for Supply to
 

8085
02:36:53,220 --> 02:36:55,969
create another mechanism for Supply to
be created and that's why that's a

8086
02:36:55,969 --> 02:36:55,979
be created and that's why that's a
 

8087
02:36:55,979 --> 02:36:57,950
be created and that's why that's a

pretty close to correct and a journalist
 

8911
02:52:38,279 --> 02:52:39,469
pretty close to correct and a journalist
would just look at him like he's from

outer space to some extent this also
happens on to people on the right you

8916
02:52:43,429 --> 02:52:43,439
happens on to people on the right you
 

8917
02:52:43,439 --> 02:52:45,290
happens on to people on the right you
know people on the right often say

8918
02:52:45,290 --> 02:52:45,300
know people on the right often say
 

8919
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:49,070
know people on the right often say
things that I find uh repulsive or or

8921
02:52:49,080 --> 02:52:51,650
things that I find uh repulsive or or
just wrong but

8922
02:52:51,650 --> 02:52:51,660
just wrong but
 

8923
02:52:51,660 --> 02:52:53,929
just wrong but
there's parts of the media that would

8924
02:52:53,929 --> 02:52:53,939
there's parts of the media that would
 

8925
02:52:53,939 --> 02:52:56,410
there's parts of the media that would
describe their certain views as

8926
02:52:56,410 --> 02:52:56,420
describe their certain views as
 

8927
02:52:56,420 --> 02:52:59,210
describe their certain views as
illegitimate or outside this boundaries

8928
02:52:59,210 --> 02:52:59,220
illegitimate or outside this boundaries
 

8929
02:52:59,220 --> 02:53:01,490
illegitimate or outside this boundaries
of acceptable conversation I think there

8930
02:53:01,490 --> 02:53:01,500
of acceptable conversation I think there
 

8931
02:53:01,500 --> 02:53:03,230
of acceptable conversation I think there
should be a few things outside the

8932
02:53:03,230 --> 02:53:03,240
should be a few things outside the
 

8933
02:53:03,240 --> 02:53:05,750
should be a few things outside the
boundary of acceptable conversation you

8934
02:53:05,750 --> 02:53:05,760
boundary of acceptable conversation you
 

8935
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:08,150
boundary of acceptable conversation you
know hate speech and and so on

8936
02:53:08,150 --> 02:53:08,160
know hate speech and and so on
 

8937
02:53:08,160 --> 02:53:11,330
know hate speech and and so on
um but like there's this attempt to say

8938
02:53:11,330 --> 02:53:11,340
um but like there's this attempt to say
 

8939
02:53:11,340 --> 02:53:13,969
um but like there's this attempt to say
their views are illegitimate and

8940
02:53:13,969 --> 02:53:13,979
their views are illegitimate and
 

8941
02:53:13,979 --> 02:53:15,469
their views are illegitimate and
therefore anyone who votes for them for

8942
02:53:15,469 --> 02:53:15,479
therefore anyone who votes for them for
 

8943
02:53:15,479 --> 02:53:17,630
therefore anyone who votes for them for
any reason is illegitimate too and

8944
02:53:17,630 --> 02:53:17,640
any reason is illegitimate too and
 

8945
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:19,309
any reason is illegitimate too and
that's one reason why I think it fueled

8946
02:53:19,309 --> 02:53:19,319
that's one reason why I think it fueled
 

8947
02:53:19,319 --> 02:53:21,590
that's one reason why I think it fueled
a lot of resentment and it will

8948
02:53:21,590 --> 02:53:21,600
a lot of resentment and it will
 

8949
02:53:21,600 --> 02:53:23,510
a lot of resentment and it will
ultimately end up feeling

8950
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:23,520
ultimately end up feeling
 

8951
02:53:23,520 --> 02:53:25,910
ultimately end up feeling
um the extremes of American politics and

8952
02:53:25,910 --> 02:53:25,920
um the extremes of American politics and
 

8953
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:27,349
um the extremes of American politics and
people feel like you know they're

8954
02:53:27,349 --> 02:53:27,359

02:53:27,359 --> 02:53:28,910
people feel like you know they're
they're not being listened to

02:53:30,960 --> 02:53:33,530
yeah and some of it is also style
speaking and personality

02:53:33,530 --> 02:53:33,540

of out of this Bernie wave of the first
 

9079
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:51,050
of out of this Bernie wave of the first
set of Bernie candidates in 2018 that

02:56:03,830 --> 02:56:03,840
deep blue District
 

9093
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:05,269
deep blue District

02:56:13,490 --> 02:56:13,500
re-election or talk to but modulate your
 

9101
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,050
re-election or talk to but modulate your
rhetoric to win over swing Motors in

rhetoric to win over swing Motors in
 

9103
02:56:15,060 --> 02:56:16,370
rhetoric to win over swing Motors in
your District but then you're

02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:16,380
your District but then you're
 

9105
02:56:16,380 --> 02:56:18,170
your District but then you're

attacks on her from the right and also
this media attention and this notoriety

9196

um ineffective quite frankly in the last

9212
02:58:21,110 --> 02:58:21,120
um ineffective quite frankly in the last
 

9213
02:58:21,120 --> 02:58:23,269
um ineffective quite frankly in the last
year making that transition whereas I

9214
02:58:23,269 --> 02:58:23,279
year making that transition whereas I
 

9215
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:24,830
year making that transition whereas I
think other politicians who are not so

9216
02:58:24,830 --> 02:58:24,840
think other politicians who are not so
 

9217
02:58:24,840 --> 02:58:26,570
think other politicians who are not so
far left

9218
02:58:26,570 --> 02:58:26,580

let's say a John Federman has managed to
 

9223
02:58:30,899 --> 02:58:32,450
let's say a John Federman has managed to
become more effective and I don't think

9224
02:58:32,450 --> 02:58:32,460
become more effective and I don't think
 

9225
02:58:32,460 --> 02:58:34,190
become more effective and I don't think
it's a question of character or whatever

9226

03:02:17,580 --> 03:02:20,809
that leads to outrage and then walking
through that fire with Grace

because I would have rather a whole

9876
03:10:47,090 --> 03:10:47,100
because I would have rather a whole
 

9877
03:10:47,100 --> 03:10:50,510
because I would have rather a whole
campaign cycle about health care and

jobs and other other issues
yeah I'll yeah and this is the the hope

9882
03:10:57,110 --> 03:10:57,120
yeah I'll yeah and this is the the hope
 

9883
03:10:57,120 --> 03:10:58,849

is that people just get better at that

9884
03:10:58,849 --> 03:10:58,859
is that people just get better at that
 

9885

is that people just get better at that
kind of uh Social Media communication so

9886
03:11:01,010 --> 03:11:01,020
kind of uh Social Media communication so
 

9887
03:11:01,020 --> 03:11:03,290
kind of uh Social Media communication so
I do actually think there's something

9888
03:11:03,290 --> 03:11:03,300
I do actually think there's something
 

9889
03:11:03,300 --> 03:11:06,050
I do actually think there's something
about doing political speeches that

9890
03:11:06,050 --> 03:11:06,060
about doing political speeches that
 

9891
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:08,090
about doing political speeches that
makes you sound less authentic

9892
03:11:08,090 --> 03:11:08,100
makes you sound less authentic
 

9893
03:11:08,100 --> 03:11:10,429
makes you sound less authentic
because you have to like

9894
03:11:10,429 --> 03:11:10,439
because you have to like
 

9895
03:11:10,439 --> 03:11:12,469
because you have to like
do so many of them

9896
03:11:12,469 --> 03:11:12,479
do so many of them
 

9897
03:11:12,479 --> 03:11:15,290
do so many of them
it's it must be exhausting to like day

9898
03:11:15,290 --> 03:11:15,300
it's it must be exhausting to like day
 

9899
03:11:15,300 --> 03:11:17,570
it's it must be exhausting to like day
after day after day make the speech

9900
03:11:17,570 --> 03:11:17,580
after day after day make the speech
 

9901
03:11:17,580 --> 03:11:20,389
after day after day make the speech
you're going to start uh sort of

9902
03:11:20,389 --> 03:11:20,399
you're going to start uh sort of
 

9903
03:11:20,399 --> 03:11:21,830
you're going to start uh sort of
replaying the same stuff over and over

9904
03:11:21,830 --> 03:11:21,840
replaying the same stuff over and over
 

9905
03:11:21,840 --> 03:11:23,330
replaying the same stuff over and over
as opposed to actually thinking about

9906
03:11:23,330 --> 03:11:23,340
as opposed to actually thinking about
 

9907
03:11:23,340 --> 03:11:24,650
as opposed to actually thinking about
the words that are coming out of your

9908
03:11:24,650 --> 03:11:24,660
the words that are coming out of your
 

9909
03:11:24,660 --> 03:11:27,110
the words that are coming out of your
mouth and then the public will know that

9910
03:11:27,110 --> 03:11:27,120
mouth and then the public will know that
 

9911
03:11:27,120 --> 03:11:28,730
mouth and then the public will know that
you're not really being that authentic

9912
03:11:28,730 --> 03:11:28,740
you're not really being that authentic
 

9913
03:11:28,740 --> 03:11:30,590
you're not really being that authentic
even though you believe those things you

9914
03:11:30,590 --> 03:11:30,600
even though you believe those things you
 

9915
03:11:30,600 --> 03:11:32,929
even though you believe those things you
just It's just tough I just wish we they

9916
03:11:32,929 --> 03:11:32,939
just It's just tough I just wish we they
 

9917
03:11:32,939 --> 03:11:35,090
just It's just tough I just wish we they
didn't have to do constantly do speeches

9918
03:11:35,090 --> 03:11:35,100
didn't have to do constantly do speeches
 

9919
03:11:35,100 --> 03:11:38,150
didn't have to do constantly do speeches
so I think that the fact that Bernie's

9920
03:11:38,150 --> 03:11:38,160
so I think that the fact that Bernie's
 

9921
03:11:38,160 --> 03:11:40,730
so I think that the fact that Bernie's
speeches very clearly like came out of

9922
03:11:40,730 --> 03:11:40,740
speeches very clearly like came out of
 

9923
03:11:40,740 --> 03:11:42,290
speeches very clearly like came out of
it's not directly his own pen but his

9924
03:11:42,290 --> 03:11:42,300
it's not directly his own pen but his
 

9925
03:11:42,300 --> 03:11:43,849
it's not directly his own pen but his
own rhetoric over the years and he kind

9926
03:11:43,849 --> 03:11:43,859
own rhetoric over the years and he kind
 

9927
03:11:43,859 --> 03:11:45,950
own rhetoric over the years and he kind
of wrote it seemed authentic yes even if

9928
03:11:45,950 --> 03:11:45,960
of wrote it seemed authentic yes even if
 

9929
03:11:45,960 --> 03:11:47,450
of wrote it seemed authentic yes even if
he was repeating it

9930
03:11:47,450 --> 03:11:47,460
he was repeating it
 

9931
03:11:47,460 --> 03:11:49,130
he was repeating it
um and then Trump is just wild

9932
03:11:49,130 --> 03:11:49,140
um and then Trump is just wild
 

9933
03:11:49,140 --> 03:11:52,070
um and then Trump is just wild
improvisation I think people found real

9934
03:11:52,070 --> 03:11:52,080
improvisation I think people found real
 

9935
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:54,469
improvisation I think people found real
you know in a certain way and I would

9936
03:11:54,469 --> 03:11:54,479
you know in a certain way and I would
 

9937
03:11:54,479 --> 03:11:56,809
you know in a certain way and I would
love for the left more generally to tap

9938
03:11:56,809 --> 03:11:56,819
love for the left more generally to tap
 

9939
03:11:56,819 --> 03:11:58,610
love for the left more generally to tap
into some of that anti-establishment

9940
03:11:58,610 --> 03:11:58,620
into some of that anti-establishment
 

9941
03:11:58,620 --> 03:12:00,110
into some of that anti-establishment
sentiment

9942
03:12:00,110 --> 03:12:00,120
sentiment
 

9943
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:01,550
sentiment
but obviously during a way that's

9944
03:12:01,550 --> 03:12:01,560
but obviously during a way that's
 

9945
03:12:01,560 --> 03:12:03,290
but obviously during a way that's
productive that doesn't blame immigrants

9946
03:12:03,290 --> 03:12:03,300
productive that doesn't blame immigrants
 

9947
03:12:03,300 --> 03:12:05,630
productive that doesn't blame immigrants
or whatever else for for problems but

9948
03:12:05,630 --> 03:12:05,640
or whatever else for for problems but
 

9949
03:12:05,640 --> 03:12:07,849
or whatever else for for problems but
you know it is kind of built on a

9950
03:12:07,849 --> 03:12:07,859
you know it is kind of built on a
 

9951
03:12:07,859 --> 03:12:10,070
you know it is kind of built on a
different basis but people are fed up

9952
03:12:10,070 --> 03:12:10,080
different basis but people are fed up
 

9953
03:12:10,080 --> 03:12:11,690
different basis but people are fed up
for good reason with a lot of

03:12:11,700 --> 03:12:14,510
for good reason with a lot of
conventional politics and we need to

03:12:14,510 --> 03:12:14,520
conventional politics and we need to
 

9957
03:12:14,520 --> 03:12:16,730
conventional politics and we need to
speak to that otherwise it'll only be

9958
03:12:16,730 --> 03:12:16,740
speak to that otherwise it'll only be
 

9959
03:12:16,740 --> 03:12:19,190
speak to that otherwise it'll only be
the right that is taking advantage of

9966
03:12:26,750 --> 03:12:26,760
historically we talked about the Soviet
 

9967
03:12:26,760 --> 03:12:29,150
historically we talked about the Soviet
Union but what lessons do you draw from

9968
03:12:29,150 --> 03:12:29,160
Union but what lessons do you draw from
 

9969
03:12:29,160 --> 03:12:30,590
Union but what lessons do you draw from
the implementation of socialism

9970
03:12:30,590 --> 03:12:30,600
the implementation of socialism
 

9971
03:12:30,600 --> 03:12:34,969
the implementation of socialism
communism in maoist China and modern

9972
03:12:34,969 --> 03:12:34,979
communism in maoist China and modern
 

9973

03:18:57,120 --> 03:18:59,809

today I think there's a large number of

10294
03:18:59,809 --> 03:18:59,819
today I think there's a large number of
 

10295
03:18:59,819 --> 03:19:03,650

the strong leadership so in this there's
 

10301
03:19:08,880 --> 03:19:10,250
the strong leadership so in this there's
a lot of people who miss the Soviet

10302
03:19:10,250 --> 03:19:10,260
a lot of people who miss the Soviet
 

10303
03:19:10,260 --> 03:19:13,070
a lot of people who miss the Soviet
Union right the reason why they miss it

10304
03:19:13,070 --> 03:19:13,080
Union right the reason why they miss it
 

10305
03:19:13,080 --> 03:19:15,769
Union right the reason why they miss it
is that it was a system they knew it

10306
03:19:15,769 --> 03:19:15,779
is that it was a system they knew it
 

10307
03:19:15,779 --> 03:19:17,809
is that it was a system they knew it
provided the basics of their livelihood

10308
03:19:17,809 --> 03:19:17,819
provided the basics of their livelihood
 

10309
03:19:17,819 --> 03:19:20,090

the things beyond your control like you
 

10583
03:24:23,640 --> 03:24:25,250
the things beyond your control like you
could put out something that you think

03:24:25,260 --> 03:24:28,370
could put out something that you think
is great or interesting but then you

10586
03:24:28,370 --> 03:24:28,380
is great or interesting but then you
 

10587
03:24:28,380 --> 03:24:30,050
is great or interesting but then you
need the feedback of people actually

10588
03:24:30,050 --> 03:24:30,060
need the feedback of people actually
 

10589
03:24:30,060 --> 03:24:33,410
need the feedback of people actually
subscribing to it and you occasionally

10590
03:24:33,410 --> 03:24:33,420
subscribing to it and you occasionally
 

10591
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:34,910
subscribing to it and you occasionally
encounter periods where you feel like

10592
03:24:34,910 --> 03:24:34,920
encounter periods where you feel like
 

10593
03:24:34,920 --> 03:24:36,229
encounter periods where you feel like
you're doing your best work but you're

10594
03:24:36,229 --> 03:24:36,239
you're doing your best work but you're
 

10595
03:24:36,239 --> 03:24:38,570
you're doing your best work but you're
not getting the the audience response

10596
03:24:38,570 --> 03:24:38,580
not getting the the audience response
 

10597
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:42,050
not getting the the audience response
and I think you just need the kind of

10598
03:24:42,050 --> 03:24:42,060
and I think you just need the kind of
 

10599
03:24:42,060 --> 03:24:45,110
and I think you just need the kind of

and that was the whole point of a whole

10776
03:27:54,590 --> 03:27:54,600
and that was the whole point of a whole
 

10777
03:27:54,600 --> 03:27:56,929
and that was the whole point of a whole
generation of anti-racist struggle but

generation of anti-racist struggle but
 

10779

now we seem to be
 

10781
03:27:59,420 --> 03:28:02,630
now we seem to be
kind of reifying it in the media and in

10782

kind of reifying it in the media and in

culture and in politics and that's
that's one issue where I've been kind of

10786
03:28:06,170 --> 03:28:06,180
that's one issue where I've been kind of
 

10787
03:28:06,180 --> 03:28:07,610
that's one issue where I've been kind of
banging the drum on this to the point

10788
03:28:07,610 --> 03:28:07,620
banging the drum on this to the point
 

10789
03:28:07,620 --> 03:28:09,110
banging the drum on this to the point
that it's it's annoying in certain parts

10790
03:28:09,110 --> 03:28:09,120
that it's it's annoying in certain parts
 

10791
03:28:09,120 --> 03:28:11,690
that it's it's annoying in certain parts
of the left I don't think there's

10792
03:28:11,690 --> 03:28:11,700
of the left I don't think there's
 

10793
03:28:11,700 --> 03:28:13,670
of the left I don't think there's
um maybe extreme opposition among

10794
03:28:13,670 --> 03:28:13,680
um maybe extreme opposition among
 

10795
03:28:13,680 --> 03:28:15,769
um maybe extreme opposition among
socialists but it's more like a why do

10796
03:28:15,769 --> 03:28:15,779
socialists but it's more like a why do
 

10797
03:28:15,779 --> 03:28:18,110
socialists but it's more like a why do

03:28:19,910 --> 03:28:19,920
our Real Enemy the right instead of
 

10801
03:28:19,920 --> 03:28:22,670

that drum because I think that's one of
 

10809
03:28:29,700 --> 03:28:30,950
that drum because I think that's one of
the uh

10810
03:28:30,950 --> 03:28:30,960
the uh
 

10811
03:28:30,960 --> 03:28:33,590
the uh
one of the reasons that the left has not

10812
03:28:33,590 --> 03:28:33,600
one of the reasons that the left has not
 

10813
03:28:33,600 --> 03:28:36,950
one of the reasons that the left has not
had broader impact or is not heard by

interested in the idea what we actually
 

10931
03:30:46,500 --> 03:30:50,690
interested in the idea what we actually
need to I think have a clearer sense of

10937
03:30:55,380 --> 03:30:57,490
movement like it used to be more rooted
in the working class so if anyone

10938
03:30:57,490 --> 03:30:57,500
in the working class so if anyone
 

10939
03:30:57,500 --> 03:31:00,110
in the working class so if anyone
rewinds the tape may go to when we first

10940
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:00,120
rewinds the tape may go to when we first
 

10941
03:31:00,120 --> 03:31:02,450
rewinds the tape may go to when we first
started talking about early socialism

10942
03:31:02,450 --> 03:31:02,460
started talking about early socialism
 

10943
03:31:02,460 --> 03:31:04,250
started talking about early socialism
when I was talking about the German

10944
03:31:04,250 --> 03:31:04,260
when I was talking about the German
 

10945
03:31:04,260 --> 03:31:08,210
when I was talking about the German
Social Democratic workers movement or

03:31:10,670 --> 03:31:10,680
um all these different early parties I
 

10949
03:31:10,680 --> 03:31:12,849
um all these different early parties I
think at various points I use the word

10950
03:31:12,849 --> 03:31:12,859
think at various points I use the word
 

10951
03:31:12,859 --> 03:31:15,010
think at various points I use the word
worker and socialist movement

03:31:18,290 --> 03:31:18,300
interchangeably because in fact at the
 

10955
03:31:18,300 --> 03:31:20,809
interchangeably because in fact at the
time it was pretty interchangeable

10956
03:31:20,809 --> 03:31:20,819
time it was pretty interchangeable
 

10957
03:31:20,819 --> 03:31:23,929
time it was pretty interchangeable
um socialism was the ideology that had

10958
03:31:23,929 --> 03:31:23,939
um socialism was the ideology that had
 

10959
03:31:23,939 --> 03:31:25,790
um socialism was the ideology that had
the appeal of the working class movement

10960
03:31:25,790 --> 03:31:25,800
the appeal of the working class movement
 

10961
03:31:25,800 --> 03:31:26,990
the appeal of the working class movement
you know

10962
03:31:26,990 --> 03:31:27,000
you know
 

10963
03:31:27,000 --> 03:31:28,490
you know
um you couldn't really separate between

10964
03:31:28,490 --> 03:31:28,500
um you couldn't really separate between
 

10965
03:31:28,500 --> 03:31:29,990
um you couldn't really separate between
the two

10966
03:31:29,990 --> 03:31:30,000
the two
 

10967
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:32,630
the two
um now obviously socialism is like a

10968
03:31:32,630 --> 03:31:32,640
um now obviously socialism is like a
 

10969
03:31:32,640 --> 03:31:35,570
um now obviously socialism is like a
fringe ideological current among a very

10970
03:31:35,570 --> 03:31:35,580
fringe ideological current among a very
 

10971
03:31:35,580 --> 03:31:37,429
fringe ideological current among a very
small minority of the working class

10972
03:31:37,429 --> 03:31:37,439
small minority of the working class
 

10973
03:31:37,439 --> 03:31:39,590
small minority of the working class
um which is fine but we need to get to

10974
03:31:39,590 --> 03:31:39,600
um which is fine but we need to get to
 

10975
03:31:39,600 --> 03:31:41,690
um which is fine but we need to get to
the point I think ideally where when

10976
03:31:41,690 --> 03:31:41,700
the point I think ideally where when
 

10977
03:31:41,700 --> 03:31:43,790
the point I think ideally where when
people talk about unions and people

10978

socialism they all kind of are one and
 

10983
03:31:48,300 --> 03:31:50,090
socialism they all kind of are one and

that kind of stuff it really puts into
 

11353
03:38:31,800 --> 03:38:33,349
that kind of stuff it really puts into
context how

it's totally has no lessons but then you
 

11407
03:39:34,020 --> 03:39:35,570
it's totally has no lessons but then you
remind yourself that it's the same human

11408
03:39:35,570 --> 03:39:35,580
remind yourself that it's the same human
 

11409

beings right yeah and also we're no

11410
03:39:37,729 --> 03:39:37,739
beings right yeah and also we're no
 

11411
03:39:37,739 --> 03:39:39,170
beings right yeah and also we're no
smarter than them we just have more

11412
03:39:39,170 --> 03:39:39,180
smarter than them we just have more
 

11413
03:39:39,180 --> 03:39:40,790
smarter than them we just have more
crude knowledge in part because of them

11414
03:39:40,790 --> 03:39:40,800
crude knowledge in part because of them
 

11415
03:39:40,800 --> 03:39:42,769
crude knowledge in part because of them
yeah but like you know they're just as

11416
03:39:42,769 --> 03:39:42,779
yeah but like you know they're just as
 

11417
03:39:42,779 --> 03:39:45,110
yeah but like you know they're just as
they were just as clever as us you know

11418
03:39:45,110 --> 03:39:45,120
they were just as clever as us you know
 

11419
03:39:45,120 --> 03:39:47,630
they were just as clever as us you know
uh what do you think is the meaning of

11420
03:39:47,630 --> 03:39:47,640
uh what do you think is the meaning of
 

11421
03:39:47,640 --> 03:39:49,309
uh what do you think is the meaning of
this whole experiment we have going on

11422
03:39:49,309 --> 03:39:49,319
this whole experiment we have going on
 

11423
03:39:49,319 --> 03:39:50,330
this whole experiment we have going on
on Earth

11424
03:39:50,330 --> 03:39:50,340
on Earth
 

11425
03:39:50,340 --> 03:39:52,849
on Earth
Now what's the meaning of life

11426
03:39:52,849 --> 03:39:52,859
Now what's the meaning of life
 

11427
03:39:52,859 --> 03:39:55,610
Now what's the meaning of life
well I think there's no broad meaning of

11428
03:39:55,610 --> 03:39:55,620
well I think there's no broad meaning of
 

11429
03:39:55,620 --> 03:39:57,229
well I think there's no broad meaning of
life there's you know it was an accident

11430
03:39:57,229 --> 03:39:57,239
life there's you know it was an accident
 

11431
03:39:57,239 --> 03:39:59,570
life there's you know it was an accident
but we ourselves need to make our own

11432
03:39:59,570 --> 03:39:59,580
but we ourselves need to make our own
 

11433
03:39:59,580 --> 03:40:03,950
but we ourselves need to make our own
meeting and for me a lot of it is about

11434
03:40:03,950 --> 03:40:03,960
meeting and for me a lot of it is about
 

11435
03:40:03,960 --> 03:40:05,990
meeting and for me a lot of it is about
um posterity trying to do something

11436
03:40:05,990 --> 03:40:06,000
um posterity trying to do something
 

11437
03:40:06,000 --> 03:40:07,370
um posterity trying to do something
worthwhile

11438
03:40:07,370 --> 03:40:07,380
worthwhile
 

11439
03:40:07,380 --> 03:40:10,010
worthwhile
while on Earth but also leaving

11440
03:40:10,010 --> 03:40:10,020
while on Earth but also leaving
 

11441
03:40:10,020 --> 03:40:11,450
while on Earth but also leaving
something behind it could just be

11442
03:40:11,450 --> 03:40:11,460
something behind it could just be
 

11443
03:40:11,460 --> 03:40:14,570
something behind it could just be
relationships with friends or family in

11444
03:40:14,570 --> 03:40:14,580
relationships with friends or family in
 

11445
03:40:14,580 --> 03:40:16,250
relationships with friends or family in
the future maybe having a family and

11446
03:40:16,250 --> 03:40:16,260
the future maybe having a family and
 

11447
03:40:16,260 --> 03:40:17,750
the future maybe having a family and
then kind of like leaving behind that

11448
03:40:17,750 --> 03:40:17,760
then kind of like leaving behind that
 

11449
03:40:17,760 --> 03:40:19,910
then kind of like leaving behind that
sort of Legacy

11450
03:40:19,910 --> 03:40:19,920
sort of Legacy
 

11451
03:40:19,920 --> 03:40:21,710
sort of Legacy
um the little bits of yourself but also

um the little bits of yourself but also
 

11453
03:40:21,720 --> 03:40:24,590
um the little bits of yourself but also
you know but them being able to learn

11454
03:40:24,590 --> 03:40:24,600
you know but them being able to learn
