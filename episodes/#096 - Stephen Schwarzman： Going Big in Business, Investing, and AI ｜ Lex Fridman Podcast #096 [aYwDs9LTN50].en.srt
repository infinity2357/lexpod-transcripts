well
 

367
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,909
well
it makes it easier to succeed actually

368
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
it makes it easier to succeed actually
 

369
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,469
it makes it easier to succeed actually
because if you catch something for

370
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
because if you catch something for
 

371
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:35,909
because if you catch something for
example that's cyclical

00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:35,919
example that's cyclical
 

373
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,670
example that's cyclical
that's it's a huge uh opportunity

374
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,680
that's it's a huge uh opportunity
 

375
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,670
that's it's a huge uh opportunity
then then you usually can find some

376
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
then then you usually can find some
 

377
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,469
then then you usually can find some
place within that huge opportunity where

378
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
place within that huge opportunity where
 

379
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,350
place within that huge opportunity where
you can

380
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:45,360
you can
 

381
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,909
you can
make it work uh if if if you're

you don't have many places to go so

390
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
you don't have many places to go so
 

391
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,430
you don't have many places to go so
you know i've always found that the easy

place to be
 

395
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,150
place to be
uh and you know the ability where you

396

uh and you know the ability where you
 

397
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,350

uh human resources get people excited

400
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:08,720
uh human resources get people excited
 

401
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,070
uh human resources get people excited
about doing

402
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
about doing
 

403
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,189
about doing
like really impactful big things

404
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:13,199
like really impactful big things
 

405
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,629
like really impactful big things
and you can afford to pay them actually

406
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
and you can afford to pay them actually
 

407
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,070
and you can afford to pay them actually
because the bigger thing can generate

408
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:20,080
because the bigger thing can generate
 

409
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,430
because the bigger thing can generate
much more in the way of uh of

410
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:23,440
much more in the way of uh of
 

411
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,670
much more in the way of uh of
financial resources so so that brings

412
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:25,680
financial resources so so that brings
 

413
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,589
financial resources so so that brings
people out of talent

414
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
people out of talent
 

415
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,790
people out of talent
to help you uh and and so all together

00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
to help you uh and and so all together
 

417
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,469
to help you uh and and so all together
it's a virtuous circle

418
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
it's a virtuous circle
 

419
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,870
it's a virtuous circle
uh i think how do you know an

420
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:34,880
uh i think how do you know an
 

421
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,150
uh i think how do you know an
opportunity

422
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
opportunity
 

423
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,309
opportunity
when you see one in terms of the one you

424
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
when you see one in terms of the one you
 

425
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,150
when you see one in terms of the one you
want to go big on

is it uh back and forth deliberation
 

431
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,550
is it uh back and forth deliberation
with people you trust what's the process

pattern recognition

436
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
pattern recognition
 

437
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,950
pattern recognition
and how do you get to pattern

438
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
and how do you get to pattern
 

439
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,950
and how do you get to pattern
recognition first you need to understand

440
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:58,960
recognition first you need to understand
 

441
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,150
recognition first you need to understand
the patterns

442
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
the patterns
 

443
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,790
the patterns
and and the changes that are happening

uh that's either uh it's observational
on some level you can call it data

450
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:10,639
on some level you can call it data
 

451
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,510
on some level you can call it data
uh or you can just call it listening to

452
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:15,520
uh or you can just call it listening to
 

453
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,909
uh or you can just call it listening to
uh unusual things that people are saying

454
00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:17,919
uh unusual things that people are saying
 

455
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,909
uh unusual things that people are saying
that they haven't said before

that they haven't said before
 

457
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,950
that they haven't said before
and you know i've always

458
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:22,960
and you know i've always
 

459
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,510
and you know i've always
tried to describe this it's like seeing

460
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:25,520
tried to describe this it's like seeing
 

461
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,070
tried to describe this it's like seeing
a

462
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
a
 

463
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,469
a
piece of white lint on a on a black

464
00:08:28,469 --> 00:08:28,479
piece of white lint on a on a black
 

465
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,270
piece of white lint on a on a black
dress

466
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,280
dress
 

467
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,310
dress
but most people disregard that piece of

468
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:32,320
but most people disregard that piece of
 

469
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,110
but most people disregard that piece of

470
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,120
lint
 

471
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,829
lint
they just see the dress i always see the

472
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
they just see the dress i always see the
 

473
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,550
they just see the dress i always see the
lint

474
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
lint
 

475
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,589
lint
uh and and i'm i'm fascinated by

476
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:39,599
uh and and i'm i'm fascinated by
 

477
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,070
uh and and i'm i'm fascinated by
how did something get someplace it's not

478
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
how did something get someplace it's not
 

479
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,350
how did something get someplace it's not
supposed to be

480
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
supposed to be
 

481
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,590
supposed to be
so it doesn't even need to be a big

482
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:45,600
so it doesn't even need to be a big
 

483
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,949
so it doesn't even need to be a big
discrepancy

484
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
discrepancy
 

485
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,750
discrepancy
but if something shouldn't be someplace

486
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:49,760
but if something shouldn't be someplace
 

487
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,509
but if something shouldn't be someplace
in in a

488
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:51,519
in in a
 

489
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,550
in in a
constellation of facts that that

490
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:54,560
constellation of facts that that
 

491
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,550
constellation of facts that that
you know sort of made sense in a

492
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
you know sort of made sense in a
 

493
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,990
you know sort of made sense in a
traditional way

494
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:58,000
traditional way
 

495
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,269
traditional way
i i've learned that if you focus

496
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
i i've learned that if you focus
 

497
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,790
i i've learned that if you focus
on why some one discordant note

498
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
on why some one discordant note
 

499
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,990
on why some one discordant note
is there that's usually a key to

500
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
is there that's usually a key to
 

501
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,269
is there that's usually a key to
something important and if you can find

502
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
something important and if you can find
 

503
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,550
something important and if you can find
two of those discordant notes

504
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:14,560
two of those discordant notes
 

505
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,630
two of those discordant notes
that's usually a straight line to some

506
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:16,640
that's usually a straight line to some
 

507
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,590
that's usually a straight line to some
place

508
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:17,600
place
 

509
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,590
place
and that some place is not where you've

510
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:19,600
and that some place is not where you've
 

511
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,110
and that some place is not where you've
been and

512
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,120
been and
 

513
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,110
been and
uh usually when you figure out that

514
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
uh usually when you figure out that
 

515
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,750
uh usually when you figure out that
things are changing or have changed

516
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:25,760
things are changing or have changed
 

517
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,230
things are changing or have changed
and you describe them which you have to

518
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:28,240
and you describe them which you have to
 

519
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,389
and you describe them which you have to
be able to do because it's not

520
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
be able to do because it's not
 

521
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,790
be able to do because it's not
uh some odd intuition it's just focusing

522
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
uh some odd intuition it's just focusing
 

523
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,350
uh some odd intuition it's just focusing
on facts it's almost like a scientific

524
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
on facts it's almost like a scientific
 

525
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,870
on facts it's almost like a scientific
discovery if you will

526
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:38,880
discovery if you will
 

527
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,870
discovery if you will
when you describe it to other people in

528
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
when you describe it to other people in
 

529
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,150
when you describe it to other people in
the real world

530
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,160
the real world
 

531
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,269
the real world
they tend to do absolutely nothing

532
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:45,279
they tend to do absolutely nothing
 

533
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,550
they tend to do absolutely nothing
about it and that's because

534
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560
about it and that's because
 

535
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,590
about it and that's because
humans are comfortable in their own

536
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
humans are comfortable in their own
 

537
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,030
humans are comfortable in their own
reality

538
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
reality
 

539
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,910
reality
and if there's no particular reason at

540
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
and if there's no particular reason at
 

541
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,269
and if there's no particular reason at
that moment

542
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
that moment
 

543
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,150
that moment
to shake them out of their reality

544
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,160
to shake them out of their reality
 

545
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,829
to shake them out of their reality
they'll stay in it

546
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:01,839
they'll stay in it
 

547
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,310
they'll stay in it
even if they're ultimately completely

548
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
even if they're ultimately completely
 

549
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,190
even if they're ultimately completely
wrong

550
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:05,200
wrong
 

551
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,069
wrong
and i've always been stunned that when i

552
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
and i've always been stunned that when i
 

553
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:09,269
and i've always been stunned that when i
explain

554
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:09,279
explain
 

555
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,829
explain
where we're going what we're doing and

556
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
where we're going what we're doing and
 

557
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,949
where we're going what we're doing and
why

558
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
why
 

559
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,829
why
almost everyone just says that's

560
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:16,839
almost everyone just says that's
 

561
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,670
almost everyone just says that's
interesting and they continue doing what

562
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
interesting and they continue doing what
 

563
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,550
interesting and they continue doing what
they're doing

564
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:20,560
they're doing
 

565
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,190
they're doing
and and so um you know i think it's

566
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
and and so um you know i think it's
 

567
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,949
and and so um you know i think it's
pretty easy to do that

568
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
pretty easy to do that
 

569
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,230
pretty easy to do that
uh you know but what you need is a huge

570
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:28,240
uh you know but what you need is a huge
 

571
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,110
uh you know but what you need is a huge
data set so you know before ai and

572
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,120
data set so you know before ai and
 

573
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,990
data set so you know before ai and
people's focus

574
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
people's focus
 

575
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,550
people's focus
on data you know i've sort of been doing

576
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:34,560
on data you know i've sort of been doing
 

577
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,069
on data you know i've sort of been doing
this mostly my whole life

578
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:36,079
this mostly my whole life
 

579
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,550
this mostly my whole life
i'm not a scientist i'm not a let alone

580
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
i'm not a scientist i'm not a let alone
 

581
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,310
i'm not a scientist i'm not a let alone
a computer scientist

582
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
a computer scientist
 

583
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,470
a computer scientist
and you know you can just hear what

584
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:42,480
and you know you can just hear what
 

585
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,150
and you know you can just hear what
people are saying when somebody says

586
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
people are saying when somebody says
 

587
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,150
people are saying when somebody says
something or you observe something

588
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,160
something or you observe something
 

589
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,630
something or you observe something
that simply doesn't make sense that's

590
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:48,640
that simply doesn't make sense that's
 

591
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,389
that simply doesn't make sense that's
when you really go to work

592
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:50,399
when you really go to work
 

593
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,949
when you really go to work
the rest of it's just processing you

594
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
the rest of it's just processing you
 

595
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,430
the rest of it's just processing you
know

596
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:53,440
know
 

597
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,150
know
on a quick tangent pattern recognition

598
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,160
on a quick tangent pattern recognition
 

599
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,710
on a quick tangent pattern recognition
is a term

600
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:56,720
is a term
 

601
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,870
is a term
often used throughout the history of ai

602
00:10:58,870 --> 00:10:58,880
often used throughout the history of ai
 

603
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,389
often used throughout the history of ai
that's the goal of artificial

604
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:00,399
that's the goal of artificial
 

605
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,350
that's the goal of artificial
intelligence

606
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,360
intelligence
 

607
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,389
intelligence
is pattern recognition right but there's

608
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:04,399
is pattern recognition right but there's
 

609
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,470
is pattern recognition right but there's
i would say various flavors of that

610
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:08,480
i would say various flavors of that
 

611
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,190
i would say various flavors of that
so usually pattern recognition refers to

612
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:11,200
so usually pattern recognition refers to
 

613
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,630
so usually pattern recognition refers to
the process

614
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
the process
 

615
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,550
the process
of the the we said dress and the lint on

616
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:16,560
of the the we said dress and the lint on
 

617
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,190
of the the we said dress and the lint on
the dress

618
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
the dress
 

619
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,949
the dress
pattern recognition is very good at

620
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
pattern recognition is very good at
 

621
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,190
pattern recognition is very good at
identifying the dress

622
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
identifying the dress
 

623
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,150
identifying the dress
as looking at the re the pattern that's

624
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
as looking at the re the pattern that's
 

625
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,230
as looking at the re the pattern that's
always there that's very common and so

626
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
always there that's very common and so
 

627
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,030
always there that's very common and so
on

628
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:27,040
on
 

629
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,710
on
you almost refer to a pattern that's

630
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:28,720
you almost refer to a pattern that's
 

631
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,910
you almost refer to a pattern that's
like an what's called outlier detection

632
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:31,920
like an what's called outlier detection
 

633
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,110
like an what's called outlier detection
in uh computer science right the the

634
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:35,120
in uh computer science right the the
 

635
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,829
in uh computer science right the the
rare thing

636
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:35,839
rare thing
 

637
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,870
rare thing
the the small thing now

638
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
the the small thing now
 

639
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,069
the the small thing now
ai is not often good at that

640
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
ai is not often good at that
 

641
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,310
ai is not often good at that
do you just almost philosophically

642
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
do you just almost philosophically
 

643
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,069
do you just almost philosophically
the kind of decisions you made in your

644
00:11:48,069 --> 00:11:48,079
the kind of decisions you made in your
 

645
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,670
the kind of decisions you made in your
life based

646
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
life based
 

647
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,470
life based
scientifically almost on data do you

648
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
scientifically almost on data do you
 

649
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,550
scientifically almost on data do you
think ai in the future will be able to

650
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
think ai in the future will be able to
 

651
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,110
think ai in the future will be able to
do

652
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
do
 

653
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,389
do
is it something that could be put down

654
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
is it something that could be put down
 

655
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,710
is it something that could be put down
into code or is it still deeply human

656
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
into code or is it still deeply human
 

657
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,470
into code or is it still deeply human
it's tough for me to say since i don't

658
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
it's tough for me to say since i don't
 

659
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,829
it's tough for me to say since i don't
have domain

660
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
have domain
 

661
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,269
have domain
knowledge in a.i to know everything

you know that
 

833
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,189
you know that
of course it's sort of easy to play that

834
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
of course it's sort of easy to play that
 

835
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,550
of course it's sort of easy to play that
kind of game

836
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
kind of game
 

837
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,030
kind of game
uh because they've already told you

838
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
uh because they've already told you
 

839
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,870
uh because they've already told you
everything you need to know and

840
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:32,880
everything you need to know and
 

841
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,990
everything you need to know and
and and so it's easy to get to uh

842
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
and and so it's easy to get to uh
 

843
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,470
and and so it's easy to get to uh
a conclusion if there's meant to be one

844
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:38,480
a conclusion if there's meant to be one
 

845
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,389
a conclusion if there's meant to be one
an area of common interest

846
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
an area of common interest
 

847
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,269
an area of common interest
since you know almost exactly what's on

848
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
since you know almost exactly what's on
 

849
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,710
since you know almost exactly what's on
their mind

850
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:44,720
their mind
 

851
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,829
their mind
and and so that's an enormous advantage

852
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
and and so that's an enormous advantage
 

853
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,030
and and so that's an enormous advantage
as opposed to just walking in in

854
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
as opposed to just walking in in
 

855
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,509
as opposed to just walking in in
some place and and somebody telling you

856
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
some place and and somebody telling you
 

857
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,030
some place and and somebody telling you
something and you believing what they're

858
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:55,040
something and you believing what they're
 

859
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,829
something and you believing what they're
saying

860
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
saying
 

861
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,790
saying
um there are so many different levels of

862
00:15:58,790 --> 00:15:58,800
um there are so many different levels of
 

863
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,949
um there are so many different levels of
communication

864
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:00,959
communication
 

865
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,749
communication
so powerful approach to life you discuss

so powerful approach to life you discuss
in the book

868
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959

hearing people is
 

873
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,069
hearing people is
figuring out what the biggest problem

874
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:10,079
figuring out what the biggest problem
 

875
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,670
figuring out what the biggest problem
bothering a particular individual

876
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
bothering a particular individual
 

877
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,069
bothering a particular individual
group is and coming up with a solution

878
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:14,079
group is and coming up with a solution
 

879
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,430
group is and coming up with a solution
to that problem

880
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
to that problem
 

881
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,069
to that problem
and presenting them with the solution

882
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
and presenting them with the solution
 

883
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,910
and presenting them with the solution
right

884
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:19,920
right
 

885
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,389
right
in fact you brilliantly describe a lot

886
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
in fact you brilliantly describe a lot
 

887
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:23,350
in fact you brilliantly describe a lot
of

888
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:23,360
of
 

889
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,030
of
simple things that most people just

890
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,040
simple things that most people just
 

891
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,910
simple things that most people just
don't do it's kind of obvious

892
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
don't do it's kind of obvious
 

893
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,590
don't do it's kind of obvious
find the problem that's bothering

894
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
find the problem that's bothering
 

895
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,110
find the problem that's bothering
somebody deeply

896
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
somebody deeply
 

897
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,350
somebody deeply
and as you said i think you've implied

898
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
and as you said i think you've implied
 

899
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,030
and as you said i think you've implied
that they will usually tell you what the

900
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
that they will usually tell you what the
 

901
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,150
that they will usually tell you what the
problem is

902
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
problem is
 

903
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,189
problem is
but can you talk about this process

904
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:39,199
but can you talk about this process
 

905
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,389
but can you talk about this process
of seeing what the biggest problem for a

906
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
of seeing what the biggest problem for a
 

907
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,230
of seeing what the biggest problem for a
person is trying to solve it

908
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
person is trying to solve it
 

909
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,710
person is trying to solve it
and uh maybe a particularly memorable

910
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:46,720
and uh maybe a particularly memorable
 

911
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,430
and uh maybe a particularly memorable
example

912
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
example
 

913
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,230

that they're facing and and come up with
 

999
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,070
that they're facing and and come up with
uh a few interesting solutions that that

1000
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:12,080
uh a few interesting solutions that that
 

1001
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,190
uh a few interesting solutions that that
that basically haven't been out there

1002
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:15,200
that basically haven't been out there
 

1003
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,070
that basically haven't been out there
uh or that you you haven't heard anybody

1004
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
uh or that you you haven't heard anybody
 

1005
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,950
uh or that you you haven't heard anybody
else

1006
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:18,960
else
 

1007
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,789
else
i was thinking about so just to give you

1008
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
i was thinking about so just to give you
 

1009
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,470
i was thinking about so just to give you
an example it was

1010
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,480
an example it was
 

1011
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,630
an example it was
sort of in the early 1990s and i was

1012
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:24,640
sort of in the early 1990s and i was
 

1013
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,230
sort of in the early 1990s and i was
invited to something at the white house

1014
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
invited to something at the white house
 

1015
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,630
invited to something at the white house
which was a big deal for me because

1016
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:28,640
which was a big deal for me because
 

1017
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,470
which was a big deal for me because
i was like you know a person from no

1018
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
i was like you know a person from no
 

1019
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,830
i was like you know a person from no
place and and

1020
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
place and and
 

1021
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,830
place and and
you know i had met the president once

1022
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
you know i had met the president once
 

1023
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,870
you know i had met the president once
before

1024
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:34,880
before
 

1025
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,590
before
uh because it was president bush because

1026
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:37,600
uh because it was president bush because
 

1027
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,789
uh because it was president bush because
his son

1028
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
his son
 

1029
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,590
his son
was in my dormitory so i had met him at

1030
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:41,600
was in my dormitory so i had met him at
 

1031
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,870
was in my dormitory so i had met him at
parents day

1032
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
parents day
 

1033
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
parents day
i mean it's just like the oddity of

1034
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
i mean it's just like the oddity of
 

1035
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,950
i mean it's just like the oddity of
things so so i knew i was going to see

1036
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
things so so i knew i was going to see
 

1037
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,669
things so so i knew i was going to see
him

1038
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
him
 

1039
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,950
him
because you know that's where the

1040
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
because you know that's where the
 

1041
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,510
because you know that's where the
invitation came from

1042
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
invitation came from
 

1043
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,669
invitation came from
and um so so there was something going

1044
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
and um so so there was something going
 

1045
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,710
and um so so there was something going
on and i just

1046
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:54,720
on and i just
 

1047
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,190
on and i just
thought about you know two or three ways

1048
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:57,200
thought about you know two or three ways
 

1049
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,070
thought about you know two or three ways
to

1050
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
to
 

1051
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,750
to
approach that uh that issue and

1052
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:01,760
approach that uh that issue and
 

1053
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,669
approach that uh that issue and
you know at that point i was uh

1054
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:03,679
you know at that point i was uh
 

1055
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,870
you know at that point i was uh
separated and

1056
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:04,880
separated and
 

1057
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,750
separated and
so i had brought it it brought a date uh

1058
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:07,760
so i had brought it it brought a date uh
 

1059
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,029
so i had brought it it brought a date uh
to the white house and

1060
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:09,039
to the white house and
 

1061
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,750
to the white house and
you know you know and so i saw the

1062
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:11,760
you know you know and so i saw the
 

1063
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,710
you know you know and so i saw the
president and

president and
 

1065
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,549
president and
we sort of went over in a corner for

1066
00:19:14,549 --> 00:19:14,559
we sort of went over in a corner for
 

1067
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,909
we sort of went over in a corner for
about 10 minutes

1068
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:15,919
about 10 minutes
 

1069
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,310
about 10 minutes
and discussed whatever this issue was

1070
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:18,320
and discussed whatever this issue was
 

1071
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,510
and discussed whatever this issue was
and i

1072
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
and i
 

1073
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,990
and i
i i later you know went back to my data

1074
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,000
i i later you know went back to my data
 

1075
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,990
i i later you know went back to my data
was a little rude but it was meant to be

1076
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
was a little rude but it was meant to be
 

1077
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,310
was a little rude but it was meant to be
confidential conversation and i barely

1078
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:26,320
confidential conversation and i barely
 

1079
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,669
confidential conversation and i barely
knew her

1080
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
knew her
 

1081
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,070
knew her
and um you know she said what were you

1082
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,080
and um you know she said what were you
 

1083
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,990
and um you know she said what were you
talking about all that time i said well

1084
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,000
talking about all that time i said well
 

1085
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,350
talking about all that time i said well
you know

1086
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
you know
 

1087
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,029
you know
there's something going on in the world

1088
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
there's something going on in the world
 

1089
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,110
there's something going on in the world
and i've thought about

1090
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,120
and i've thought about
 

1091
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,270
and i've thought about
different ways of perhaps approaching

1092
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
different ways of perhaps approaching
 

1093
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,510
different ways of perhaps approaching
that and he was interested

1094
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
that and he was interested
 

1095
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,190
that and he was interested
and the answer is of course he was

1096
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
and the answer is of course he was
 

1097
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,270
and the answer is of course he was
interested why wouldn't he be interested

1098
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,280
interested why wouldn't he be interested
 

1099
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,669
interested why wouldn't he be interested
there didn't seem to be an easy outcome

1100
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
there didn't seem to be an easy outcome
 

1101
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,630
there didn't seem to be an easy outcome
and and so you know conversations of

1102
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
and and so you know conversations of
 

1103
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,310
and and so you know conversations of
that type once somebody knows you're

1104
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
that type once somebody knows you're
 

1105
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,669
that type once somebody knows you're
really thinking

1106
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:53,679
really thinking
 

1107
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,549
really thinking
about what's good for them uh and good

1108
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
about what's good for them uh and good
 

1109
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,150
about what's good for them uh and good
for the situation

1110
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,160
for the situation
 

1111
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,750
for the situation
uh it has nothing to do with with me

1112
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:01,760
uh it has nothing to do with with me
 

1113
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,990
uh it has nothing to do with with me
i mean it's really about being in

1114
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,000
i mean it's really about being in
 

1115
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,950
i mean it's really about being in
service

1116
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:04,960
service
 

1117
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,310
service
uh you know to to to this situation

1118
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,320
uh you know to to to this situation
 

1119
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,470
uh you know to to to this situation

why they're losing right inevitably

1198
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
why they're losing right inevitably
 

1199
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,470
why they're losing right inevitably
it's because they don't have a great

1200

quarterback
 

1203
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,549
quarterback
they don't have a great coach and they

1204
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:50,559
they don't have a great coach and they
 

1205

the best talent those are the three

1210
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
the best talent those are the three
 

1211
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,950
the best talent those are the three
reasons

1212
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:56,960
reasons
 

1213
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,669
reasons
why a team fails right because they're

1214
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
why a team fails right because they're
 

1215
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:00,950
why a team fails right because they're
salary caps

1216
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
salary caps
 

1217
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,710
salary caps
so every team pays the same amount of

1218
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
so every team pays the same amount of
 

1219
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,630
so every team pays the same amount of
money for all their players

1220
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:04,640
money for all their players
 

1221
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,789
money for all their players
so it's got to be those three positions

1222
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
so it's got to be those three positions
 

1223
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,470
so it's got to be those three positions
so if you're talking with somebody like

1224
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
so if you're talking with somebody like
 

1225
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,350
so if you're talking with somebody like
that

1226
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
that
 

1227
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,990
that
inevitably even though it's not

1228
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
inevitably even though it's not
 

1229
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,350
inevitably even though it's not
structured

1230
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,310
questions about that
they're typically very happy to talk

1240
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320

1241
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,909
they're typically very happy to talk
about it because they haven't solved

1242
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:25,919
about it because they haven't solved
 

1243
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:26,870
about it because they haven't solved
that problem

that problem
in some cases they don't even know

1246
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
in some cases they don't even know
 

1247
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,470
in some cases they don't even know
that's the problem it's pretty easy to

1248
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
that's the problem it's pretty easy to
 

1249
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,190
that's the problem it's pretty easy to
see it

1250
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
see it
 

1251
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,950
see it
so you know i do stuff like that which

i find is intuitive as a process
 

1255
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,230
i find is intuitive as a process
but you know leads to really good

00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:57,600
marshaling a lot of money and and then
 

1485
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,789
marshaling a lot of money and and then
at the end of that

1486
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:58,799
at the end of that
 

1487
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,350
at the end of that
kind of creative process so somebody

1488
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:01,360
kind of creative process so somebody
 

1489
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:01,909
kind of creative process so somebody
typically

1490
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:01,919
typically
 

1491
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,390
typically
asks me to write a check i i don't wake

1492
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:04,400
asks me to write a check i i don't wake
 

1493
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,870
asks me to write a check i i don't wake
up and say how can i

1494
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
up and say how can i
 

1495
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,830
up and say how can i
like give large amounts money away i

1496
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
like give large amounts money away i
 

1497
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,470
like give large amounts money away i
look at

1498
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:10,480
look at
 

1499
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,470
look at
issues that are important for people

1500
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
issues that are important for people
 

1501
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,350
issues that are important for people
in some cases i do smaller things

1502
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:17,360
in some cases i do smaller things
 

1503
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,789
in some cases i do smaller things
because it's important to a person uh

1504
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
because it's important to a person uh
 

1505
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,029
because it's important to a person uh
and and you know i have you know sort of

1506
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:23,039
and and you know i have you know sort of
 

1507
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,870
and and you know i have you know sort of
like i can relate to that person there's

1508
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:24,880
like i can relate to that person there's
 

1509
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,510
like i can relate to that person there's
some

1510
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:25,520
some
 

1511
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,070
some
unfairness uh that's happened to them

1512
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
unfairness uh that's happened to them
 

1513
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,110
unfairness uh that's happened to them
and so uh

1514
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
and so uh
 

1515
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,110
and so uh
in situations like that i'd give money

1516
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:31,120
in situations like that i'd give money
 

1517
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,470
in situations like that i'd give money
anonymously and

1518
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
anonymously and
 

1519
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,029
anonymously and
help them out and you know that that's

1520
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
help them out and you know that that's
 

1521
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:35,990
help them out and you know that that's
that's

1522
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
that's
 

1523
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,269
that's
it's it's like a miniature version

1524
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
it's it's like a miniature version
 

1525
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,750
it's it's like a miniature version
of addressing something really big so

1526
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
of addressing something really big so
 

1527
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,950
of addressing something really big so
you know at mit

1528
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:42,960
you know at mit
 

1529
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,470
you know at mit
um i i've done a big thing uh

1530
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
um i i've done a big thing uh
 

1531
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,389
um i i've done a big thing uh
you know helping to start this new

1532
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:48,399
you know helping to start this new
 

1533
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,750
you know helping to start this new
school of computing

1534
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
school of computing
 

1535
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,389
school of computing
and and i did that because you know i i

1536
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:52,399
and and i did that because you know i i
 

1537
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,510
and and i did that because you know i i
saw that

1538
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:53,520
saw that
 

1539
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,029
saw that
that you know there's sort of like a

1540
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:55,039
that you know there's sort of like a
 

1541
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,630
that you know there's sort of like a
global race on

1542
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
global race on
 

1543
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,750
global race on
uh in ai quantum and other major

1544
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
uh in ai quantum and other major
 

1545
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,190
uh in ai quantum and other major
technologies and i

1546
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,200
technologies and i
 

1547
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,110
technologies and i
i thought that um that the u.s could use

1548
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,120
i thought that um that the u.s could use
 

1549
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,789
i thought that um that the u.s could use
more enhancement

1550
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:06,799
more enhancement
 

1551
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,909
more enhancement
from a competitive perspective and

1552
00:28:09,909 --> 00:28:09,919
from a competitive perspective and
 

1553
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,389
from a competitive perspective and
i also because i get to china a lot and

1554
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399
i also because i get to china a lot and
 

1555
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,070
i also because i get to china a lot and
i travel around a lot

1556
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
i travel around a lot
 

1557
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,430
i travel around a lot
compared to a regular person um you know

1558
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
compared to a regular person um you know
 

1559
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:17,669
compared to a regular person um you know
i

1560
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679
i
 

1561
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,870
i
i can see the need to have control

1562
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
i can see the need to have control
 

1563
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,350
i can see the need to have control
of these types of technologies so when

1564
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:23,360
of these types of technologies so when
 

1565
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,630
of these types of technologies so when
they're introduced

1566
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
they're introduced
 

1567
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,950
they're introduced
we don't create a mess like we did with

1568
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
we don't create a mess like we did with
 

1569
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,909
we don't create a mess like we did with
the internet

1570
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:27,919
the internet
 

1571
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,350
the internet
uh and with social media uh unintended

uh and with social media uh unintended
 

1573
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,230

consequence
 

1575
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,710
consequence
um you know that's creating all kinds of

1576
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
um you know that's creating all kinds of
 

1577
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,190
um you know that's creating all kinds of
issues and freedom of speech and the

1578
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
issues and freedom of speech and the
 

1579
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,669
issues and freedom of speech and the
functioning of liberal democracies so

1580
00:28:39,669 --> 00:28:39,679
functioning of liberal democracies so
 

1581
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:41,750
functioning of liberal democracies so
with with ai it was pretty clear that

1582
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:41,760
with with ai it was pretty clear that
 

1583
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,430
with with ai it was pretty clear that
there was enormous

1584
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:43,440
there was enormous
 

1585
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,990
there was enormous
difference of views around the world by

1586
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
difference of views around the world by
 

1587
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,470
difference of views around the world by
the

1588

the
 

1589
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,870
the
relatively few practitioners in the

1590
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:48,880
relatively few practitioners in the
 

1591
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,430
relatively few practitioners in the
world who really knew what was going on

1592
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:51,440
world who really knew what was going on
 

1593
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,149
world who really knew what was going on
and uh by accident i knew a bunch of

1594
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
and uh by accident i knew a bunch of
 

1595
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,350
and uh by accident i knew a bunch of
these people

1596
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:55,360
these people
 

1597
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,630
these people
uh you know who were like big famous

1598
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:58,640
uh you know who were like big famous
 

1599
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,350
uh you know who were like big famous
people

1600
00:28:59,350 --> 00:28:59,360
people
 

1601
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,070
people
uh and i could talk to them and say why

1602
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:02,080
uh and i could talk to them and say why
 

1603
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,029
uh and i could talk to them and say why
do you think this is a force for bad

1604
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:05,039
do you think this is a force for bad
 

1605
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,029
do you think this is a force for bad
and someone else why do you feel this is

1606
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
and someone else why do you feel this is
 

1607
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,630
and someone else why do you feel this is
a force for good

1608
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:08,640
a force for good
 

1609
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,750
a force for good
and and how do we move forward with the

1610
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
and and how do we move forward with the
 

1611
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,350
and and how do we move forward with the
technology

1612
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
technology
 

1613
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,630
technology
but the same by the same time make sure

1614
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:16,640
but the same by the same time make sure
 

1615
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,750
but the same by the same time make sure
that whatever is potentially you know

1616
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:19,760
that whatever is potentially you know
 

1617
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,510
that whatever is potentially you know
sort of on the bad side of this

1618
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
sort of on the bad side of this
 

1619
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,029
sort of on the bad side of this
technology with

1620
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:23,039
technology with
 

1621
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,269
technology with
you know for example the disruption of

1622
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:25,279
you know for example the disruption of
 

1623
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:27,830
you know for example the disruption of
workforces and things like that

1624
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
workforces and things like that
 

1625
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,830
workforces and things like that
that could hap happen much faster than

1626
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
that could hap happen much faster than
 

1627
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,669
that could hap happen much faster than
the industrial revolution

1628
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:31,679
the industrial revolution
 

1629
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,750
the industrial revolution
uh what do we do about that and how do

1630
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
uh what do we do about that and how do
 

1631
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,029
uh what do we do about that and how do
we keep that

1632
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
we keep that
 

1633
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,190
we keep that
under control so that the really good

1634
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
under control so that the really good
 

1635
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,430
under control so that the really good
things about these technologies

1636
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:39,440
things about these technologies
 

1637
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,310
things about these technologies
which will be great things not good

1638
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
which will be great things not good
 

1639
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,029
which will be great things not good
things

1640
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:43,039
things
 

1641
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,630
things
uh are allowed to happen so so to me

1642
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
uh are allowed to happen so so to me
 

1643
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,350
uh are allowed to happen so so to me
uh you know this this was one of the

1644
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:49,360
uh you know this this was one of the
 

1645
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,549
uh you know this this was one of the
great

1646
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:50,559

you know and a number of other
 

1707
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,110
you know and a number of other
universities were going to do the same

1708

thing at the end of it
 

1711
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:08,149
thing at the end of it
it would be great for knowledge creation

1712
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
it would be great for knowledge creation
 

1713
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,269
it would be great for knowledge creation
you know great

1714
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
you know great
 

1715
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,669
you know great
for the united states great for the

i can recognize
 

1737
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,350
i can recognize
when something really profound is about

1738
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
when something really profound is about
 

1739
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,190

to happen or needs to

1740

to happen or needs to
 

1741
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,190
to happen or needs to
and i do it at the end of the day the

1742
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
and i do it at the end of the day the
 

1743
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,029
and i do it at the end of the day the
end of the situation

1744
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
end of the situation

somebody says can you write a a check

1746
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:42,159
somebody says can you write a a check
 

1747
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,789
somebody says can you write a a check
to help us and then the answer is sure i

1748
00:31:44,789 --> 00:31:44,799
to help us and then the answer is sure i
 

1749
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,470
to help us and then the answer is sure i
mean because if i don't

1750
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
mean because if i don't
 

1751
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,710
mean because if i don't
the vision won't happen but it's the

of whatever i do that is compelling
 

1757
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,389
of whatever i do that is compelling
and essentially i love that idea of

1758
00:31:58,389 --> 00:31:58,399
and essentially i love that idea of
 

1759
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:00,470
and essentially i love that idea of
whether it's small to individual level

1760
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:00,480
whether it's small to individual level
 

1761
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,830
whether it's small to individual level
or really big

1762

as um the biggest impact you can have is
 

1773
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,389
as um the biggest impact you can have is
by launching something new

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,990
what is your hope long term for the
impact the college here at mit might

1812
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
impact the college here at mit might
 

1813
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,710
impact the college here at mit might
have

1814
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
have
 

1815
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,750
have
in the next 5 10 even 20 or let's get

1816
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:01,760
in the next 5 10 even 20 or let's get
 

1817
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,509
in the next 5 10 even 20 or let's get
crazy 30 50 years

1818
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:03,519
crazy 30 50 years
 

1819
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,509
crazy 30 50 years
well it's very difficult to predict the

1820
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
well it's very difficult to predict the
 

1821
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,870
well it's very difficult to predict the
future when you're dealing with

1822
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:06,880
future when you're dealing with
 

1823
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,389
future when you're dealing with
knowledge production

1824
00:33:08,389 --> 00:33:08,399
knowledge production
 

1825
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,149
knowledge production
and creativity um you know mit has

1826
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:12,159
and creativity um you know mit has
 

1827
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,190
and creativity um you know mit has
obviously um some unique aspects

1828
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,200
obviously um some unique aspects
 

1829
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,669
obviously um some unique aspects
uh you know globally and you know

1830
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:17,679
uh you know globally and you know
 

1831
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,669
uh you know globally and you know
there's four big uh

1832
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
there's four big uh
 

1833
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,110
there's four big uh
sort of academic surveys um i forget

1834
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
sort of academic surveys um i forget
 

1835
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,710
sort of academic surveys um i forget
whether it was qs

1836

one of these recently mit was ranked

1842
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:34,000
one of these recently mit was ranked
 

1843
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,789
one of these recently mit was ranked
number one

in the world yeah right so so
 

1847
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,750
in the world yeah right so so
leave aside whether you're number three

1848
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:39,760
leave aside whether you're number three
 

1849
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,350
leave aside whether you're number three
somewhere else

1850
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:41,360
somewhere else
 

1851
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,389
somewhere else
in the great sweep of humanity

1852
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:44,399
in the great sweep of humanity
 

1853
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,190
in the great sweep of humanity
this is pretty amazing yeah right so so

1854
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:47,200
this is pretty amazing yeah right so so
 

1855
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,830
this is pretty amazing yeah right so so
you have a

1856
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
you have a
 

1857
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,430
you have a
really um remarkable aggregation of

1858
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
really um remarkable aggregation of
 

1859
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,110
really um remarkable aggregation of
of human talent uh here

1860
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
of human talent uh here
 

1861
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,990
of human talent uh here
and um where it goes uh it's hard to

1862
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
and um where it goes uh it's hard to
 

1863
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,909
and um where it goes uh it's hard to
tell you have to be a scientist

1864
00:33:59,909 --> 00:33:59,919
tell you have to be a scientist
 

1865
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,110
tell you have to be a scientist
to have the right feel um

1866
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
to have the right feel um
 

1867
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,750
to have the right feel um
but but what's important is you you have

1868
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
but but what's important is you you have
 

1869
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,750
but but what's important is you you have
a critical mass

1870
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:07,760
a critical mass
 

1871
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,270
a critical mass
of people and i i think it breaks into

1872
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:11,280
of people and i i think it breaks into
 

1873
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,629
of people and i i think it breaks into
two buckets

1874
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:12,639
two buckets
 

1875
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,669
two buckets
one is scientific advancement uh

1876
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
one is scientific advancement uh
 

1877
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,790
one is scientific advancement uh
and and if the new college can uh

1878
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:18,800
and and if the new college can uh
 

1879
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,909
and and if the new college can uh
help you know sort of either serve as a

people
uh that's a good thing um

1892
00:34:35,669 --> 00:34:35,679
uh that's a good thing um
 

1893
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,629
uh that's a good thing um
absolute good thing the second thing is

1894
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
absolute good thing the second thing is
 

1895
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:39,109
absolute good thing the second thing is
is

1896
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
is
 

1897
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,669
is
in the ai ethics area uh which

1898
00:34:42,669 --> 00:34:42,679
in the ai ethics area uh which
 

1899
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:45,829
in the ai ethics area uh which
is is is

1900
00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:45,839
is is is
 

1901
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,510
is is is
uh in a way equally important because

1902
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
uh in a way equally important because
 

1903
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:54,230
uh in a way equally important because
if if the science side creates blowback

1904
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:54,240
if if the science side creates blowback
 

1905
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,150
if if the science side creates blowback
uh so so that science is is

1906
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
uh so so that science is is
 

1907
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,069
uh so so that science is is
is um you know uh

1908
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
is um you know uh
 

1909
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,710
is um you know uh
a bit crippled in terms of going forward

1910
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:04,720
a bit crippled in terms of going forward
 

1911
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,109
a bit crippled in terms of going forward
because

1912
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
because
 

1913
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,470
because
society's reaction to to

1914
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
society's reaction to to
 

1915
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,710
society's reaction to to
knowledge advancement in this field

1916
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:10,720
knowledge advancement in this field
 

1917
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,790
knowledge advancement in this field
becomes really hostile

1918
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:12,800
becomes really hostile
 

1919
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,670
becomes really hostile
that then you've sort of lost the game

1920
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
that then you've sort of lost the game
 

1921
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,109
that then you've sort of lost the game
in terms of scientific

1922
00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:17,119
in terms of scientific
 

1923
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,990
in terms of scientific
progress and innovation and and so the

1924
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,000
progress and innovation and and so the
 

1925
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,670
progress and innovation and and so the
ai ethics piece

1926
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:21,680
ai ethics piece
 

1927
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,030
ai ethics piece
is super important because you know in

1928
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
is super important because you know in
 

1929
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,390
is super important because you know in

a in a perfect world mit
 

1931
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,390

would would serve as a global convener

1932
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400

00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:34,880
uh you know sort of is pushed around
 

1975
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,030
uh you know sort of is pushed around
society then you can end up with a

1976
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
society then you can end up with a
 

1977
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,829
society then you can end up with a
really hostile regulatory environment

1978
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:39,839
really hostile regulatory environment
 

1979
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,109
really hostile regulatory environment
and other things so you have

1980
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
and other things so you have
 

1981
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,270
and other things so you have
four drivers that that have to be

1982
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280
four drivers that that have to be
 

1983
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,390
four drivers that that have to be
um sort of um

1984
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:48,400
um sort of um
 

1985
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,510
um sort of um
integrated uh and and so uh

1986
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:51,520
integrated uh and and so uh
 

1987
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,109
integrated uh and and so uh
if if the new school of computing uh

1988
00:36:55,109 --> 00:36:55,119
if if the new school of computing uh
 

1989
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,150
if if the new school of computing uh
can be really helpful in that regard

1990
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
can be really helpful in that regard
 

1991
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,190
can be really helpful in that regard
uh then that's a real service uh to

1992
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
uh then that's a real service uh to
 

1993
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,109
uh then that's a real service uh to
science and it's a service to mit

1994
00:37:05,109 --> 00:37:05,119
science and it's a service to mit
 

1995
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,990
science and it's a service to mit
so so that's that's why i wanted to get

1996
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
so so that's that's why i wanted to get
 

1997
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,950
so so that's that's why i wanted to get
involved

1998
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
involved
 

1999
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,230
involved
for both areas and the hope is for me

2000
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:12,240
for both areas and the hope is for me
 

2001
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,310
for both areas and the hope is for me
for others for everyone for the world

2002
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,320
for others for everyone for the world
 

2003
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,589
for others for everyone for the world
is uh for this particular college of

2004
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
is uh for this particular college of
 

2005
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,270
is uh for this particular college of
community to be a beacon

2006
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,280
community to be a beacon
 

2007
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,069
community to be a beacon
and a connector for the re for these for

2008
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:22,079
and a connector for the re for these for
 

2009

these ideas
 

2011
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,750
these ideas
yeah that's right i mean i i think uh

2012
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:25,760
yeah that's right i mean i i think uh
 

2013
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,790
yeah that's right i mean i i think uh
mit is

2014
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:26,800
mit is
 

2015
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,230
mit is
perfectly uh positioned uh

2331
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,790
billion three people
one of the things you've got to be

2332
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:38,800
one of the things you've got to be
 

2333

of a billion 2.99999
 

2339
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,910
of a billion 2.99999
other people another word for that is

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
other people another word for that is
 

2341
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,270
other people another word for that is
competitive yes

energetic
 

2347
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,710
energetic
highly focused always looking for

2348
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,720
highly focused always looking for
 

2349
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,390
highly focused always looking for
some opportunity uh for themselves

2350
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:04,400
some opportunity uh for themselves
 

2351
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,630
some opportunity uh for themselves
um because they need to uh because

2352
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:08,640
um because they need to uh because
 

2353
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,030
um because they need to uh because
there's an enormous amount of just

2354
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,040
there's an enormous amount of just
 

2355
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,630
there's an enormous amount of just
literally people around and

2356
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:12,640
literally people around and
 

2357
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,829
literally people around and
and so you you know what i've found uh

2358
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
and so you you know what i've found uh
 

2359
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:19,910
and so you you know what i've found uh
is uh they'll try and find a way to win

2360
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:19,920
is uh they'll try and find a way to win
 

2361
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,030
is uh they'll try and find a way to win
uh for themselves uh and their country

2362
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
uh for themselves uh and their country
 

2363
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,550
uh for themselves uh and their country
is complicated

2364
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:24,560
is complicated
 

2365
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,790
is complicated
because it it basically doesn't have the

2366
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:26,800
because it it basically doesn't have the
 

2367
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,190
because it it basically doesn't have the
same kind of functional laws

2368
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
same kind of functional laws
 

2369
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,790
same kind of functional laws
uh that we do uh in in the united states

2370
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:32,800
uh that we do uh in in the united states
 

2371
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,990
uh that we do uh in in the united states
in the west

2372
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
in the west
 

2373
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,069
in the west
and and um the country is controlled

2374
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:38,079
and and um the country is controlled
 

2375
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,990
and and um the country is controlled
really uh through a web of relationships

2376
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
really uh through a web of relationships
 

2377
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,750
really uh through a web of relationships
you have with other people

2378
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:43,760
you have with other people
 

2379
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,470
you have with other people
uh and the relationships that those

2380
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:46,480
uh and the relationships that those
 

2381
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,790
uh and the relationships that those
other people have with other people

2382
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
other people have with other people
 

2383
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,069
other people have with other people
so it's an incredibly dynamic

2384
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
so it's an incredibly dynamic
 

2385
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,750
so it's an incredibly dynamic
uh uh culture where if somebody

2386
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:55,760
uh uh culture where if somebody
 

2387
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,230
uh uh culture where if somebody
knocks somebody up on the top who's

2388
00:44:58,230 --> 00:44:58,240
knocks somebody up on the top who's
 

2389
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,390
knocks somebody up on the top who's
three levels above you and is in effect

2390
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:00,400
three levels above you and is in effect
 

2391
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,990
three levels above you and is in effect
protecting you then

2392
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
protecting you then
 

2393
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,550
protecting you then
then you know you're you're like a you

2394
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
then you know you're you're like a you
 

2395
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,230
then you know you're you're like a you
know sort of a floating

2396
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:06,240
know sort of a floating
 

2397
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,710
know sort of a floating
molecule there uh you know without

2398
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:08,720
molecule there uh you know without
 

2399
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,670
molecule there uh you know without
tethering

2400
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
tethering
 

2401
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,829
tethering
uh except the one or two layers above

2402
00:45:11,829 --> 00:45:11,839
uh except the one or two layers above
 

2403
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,990
uh except the one or two layers above
you but that's gonna get affected

2404
00:45:13,990 --> 00:45:14,000
you but that's gonna get affected
 

2405
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,069
you but that's gonna get affected
so it's a very dynamic system and

2406
00:45:16,069 --> 00:45:16,079
so it's a very dynamic system and
 

2407
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:18,230
so it's a very dynamic system and
getting people to change

2408
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:18,240
getting people to change
 

2409
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,510
getting people to change
is not that easy because if there aren't

2410
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:21,520
is not that easy because if there aren't
 

2411
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,670
is not that easy because if there aren't
really functioning laws

2412
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:23,680
really functioning laws
 

2413
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,829
really functioning laws
it's only the relationships that

2414
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:25,839
it's only the relationships that
 

2415
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,510
it's only the relationships that
everybody has

2416
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,520
everybody has
 

2417
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,510
everybody has
and so when you decide to make a major

2418
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
and so when you decide to make a major
 

2419
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,790
and so when you decide to make a major
change

2420
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:30,800
change
 

2421
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,910
change
and you sign up for it something

2422
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:33,920
and you sign up for it something
 

2423
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,950
and you sign up for it something
is changing in your life there won't

2424
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:36,960
is changing in your life there won't
 

2425
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,030
is changing in your life there won't
necessarily be all the same people on

2426
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,040
necessarily be all the same people on
 

2427
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,230
necessarily be all the same people on
your team

2428
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
your team
 

2429
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,030
your team
uh and that's a very high risk

2430
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:43,040
uh and that's a very high risk
 

2431
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,670
uh and that's a very high risk
enterprise so when you're dealing with

2432
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:45,680
enterprise so when you're dealing with
 

2433
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,430
enterprise so when you're dealing with
with china it's important to know almost

2434
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:49,440
with china it's important to know almost
 

2435
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:51,270
with china it's important to know almost
what everybody's relationship is with

2436
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:51,280
what everybody's relationship is with
 

2437
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:52,630
what everybody's relationship is with
somebody uh

2438
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:52,640
somebody uh
 

2439
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,550
somebody uh
so when you suggest doing something

2440
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:54,560
so when you suggest doing something
 

2441
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,990
so when you suggest doing something
differently

2442
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,000
differently
 

2443
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,390
differently
you you line up these forces in the west

2444
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:00,400
you you line up these forces in the west
 

2445
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,710
you you line up these forces in the west
it's usually you talk to a person and

2446
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
it's usually you talk to a person and
 

2447
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,550
it's usually you talk to a person and
they figure out what's good for them

2448
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
they figure out what's good for them
 

2449
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,829
they figure out what's good for them
uh it's a lot easier and in that sense

2450
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
uh it's a lot easier and in that sense
 

2451
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,750
uh it's a lot easier and in that sense
in a funny way it's easier to make

2452
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:09,760
in a funny way it's easier to make
 

2453
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,390
in a funny way it's easier to make
change uh in the west just the opposite

2454
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:12,400
change uh in the west just the opposite
 

2455
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,790
change uh in the west just the opposite
of what people think

2456
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
of what people think
 

2457
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,190
of what people think
but but once the chinese system adjusts

2458
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:17,200
but but once the chinese system adjusts
 

2459
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,670
but but once the chinese system adjusts
to something that's new

2460
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
to something that's new
 

2461
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:23,030
to something that's new

uh kind of mobilization uh
 

2715
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:31,670
uh kind of mobilization uh
by the united states uh i think

2716
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
by the united states uh i think
 

2717
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,829
by the united states uh i think
uh the appetite uh actually is there

uh the appetite uh actually is there
to do that at the moment

to do that at the moment
 

2721
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,309
to do that at the moment
what's getting in the way is the kind of

what's getting in the way is the kind of
 

2723

another part of the issue is we're
 

2743
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:11,510
another part of the issue is we're
running huge deficits we're running

running huge deficits we're running
 

2745

running huge deficits we're running
trillion dollar plus deficits so how

2746
00:52:14,069 --> 00:52:14,079
trillion dollar plus deficits so how
 

2747
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,069
trillion dollar plus deficits so how
much money do you need

2748
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:16,079
much money do you need
 

2749
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,589
much money do you need
for this initiative

2750
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:19,599
for this initiative
 

2751
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,069
for this initiative
where does it come from who's prepared

2752
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:22,079
where does it come from who's prepared
 

2753
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,910
where does it come from who's prepared
to stand up for it

to stand up for it
 

2755
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,150
to stand up for it
uh because if it if it involves taking

in a way it could be easy what's the

2776
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
in a way it could be easy what's the
 

2777
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,790
in a way it could be easy what's the
difference of a trillion and a trillion

uh but but you know it's it's hard with
 

2783
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,750
uh but but you know it's it's hard with
the mechanisms

the mechanisms
 

2785
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,390
the mechanisms
of congress but what's um what's really

25 variables going on if you you know if

3268
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
25 variables going on if you you know if
 

3269
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,069
25 variables going on if you you know if
you're missing four big ones you can

3270

really make a mess
 

3273
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:47,029
really make a mess
uh and so the ability to to in effect

3274
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,039
uh and so the ability to to in effect
 

3275
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,870
uh and so the ability to to in effect
have either an outsider uh

3276
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:50,880
have either an outsider uh
 

3277
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,270
have either an outsider uh
