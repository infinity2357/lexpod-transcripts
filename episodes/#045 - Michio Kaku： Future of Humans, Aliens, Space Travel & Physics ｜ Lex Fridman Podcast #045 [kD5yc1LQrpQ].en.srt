Federation of Planets have colonized the
 

197
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:25,969
Federation of Planets have colonized the
nearby stars so a type 2 would be

198
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:25,979
nearby stars so a type 2 would be
 

199
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,800
nearby stars so a type 2 would be
somewhat similar to

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:43,230
this talk in London at the planetarium
 

211
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,409
this talk in London at the planetarium
there and the little boy comes up to me

212
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:45,419
there and the little boy comes up to me
 

213
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,890
there and the little boy comes up to me
and he says professor you're wrong

214
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:47,900
and he says professor you're wrong
 

215
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,710
and he says professor you're wrong
you're wrong this type 4 and I told them

216
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:51,720
you're wrong this type 4 and I told them
 

217
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,690
you're wrong this type 4 and I told them
look kid there are planets stars and

218
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:55,700
look kid there are planets stars and
 

219
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,040
look kid there are planets stars and
galaxies that's it folks

220
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,050
galaxies that's it folks
 

221
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,070
galaxies that's it folks
and he kept persisting and saying no

222
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,080
and he kept persisting and saying no
 

223
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,190
and he kept persisting and saying no
there's time for the power of the

224
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,200
there's time for the power of the
 

225
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,860
there's time for the power of the
continuum and I thought about it for a

226
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:06,870
continuum and I thought about it for a
 

227
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,260
continuum and I thought about it for a
moment and I said to myself is there an

228
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,270
moment and I said to myself is there an
 

229
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,350
moment and I said to myself is there an
extra galactic source of energy the

230
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,360
extra galactic source of energy the
 

231
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,050
extra galactic source of energy the
continuum of Star Trek and the answer is

232
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,060
continuum of Star Trek and the answer is
 

233
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,409
continuum of Star Trek and the answer is
yes there could be a type 4 and that's

234
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:18,419
yes there could be a type 4 and that's
 

235
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,450
yes there could be a type 4 and that's
dark energy we now know that 73% of the

236
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:23,460
dark energy we now know that 73% of the
 

237
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,710
dark energy we now know that 73% of the
energy of the universe is dark energy

238
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:26,720
energy of the universe is dark energy
 

239
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,810
energy of the universe is dark energy
dark matter represents maybe 23 percent

240
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:29,820
dark matter represents maybe 23 percent
 

241
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:33,380
dark matter represents maybe 23 percent
or so and we only represent 4% we're the

242
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,390
or so and we only represent 4% we're the
 

243
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,100
or so and we only represent 4% we're the
oddballs

244
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:34,110
oddballs
 

245
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,290
oddballs
and so you begin to realize that yeah

246
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:36,300
and so you begin to realize that yeah
 

247
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,050
and so you begin to realize that yeah
they could be type 4 maybe even type 5

248
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:39,060
they could be type 4 maybe even type 5
 

249
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,529
they could be type 4 maybe even type 5
so type 4 you're saying being able to

250
00:05:42,529 --> 00:05:42,539
so type 4 you're saying being able to
 

251
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,719
so type 4 you're saying being able to
harness sort of like dark energy

252
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:44,729
harness sort of like dark energy
 

253
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:46,400
harness sort of like dark energy
something that permeates the entire

254
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:46,410
something that permeates the entire
 

255
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,920
something that permeates the entire
universe so be able to plug into the

256
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:48,930
universe so be able to plug into the
 

257
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,500
universe so be able to plug into the
entire entire universe is a source of

258
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,510
entire entire universe is a source of
 

259
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,930
entire entire universe is a source of
energy that's right and dark energy is

260
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:53,940
energy that's right and dark energy is
 

261
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,360
energy that's right and dark energy is
the energy of the Big Bang it's why the

262
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,370
the energy of the Big Bang it's why the
 

263
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,300
the energy of the Big Bang it's why the
galaxies are being pushed apart it's the

264
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,310
galaxies are being pushed apart it's the
 

265
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,730
galaxies are being pushed apart it's the
energy of nothing the more nothing you

266
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
energy of nothing the more nothing you
 

267
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,129
energy of nothing the more nothing you
have the more dark energy that's

268
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,139
have the more dark energy that's
 

269
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,340
have the more dark energy that's
repulsive and so the acceleration of the

270
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:07,350
repulsive and so the acceleration of the
 

271
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,409
repulsive and so the acceleration of the
universe is accelerating because the

272
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:09,419
universe is accelerating because the
 

273
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,409
universe is accelerating because the
more you have the more you can have and

274
00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:12,419
more you have the more you can have and
 

275
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,510
more you have the more you can have and
that of course is by definition and

276
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:14,520
that of course is by definition and
 

277
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,190
that of course is by definition and
exponential curve it's called a

278
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,200
exponential curve it's called a
 

279
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,260
exponential curve it's called a
discerner expansion and that's the

280
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,270
discerner expansion and that's the
 

281
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:20,690
discerner expansion and that's the
current state of the universe and then

282
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:20,700
current state of the universe and then
 

283
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:25,010
current state of the universe and then
type 5 would that be would that be able

284
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,020
type 5 would that be would that be able
 

285
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,120
type 5 would that be would that be able
to seek energy sources somehow outside

286
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,130
to seek energy sources somehow outside
 

287
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,140
to seek energy sources somehow outside
of our universe however that idea yeah

288
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,150
of our universe however that idea yeah
 

289
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,930
of our universe however that idea yeah
what time five will be the multiverse

290
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:34,940
what time five will be the multiverse
 

291
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,880
what time five will be the multiverse
multiverse I'm a quantum physicist and

292
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:37,890
multiverse I'm a quantum physicist and
 

293
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,190
multiverse I'm a quantum physicist and
we quantum physicists don't believe that

294
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,200
we quantum physicists don't believe that
 

295
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,330
we quantum physicists don't believe that
the Big Bang happen

296
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,340
the Big Bang happen
 

297
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,400
the Big Bang happen
once that would violate the Heisenberg

298
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,410
once that would violate the Heisenberg
 

299
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,100
once that would violate the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle and that means

300
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,110
uncertainty principle and that means
 

301
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,629
uncertainty principle and that means
that there could be multiple bangs

302
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:47,639
that there could be multiple bangs
 

303
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,750
that there could be multiple bangs
happening all the time even as we speak

304
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:50,760
happening all the time even as we speak

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,350
happening all the time even as we speak
today universes are being created and

306
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:54,360
today universes are being created and
 

307
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,810
today universes are being created and
that fits the data the inflationary

308
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:56,820
that fits the data the inflationary
 

309
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,350
that fits the data the inflationary
universe is a quantum theory so there's

310
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,360
universe is a quantum theory so there's
 

311
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,180
universe is a quantum theory so there's
a certain finite probability that

312
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,190
a certain finite probability that
 

313
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:04,670
a certain finite probability that
universes are being created all the time

314
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:04,680
universes are being created all the time
 

315
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
universes are being created all the time
and for me this is actually rather

316
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,690
and for me this is actually rather
 

317
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,350
and for me this is actually rather
aesthetically pleasing because you know

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,879
parents were Buddhists and there's two
diametrically opposed ideas about the

00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:19,889
diametrically opposed ideas about the
 

325
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:22,219
diametrically opposed ideas about the
universe in Buddhism there's only

00:07:22,219 --> 00:07:22,229
universe in Buddhism there's only
 

327

universe in Buddhism there's only
nirvana

nirvana
 

329
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,980
nirvana
there's no beginning there's no end

330
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:24,990
there's no beginning there's no end
 

331
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,390
there's no beginning there's no end
there's only timelessness

332
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
there's only timelessness
 

333
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,870
there's only timelessness
but in Christianity there is the instant

334
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
but in Christianity there is the instant
 

335
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,450
but in Christianity there is the instant
when God said let there be light in

00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:32,460
when God said let there be light in
 

337
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:35,510
when God said let there be light in
other words an instant of creation so

I've had these two mutually exclusive

I've had these two mutually exclusive
 

341
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,060
I've had these two mutually exclusive
ideas in my head and I now realize that

342
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:41,070
ideas in my head and I now realize that
 

343
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,430
ideas in my head and I now realize that
it's possible to Mel them into a single

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
it's possible to Mel them into a single
 

345
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,190
it's possible to Mel them into a single
theory either the universe had a

346
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,200
theory either the universe had a
 

347
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:50,000
theory either the universe had a
beginning or it didn't right wrong you

beginning or it didn't right wrong you
 

349
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:53,150
beginning or it didn't right wrong you
see our universe had a beginning our

350
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,160
see our universe had a beginning our
 

351
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,430
see our universe had a beginning our
universe had an instant where somebody

352
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
universe had an instant where somebody
 

353
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,980
universe had an instant where somebody
might have said let there be light but

354
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:57,990
might have said let there be light but
 

355
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:00,050
might have said let there be light but
there other bubble universes out there

there other bubble universes out there
 

357
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,260
there other bubble universes out there
in a bubble bath of universes and that

in a bubble bath of universes and that
 

359
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:06,400
in a bubble bath of universes and that
means that these universes are expanding

360
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:06,410
means that these universes are expanding
 

361
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,170
means that these universes are expanding
into a dimension beyond our

00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,800
existence of God he said there is no God
because there was not enough time for

because there was not enough time for

because there was not enough time for
God to create the universe because the

Big Bang happened in an instant of time
 

391
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:50,000
Big Bang happened in an instant of time
therefore there was no time available

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,010
therefore there was no time available

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,520
therefore there was no time available

means that there was a time before time

398
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,080
means that there was a time before time
 

399
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:00,430
means that there was a time before time
and there multiple times each bubble has

400
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:00,440
and there multiple times each bubble has
 

401
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,330
and there multiple times each bubble has
its own time and so it means that there

402
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:04,340
its own time and so it means that there
 

403
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,700
its own time and so it means that there

could actually be a universe before the
 

405
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:09,940
could actually be a universe before the

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,160
think of a bubble bath when two bubbles
collide well when two bubbles fission to

00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,470
collide well when two bubbles fission to
create a baby bubble that's called the

Big Bang so the Big Bang is nothing but

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,090
Big Bang so the Big Bang is nothing but
 

415
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,730
Big Bang so the Big Bang is nothing but
the collision of universes or the

theory is a multiverse theory so people
say first of all what is string theory

643
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:29,510
to us
same thing with aliens from out of space

644
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:29,520
same thing with aliens from out of space
 

645
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,890
same thing with aliens from out of space
and they come down to earth

646
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:30,900
and they come down to earth
 

647
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,630
and they come down to earth
they'll be curious about us to a degree

648
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:32,640
they'll be curious about us to a degree
 

649
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,120
they'll be curious about us to a degree
but after a while they just get bored

650
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,130
but after a while they just get bored
 

651
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,060
but after a while they just get bored
because we have nothing to offer them so

652
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,070
because we have nothing to offer them so
 

653
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,730
because we have nothing to offer them so
our sense of right and wrong what does

654
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:40,740
our sense of right and wrong what does
 

655
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,070
our sense of right and wrong what does
that mean compared to a squirrels sense

656
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:43,080
that mean compared to a squirrels sense
 

657
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,630
that mean compared to a squirrels sense
of right and wrong now we of course do

658
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:47,640
of right and wrong now we of course do
 

659
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,420
of right and wrong now we of course do
have an ethics that keeps civilizations

660
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,430
have an ethics that keeps civilizations
 

661
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,950
have an ethics that keeps civilizations
in line enriches our life and makes

662
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:54,960
in line enriches our life and makes
 

663
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,050
in line enriches our life and makes
civilization possible and I think that's

664
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,060
civilization possible and I think that's
 

665
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,720
civilization possible and I think that's
a good thing but it's not mandated by a

00:14:59,720 --> 00:14:59,730
a good thing but it's not mandated by a

law of physics
 

669
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:05,450
law of physics
so if aliens do alien species were to

670
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:05,460
so if aliens do alien species were to
 

671
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,660
so if aliens do alien species were to
make contact forgive me for staying on

672
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:08,670
make contact forgive me for staying on
 

673
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,450
make contact forgive me for staying on
aliens for a bit longer do you think

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:33,450
right now robots have the intelligence
 

909
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:36,950
right now robots have the intelligence
of a cockroach but in the coming years

our robots will be as smart as a mouse

our robots will be as smart as a mouse
 

913
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,160
our robots will be as smart as a mouse
then maybe as smart as a rabbit if we're

914
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:43,170
then maybe as smart as a rabbit if we're
 

915
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:46,310
then maybe as smart as a rabbit if we're
lucky maybe as smart as a cat or a dog

916
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
lucky maybe as smart as a cat or a dog
 

917
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,100
lucky maybe as smart as a cat or a dog
and by the end of the century who knows

918
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,110
and by the end of the century who knows
 

919
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,560
and by the end of the century who knows
for sure our robots will be probably as

920
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:51,570
for sure our robots will be probably as
 

921
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,560
for sure our robots will be probably as
smart as a monkey now at that point of

smart as a monkey now at that point of
 

923
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:56,330
smart as a monkey now at that point of
course they could be dangerous

course they could be dangerous
 

925
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,320
course they could be dangerous
you see monkeys are self-aware they know

926
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,330
you see monkeys are self-aware they know
 

927
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,770
you see monkeys are self-aware they know
they are monkeys they may have a

they are monkeys they may have a

00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,120
they are monkeys they may have a
different agenda than us while dogs dogs

930
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:08,130
different agenda than us while dogs dogs
 

931
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:12,590
different agenda than us while dogs dogs
are confused you see dogs think that we

932
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:12,600
are confused you see dogs think that we
 

933
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,520
are confused you see dogs think that we
are a dog that we're the top dog they're

934
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:16,530
are a dog that we're the top dog they're
 

935
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,770
are a dog that we're the top dog they're
the underdog that's why they whimper and

936
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:18,780
the underdog that's why they whimper and
 

937
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,470
the underdog that's why they whimper and
follow us and lick us all the time for

938
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:21,480
follow us and lick us all the time for
 

939
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,860
follow us and lick us all the time for
the top dog monkeys have no illusion at

940
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:24,870
the top dog monkeys have no illusion at
 

941
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,890
the top dog monkeys have no illusion at
all they know who we are not monkeys and

942
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:27,900
all they know who we are not monkeys and
 

943
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,230
all they know who we are not monkeys and
so I think that in the future we'll have

944
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,240
so I think that in the future we'll have
 

945
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,060
so I think that in the future we'll have
to put a chip in their brain to shut

946
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,070
to put a chip in their brain to shut
 

947
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,520
to put a chip in their brain to shut
them off once our robots have murderous

948
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:34,530
them off once our robots have murderous
 

949
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,530
them off once our robots have murderous
thoughts but that's in a hundred years

950
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:36,540
thoughts but that's in a hundred years
 

951
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,940
thoughts but that's in a hundred years
in 200 years the robots will be smart

952
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:40,950
in 200 years the robots will be smart
 

953
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,490
in 200 years the robots will be smart
enough to remove that failsafe chip in

954
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:43,500
enough to remove that failsafe chip in
 

955
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,180
enough to remove that failsafe chip in
their brain and then watch out at that

956
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:47,190
their brain and then watch out at that
 

957
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,990
their brain and then watch out at that
point I think rather than compete with

958
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,000
point I think rather than compete with
 

959
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,920
point I think rather than compete with
our robots we should merge with them we

960
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:54,930
our robots we should merge with them we
 

961
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,050
our robots we should merge with them we
should become part cybernetic so I think

962
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:57,060
should become part cybernetic so I think
 

963
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,550
should become part cybernetic so I think
we'll be beat alien life from outer

964

this with primates at Wake Forest

1006
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:52,910
this with primates at Wake Forest
 

1007
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:55,980
this with primates at Wake Forest
University and also in Los Angeles and

1008

University and also in Los Angeles and
 

1009
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,630
University and also in Los Angeles and
then after that we'll have a memory chip

1010
00:22:58,630 --> 00:22:58,640
then after that we'll have a memory chip
 

1011
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,450
then after that we'll have a memory chip
for Alzheimer's patients well test it

1012
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:01,460
for Alzheimer's patients well test it
 

1013
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,190
for Alzheimer's patients well test it
out in alzheimerís patients because of

1014
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
out in alzheimerís patients because of
 

1015
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,010
out in alzheimerís patients because of
course when Alzheimer is patients lose

1016
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,020
course when Alzheimer is patients lose
 

1017

their memory they wander they create all

1018
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:08,480
their memory they wander they create all
 

1019
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,580
their memory they wander they create all
sorts of havoc wandering around

1020
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:11,590
sorts of havoc wandering around
 

1021
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:14,230
sorts of havoc wandering around
oblivious to their surroundings and

1022
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:14,240
oblivious to their surroundings and
 

1023
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,330
oblivious to their surroundings and
they'll have a chip they'll push the

1024
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:16,340
they'll have a chip they'll push the
 

1025
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,060
they'll have a chip they'll push the
button and memories memories will come

1026
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:19,070
button and memories memories will come
 

1027
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,190
button and memories memories will come
flooding into their hippocampus and the

1028
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:21,200
flooding into their hippocampus and the
 

1029
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,280
flooding into their hippocampus and the
chip telling them where they live and

1030
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:24,290
chip telling them where they live and
 

1031
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,730
chip telling them where they live and
who they are and so a memory chip is

1032
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:27,740
who they are and so a memory chip is
 

1033
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,190
who they are and so a memory chip is
definitely in the cards and I think this

1034
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:30,200
definitely in the cards and I think this
 

1035
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,720
definitely in the cards and I think this
will eventually affect human

1036
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:31,730
will eventually affect human
 

1037
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,090
will eventually affect human

Charlie Chaplin anymore because he never
 

1061
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,310
Charlie Chaplin anymore because he never
talked in the movies and so a whole

1062
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:06,320
talked in the movies and so a whole
 

1063
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,830

this is coming you describe brain that

1098
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:57,500
this is coming you describe brain that
 

1099
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,960
this is coming you describe brain that
in feature of the mind this is an

1100
00:24:58,960 --> 00:24:58,970
in feature of the mind this is an
 

1101
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,930
in feature of the mind this is an
interesting concept do you think

1102
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:01,940
interesting concept do you think
 

1103
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,960
interesting concept do you think
so you mentioned entertainment but what

1104
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:04,970
so you mentioned entertainment but what
 

1105
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,400
so you mentioned entertainment but what
kind of effect would it have on our

1106
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:06,410
kind of effect would it have on our
 

1107
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:09,520
kind of effect would it have on our
personal relationships hopefully it will

1108
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:09,530
personal relationships hopefully it will
 

1109
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,860
personal relationships hopefully it will
deepen it you realize that for most of

1110
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:11,870
deepen it you realize that for most of
 

1111
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:15,520
deepen it you realize that for most of
human history for over 90% of human

1112
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:15,530
human history for over 90% of human
 

1113
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,770
human history for over 90% of human
history we only knew maybe 20 a hundred

1114
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:20,780
history we only knew maybe 20 a hundred
 

1115
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,960
history we only knew maybe 20 a hundred
people yeah that's it folks

1116
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:22,970
people yeah that's it folks
 

1117
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:25,990
people yeah that's it folks
that was your tribe that was everybody

1118
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,000
that was your tribe that was everybody
 

1119
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,080
that was your tribe that was everybody
you knew in the universe was only maybe

1120
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,090
you knew in the universe was only maybe
 

1121
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,740
you knew in the universe was only maybe
50 or a hundred with the coming of towns

1122
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:32,750
50 or a hundred with the coming of towns
 

1123
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:35,170
50 or a hundred with the coming of towns
of course it expanded to a few thousand

1124
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:35,180
of course it expanded to a few thousand
 

1125
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,690
of course it expanded to a few thousand
with the coming of the telephone all of

1126
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:37,700
with the coming of the telephone all of
 

1127
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,730
with the coming of the telephone all of
a sudden you could reach thousands of

1128
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:39,740
a sudden you could reach thousands of
 

1129
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,190
a sudden you could reach thousands of
people with a telephone and now with the

1130
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,200
people with a telephone and now with the
 

1131
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,510
people with a telephone and now with the
internet you can reach the entire

1132
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:43,520
internet you can reach the entire
 

1133
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,000
internet you can reach the entire
population of the planet Earth and so I

1134
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:46,010
population of the planet Earth and so I
 

1135
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,780
population of the planet Earth and so I
think this is a normal progression and

1136
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:48,790
think this is a normal progression and
 

1137
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:51,610
think this is a normal progression and
you you think that kind of sort of

1138
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:51,620
you you think that kind of sort of
 

1139
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,590
you you think that kind of sort of
connection to the rest of the world and

1140
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:53,600
connection to the rest of the world and
 

1141
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,050
connection to the rest of the world and
then adding sensations like being able

1142
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,060
then adding sensations like being able
 

1143
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,210
then adding sensations like being able
to share telepathically emotions and so

1144
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:58,220
to share telepathically emotions and so
 

1145
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,610
to share telepathically emotions and so
on that would just further deepen our

1146
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:00,620
on that would just further deepen our
 

1147
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,070
on that would just further deepen our
connection to our fellow humans yes

1148
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,080
connection to our fellow humans yes
 

1149
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,440
connection to our fellow humans yes
right in fact I disagree with many

1150
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,450
right in fact I disagree with many
 

1151
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,870
right in fact I disagree with many
scientists on this question most

1152
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:07,880
scientists on this question most
 

1153
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,300
scientists on this question most
scientists would say that technology is

1154
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,310
scientists would say that technology is

people the other side of the sword can
 

1161
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,700
people the other side of the sword can
cut against ignorance and disease I

cut against ignorance and disease I
 

1163
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,520
cut against ignorance and disease I
disagree I think technology does have a

00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:24,530
disagree I think technology does have a
 

1165
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,460
disagree I think technology does have a
moral direction look at the Internet the

1166
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:27,470
moral direction look at the Internet the
 

1167
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,310
moral direction look at the Internet the
internet spreads knowledge awareness and

1168
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
internet spreads knowledge awareness and
 

1169
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,090

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:36,230
knowledge when they begin to realize
 

1173
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,870

of living under freedom then they begin
 

1181
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,950
of living under freedom then they begin
to take things take power and that

1182
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:47,960
to take things take power and that
 

1183

war with other democracies I'm a

1186
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:54,470
war with other democracies I'm a
 

1187
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,180
war with other democracies I'm a
scientist

1188
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:55,190
scientist
 

1189
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,180
scientist
I believe in data so let's take a sheet

1190
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,190
I believe in data so let's take a sheet
 

1191
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,740
I believe in data so let's take a sheet
of paper and write down every single war

1192
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:01,750
of paper and write down every single war
 

1193
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,450
of paper and write down every single war
you had to learn since you were an

1194
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:04,460
you had to learn since you were an
 

1195
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,880
you had to learn since you were an
elementary school every single war

1196
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:06,890
elementary school every single war
 

1197
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,690
elementary school every single war
hundreds of

1198
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:07,700
hundreds of
 

1199
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,050
hundreds of
kings queens emperors dictators all

1200
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,060
kings queens emperors dictators all
 

1201
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:13,390
kings queens emperors dictators all
these wars were between kings queens

1202
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:13,400
these wars were between kings queens
 

1203
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,440
these wars were between kings queens
emperors and dictators never between two

1204
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,450
emperors and dictators never between two
 

1205
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,650
emperors and dictators never between two
major democracies and so I think with

1206
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:20,660
major democracies and so I think with
 

1207
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,230
major democracies and so I think with
the spread of this technology and which

1208
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:23,240
the spread of this technology and which
 

1209
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,970
the spread of this technology and which
would accelerate with the coming of

1210
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:24,980
would accelerate with the coming of
 

1211
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,460
would accelerate with the coming of
brain net it means that well we will

1212
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:27,470
brain net it means that well we will
 

1213
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,320
brain net it means that well we will
still have wars wars of course as

1214
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:29,330
still have wars wars of course as
 

1215
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:32,080
still have wars wars of course as
politics by other means but there'll be

1216
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:32,090
politics by other means but there'll be
 

1217
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,740
politics by other means but there'll be
less intense and less frequent do you

1218
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:35,750
less intense and less frequent do you
 

1219
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:40,270
less intense and less frequent do you
have worries of longer-term existential

1220
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:40,280
have worries of longer-term existential
 

1221
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:45,070
have worries of longer-term existential
risk from technology from AI so I think

1222
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,080
risk from technology from AI so I think
 

1223
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,770
risk from technology from AI so I think
that's a wonderful vision of a future

1224
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:47,780
that's a wonderful vision of a future
 

1225
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,550
that's a wonderful vision of a future
where war is a distant memory but now

1226
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:51,560
where war is a distant memory but now
 

1227
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,370
where war is a distant memory but now
there's another agent there's there's

1228
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:54,380
there's another agent there's there's
 

1229
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,320
there's another agent there's there's
there's somebody else that's able to

1230
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,330
there's somebody else that's able to
 

1231
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,810
there's somebody else that's able to
create conflict that's able to create

1232
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:58,820
create conflict that's able to create
 

1233
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,570
create conflict that's able to create
harm AI systems so do you have worry

1234
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:01,580
harm AI systems so do you have worry
 

1235
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,060
harm AI systems so do you have worry
about such AI systems well yes that is

1236
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,070
about such AI systems well yes that is
 

1237
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,790
about such AI systems well yes that is
an existential risk but again I think an

1238
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:06,800
an existential risk but again I think an
 

1239
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,180
an existential risk but again I think an
existential risk not for this century I

1240
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,190
existential risk not for this century I
 

1241
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:12,070
existential risk not for this century I
think our grandkids are gonna have to

1242
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
think our grandkids are gonna have to
 

1243
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,960
think our grandkids are gonna have to
confront this question as robots

1244
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:13,970
confront this question as robots
 

1245
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,780
confront this question as robots

however I think we will digitize

1250
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:21,890
however I think we will digitize
 

1251
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,760
however I think we will digitize
ourselves as well not only are we gonna

ourselves as well not only are we gonna
 

1253
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,410
ourselves as well not only are we gonna
merge with our technology it will also

1254
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:26,420
merge with our technology it will also
 

1255
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,170
merge with our technology it will also
digitize our personality our memories

1256
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:29,180
digitize our personality our memories
 

1257
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,720
digitize our personality our memories

the Middle Ages there was something

1260
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:33,110
the Middle Ages there was something
 

1261
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,560
the Middle Ages there was something
called dualism dualism meant that the

1262
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:35,570
called dualism dualism meant that the
 

1263
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:38,440
called dualism dualism meant that the
soul was separate from the body when the

1264
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,450
soul was separate from the body when the
 

1265
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,600
soul was separate from the body when the
body died the soul went to heaven

1266

body died the soul went to heaven
 

1267
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:43,800
body died the soul went to heaven
that's dualism then in the 20th century

1268
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:43,810
that's dualism then in the 20th century
 

1269

that's dualism then in the 20th century

and what are we going to do with it I
 

1351
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,900
and what are we going to do with it I
think we should send it into outer space

1352
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:39,910

galaxy now let me ask you a question are
 

1433
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,400
galaxy now let me ask you a question are
we smart enough to determine whether

00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:25,410
we smart enough to determine whether
 

1435
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,630
we smart enough to determine whether
such a thing exists or not no this could

such a thing exists or not no this could
 

1437
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,790
such a thing exists or not no this could
exist right outside the orbit of the

00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,490
exist right outside the orbit of the
planet Earth and we're too stupid in our

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:34,500
planet Earth and we're too stupid in our
 

1441
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,240

00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,250
technology to even prove it or disprove
 

1443
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,540
technology to even prove it or disprove
it we would need the aliens on this

1444
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:41,550
it we would need the aliens on this
 

1445
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,130
it we would need the aliens on this
laser superhighway to help us out just

00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,780
I mean it ultimately boils down to the
language of communication but that's an

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,210
know one of us could be an alien you
know in a zoo did you know that we

know in a zoo did you know that we
 

1475
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,370
know in a zoo did you know that we
sometimes have zookeepers that imitate

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,970
animals we create a fake animal and we
put it in so that the animal is not

put it in so that the animal is not
 

1481
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,010
put it in so that the animal is not
afraid of this fake animal and of course

00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:34,020
afraid of this fake animal and of course
 

1483
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,540
afraid of this fake animal and of course
these animals brains their brain is

these animals brains their brain is
 

1485
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,640
these animals brains their brain is
about as big as a walnut they accept

say oh yeah human brains are so tiny we

1492
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:46,590
say oh yeah human brains are so tiny we
 

1493
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:48,499
say oh yeah human brains are so tiny we
could put a dummy on their world and

1494
00:33:48,499 --> 00:33:48,509
could put a dummy on their world and
 

1495
00:33:48,509 --> 00:33:51,919
could put a dummy on their world and
avatar and they never know it that would

avatar and they never know it that would
 

1497
00:33:51,929 --> 00:33:53,449
avatar and they never know it that would
be an entertaining thing to watch from

1498
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:53,459
be an entertaining thing to watch from
 

1499
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:56,239
be an entertaining thing to watch from
the alien perspective so you kind of

1500
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,249
the alien perspective so you kind of
 

1501
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,759
the alien perspective so you kind of
implied that with it was a digital form

1502
00:33:58,759 --> 00:33:58,769
implied that with it was a digital form
 

1503
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:02,569
implied that with it was a digital form
of our being but also biologically do

1504
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:02,579
of our being but also biologically do
 

1505
00:34:02,579 --> 00:34:04,219
of our being but also biologically do
you think one day technology will allow

1506
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:04,229
you think one day technology will allow
 

1507
00:34:04,229 --> 00:34:06,349
you think one day technology will allow
individual human beings to become

1508
00:34:06,349 --> 00:34:06,359
individual human beings to become
 

1509
00:34:06,359 --> 00:34:09,470

immortal besides just through the
 

1511
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,749
immortal besides just through the
ability to digitize our essence yeah I

1512
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:11,759
ability to digitize our essence yeah I
 

1513
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,730
ability to digitize our essence yeah I
think that artificial intelligence will

1514
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:13,740
think that artificial intelligence will
 

1515
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:15,769
think that artificial intelligence will
give us the key to to genetic

billions of genomes of young people and
what are we going to do with it we're

1528
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:28,349
what are we going to do with it we're
 

1529

what are we going to do with it we're
gonna run into an AI machine which has a

00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,970
aging is aging is the build-up of errors
that's all aging is the buildup of

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:01,980
that's all aging is the buildup of
 

1551
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,519
that's all aging is the buildup of
genetic errors this means that cells

00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:04,529
genetic errors this means that cells
 

1553
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:07,400
genetic errors this means that cells
eventually become slower sluggish if

so even in old age I've noticed that

1902
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,050
so even in old age I've noticed that
 

1903
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,990
so even in old age I've noticed that
these scientists when they sit back they

1904
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
these scientists when they sit back they
 

1905
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,109
these scientists when they sit back they
still remember they still remember that

1906
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:29,119
still remember they still remember that
 

1907
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,710
still remember they still remember that

so if a computer could ever simulate

00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,810
so if a computer could ever simulate
that number then it would the universe

that number then it would the universe
 

2207
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,990
that number then it would the universe
would be a simulation so theoretically

would be a simulation so theoretically
 

2209
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,520
would be a simulation so theoretically
because it's because the amount of

2359
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,799
physics reason why we can't do it it's
an engineering problem it's a very

and in my book future of humanity I even

they didn't have a space program we do
have a space program which means that we

00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:45,029

00:58:45,029 --> 00:58:45,039
deplete the earth to go to Mars that's
 

2599
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:47,699
deplete the earth to go to Mars that's
too expensive and not practical but we

2600

too expensive and not practical but we
 

2601
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:50,130
too expensive and not practical but we

in case something bad happens to the
 

2605
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:54,719
in case something bad happens to the
planet Earth and that means we have to

2606
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:54,729
planet Earth and that means we have to
 

2607
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:58,289
planet Earth and that means we have to
terraform Mars now to terraform Mars if

00:58:58,289 --> 00:58:58,299
terraform Mars now to terraform Mars if

we get raised a temperature of Mars by 6
 

2611
00:59:00,189 --> 00:59:04,649
we get raised a temperature of Mars by 6
degrees 6 degrees then the polar icecaps

2612
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:04,659
degrees 6 degrees then the polar icecaps
 

2613
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:07,949
degrees 6 degrees then the polar icecaps
begin to melt releasing water vapor

2614
00:59:07,949 --> 00:59:07,959
begin to melt releasing water vapor
 

2615
00:59:07,959 --> 00:59:10,739
begin to melt releasing water vapor
water vapor is the greenhouse gas it

2616
00:59:10,739 --> 00:59:10,749
water vapor is the greenhouse gas it
 

2617
00:59:10,749 --> 00:59:12,659
water vapor is the greenhouse gas it
causes even more melting of the ice caps

2618
00:59:12,659 --> 00:59:12,669
causes even more melting of the ice caps
 

2619
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:16,349
causes even more melting of the ice caps
so it becomes a self-fulfilling

2620
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:16,359
so it becomes a self-fulfilling
 

2621
00:59:16,359 --> 00:59:19,890
so it becomes a self-fulfilling
see it feeds on itself it becomes

2622
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:19,900
see it feeds on itself it becomes
 

2623
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,499
see it feeds on itself it becomes
autocatalytic and so once you hit six

2624
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:22,509
autocatalytic and so once you hit six
 

2625
00:59:22,509 --> 00:59:24,630
autocatalytic and so once you hit six
degrees were rising of the temperature

2626
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:24,640
degrees were rising of the temperature
 

2627
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,120
degrees were rising of the temperature
on Mars by six degrees it takes off and

2628
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:27,130
on Mars by six degrees it takes off and
 

2629
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,999
on Mars by six degrees it takes off and
we melt the polar ice caps and liquid

2630
00:59:29,999 --> 00:59:30,009
we melt the polar ice caps and liquid
 

2631
00:59:30,009 --> 00:59:33,720
we melt the polar ice caps and liquid

of Mars Mars once had an ocean we think

2636
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:39,910
of Mars Mars once had an ocean we think
 

2637
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:41,729
of Mars Mars once had an ocean we think

about the size of the United States and
so that is a possibility now how do we

so that is a possibility now how do we
 

2641
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,799
so that is a possibility now how do we
get there how do we raise the

get there how do we raise the
 

2643

I'm not sure about that because we don't
