it means like they're not into it as

552
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
it means like they're not into it as
 

553
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,670
it means like they're not into it as
much or at least certain sports

much or at least certain sports
 

555
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,030
much or at least certain sports
because they have the resources

556
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
because they have the resources
 

557
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,710

be an issue
 

561
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,790
be an issue
so there's something to like where the

562
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:52,800
so there's something to like where the
 

563
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,310
so there's something to like where the
starting point is like that's the

564
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:54,320
starting point is like that's the
 

565
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,829
starting point is like that's the
argument with like uh

566
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:55,839
argument with like uh
 

567
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,990

they say mardon is better than messi

572
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:03,120
they say mardon is better than messi
 

573
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,590
they say mardon is better than messi
because

574
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:03,600
because
 

575
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,750
because
he basically carried the team and and

576
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
he basically carried the team and and
 

577
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,110
he basically carried the team and and
won the world cup with the team that

578
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:07,120
won the world cup with the team that
 

579
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,949
won the world cup with the team that
wouldn't otherwise win the world cup

580
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
wouldn't otherwise win the world cup
 

581
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,150
wouldn't otherwise win the world cup

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,160
and then messi was only successful in
 

583
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,070
and then messi was only successful in
barcelona because uh

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,470
the and you know the
you know the again the backing there in

620
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:40,480
you know the again the backing there in
 

621
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,310
you know the again the backing there in
the midfield but um

622
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,320
the midfield but um
 

623
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,910
the midfield but um

are certain positives to that

992
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
are certain positives to that
 

993
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,230
are certain positives to that
and i it's just things are as they are

994
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:22,240
and i it's just things are as they are
 

995
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,990
and i it's just things are as they are
it's difficult but that is ultimately

996
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,000
it's difficult but that is ultimately
 

997
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,350
it's difficult but that is ultimately
more the law of the jungle and i think

998
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:25,360
more the law of the jungle and i think
 

999
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,790
more the law of the jungle and i think
that we're able to supersede some of

1000
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:26,800
that we're able to supersede some of
 

1001
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,110
that we're able to supersede some of
that

1002
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:27,120
that
 

1003
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,509
that
now in modern times and i think we're

1004
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
now in modern times and i think we're
 

1005
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,150
now in modern times and i think we're
fortunate

1006
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,160
fortunate
 

1007
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,990
fortunate
but as you mentioned we look back and

1008
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:32,000
but as you mentioned we look back and
 

1009
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,350
but as you mentioned we look back and
say oh this is horrible

1010
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,360
say oh this is horrible
 

1011
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,509
say oh this is horrible
say no that that just is what it is

1012
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:35,519
say no that that just is what it is
 

1013
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,389
say no that that just is what it is
that's how life

1014
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:36,399
that's how life
 

1015
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,030
that's how life
is at a base level and you know again if

1016
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:39,040
is at a base level and you know again if
 

1017
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,790
is at a base level and you know again if
you're a lion and i'm a gazelle i don't

1018
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:40,800
you're a lion and i'm a gazelle i don't
 

1019
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,710
you're a lion and i'm a gazelle i don't
i don't really like it very much but we

1020
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:42,720
i don't really like it very much but we
 

1021
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,790
i don't really like it very much but we
don't call the lion the bad guy

1022
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:44,800
don't call the lion the bad guy
 

1023
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,110
don't call the lion the bad guy
we don't sanctify the gazelle or the

1024
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
we don't sanctify the gazelle or the
 

1025
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,790
we don't sanctify the gazelle or the
other way around so it's just it's

1026
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:48,800
other way around so it's just it's
 

1027
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,310
other way around so it's just it's
interesting when you pull back some of

1028
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:50,320
interesting when you pull back some of
 

1029
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,069
interesting when you pull back some of
the controls that we put on

1030
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
the controls that we put on
 

1031
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,389
the controls that we put on
our behavior and you know in modern life

1032
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:54,399
our behavior and you know in modern life
 

1033
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,670
our behavior and you know in modern life
which i think are generally speaking

1034
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:55,680
which i think are generally speaking
 

1035
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,470
which i think are generally speaking
positive

1036
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:56,480
positive
 

1037
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,710
positive
you know we get down to how things often

1038
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:58,720
you know we get down to how things often
 

1039
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,910
you know we get down to how things often
are and

1040
00:15:59,910 --> 00:15:59,920
are and
 

1041
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,430
are and
at the same time we could modern life

1042
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:03,440
at the same time we could modern life
 

1043
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,389
at the same time we could modern life
was built by people like genghis khan

1044
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
was built by people like genghis khan
 

1045
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,790
was built by people like genghis khan
so then you get down to the ends just to

1046
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
so then you get down to the ends just to
 

1047
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,150
so then you get down to the ends just to
find the means it's a tough question

1048
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,160
find the means it's a tough question
 

1049
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,670
find the means it's a tough question
these aren't things with easy answers at

1050
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
these aren't things with easy answers at
 

1051
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,030
these aren't things with easy answers at
least if they are i certainly don't have

1052
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:13,040
least if they are i certainly don't have
 

1053
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,350
least if they are i certainly don't have
the

1054
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
the
 

1055
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,949
the
the smarts to figure out the answers to

1056
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:14,959
the smarts to figure out the answers to
 

1057
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,110
the smarts to figure out the answers to
them but uh

1058
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:17,120
them but uh
 

1059
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,389
them but uh
it's it's difficult i would just say

1060
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
it's it's difficult i would just say
 

1061
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,150
it's it's difficult i would just say
people in the world are complicated and

1062
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
people in the world are complicated and
 

1063
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,749
people in the world are complicated and
layered and depending upon which side of

1064
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
layered and depending upon which side of
 

1065
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,110
layered and depending upon which side of
the line you're standing on at various

1066
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
the line you're standing on at various
 

1067
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,150
the line you're standing on at various
times

1068
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:24,160
times
 

1069
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,310
times
you know um you may like or dislike

1070
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
you know um you may like or dislike
 

1071
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,550
you know um you may like or dislike
someone but i can't remember uh

1072
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
someone but i can't remember uh
 

1073
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,230
someone but i can't remember uh
it's i can't remember who's whose idea

1074
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
it's i can't remember who's whose idea
 

1075
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,509
it's i can't remember who's whose idea
was this is killing me but it's the veil

1076
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
was this is killing me but it's the veil
 

1077
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,710
was this is killing me but it's the veil
of ignorance i guess

1078
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
of ignorance i guess
 

1079
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,110
of ignorance i guess
um the philosophical you know um you

1080
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
um the philosophical you know um you
 

1081
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,790
um the philosophical you know um you
know idea of the veil of ignorance where

1082
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
know idea of the veil of ignorance where
 

1083
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,910
know idea of the veil of ignorance where
i go is

1084
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
i go is
 

1085
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,590
i go is
is sticking everyone in the cage the

1086
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:39,600
is sticking everyone in the cage the
 

1087
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,590
is sticking everyone in the cage the
right thing to do when i say or everyone

1088
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
right thing to do when i say or everyone
 

1089
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,870
right thing to do when i say or everyone
but me and i say well

1090
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:42,880
but me and i say well
 

1091
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,790
but me and i say well
no why well it would make my life easier

1092
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:44,800
no why well it would make my life easier
 

1093
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,990
no why well it would make my life easier
if i just went over and took all of your

1094
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:46,000
if i just went over and took all of your
 

1095
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,749
if i just went over and took all of your
stuff as long as you couldn't stop me

1096
00:16:47,749 --> 00:16:47,759
stuff as long as you couldn't stop me
 

1097
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,949
stuff as long as you couldn't stop me
i mean of course that's a great idea

1098
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
i mean of course that's a great idea
 

1099
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,150
i mean of course that's a great idea
that's what everyone does in every video

1100
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,160
that's what everyone does in every video
 

1101
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,230
that's what everyone does in every video
game but uh in skyrim you steal stuff

1102
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
game but uh in skyrim you steal stuff
 

1103
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,670
game but uh in skyrim you steal stuff
when people aren't around

1104
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
when people aren't around
 

1105
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,629
when people aren't around
but um ultimately you go well this isn't

1106
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
but um ultimately you go well this isn't
 

1107
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:57,990
but um ultimately you go well this isn't
the right thing to do because if i were

1108
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,000
the right thing to do because if i were
 

1109
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,110
the right thing to do because if i were
on the other side of it

1110
00:16:59,110 --> 00:16:59,120
on the other side of it
 

1111
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,949
on the other side of it
i would i would not appreciate it it's

1112
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:00,959
i would i would not appreciate it it's
 

1113
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,710
i would i would not appreciate it it's
it's inherently not a good thing to do

1114
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:02,720
it's inherently not a good thing to do
 

1115
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,990
it's inherently not a good thing to do
i'm only doing it because i think i'm

1116
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,000
i'm only doing it because i think i'm
 

1117
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,710
i'm only doing it because i think i'm
going to win and that's a fine way to be

1118
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:06,720
going to win and that's a fine way to be
 

1119
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,309
going to win and that's a fine way to be
but you don't have the white hat on i

1120
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:08,319
but you don't have the white hat on i
 

1121
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,309
but you don't have the white hat on i
guess i would say so

1122
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:10,319
guess i would say so
 

1123
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,909
guess i would say so
i think without those philosophical

1124
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:11,919
i think without those philosophical
 

1125
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,350
i think without those philosophical
underpinnings to reign us in

1126
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:13,360
underpinnings to reign us in
 

1127
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,750
underpinnings to reign us in
you know i guess morally speaking it's

1128
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
you know i guess morally speaking it's
 

1129
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,429
you know i guess morally speaking it's
very difficult to say what's right or

1130
00:17:17,429 --> 00:17:17,439
very difficult to say what's right or
 

1131
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,069
very difficult to say what's right or
wrong and

1132
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,079
wrong and
 

1133
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,750
wrong and
you'd say certain actions have a

1134
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
you'd say certain actions have a
 

1135
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,990
you'd say certain actions have a
reaction almost like a physics sense

1136
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
reaction almost like a physics sense
 

1137
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,549
reaction almost like a physics sense
if you kill everyone in your way for as

1138
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
if you kill everyone in your way for as
 

1139
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,230
if you kill everyone in your way for as
long as you're able to

1140
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
long as you're able to
 

1141
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,789
long as you're able to
your life will be easier i mean you're

1142
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
your life will be easier i mean you're
 

1143
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,070
your life will be easier i mean you're
setting the table for someone doing the

1144
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:30,080
setting the table for someone doing the
 

1145
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,270
setting the table for someone doing the
same to you when you're no longer the

1307
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,190
very very different direction and the
only person the only thing stopping that

1308
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,200
only person the only thing stopping that
 

1309
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,029
only person the only thing stopping that
person from doing something to me

1310
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:07,039
person from doing something to me
 

1311
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,230
person from doing something to me
is either me that person or someone else

1312
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
is either me that person or someone else
 

1313
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,830
is either me that person or someone else
that will stand in between us

1314
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:11,840
that will stand in between us
 

1315
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,750
that will stand in between us
and if i can't do it and there's no one

1316
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
and if i can't do it and there's no one
 

1317
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,950
and if i can't do it and there's no one
there to stand in between us

1318
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
there to stand in between us
 

1319
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,190
there to stand in between us
then the only thing stopping that person

1320
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
then the only thing stopping that person
 

1321
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,470
then the only thing stopping that person
is that person and i have to hope that

1322
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:18,480
is that person and i have to hope that
 

1323
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,029
is that person and i have to hope that
they're

1324
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:19,039
they're
 

1325
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,750
they're
either disinterested or disinclined to

1326
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
either disinterested or disinclined to
 

1327
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,510
either disinterested or disinclined to
do that sort of thing and i think that

1328
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
do that sort of thing and i think that
 

1329
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,310
do that sort of thing and i think that
uh

1330
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,320
uh
 

1331
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,549
uh
you know it's keeping in mind that that

1332
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
you know it's keeping in mind that that
 

1333
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,750
you know it's keeping in mind that that
that is the fundamental

1334
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:27,760
that is the fundamental
 

1335
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,909
that is the fundamental
nature of the world whether we like it

1336
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:29,919
nature of the world whether we like it
 

1337
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,110
nature of the world whether we like it
or not um

1338
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
or not um
 

1339
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,669
or not um
is important and i think the the quest

1340
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
is important and i think the the quest
 

1341
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,230
is important and i think the the quest
to

1342
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:34,240
to
 

1343
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,230
to
fundamentally alter human nature is

1344
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,240
fundamentally alter human nature is
 

1345
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,669
fundamentally alter human nature is
going to be ultimately fruitless and

1346
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
going to be ultimately fruitless and
 

1347
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,630
going to be ultimately fruitless and
then also it's

1348
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
then also it's
 

1349
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,390
then also it's
it is a little bit egotistical the lion

1350
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:40,400
it is a little bit egotistical the lion
 

1351
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,669
it is a little bit egotistical the lion
does what a lion does

1352
00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:41,679
does what a lion does

a realization at least from my

00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
a realization at least from my
 

1455
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,590
a realization at least from my
perspective that

1456
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
perspective that
 

1457
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,830
perspective that
power corrupts everyone even if you're

i think that i have to allow for a

1582
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:29,600
i think that i have to allow for a
 

1583
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,590
i think that i have to allow for a
space i guess with the word it's almost

1584
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:31,600
space i guess with the word it's almost
 

1585
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,710
space i guess with the word it's almost
a religious term but i guess i would

1586
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:32,720
a religious term but i guess i would
 

1587
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,669
a religious term but i guess i would
just say grace

1588
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:33,679
just say grace
 

1589
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:34,710
just say grace
and that's something that i see

1590
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:34,720
and that's something that i see
 

1591
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,269
and that's something that i see
disappearing from discourse in the

1592
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:37,279
disappearing from discourse in the
 

1593
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,789
disappearing from discourse in the
public or maybe it wasn't there i'm not

1597
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,350
sure but it's interesting you know
watching this occur

and basically uh you know with with the
 

1617
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,830
and basically uh you know with with the
degree to which everything is recorded

1618
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:57,840
degree to which everything is recorded
 

1619
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,510
degree to which everything is recorded
but recorded in tiny little bytes it's

1620
00:24:59,510 --> 00:24:59,520
but recorded in tiny little bytes it's
 

1621
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,110

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,230
part if that's a sliding scale
that we could all find ourselves looking

2034
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
that we could all find ourselves looking

00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
um learning how to generate force on
 

2963
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,510
um learning how to generate force on
your own and how to steal force from the

floor how to steal force from the other
person and move in concert with it as

opposed to clash against which if you

2970
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
opposed to clash against which if you
 

2971
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:03,750
opposed to clash against which if you
watch

2972
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
watch
 

2973
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,349
watch
two untrained people fight it's almost

2974
00:46:05,349 --> 00:46:05,359
two untrained people fight it's almost
 

2975
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:06,950
two untrained people fight it's almost
entirely a clash it's a runaway and

2976
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
entirely a clash it's a runaway and
 

2977
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,550
entirely a clash it's a runaway and
clash or run away and clash

2978
00:46:08,550 --> 00:46:08,560
clash or run away and clash
 

2979
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,589
clash or run away and clash
um if you watch jiu jitsu done well

2980
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:11,599
um if you watch jiu jitsu done well
 

2981
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,150
um if you watch jiu jitsu done well
it's it looks like water moving around a

2982
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,160
it's it looks like water moving around a
 

2983
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,510
it's it looks like water moving around a
solid structure

2984
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:15,520
solid structure
 

2985
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,150
solid structure
and and i think that that is expressed

2986
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
and and i think that that is expressed
 

2987
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,589
and and i think that that is expressed
physically and i think that all of the

2988
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
physically and i think that all of the
 

2989
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,390
physically and i think that all of the
things

2990
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:20,400
things
 

2991
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,870
things
that anyone have really been able to do

2992
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
that anyone have really been able to do
 

2993
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,349
that anyone have really been able to do
very very well in jiu jitsu end up

2994
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:25,359
very very well in jiu jitsu end up
 

2995
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,589
very very well in jiu jitsu end up
kind of exemplifying that but i think

2996
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
kind of exemplifying that but i think
 

2997
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,270
kind of exemplifying that but i think
that's true of martial arts in general

2998
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
that's true of martial arts in general
 

2999
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,710
that's true of martial arts in general
i think that a lot of times like the

3000
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
i think that a lot of times like the
 

3001
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,630
i think that a lot of times like the
clashing that we see going on

3002
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:32,640
clashing that we see going on
 

3003
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,430
clashing that we see going on
um and working well is just the fact

3004
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
um and working well is just the fact
 

3005
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,390
um and working well is just the fact
that you know you get

3006
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:36,400
that you know you get
 

3007
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,550
that you know you get
very very physically powerful people

3008
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:38,560
very very physically powerful people
 

3009
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,750
very very physically powerful people
every now and then they're able to get

3010
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:39,760
every now and then they're able to get
 

3011
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,109
every now and then they're able to get
away with this but i don't think that

3012
00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
away with this but i don't think that
 

3013
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,790
away with this but i don't think that
that's and that's that's fantastic

3014
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
that's and that's that's fantastic
 

3015
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,150
that's and that's that's fantastic
because ultimately it's a results-driven

3016
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,160
because ultimately it's a results-driven
 

3017
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,950
because ultimately it's a results-driven
thing but

3018
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:44,960
thing but
 

3019
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,390
thing but
i think that the essence of the martial

3020
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:46,400
i think that the essence of the martial
 

3021
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,750
i think that the essence of the martial
arts is learning how to make more out of

3022
00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:47,760
arts is learning how to make more out of
 

3023
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,190
arts is learning how to make more out of
less and how to move with

3024
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,200
less and how to move with
 

3025
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,589
less and how to move with
and be yielding almost like real life

3026
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:51,599
and be yielding almost like real life
 

3027
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:52,550
and be yielding almost like real life
aikido

3028
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:52,560
aikido
 

3029
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,950
aikido
and uh so you think of martial arts uh

3030
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:54,960
and uh so you think of martial arts uh
 

3031
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,630
and uh so you think of martial arts uh
jiu jitsu

3032
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:56,640
jiu jitsu
 

3033
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,750
jiu jitsu
as uh like water

3034
00:46:59,750 --> 00:46:59,760
as uh like water
 

3035
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,230
as uh like water
or flowing so aikido so moving around

3036
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:04,240
or flowing so aikido so moving around
 

3037
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,390
or flowing so aikido so moving around
the the force as opposed to

3038
00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:08,400
the the force as opposed to
 

3039
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,430
the the force as opposed to
sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is

3040
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is
 

3041
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,589
sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is
finding a leverage where you can apply

3042
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
finding a leverage where you can apply
 

3043
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,109
finding a leverage where you can apply
an exceptional amount of force

3044
00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:15,119
an exceptional amount of force
 

3045
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,589
an exceptional amount of force
so like it's like maximizing the

3046
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:17,599
so like it's like maximizing the
 

3047
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:19,030
so like it's like maximizing the
application of force i guess maybe

3048
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:19,040
application of force i guess maybe
 

3049
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,630
application of force i guess maybe
that's a better way to i'd like to marry

3050
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
that's a better way to i'd like to marry
 

3051
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,470
that's a better way to i'd like to marry
the two ideas you know because i think

3052
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,480
the two ideas you know because i think
 

3053
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,990
the two ideas you know because i think
you flow until the point at which

3054
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:24,000
you flow until the point at which
 

3055
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,589
you flow until the point at which
you are the greater force at which point

3056
00:47:25,589 --> 00:47:25,599
you are the greater force at which point
 

3057
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:27,190
you are the greater force at which point
in time you can apply

i'm told by people that i trust that it
 

3533
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,910
i'm told by people that i trust that it
just one doesn't bear resemblance to the

00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
just one doesn't bear resemblance to the
 

3535
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,030
just one doesn't bear resemblance to the
other and i think that's a very

3536
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:35,040
other and i think that's a very
 

3537
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,230
other and i think that's a very
interesting thing that you may be able

3538
00:54:36,230 --> 00:54:36,240
interesting thing that you may be able
 

3539
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:39,750
interesting thing that you may be able
to say the same thing but in in a more

3540
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:39,760
to say the same thing but in in a more
 

3541
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,270
to say the same thing but in in a more
in i guess in a different way in a more

3542
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
in i guess in a different way in a more
 

3543
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,950
in i guess in a different way in a more
artistic way that that

3544
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
artistic way that that
 

3545
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,710
artistic way that that
may not translate on a one-for-one kind

3546
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:44,720
may not translate on a one-for-one kind
 

3547
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,190
may not translate on a one-for-one kind
of fidelity but um

3548
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:47,200
of fidelity but um
 

3549
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,950
of fidelity but um
the more that we're able to understand

um but the problem with that is
 

3611
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,589
um but the problem with that is
oftentimes we get stuck in that phase

i'm basically just throwing at you
 

3647
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,829
i'm basically just throwing at you
like 75 different words that you could

3648
00:56:07,829 --> 00:56:07,839
like 75 different words that you could
 

3649
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:09,510
like 75 different words that you could
use but that hasn't really taught you

3650
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:09,520
use but that hasn't really taught you
 

3651
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:10,789
use but that hasn't really taught you
how to how to

3652
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
how to how to
 

3653
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,870
how to how to
speak a language whereas if you give me

3654
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
speak a language whereas if you give me
 

3655
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:13,990
speak a language whereas if you give me
the language structure

3656
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
the language structure
 

3657
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,990
the language structure
you can fill in these pieces on your own

3658
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
you can fill in these pieces on your own
 

3659
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,069
you can fill in these pieces on your own
and then eventually speak organically

3660
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:18,079
and then eventually speak organically
 

3661
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,910
and then eventually speak organically
in lex form which will be ultimately

3662
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
in lex form which will be ultimately
 

3663
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,069
in lex form which will be ultimately
unique to you because otherwise you just

3664
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
unique to you because otherwise you just
 

3665
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:22,630
unique to you because otherwise you just
end up being

3666
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:22,640
end up being
 

3667
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,789
end up being

but uh which maybe all is right but

3848
00:59:15,589 --> 00:59:15,599
but uh which maybe all is right but
 

3849
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:16,950
but uh which maybe all is right but
basically uh

3850
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:16,960
basically uh
 

3851
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,630
basically uh
you know going through that iterative

3852
00:59:18,630 --> 00:59:18,640
you know going through that iterative
 

3853
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,710
you know going through that iterative
process that allows you to eventually

3854
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:20,720
process that allows you to eventually
 

3855
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,309
process that allows you to eventually
find your self-expression and find your

3856
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:22,319
find your self-expression and find your
 

3857
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,190
find your self-expression and find your
voice so that you

3858
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:23,200
voice so that you
 

3859
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,870
voice so that you
you fight the same way that you speak

3860
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:24,880
you fight the same way that you speak
 

3861
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,150
you fight the same way that you speak
the same way that you write the same way

3862
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
the same way that you write the same way
 

3863
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,270
the same way that you write the same way
that you think in a way that

3864
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
that you think in a way that
 

3865
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,589
that you think in a way that
that is uniquely you that will also

3866
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
that is uniquely you that will also
 

3867
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,670
that is uniquely you that will also
ultimately allow you

3868
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
ultimately allow you
 

3869
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,030
ultimately allow you
to understand other people being

3870
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
to understand other people being
 

3871
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,630
to understand other people being
uniquely them because even if you can

3872
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
uniquely them because even if you can
 

3873
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,990
uniquely them because even if you can
only conceptualize and i think about

3874
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:36,000
only conceptualize and i think about
 

3875
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,870
only conceptualize and i think about
this a lot for

3876
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
this a lot for
 

3877
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,150
this a lot for
society stuff where i go well this is

3878
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:38,160
society stuff where i go well this is
 

3879
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,150
society stuff where i go well this is
how i feel about this but

3880
00:59:40,150 --> 00:59:40,160
how i feel about this but
 

3881
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:41,990
how i feel about this but
am i objectively right maybe about a

3882
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:42,000
am i objectively right maybe about a
 

3883
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,510
am i objectively right maybe about a
couple things but that's a small box

3884
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:43,520
couple things but that's a small box
 

3885
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,710
couple things but that's a small box
that i have to be very very careful

3886
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
that i have to be very very careful
 

3887
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,150
that i have to be very very careful
about what i think is objective

3888
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
about what i think is objective
 

3889
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,670
about what i think is objective
and versus what's not and i have to be

3890
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
and versus what's not and i have to be
 

3891
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,030
and versus what's not and i have to be
open to the possibility that all the

3892
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,040
open to the possibility that all the
 

3893
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:49,910
open to the possibility that all the
things that i think are

3894
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:49,920
things that i think are
 

3895
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,990
things that i think are
objectively correct may or may not be

3896
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
objectively correct may or may not be
 

3897
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,150
objectively correct may or may not be
and that should allow me to have some

3898
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:54,160
and that should allow me to have some
 

3899
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,069
and that should allow me to have some
degree of compassion or consideration

3900
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:56,079
degree of compassion or consideration
 

3901
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,750
degree of compassion or consideration
for other people both in their martial

3902
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
for other people both in their martial
 

3903
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,870
for other people both in their martial
arts journey and in their

3904
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
arts journey and in their
 

3905
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,630
arts journey and in their
in their journey you know as people as

3906
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:00,640
in their journey you know as people as
 

3907
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,870
in their journey you know as people as
human beings because i understand

3908
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
human beings because i understand
 

3909
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:05,990
human beings because i understand
that they're on a it's a we're all on a

3910
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
that they're on a it's a we're all on a
 

3911
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,430
that they're on a it's a we're all on a
path right it's all a

3912
01:00:07,430 --> 01:00:07,440
path right it's all a
 

3913
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,670
path right it's all a
again an iterative process of eventual

3914
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:09,680
again an iterative process of eventual
 

3915
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,030
again an iterative process of eventual
self-expression but i think that's one

3916
01:00:11,030 --> 01:00:11,040
self-expression but i think that's one
 

3917
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,549
self-expression but i think that's one
of the things that we

3918
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:12,559
of the things that we
 

3919
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,030
of the things that we
see having trouble when we see tribalism

3920
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:15,040
see having trouble when we see tribalism
 

3921
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,150
see having trouble when we see tribalism
which i mean

3922
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
which i mean
 

3923
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:17,670
which i mean
raises an expression of that political

3924
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:17,680
raises an expression of that political
 

3925
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,190
raises an expression of that political
affiliation expression of that

3926
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
affiliation expression of that
 

3927
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,549
affiliation expression of that
all of these things that can go in

3928
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:20,559
all of these things that can go in
 

3929
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,150
all of these things that can go in
really uncomfortable directions people

3930
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,160
really uncomfortable directions people
 

3931
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,109
really uncomfortable directions people
are looking for

3932
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
are looking for
 

3933
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,549
are looking for
hey where do i plant my feet over here

3934
01:00:24,549 --> 01:00:24,559
hey where do i plant my feet over here
 

3935
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:26,390
hey where do i plant my feet over here
where's where's the thing that i know is

3936
01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:26,400
where's where's the thing that i know is
 

3937
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,150
where's where's the thing that i know is
right and that we can all agree on the

3938
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
right and that we can all agree on the
 

3939
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:28,950
right and that we can all agree on the
following

3940
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:28,960
following
 

3941
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,870
following
and i think that we see that in martial

3942
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:30,880
and i think that we see that in martial
 

3943
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,309
and i think that we see that in martial
arts we're like oh i do this style why

3944
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
arts we're like oh i do this style why
 

3945
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:33,750
arts we're like oh i do this style why
do that style i do that stuff which is

3946
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
do that style i do that stuff which is
 

3947
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:34,870
do that style i do that stuff which is
like hey man we're all

3948
01:00:34,870 --> 01:00:34,880
like hey man we're all
 

3949
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,069
like hey man we're all
just pushing forward in a certain

3950
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
just pushing forward in a certain
 

3951
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:37,270
just pushing forward in a certain
direction you're trying to do our best

3952
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:37,280
direction you're trying to do our best
 

3953
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:38,309
direction you're trying to do our best
and i understand why you feel the way

3954
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
and i understand why you feel the way
 

3955
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,670
and i understand why you feel the way
you do i may have felt like that at one

3956
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:39,680
you do i may have felt like that at one
 

3957
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:40,549
you do i may have felt like that at one
point too

3958
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
point too
 

3959
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,789
point too
but uh you know what i'm just trying to

3960
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
but uh you know what i'm just trying to
 

3961
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,230
but uh you know what i'm just trying to
learn and understand

3962
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:44,240
learn and understand
 

3963
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:46,549
learn and understand
versus i've already acquired enough

3964
01:00:46,549 --> 01:00:46,559
versus i've already acquired enough
 

3965
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,470
versus i've already acquired enough
knowledge let me cross my arms and start

3966
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
knowledge let me cross my arms and start
 

3967
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,309
knowledge let me cross my arms and start
to to look who's [\h__\h] up around here

3968
01:00:50,309 --> 01:00:50,319
to to look who's [\h__\h] up around here
 

3969
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:52,549
to to look who's [\h__\h] up around here
yeah and and i think that uh

3970
01:00:52,549 --> 01:00:52,559
yeah and and i think that uh
 

3971
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,950
yeah and and i think that uh
that that's an it's an interesting trap

3972
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
that that's an it's an interesting trap
 

3973
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,390
that that's an it's an interesting trap
that i think is very human trapped to

3974
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
that i think is very human trapped to
 

3975
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,069
that i think is very human trapped to
fall into but it definitely happens

3976
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
fall into but it definitely happens
 

3977
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,349
fall into but it definitely happens
early on it's something it's a joke in

3978
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
early on it's something it's a joke in
 

3979
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,630
early on it's something it's a joke in
the jiu jitsu world right like how the

3980
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
the jiu jitsu world right like how the
 

3981
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,230
the jiu jitsu world right like how the
blue belt that knows everything well

3982
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,240
blue belt that knows everything well
 

3983
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,670
blue belt that knows everything well
initially it's like what i know nothing

3984
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:03,680
initially it's like what i know nothing
 

3985
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:03,990
initially it's like what i know nothing
and i

3986
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,000
and i
 

3987
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,589
and i
at least think i know nothing then i'd

3988
01:01:05,589 --> 01:01:05,599
at least think i know nothing then i'd
 

3989
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:06,710
at least think i know nothing then i'd
learn a little bit and i think it's a

3990
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
learn a little bit and i think it's a
 

3991
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:07,589
learn a little bit and i think it's a
lot bit

3992
01:01:07,589 --> 01:01:07,599
lot bit
 

3993
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:08,950
lot bit
and then you know the more you learn the

3994
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
and then you know the more you learn the
 

3995
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,990
and then you know the more you learn the
more you go like i don't even know what

3996
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:10,000
more you go like i don't even know what
 

3997
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,030
more you go like i don't even know what
i'm doing

3998
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:11,040
i'm doing
 

3999
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,349
i'm doing
yeah that's exactly right we kind of

4000
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
yeah that's exactly right we kind of
 

4001
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:14,950
yeah that's exactly right we kind of
talked about it a little bit

4002
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:14,960
talked about it a little bit
 

4003
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,190
talked about it a little bit
but uh once again a lot of people that

4004
01:01:17,190 --> 01:01:17,200
but uh once again a lot of people that

biggest hurdle and physical
 

4213
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,470

4381
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:35,190
i can't say even say your best interests
at heart because they don't even know

4382
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:35,200
at heart because they don't even know
 

4383

way that they would understand
and i guess that's for instance that's

4390
01:06:40,549 --> 01:06:40,559
and i guess that's for instance that's
 

4391
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:42,630
and i guess that's for instance that's
what i would try to do with anyone

4399
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:49,750
understand
they need as best i can in as safe and

4400
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:49,760
they need as best i can in as safe and
 

4401
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,270
they need as best i can in as safe and
reasonable a way as possible

4402

reasonable a way as possible
 

4403
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,390
reasonable a way as possible
but sometimes in a way that's going to

4404
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:52,400
but sometimes in a way that's going to
 

4405
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:54,230
but sometimes in a way that's going to
make them uncomfortable particularly if

4406
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
make them uncomfortable particularly if
 

4407

physical combat
 

4409
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,789
physical combat
and and it's not something they've done

4410
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
and and it's not something they've done
 

4411
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,710
and and it's not something they've done
before if

01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:58,720
before if

and so that can be a big jump and you
 

4419
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:05,430
and so that can be a big jump and you
have to understand if if that's

4420
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
have to understand if if that's
 

4421
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,109
have to understand if if that's
where you're starting from no worries

4422
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:07,119
where you're starting from no worries

your way to it and it's going to be

4426
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:10,000
your way to it and it's going to be
 

4427
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,029
your way to it and it's going to be
uncomfortable and

and bowing all these traditions there's
 

4937
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,830

outside perhaps but there's something
 

4941
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,950
outside perhaps but there's something
really powerful to that

really powerful to that
 

4943
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:31,189

at the bigger picture
it's fascinating and i don't know what

5346
01:20:38,790 --> 01:20:38,800
it's fascinating and i don't know what

let's uh use an example of sci-fi movies
 

5375
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:05,990
let's uh use an example of sci-fi movies
let's say the matrix which of course

5376
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:06,000
let's say the matrix which of course
 

5377
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,270
let's say the matrix which of course
the first one was amazing and then each

5378
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,280
the first one was amazing and then each
 

5379
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,270
the first one was amazing and then each
subsequent movie made the series worse

5380
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
subsequent movie made the series worse
 

5381
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,270
subsequent movie made the series worse
but um but basically i'm working on a

5382
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:11,280
but um but basically i'm working on a
 

5383
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:12,709
but um but basically i'm working on a
new one by the way yeah i've heard

um but basically uh you know it's like
 

5389
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:17,350
um but basically uh you know it's like
hey we started

5390
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:17,360
hey we started
 

5391

um i mean granted it hasn't sustained
 

5455
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,629
um i mean granted it hasn't sustained
but i mean that type of a

5456
01:22:20,629 --> 01:22:20,639
but i mean that type of a
 

5457
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:23,270
but i mean that type of a
of a thing it burns too hot almost and

5458
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:23,280
of a thing it burns too hot almost and
 

5459
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,550
of a thing it burns too hot almost and
it uh

5460
01:22:24,550 --> 01:22:24,560
it uh
 

5461

01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
and you know i guess that that type of
 

5465
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:29,910
and you know i guess that that type of
unforgiving nature

be okay with what i'm saying
which is usually the beginning of a

6638
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
which is usually the beginning of a
 

6639
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:00,950
which is usually the beginning of a
conversation that's going to go nowhere

6640
01:40:00,950 --> 01:40:00,960
conversation that's going to go nowhere
 

6641
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:01,590
conversation that's going to go nowhere
right

6642
01:40:01,590 --> 01:40:01,600
right
 

6643
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,189
right
and uh it's it's neat to see um

6644
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,199
and uh it's it's neat to see um
 

6645
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,350
and uh it's it's neat to see um
the things i guess that he's created on

6646
01:40:07,350 --> 01:40:07,360
the things i guess that he's created on
 

6647
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:08,550
the things i guess that he's created on
his own as a result

6648
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:08,560
his own as a result
 

6649
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,030
his own as a result
of the authenticity that's there and it

6650
01:40:11,030 --> 01:40:11,040
of the authenticity that's there and it
 

6651
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,109
of the authenticity that's there and it
reminds me of like dave chappelle and

6652
01:40:13,109 --> 01:40:13,119
reminds me of like dave chappelle and
 

6653
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:14,550
reminds me of like dave chappelle and
again i don't know i've never met dave

6654
01:40:14,550 --> 01:40:14,560
again i don't know i've never met dave
 

6655
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:16,310
again i don't know i've never met dave
but it's neat to see someone that's

but it's neat to see someone that's
 

6657
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:19,430
but it's neat to see someone that's
clearly again authentic in their own way

6658
01:40:19,430 --> 01:40:19,440
clearly again authentic in their own way

the effort and i think that that's
something where martial arts shows

7862
01:58:50,950 --> 01:58:50,960
the chain of events that led us
 

7863
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:53,030
the chain of events that led us
somewhere and then only with only with

7864
01:58:53,030 --> 01:58:53,040
somewhere and then only with only with
 

7865
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:54,310
somewhere and then only with only with
the eyes of history can we truly

7866

speak to this more but for ryan i think

9340
02:21:30,389 --> 02:21:30,399
speak to this more but for ryan i think
 

9341
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:31,349
speak to this more but for ryan i think
it was the

9342
02:21:31,349 --> 02:21:31,359
it was the
 

9343
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:34,790
it was the
um inability to to perform at certain

9344
02:21:34,790 --> 02:21:34,800
um inability to to perform at certain
 

9345
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:36,230
um inability to to perform at certain
points to the upper

9346
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:36,240
points to the upper
 

9347
02:21:36,240 --> 02:21:37,990
points to the upper
the missing of opportunities that for

9348
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:38,000
the missing of opportunities that for
 

9349
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,990
the missing of opportunities that for
him from my perspective watching him

9350
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:40,000
him from my perspective watching him
 

9351
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:41,910
him from my perspective watching him
go through and having seen various

9352
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:41,920
go through and having seen various
 

9353
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:43,429
go through and having seen various
points of his growth from

9354
02:21:43,429 --> 02:21:43,439
points of his growth from
 

9355
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:45,830
points of his growth from
from early purple bought on i think the

9356
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:45,840
from early purple bought on i think the
 

9357
02:21:45,840 --> 02:21:47,670
from early purple bought on i think the
hardest time for him looking in

9358
02:21:47,670 --> 02:21:47,680
hardest time for him looking in
 

9359
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:51,190
hardest time for him looking in
obviously was when he would hit moments

9360
02:21:51,190 --> 02:21:51,200
obviously was when he would hit moments
 

9361
02:21:51,200 --> 02:21:53,349
obviously was when he would hit moments
where he wasn't able to perform

9362
02:21:53,349 --> 02:21:53,359
where he wasn't able to perform
 

9363
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:54,790
where he wasn't able to perform
for various reasons he couldn't get

9364
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800
for various reasons he couldn't get
 

9365
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:57,030
for various reasons he couldn't get

that totally counterproductive um
 

9579
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,389
that totally counterproductive um
you can't help but think that way when

9580
02:25:12,389 --> 02:25:12,399
you can't help but think that way when

you've had the amount of injuries i've

9582
02:25:13,750 --> 02:25:13,760
you've had the amount of injuries i've

you've had the amount of injuries i've
had now because i've had

had now because i've had
 

9585
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:18,230
had now because i've had
more than most people's fair share um

9586
02:25:18,230 --> 02:25:18,240
more than most people's fair share um
 

9587
02:25:18,240 --> 02:25:19,910
more than most people's fair share um
as my orthopedic says you don't want to

9588
02:25:19,910 --> 02:25:19,920
as my orthopedic says you don't want to
 

9589
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:21,510
as my orthopedic says you don't want to
win that you don't want to with the

9590
02:25:21,510 --> 02:25:21,520
win that you don't want to with the
 

9591
02:25:21,520 --> 02:25:23,190
win that you don't want to with the
contest of who's had the most

9592
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:23,200
contest of who's had the most
 

9593
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,710
contest of who's had the most
but since you haven't actually built me

9594
02:25:24,710 --> 02:25:24,720
but since you haven't actually built me
 

9595

a pool yeah um
but i think you can't help but think

9598
02:25:29,349 --> 02:25:29,359
but i think you can't help but think
 

9599
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:30,710
but i think you can't help but think
that way sometimes but i definitely

9600
02:25:30,710 --> 02:25:30,720
that way sometimes but i definitely
 

9601
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:32,150
that way sometimes but i definitely
don't think it's

9602
02:25:32,150 --> 02:25:32,160
don't think it's
 

9603
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,670
don't think it's
i think it can be facilitated if you

9604
02:25:33,670 --> 02:25:33,680
i think it can be facilitated if you
 

9605
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:35,429
i think it can be facilitated if you
don't beat yourself up too much

9606

don't beat yourself up too much
 

9607
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:38,550
don't beat yourself up too much
um because thinking about

02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:19,429
if they're the same size and so i think
that the willingness to be in that

that the willingness to be in that
 

9657

over and over and over again creates a
 

9661
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,750
over and over and over again creates a
lot of strength resiliency willingness

mean you know groupthink is a real thing
 

11005
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:46,070
mean you know groupthink is a real thing
in group inertia

11006
02:46:46,070 --> 02:46:46,080
in group inertia
 

11007
02:46:46,080 --> 02:46:48,950
in group inertia
and it's it's neat to see um you know

11008
02:46:48,950 --> 02:46:48,960
and it's it's neat to see um you know

the line isn't impressive that comes up
 

11029
02:47:06,080 --> 02:47:07,830
the line isn't impressive that comes up
with an interesting way to use it

11030

02:47:19,110 --> 02:47:19,120
of course it's not going to be as good
 

11047
02:47:19,120 --> 02:47:20,309
of course it's not going to be as good
as the airplane down the line the

11048
02:47:20,309 --> 02:47:20,319
as the airplane down the line the
 

11049
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:22,389
as the airplane down the line the
iterative things that happen later on

internal constitution has changed

11234
02:49:59,510 --> 02:49:59,520
internal constitution has changed
 

11235
02:49:59,520 --> 02:50:00,150
internal constitution has changed
because

11236
02:50:00,150 --> 02:50:00,160
because
 

11237
02:50:00,160 --> 02:50:02,230
because
of of how i've decided to approach the

of of how i've decided to approach the
situation so although i wouldn't

11240
02:50:03,670 --> 02:50:03,680
situation so although i wouldn't
 

11241
02:50:03,680 --> 02:50:05,510
situation so although i wouldn't
personally want to spend all my time

11242
02:50:05,510 --> 02:50:05,520
personally want to spend all my time
 

11243

personally want to spend all my time
trying to turn lead into gold because i

11244
02:50:07,349 --> 02:50:07,359
trying to turn lead into gold because i
 

11245
02:50:07,359 --> 02:50:09,269
trying to turn lead into gold because i
don't believe that it's likely to work

11246
02:50:09,269 --> 02:50:09,279
don't believe that it's likely to work
 

11247
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:11,510
don't believe that it's likely to work
only a person who's willing to spend his

11248
02:50:11,510 --> 02:50:11,520
only a person who's willing to spend his
 

11249
02:50:11,520 --> 02:50:13,030
only a person who's willing to spend his
or her life in that pursuit will

11250
02:50:13,030 --> 02:50:13,040
or her life in that pursuit will
 

11251
02:50:13,040 --> 02:50:14,469
or her life in that pursuit will
actually get to the bottom of that and

11252
02:50:14,469 --> 02:50:14,479
actually get to the bottom of that and
 

11253
02:50:14,479 --> 02:50:15,190
actually get to the bottom of that and
also in the

11254
02:50:15,190 --> 02:50:15,200
also in the
 

11255
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:16,710
also in the
in the pursuit of that they're likely to

11256
02:50:16,710 --> 02:50:16,720
in the pursuit of that they're likely to
 

11257
02:50:16,720 --> 02:50:18,870
in the pursuit of that they're likely to
find other things so i think a lot of

11258
02:50:18,870 --> 02:50:18,880
find other things so i think a lot of
 

11259
02:50:18,880 --> 02:50:20,469
find other things so i think a lot of
times the idea is that humanity is

11260
02:50:20,469 --> 02:50:20,479
times the idea is that humanity is
 

11261
02:50:20,479 --> 02:50:21,510
times the idea is that humanity is
pushed forward by

11262
02:50:21,510 --> 02:50:21,520
pushed forward by
 

11263
02:50:21,520 --> 02:50:23,030
pushed forward by
you know again it's another orson scott

11266
02:50:24,710 --> 02:50:24,720
carbon it's like you know human beings
 

11267
02:50:24,720 --> 02:50:26,150
carbon it's like you know human beings
are in this slog it's

11268
02:50:26,150 --> 02:50:26,160
are in this slog it's
 

11269
02:50:26,160 --> 02:50:28,150
are in this slog it's
paraphrasing just in this slog over time

11270
02:50:28,150 --> 02:50:28,160
paraphrasing just in this slog over time
 

11271
02:50:28,160 --> 02:50:29,429
paraphrasing just in this slog over time
and then periodically

11272
02:50:29,429 --> 02:50:29,439
and then periodically
 

11273
02:50:29,439 --> 02:50:31,269
and then periodically
the humanity gives birth to genius like

11274

electricity pushes us forward

11278
02:50:34,790 --> 02:50:34,800
electricity pushes us forward
 

11279
02:50:34,800 --> 02:50:36,469
electricity pushes us forward
you know comes up with with the idea of

11280
02:50:36,469 --> 02:50:36,479
you know comes up with with the idea of
 

11281
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:38,070
you know comes up with with the idea of
governance that doesn't you know just

11282
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:38,080
governance that doesn't you know just
 

11283
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:40,230
governance that doesn't you know just
start and end with the point of a sword

11284
02:50:40,230 --> 02:50:40,240
start and end with the point of a sword
 

11285
02:50:40,240 --> 02:50:42,550
start and end with the point of a sword
you know and uh you know these aren't

11286
02:50:42,550 --> 02:50:42,560
you know and uh you know these aren't
 

11287
02:50:42,560 --> 02:50:44,550
you know and uh you know these aren't
common things these are unbelievable

11288
02:50:44,550 --> 02:50:44,560
common things these are unbelievable
 

11289
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:46,630
common things these are unbelievable
advancements that you know that just me

11290
02:50:46,630 --> 02:50:46,640
advancements that you know that just me
 

11291
02:50:46,640 --> 02:50:47,590
advancements that you know that just me
sitting here i didn't come up with them

11292
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:47,600
sitting here i didn't come up with them
 

11293
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:49,110
sitting here i didn't come up with them
but i just get the benefit of it

11294
02:50:49,110 --> 02:50:49,120
but i just get the benefit of it
 

11295
02:50:49,120 --> 02:50:50,550
but i just get the benefit of it
so i guess what i would say is a lot of

11296
02:50:50,550 --> 02:50:50,560
so i guess what i would say is a lot of
 

11297
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,309
so i guess what i would say is a lot of
times these ideas are called crazy

11298
02:50:52,309 --> 02:50:52,319
times these ideas are called crazy
 

11299
02:50:52,319 --> 02:50:53,990
times these ideas are called crazy
you know like as we discussed on kind of

11300
02:50:53,990 --> 02:50:54,000
you know like as we discussed on kind of
 

11301
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:55,510
you know like as we discussed on kind of
offline it's like you know einstein

11302
02:50:55,510 --> 02:50:55,520
offline it's like you know einstein
 

11303
02:50:55,520 --> 02:50:57,990
offline it's like you know einstein
was brilliant in his 20s and it was

11304
02:50:57,990 --> 02:50:58,000
was brilliant in his 20s and it was
 

11305
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,670
was brilliant in his 20s and it was
brilliant before that i would suspect

11306
02:50:59,670 --> 02:50:59,680
brilliant before that i would suspect
 

11307
02:50:59,680 --> 02:51:01,429
brilliant before that i would suspect
but basically uh you know gets

11308
02:51:01,429 --> 02:51:01,439
but basically uh you know gets
 

11309
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:03,349
but basically uh you know gets
recognized later on in life and

11310
02:51:03,349 --> 02:51:03,359
recognized later on in life and
 

11311
02:51:03,359 --> 02:51:04,630
recognized later on in life and
of course we all thought those were

11312
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:04,640
of course we all thought those were
 

11313
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:06,150
of course we all thought those were
great ideas the man was probably roundly

11314
02:51:06,150 --> 02:51:06,160
great ideas the man was probably roundly
 

11315
02:51:06,160 --> 02:51:06,870
great ideas the man was probably roundly
mocked for

11316
02:51:06,870 --> 02:51:06,880
mocked for
 

11317
02:51:06,880 --> 02:51:09,349
mocked for
giant chunks of his life and i i guess

11318
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
giant chunks of his life and i i guess
 

11319
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:10,630
giant chunks of his life and i i guess
so it's neat

11320
02:51:10,630 --> 02:51:10,640
so it's neat
 

11321
02:51:10,640 --> 02:51:12,070
so it's neat
i would say there's definitely in my

mind things that even if it's just
 

11325
02:51:13,760 --> 02:51:15,590
mind things that even if it's just
combinations and new to me

11326
02:51:15,590 --> 02:51:15,600
combinations and new to me
 

11327
02:51:15,600 --> 02:51:17,269
combinations and new to me
new ways to see things new ways to

understand different depth of
 

11331
02:51:18,640 --> 02:51:20,389
understand different depth of
understanding possibly new things new

understanding possibly new things new
 

11333
02:51:20,399 --> 02:51:21,990
understanding possibly new things new
positions new ideas

11334
02:51:21,990 --> 02:51:22,000
positions new ideas
 

11335
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:25,269
positions new ideas
because even if that's not true

11336
02:51:25,269 --> 02:51:25,279
because even if that's not true
 

11337

because even if that's not true
the process of of going through and

the process of of going through and
 

11339
02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:28,790
the process of of going through and
acting as if it is and believing like

02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:30,160
that and focusing and
 

11343
02:51:30,160 --> 02:51:32,309
that and focusing and
trying to investigate will make any of

11344
02:51:32,309 --> 02:51:32,319
trying to investigate will make any of
 

11345
02:51:32,319 --> 02:51:33,990
trying to investigate will make any of
us will push us all forward

11346

us will push us all forward
 

11347
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,230
us will push us all forward
we're sitting there you know obsessing

11348
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:36,240
we're sitting there you know obsessing
 

11349
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:38,070
we're sitting there you know obsessing
over the cult of our current knowledge

11350
02:51:38,070 --> 02:51:38,080
over the cult of our current knowledge
 

11351
02:51:38,080 --> 02:51:39,990
over the cult of our current knowledge
i think is the biggest the biggest

11352
02:51:39,990 --> 02:51:40,000
i think is the biggest the biggest
 

11353
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:41,110
i think is the biggest the biggest
danger um

11354
02:51:41,110 --> 02:51:41,120
danger um
 

11355
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:42,870
danger um
and the biggest cause of stagnation that

11356
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:42,880
and the biggest cause of stagnation that
 

11357
02:51:42,880 --> 02:51:45,429
and the biggest cause of stagnation that
exists anywhere

11358
02:51:45,429 --> 02:51:45,439
exists anywhere
 

11359
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:47,830
exists anywhere
yeah and it starts with believing the

11360
02:51:47,830 --> 02:51:47,840
yeah and it starts with believing the
 

11361
02:51:47,840 --> 02:51:48,950
yeah and it starts with believing the
the impossible which is kind of

11362
02:51:48,950 --> 02:51:48,960
the impossible which is kind of
 

11363
02:51:48,960 --> 02:51:49,670
the impossible which is kind of
interesting

11364
02:51:49,670 --> 02:51:49,680
interesting
 

11365
02:51:49,680 --> 02:51:50,469
interesting
one of the things that's really

11366
02:51:50,469 --> 02:51:50,479
one of the things that's really
 

11367
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:52,630
one of the things that's really
inspiring to me is to see people out

11368
02:51:52,630 --> 02:51:52,640
inspiring to me is to see people out
 

11369
02:51:52,640 --> 02:51:53,349
inspiring to me is to see people out
there which

11370
02:51:53,349 --> 02:51:53,359
there which
 

11371
02:51:53,359 --> 02:51:57,990
there which
which sadly are rare who kind of have

11372
02:51:57,990 --> 02:51:58,000
which sadly are rare who kind of have
 

11373
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,190
which sadly are rare who kind of have
uh a combination of two things one

11374
02:52:01,190 --> 02:52:01,200
uh a combination of two things one
 

11375
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:04,389
uh a combination of two things one
is they have a world view that involves

11376
02:52:04,389 --> 02:52:04,399
is they have a world view that involves
 

11377
02:52:04,399 --> 02:52:05,990
is they have a world view that involves
that includes a lot of ideas that are

11378
02:52:05,990 --> 02:52:06,000
that includes a lot of ideas that are
 

11379
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,910
that includes a lot of ideas that are
crazy and

11380
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
crazy and
 

11381
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:10,150
crazy and
the second part is they're exceptionally

11382
02:52:10,150 --> 02:52:10,160
the second part is they're exceptionally
 

11383
02:52:10,160 --> 02:52:13,349
the second part is they're exceptionally
focused and competent in bringing that

11384
02:52:13,349 --> 02:52:13,359
focused and competent in bringing that
 

11385
02:52:13,359 --> 02:52:15,590
focused and competent in bringing that

isn't the obvious
 

11457
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:22,309
isn't the obvious
path forward like from a perspective

11458
02:53:22,309 --> 02:53:22,319
path forward like from a perspective
 

11459
02:53:22,319 --> 02:53:23,510
path forward like from a perspective
that's what that's what

11460
02:53:23,510 --> 02:53:23,520
that's what that's what
 

11461

that's what that's what
elon talks about like it's obvious that

11462
02:53:26,230 --> 02:53:26,240
elon talks about like it's obvious that
 

11463
02:53:26,240 --> 02:53:27,670
elon talks about like it's obvious that
we're going to expand throughout the

we're going to expand throughout the
 

11465

universe
 

11467
02:53:28,800 --> 02:53:30,870
universe
like so from his perspective from his

11468
02:53:30,870 --> 02:53:30,880
like so from his perspective from his
 

11469
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:32,469
like so from his perspective from his
perspective like

11470
02:53:32,469 --> 02:53:32,479
perspective like
 

11471
02:53:32,479 --> 02:53:34,790
perspective like
but to me it is also obvious because

11472
02:53:34,790 --> 02:53:34,800
but to me it is also obvious because
 

11473
02:53:34,800 --> 02:53:38,469
but to me it is also obvious because
like either we destroy ourselves

11474
02:53:38,469 --> 02:53:38,479
like either we destroy ourselves
 

11475

or will expand beyond earth like
 

11477
02:53:41,520 --> 02:53:44,950
or will expand beyond earth like
uh like there's not many you know we

uh like there's not many you know we
 

11479
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:46,710
uh like there's not many you know we
well it's not maybe it's not completely

well it's not maybe it's not completely
 

11481
02:53:46,720 --> 02:53:48,550
well it's not maybe it's not completely
obvious i'm i guess i share that world

there's the other possibility that we

11486
02:53:51,349 --> 02:53:51,359
there's the other possibility that we
 

11487

there's the other possibility that we
humans find a sort of

humans find a sort of
an inner peace where the forces of

an inner peace where the forces of
 

11491
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:57,429
an inner peace where the forces of
capitalism will calm down

capitalism will calm down
 

11493
02:53:57,439 --> 02:53:59,429

whole tech thing
 

11499
02:54:02,399 --> 02:54:03,990
whole tech thing
where we keep building new technologies

11500
02:54:03,990 --> 02:54:04,000
where we keep building new technologies
 

11501
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,070
where we keep building new technologies
but it's cool to have those kinds of

crazy dreams
because that's where it starts if you

02:54:12,469 --> 02:54:12,479
because that's where it starts if you
 

11511
02:54:12,479 --> 02:54:13,830
because that's where it starts if you
want to build something special you have

11512
02:54:13,830 --> 02:54:13,840
want to build something special you have
 

11513
02:54:13,840 --> 02:54:15,190
want to build something special you have
to first believe

to first believe
 

11515
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:16,790

02:54:18,720 --> 02:54:20,389
strongly enough that you're not
vulnerable and i'm speculating but it's

02:54:20,389 --> 02:54:20,399
vulnerable and i'm speculating but it's
 

11521
02:54:20,399 --> 02:54:21,750

elon that what he's doing is crazy so
 

11527
02:54:25,120 --> 02:54:26,710
elon that what he's doing is crazy so
not only did he dream it up he dreamed

11528
02:54:26,710 --> 02:54:26,720
not only did he dream it up he dreamed
 

11529

went with it and also went with it in
the face of being

11534
02:54:30,710 --> 02:54:30,720
the face of being
 

11535
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:32,469
the face of being
told that it's not going to work and

told that it's not going to work and
 

11537
02:54:32,479 --> 02:54:33,990
told that it's not going to work and
then time and then also

then time and then also
 

11539
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:35,269
then time and then also
stepped away from the bitterness because

11540
02:54:35,269 --> 02:54:35,279
stepped away from the bitterness because
 

11541
02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:37,190
stepped away from the bitterness because
he's done a series of really crazy

principles thinking
 

11593
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:27,990
principles thinking
like physics says it's true therefore

11594
02:55:27,990 --> 02:55:28,000
like physics says it's true therefore
 

11595

therefore the haters don't matter right
 

11607
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:39,590
therefore the haters don't matter right
and i mean that's kind of like a system

11608
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:39,600
and i mean that's kind of like a system
 

11609
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:41,349
and i mean that's kind of like a system

same time that clearly isn't the only
 

11661

determining thing in making elon musk
 

11663
02:56:24,960 --> 02:56:26,150
determining thing in making elon musk
musk and obviously i don't know the guy

11664
02:56:26,150 --> 02:56:26,160
musk and obviously i don't know the guy
 

11665
02:56:26,160 --> 02:56:27,429
musk and obviously i don't know the guy
from adam and

11666
02:56:27,429 --> 02:56:27,439
from adam and
 

11667
02:56:27,439 --> 02:56:29,750
from adam and
but it's an interesting thing that it's

11668
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
but it's an interesting thing that it's
 

11669
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:31,990
but it's an interesting thing that it's
not just his intellect his belief system

11670
02:56:31,990 --> 02:56:32,000
not just his intellect his belief system
 

11671
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:33,190
not just his intellect his belief system
his structure

11672
02:56:33,190 --> 02:56:33,200
his structure
 

11673
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:35,830
his structure
how he's viewing the world like that's

11674
02:56:35,830 --> 02:56:35,840
how he's viewing the world like that's
 

11675
02:56:35,840 --> 02:56:36,469
how he's viewing the world like that's
did he

11676
02:56:36,469 --> 02:56:36,479
did he
 

11677
02:56:36,479 --> 02:56:38,309
did he
reason his way to that did he not what

11678
02:56:38,309 --> 02:56:38,319
reason his way to that did he not what
 

11679
02:56:38,319 --> 02:56:39,990
reason his way to that did he not what
other factors came in i'm really curious

11680
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:40,000
other factors came in i'm really curious
 

11681
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:42,950
other factors came in i'm really curious
about that because i guess coming it's

11682
02:56:42,950 --> 02:56:42,960
about that because i guess coming it's
 

11683
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:45,349
about that because i guess coming it's
again i feel really strongly about

11684
02:56:45,349 --> 02:56:45,359
again i feel really strongly about
 

11685
02:56:45,359 --> 02:56:47,670
again i feel really strongly about
people's belief structure and and this

11686
02:56:47,670 --> 02:56:47,680
people's belief structure and and this
 

11687
02:56:47,680 --> 02:56:49,349
people's belief structure and and this
the how they view the world

11688
02:56:49,349 --> 02:56:49,359
the how they view the world
 

11689
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:51,429
the how they view the world

fighting the randoms and
 

11997
03:01:08,399 --> 03:01:10,790
fighting the randoms and
it's you have a successful school you're

11998
03:01:10,790 --> 03:01:10,800
it's you have a successful school you're
 

11999

broadly speaking so

13181
03:18:42,720 --> 03:18:44,070
was a time it was a different sport it
was a different time in the sport where

was a different time in the sport where
 

13183
03:18:44,080 --> 03:18:45,590
was a different time in the sport where
you know they were some guys were

13184
03:18:45,590 --> 03:18:45,600
you know they were some guys were
 

13185
03:18:45,600 --> 03:18:46,950
you know they were some guys were
bouncing around doing different things

13186
03:18:46,950 --> 03:18:46,960
bouncing around doing different things
 

13187
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:47,910
bouncing around doing different things
but let's

13188
03:18:47,910 --> 03:18:47,920
but let's
 

13189
03:18:47,920 --> 03:18:50,469
but let's
so i guess the gracie family it's i mean

13190
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:50,479
so i guess the gracie family it's i mean
 

13191
03:18:50,479 --> 03:18:51,429
so i guess the gracie family it's i mean
they never had an

13192
03:18:51,429 --> 03:18:51,439
they never had an
 

13193
03:18:51,439 --> 03:18:53,910
they never had an
in like obviously hoist was there um but

13194
03:18:53,910 --> 03:18:53,920
in like obviously hoist was there um but
 

13195
03:18:53,920 --> 03:18:54,469
in like obviously hoist was there um but
they never

13196
03:18:54,469 --> 03:18:54,479
they never
 

13197
03:18:54,479 --> 03:18:55,750
they never
and that was a definitely a different

13198
03:18:55,750 --> 03:18:55,760
and that was a definitely a different
 

13199
03:18:55,760 --> 03:18:57,429
and that was a definitely a different
sport weight classes being open things

13200
03:18:57,429 --> 03:18:57,439
sport weight classes being open things
 

13201
03:18:57,439 --> 03:18:59,110
sport weight classes being open things
like that but you have to say the hoist

13202
03:18:59,110 --> 03:18:59,120
like that but you have to say the hoist
 

13203
03:18:59,120 --> 03:19:00,710
like that but you have to say the hoist
is up there oh no question one of the

13204
03:19:00,710 --> 03:19:00,720
is up there oh no question one of the
 

13205
03:19:00,720 --> 03:19:01,590
is up there oh no question one of the
greatest ever

13206
03:19:01,590 --> 03:19:01,600
greatest ever
 

13207
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:03,510
greatest ever
i think so too and again i wouldn't be

13208
03:19:03,510 --> 03:19:03,520
i think so too and again i wouldn't be
 

13209
03:19:03,520 --> 03:19:04,950
i think so too and again i wouldn't be
sitting here talking to you

um if it weren't for him so the gracie

13212
03:19:07,750 --> 03:19:07,760
um if it weren't for him so the gracie
 

13213
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:09,510
um if it weren't for him so the gracie
family as a whole but i mean who's the

13214
03:19:09,510 --> 03:19:09,520
family as a whole but i mean who's the
 

13215
03:19:09,520 --> 03:19:11,910
family as a whole but i mean who's the
better i mean i think the hoist would

13216
03:19:11,910 --> 03:19:11,920
better i mean i think the hoist would
 

13217
03:19:11,920 --> 03:19:13,429
better i mean i think the hoist would

13823
03:27:47,680 --> 03:27:49,349
am thinking about things more more
accurately or when i've addressed what

13824
03:27:49,349 --> 03:27:49,359
accurately or when i've addressed what
 

13825
03:27:49,359 --> 03:27:50,710
accurately or when i've addressed what
that concern was

13826
03:27:50,710 --> 03:27:50,720
that concern was
 

13827
03:27:50,720 --> 03:27:52,870
that concern was
i feel any of that concern kind of

13828
03:27:52,870 --> 03:27:52,880
i feel any of that concern kind of
 

13829
03:27:52,880 --> 03:27:53,990
i feel any of that concern kind of
dissipate and

13830
03:27:53,990 --> 03:27:54,000
dissipate and
 

13831
03:27:54,000 --> 03:27:57,429
dissipate and
i guess if i honestly thought that

13832
03:27:57,429 --> 03:27:57,439
i guess if i honestly thought that
 

13833
03:27:57,439 --> 03:27:58,870
i guess if i honestly thought that
you know i guess when it comes to i know

13834
03:27:58,870 --> 03:27:58,880
you know i guess when it comes to i know
 

13835
03:27:58,880 --> 03:28:00,150
you know i guess when it comes to i know
i'm gonna die at a certain point

13836
03:28:00,150 --> 03:28:00,160
i'm gonna die at a certain point
 

13837

i'm gonna die at a certain point
obviously i'm gonna get hurt

13838
03:28:01,510 --> 03:28:01,520
obviously i'm gonna get hurt
 

13839
03:28:01,520 --> 03:28:04,150
obviously i'm gonna get hurt
i mean you know pain happens but the

13840
03:28:04,150 --> 03:28:04,160
i mean you know pain happens but the
 

13841
03:28:04,160 --> 03:28:05,349
i mean you know pain happens but the
pain of

13842
03:28:05,349 --> 03:28:05,359
pain of
 

13843
03:28:05,359 --> 03:28:07,110
pain of
loss would be nothing compared to the or

13844
03:28:07,110 --> 03:28:07,120
loss would be nothing compared to the or
 

13845
03:28:07,120 --> 03:28:08,550
loss would be nothing compared to the or
the pain of injury nothing compared to

13846
03:28:08,550 --> 03:28:08,560
the pain of injury nothing compared to
 

13847
03:28:08,560 --> 03:28:09,190
the pain of injury nothing compared to
the pain

13848
03:28:09,190 --> 03:28:09,200
the pain
 

13849
03:28:09,200 --> 03:28:12,469
the pain
of running away you know and yeah and

03:36:24,560 --> 03:36:26,150
another person
i mean think about that the chances of

14324
03:36:26,150 --> 03:36:26,160
i mean think about that the chances of
 

14325
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:27,990
i mean think about that the chances of
dying by violence now are so

14326
03:36:27,990 --> 03:36:28,000
dying by violence now are so
 

14327
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:29,910
dying by violence now are so
so slim at least in in most countries in

14328
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:29,920
so slim at least in in most countries in
 

14329
03:36:29,920 --> 03:36:31,910
so slim at least in in most countries in
most places like shockingly small

14330
03:36:31,910 --> 03:36:31,920
most places like shockingly small
 

14331
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:33,830
most places like shockingly small
thankfully but there was a period of

14332
03:36:33,830 --> 03:36:33,840
thankfully but there was a period of
 

14333
03:36:33,840 --> 03:36:35,269
thankfully but there was a period of
time like the most

14334
03:36:35,269 --> 03:36:35,279
time like the most
 

14335
03:36:35,279 --> 03:36:36,870
time like the most
period of time where dying by violence

14336
03:36:36,870 --> 03:36:36,880
period of time where dying by violence
 

14337
03:36:36,880 --> 03:36:38,630
period of time where dying by violence
was mostly how it went down

14338
03:36:38,630 --> 03:36:38,640
was mostly how it went down
 

14339
03:36:38,640 --> 03:36:41,830
was mostly how it went down
and i guess what would be facilitative

14340
03:36:41,830 --> 03:36:41,840
and i guess what would be facilitative
 

14341
03:36:41,840 --> 03:36:42,950
and i guess what would be facilitative
what would allow you to win

14342
03:36:42,950 --> 03:36:42,960
what would allow you to win
 

14343
03:36:42,960 --> 03:36:45,030
what would allow you to win
back to ender's game you know what

03:36:51,200 --> 03:36:54,550
forever subject to people who can
and that's that's a real thing and

14352
03:36:54,550 --> 03:36:54,560
and that's that's a real thing and
 

14353
03:36:54,560 --> 03:36:55,910
and that's that's a real thing and
you know we're fortunate to find

14354
03:36:55,910 --> 03:36:55,920
you know we're fortunate to find
 

14355
03:36:55,920 --> 03:36:57,750
you know we're fortunate to find
ourselves in a situation where we don't

14356
03:36:57,750 --> 03:36:57,760
ourselves in a situation where we don't
 

14357
03:36:57,760 --> 03:36:59,590
ourselves in a situation where we don't
where other things matter but that is a

14358
03:36:59,590 --> 03:36:59,600
where other things matter but that is a
 

14359
03:36:59,600 --> 03:37:01,269
where other things matter but that is a
funny thing periodically where people

14360
03:37:01,269 --> 03:37:01,279
funny thing periodically where people
 

14361
03:37:01,279 --> 03:37:01,990
funny thing periodically where people
you'll see people

my violence like my and whether maybe

14598
03:40:33,830 --> 03:40:33,840
my violence like my and whether maybe
 

14599
03:40:33,840 --> 03:40:35,590
my violence like my and whether maybe
maybe not physical violence but my

14600
03:40:35,590 --> 03:40:35,600
maybe not physical violence but my
 

14601
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:38,150
maybe not physical violence but my
response to my my aggressive response to

14602
03:40:38,150 --> 03:40:38,160
response to my my aggressive response to
 

14603

things
 

14605
03:40:38,720 --> 03:40:40,790
things
and i guess like which again regrets

14606
03:40:40,790 --> 03:40:40,800
and i guess like which again regrets
 

14607
03:40:40,800 --> 03:40:42,870
and i guess like which again regrets
begets a further aggressive response and

14608
03:40:42,870 --> 03:40:42,880
begets a further aggressive response and
 

14609
03:40:42,880 --> 03:40:44,389
begets a further aggressive response and
like a you know kind of a

14610
03:40:44,389 --> 03:40:44,399
like a you know kind of a
 

14611
03:40:44,399 --> 03:40:46,950
like a you know kind of a
tit-for-tat sort of situation or or it

14612
03:40:46,950 --> 03:40:46,960
tit-for-tat sort of situation or or it
 

14613
03:40:46,960 --> 03:40:48,389
tit-for-tat sort of situation or or it
goes to like well there's 10 of me and

14614
03:40:48,389 --> 03:40:48,399
goes to like well there's 10 of me and
 

14615
03:40:48,399 --> 03:40:49,830
goes to like well there's 10 of me and
there's one of you so we'll get you and

14616
03:40:49,830 --> 03:40:49,840
there's one of you so we'll get you and
 

14617
03:40:49,840 --> 03:40:51,269
there's one of you so we'll get you and
you can't do anything about it

14618
03:40:51,269 --> 03:40:51,279
you can't do anything about it
 

14619
03:40:51,279 --> 03:40:53,429
you can't do anything about it
but that's not morality that's that's

14620
03:40:53,429 --> 03:40:53,439
but that's not morality that's that's
 

14621
03:40:53,439 --> 03:40:55,110
but that's not morality that's that's
just saying that's might makes right

14622
03:40:55,110 --> 03:40:55,120
just saying that's might makes right
 

14623
03:40:55,120 --> 03:40:56,710
just saying that's might makes right
so i guess again you can understand why

14624
03:40:56,710 --> 03:40:56,720
so i guess again you can understand why
 

14625
03:40:56,720 --> 03:40:58,229
so i guess again you can understand why
people do it and there are certain there

14626
03:40:58,229 --> 03:40:58,239
people do it and there are certain there
 

14627
03:40:58,239 --> 03:41:01,110
people do it and there are certain there
is a progress aspect to it but again i

14628
03:41:01,110 --> 03:41:01,120

but if the answer to that is no i
i guess uh that's that's always
