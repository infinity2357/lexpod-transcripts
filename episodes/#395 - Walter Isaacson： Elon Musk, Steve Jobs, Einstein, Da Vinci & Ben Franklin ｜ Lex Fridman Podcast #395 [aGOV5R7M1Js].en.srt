00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,810
were making the batteries in Japan and
the battery pack would be at some

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,169
put into a Lotus Elise chassis and then
that was a nightmare you did not have

that was a nightmare you did not have
 

1507

process so he goes to the Other Extreme

1510
00:32:35,149 --> 00:32:35,159
process so he goes to the Other Extreme

he gets a factory in Fremont from Toyota

1512
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:38,700
he gets a factory in Fremont from Toyota
 

1513
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,810
he gets a factory in Fremont from Toyota
and he wants to do everything in his the

1514
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:41,820
and he wants to do everything in his the
 

1515
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,750

1517
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,049
software in-house the painting in-house
you know the the the

1518
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:47,059
you know the the the
 

1519
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:51,409
you know the the the
uh battery he makes his own batteries

1520
00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:51,419
uh battery he makes his own batteries
 

1521
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:54,289
uh battery he makes his own batteries
and I think that end-to-end control is

1522
00:32:54,289 --> 00:32:54,299
and I think that end-to-end control is
 

1523
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:57,529
and I think that end-to-end control is
part of his personality I mean there's a

example of that which is the development
 

1533
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:16,070

of the brain of the car in autopilot

1534
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,080
of the brain of the car in autopilot
 

1535
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,430
of the brain of the car in autopilot
going from mobileye to in-house building

1536
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:19,440
going from mobileye to in-house building
 

1537
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,450
going from mobileye to in-house building
the autopilot system to uh basically

1538
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:23,460
the autopilot system to uh basically
 

1539
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:27,049
the autopilot system to uh basically
getting rid of all sensors that are not

00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:31,250
getting rid of all sensors that are not
uh rich in data to make it AI friendly

uh rich in data to make it AI friendly
 

1543
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,289
uh rich in data to make it AI friendly
sort of saying that we can do it all

1544
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:33,299
sort of saying that we can do it all
 

1545
00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:35,870
sort of saying that we can do it all
with vision and like you said removing

1546
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:35,880
with vision and like you said removing
 

1547
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,789
with vision and like you said removing
some of the bolts so sometimes it's

1548
00:33:37,789 --> 00:33:37,799
some of the bolts so sometimes it's
 

1549
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,529
some of the bolts so sometimes it's
small things but sometimes it's really

1550
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:39,539
small things but sometimes it's really
 

1551
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,509
small things but sometimes it's really
big things like getting rid of radar

1552
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
big things like getting rid of radar
 

1553
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,630
big things like getting rid of radar
well Vision only getting rid of radar is

1554
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
well Vision only getting rid of radar is
 

1555
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,029
well Vision only getting rid of radar is
huge and everybody's against everybody

1556
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:47,039
huge and everybody's against everybody
 

1557
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,950
huge and everybody's against everybody
and that's still fighting it a bit

1558
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:48,960
and that's still fighting it a bit
 

1559
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,269
and that's still fighting it a bit
they're still trying to do a Next

have lidar they don't have sonar and so
 

1577
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:16,129
have lidar they don't have sonar and so
there is no reason in the laws of

00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:00,660
as they run into they step on the Lego
 

1755
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,829
as they run into they step on the Lego
and or their their body uh is filled

with a lot of pain what I mean by that
 

1759
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,910
with a lot of pain what I mean by that
is there's this kind of evolution that

1760
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
is there's this kind of evolution that
 

1761
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,770
is there's this kind of evolution that
seems to happen where you discover

1762
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:09,780
seems to happen where you discover
 

1763
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,490
seems to happen where you discover
really good ideas along the way that

1764

really good ideas along the way that
 

1765
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,530
really good ideas along the way that
allow you to Pivot like to me

it became obvious to me that this is not

1774
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
it became obvious to me that this is not
 

1775
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,349
it became obvious to me that this is not
about the car

1776
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:30,359
about the car
 

1777
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:33,290
about the car
this is about Optimus the robot

this this is like if we look back 100

1780
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
this this is like if we look back 100
 

1781

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:44,700
autopilot won't be the thing that
 

1789
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,790
autopilot won't be the thing that
controls the car it would be the thing

1790

a car company

1800
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:01,200
a car company
 

1801
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,829
a car company
will it be an AI company will it be a

1802
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:03,839
will it be an AI company will it be a
 

1803

company and you kind of slowly discover

1808
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:10,440
company and you kind of slowly discover
 

1809
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,050
company and you kind of slowly discover
this as you confidently uh

1810
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:14,060
this as you confidently uh
 

1811
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,870
this as you confidently uh
like push forward with a vision so it's

1812
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:17,880
like push forward with a vision so it's
 

1813
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,490
like push forward with a vision so it's
interesting to watch that kind of

1814
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:19,500
interesting to watch that kind of
 

1815
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,650
interesting to watch that kind of
evolution as long as it's backed by this

1816
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:21,660
evolution as long as it's backed by this
 

1817

evolution as long as it's backed by this
confidence there are a couple of things

1818
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:23,640
confidence there are a couple of things
 

1819
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,390
confidence there are a couple of things
that are required for that one is being

1820
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
that are required for that one is being
 

1821
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,609
that are required for that one is being
adventurous one doesn't enter a dark

1822
00:39:28,609 --> 00:39:28,619
adventurous one doesn't enter a dark
 

1823
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:30,290
adventurous one doesn't enter a dark
room without a flashlight and a map

1824
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:30,300
room without a flashlight and a map
 

1825
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,510
room without a flashlight and a map
unless you're a risk taker unless you're

unless you're a risk taker unless you're
 

1827
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,790
unless you're a risk taker unless you're
adventurous the second is to have

1828
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:34,800
adventurous the second is to have
 

1829
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,390
adventurous the second is to have
iterative uh brain Cycles where you can

1830
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:38,400
iterative uh brain Cycles where you can
 

1831
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,849
iterative uh brain Cycles where you can
process information

1832
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:39,859
process information
 

1833
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:43,069
process information
and do a feedback loop and make it work

1834
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:43,079
and do a feedback loop and make it work
 

1835
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,130
and do a feedback loop and make it work
the third and this is what we failed to

1836
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:46,140
the third and this is what we failed to
 

1837
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,010
the third and this is what we failed to
do a lot in the United States and

1838
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:49,020
do a lot in the United States and
 

1839
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,890
do a lot in the United States and
perhaps around the world is when you

1840
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:51,900
perhaps around the world is when you
 

1841
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,430
perhaps around the world is when you
take risks you have to realize you're

1842
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,440
take risks you have to realize you're
 

1843
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,109
take risks you have to realize you're
going to blow things up

1844
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
going to blow things up
 

1845
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,890
going to blow things up
you know first three rockets that the

1846
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:00,900
you know first three rockets that the
 

1847
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,010
you know first three rockets that the
Falcon rocket that must does they blow

up even Starship three and a half
 

1851
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:07,849
up even Starship three and a half
minutes but then it blows up the first

1852
00:40:07,849 --> 00:40:07,859
minutes but then it blows up the first
 

1853
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:08,630
minutes but then it blows up the first
time

his views of we're living in a
 

2047
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,170
his views of we're living in a
simulation maybe and how you would

2048
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:27,180
simulation maybe and how you would
 

2049
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,809
simulation maybe and how you would
figure out if that's true yes there's a

2050
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:29,819
figure out if that's true yes there's a
 

2051
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,030
figure out if that's true yes there's a

serious sense
 

2055
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,950
serious sense
that this is all a bit of a game one of

2056
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:36,960
that this is all a bit of a game one of
 

2057

that this is all a bit of a game one of
my theories on Elon a minor theory is

2058
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
my theories on Elon a minor theory is
 

2059
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,170
my theories on Elon a minor theory is
that he read Hitchhiker's Guide to the

2060
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:42,180
that he read Hitchhiker's Guide to the
 

2061
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,410
that he read Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy once too often

2062
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:44,420
Galaxy once too often
 

2063
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,750
Galaxy once too often
yeah and as you know there's a scene in

2064
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:47,760
yeah and as you know there's a scene in
 

2065
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,589
yeah and as you know there's a scene in
there that says uh that there's a theory

2066
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
there that says uh that there's a theory
 

2067
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,349
there that says uh that there's a theory
about the universe that if anybody ever

2068
00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:54,359
about the universe that if anybody ever
 

2069
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,450
about the universe that if anybody ever
discovers the secrets and meanings of

2070
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:56,460
discovers the secrets and meanings of
 

2071
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:58,970
discovers the secrets and meanings of
the universe it will be replaced by an

2072
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:58,980
the universe it will be replaced by an
 

2073
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,609
the universe it will be replaced by an
even more complex universe and then the

2074
00:45:01,609 --> 00:45:01,619
even more complex universe and then the
 

2075
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:03,890
even more complex universe and then the
next line Douglas Adams writes is and

2076
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:03,900
next line Douglas Adams writes is and
 

2077
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,510
next line Douglas Adams writes is and
there's another theory that this has

2078
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
there's another theory that this has
 

2079
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:08,510
there's another theory that this has
already happened so I'm gonna try to get

2080
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:08,520
already happened so I'm gonna try to get
 

2081
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,309
already happened so I'm gonna try to get
my head around that but I know that Elon

hey why are you buying Twitter let's

2990
01:03:56,390 --> 01:03:56,400
hey why are you buying Twitter let's
 

2991
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,490
hey why are you buying Twitter let's
start one from scratch and do it on the

2992
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:58,500
start one from scratch and do it on the
 

2993
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:01,250
start one from scratch and do it on the
blockchain yeah now it took them a while

2994
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:01,260
blockchain yeah now it took them a while
 

2995
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,990
blockchain yeah now it took them a while
and you can argue it one way or the

2996
01:04:02,990 --> 01:04:03,000
and you can argue it one way or the
 

2997
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:03,829
and you can argue it one way or the
other

2998

other
 

2999
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,990
other
to come to the conclusion that the

3000
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
to come to the conclusion that the
 

3001
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,390
to come to the conclusion that the
blockchain was not fast enough in

3002
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
blockchain was not fast enough in
 

3003
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,549
blockchain was not fast enough in
responsive time enough to be able to

3004
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
responsive time enough to be able to
 

3005
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:13,010
responsive time enough to be able to
handle a billion tweets you know in a

3006
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:13,020
handle a billion tweets you know in a
 

3007
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:14,450
handle a billion tweets you know in a
day or so

3008
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:14,460
day or so
 

3009
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,430
day or so

in retrospect
 

3023
01:04:32,339 --> 01:04:34,849
in retrospect
I think starting a new Media Company

3024
01:04:34,849 --> 01:04:34,859
I think starting a new Media Company
 

3025
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:36,230
I think starting a new Media Company

01:04:59,690 --> 01:04:59,700
Mastodon and blue sky and threads and
 

3043
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:02,690
Mastodon and blue sky and threads and
not any threads even had a base so it

3044
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:02,700
not any threads even had a base so it
 

3045
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:05,690
not any threads even had a base so it
would have been hard yeah and uh to do

3046
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:05,700
would have been hard yeah and uh to do
 

3047
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:08,630
would have been hard yeah and uh to do
that in the way he did requires uh

3048
01:05:08,630 --> 01:05:08,640
that in the way he did requires uh
 

3049
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:10,130
that in the way he did requires uh
another part that you write about with

3050
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:10,140
another part that you write about with
 

3051
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:11,510
another part that you write about with
the Three Musketeers and the whole

3052
01:05:11,510 --> 01:05:11,520
the Three Musketeers and the whole
 

3053
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,750
the Three Musketeers and the whole
engineering the firing and the bringing

3054
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:14,760
engineering the firing and the bringing
 

3055
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,910
engineering the firing and the bringing
in the engineers to try to sort of go

3056
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:16,920
in the engineers to try to sort of go
 

3057
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:18,650
in the engineers to try to sort of go
hardcore so there's a lot of interesting

3058
01:05:18,650 --> 01:05:18,660
hardcore so there's a lot of interesting
 

3059
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,109
hardcore so there's a lot of interesting
sort of questions to ask there but the

3060
01:05:21,109 --> 01:05:21,119
sort of questions to ask there but the
 

3061
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,030
sort of questions to ask there but the
high level can you just comment about

3062
01:05:23,030 --> 01:05:23,040
high level can you just comment about
 

3063
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:24,770
high level can you just comment about
that

3064
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:24,780
that
 

3065
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:28,010
that
part of the Saga which is

3066
01:05:28,010 --> 01:05:28,020
part of the Saga which is
 

3067
01:05:28,020 --> 01:05:30,170
part of the Saga which is
bringing in the engineers and seeing

3068
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:30,180
bringing in the engineers and seeing
 

3069
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:32,930
bringing in the engineers and seeing
like what can we do here right he

3070
01:05:32,930 --> 01:05:32,940
like what can we do here right he
 

3071
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:35,089
like what can we do here right he
brought in the engineers and figured

3072
01:05:35,089 --> 01:05:35,099
brought in the engineers and figured
 

3073
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:38,510
brought in the engineers and figured
that the amount of people doing Tesla

3074
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:38,520
that the amount of people doing Tesla
 

3075
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,910
that the amount of people doing Tesla
full self-driving autopilot and all the

3076
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:40,920
full self-driving autopilot and all the
 

3077
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:44,690
full self-driving autopilot and all the
software there was about one tenth of

3078
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:44,700
software there was about one tenth of
 

3079
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:46,430
software there was about one tenth of
what was doing software for Twitter and

3080
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:46,440
what was doing software for Twitter and
 

3081
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:49,910
what was doing software for Twitter and
he said this can't be the case and he

3082
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:49,920
he said this can't be the case and he
 

3083
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,829
he said this can't be the case and he
fired 85 percent in three different

3084
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:51,839
fired 85 percent in three different
 

3085
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,990
fired 85 percent in three different
rounds the first was

3086
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:54,000
rounds the first was
 

3087
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,750
rounds the first was
just firing people because they looked

3088
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
just firing people because they looked
 

3089
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,150
just firing people because they looked
at the coding and they had a team of

3090
01:05:59,150 --> 01:05:59,160
at the coding and they had a team of
 

3091
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,390
at the coding and they had a team of
people from Tesla's autopilot team

3092
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:01,400
people from Tesla's autopilot team
 

3093
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:04,490
people from Tesla's autopilot team
grading the codes of ever of all that

3094
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:04,500
grading the codes of ever of all that
 

3095
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:07,670
grading the codes of ever of all that
was written in the past year or so then

3096
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
was written in the past year or so then
 

3097
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:10,010
was written in the past year or so then
he fired people you know who didn't seem

3098
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:10,020
he fired people you know who didn't seem
 

3099
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:12,770
he fired people you know who didn't seem
to be totally all in or loyal and then

3100
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:12,780
to be totally all in or loyal and then
 

3101
01:06:12,780 --> 01:06:15,530
to be totally all in or loyal and then
another round of layoffs so

3102
01:06:15,530 --> 01:06:15,540
another round of layoffs so
 

3103
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,750
another round of layoffs so
uh

3104
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
uh
 

3105
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,210
uh
at each step of the way almost everybody

3106
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:20,220
at each step of the way almost everybody
 

3107
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:22,670
at each step of the way almost everybody
said that's enough it's going to destroy

3108
01:06:22,670 --> 01:06:22,680
said that's enough it's going to destroy
 

3109
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:25,849
said that's enough it's going to destroy
things yeah uh from Alex Sparrow his

3123
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,170
enough we're going to be in real trouble
and they were partly right I mean there

3124
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:42,180
and they were partly right I mean there
 

3125
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:46,910
and they were partly right I mean there
was degradation of the service sum but

3126
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:46,920
was degradation of the service sum but
 

3127
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:49,370
was degradation of the service sum but
not as much as half the services I use

3128
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:49,380
not as much as half the services I use
 

3129
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,370
not as much as half the services I use
half the time you know and

3130
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:52,380
half the time you know and
 

3131
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,829
half the time you know and
I wake up each morning and

3132
01:06:54,829 --> 01:06:54,839
I wake up each morning and
 

3133
01:06:54,839 --> 01:06:57,650
I wake up each morning and
hit the app and okay still there what do

3134
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:57,660
hit the app and okay still there what do
 

3135
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,170
hit the app and okay still there what do
you think was that too much I think that

3136
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:00,180
you think was that too much I think that
 

3137
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,690
you think was that too much I think that

3827
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:21,470
going to say on this podcast I'm also
thinking about the email my daughter

3828
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:21,480
thinking about the email my daughter
 

3829
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,149
thinking about the email my daughter
just sent about a house that she's

3830
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:23,159
just sent about a house that she's
 

3831
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,890
just sent about a house that she's
looking you know and I'm

3832
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:24,900
looking you know and I'm
 

3833
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,649
looking you know and I'm
I'm multitasking he doesn't actually do

3834
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:27,659
I'm multitasking he doesn't actually do
 

3835
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:31,669
I'm multitasking he doesn't actually do
that he single tasks sequentially with a

3836
01:21:31,669 --> 01:21:31,679
that he single tasks sequentially with a
 

3837
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,189
that he single tasks sequentially with a
focus that's hardcore I don't know I

3838
01:21:34,189 --> 01:21:34,199
focus that's hardcore I don't know I
 

3839
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:35,570
focus that's hardcore I don't know I
think there's wisdom to draw from that

3840
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:35,580
think there's wisdom to draw from that
 

3841
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:36,649
think there's wisdom to draw from that
to like

3842
01:21:36,649 --> 01:21:36,659
to like
 

3843

first of all he makes me Ben Franklin

3844
01:21:39,169 --> 01:21:39,179
first of all he makes me Ben Franklin
 

3845
01:21:39,179 --> 01:21:41,810
first of all he makes me Ben Franklin
makes me feel that way that there's a

3846
01:21:41,810 --> 01:21:41,820
makes me feel that way that there's a
 

3847
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:43,970
makes me feel that way that there's a
lot of hours in the day there's a lot of

3848
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:43,980
lot of hours in the day there's a lot of
 

3849
01:21:43,980 --> 01:21:46,130
lot of hours in the day there's a lot of
minutes in the day like

3850
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:46,140
minutes in the day like
 

3851
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,990
minutes in the day like
there's no excuse not to get a lot done

3852
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
there's no excuse not to get a lot done
 

3853
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,169
there's no excuse not to get a lot done
and that requires just an extreme Focus

3854
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:51,179
and that requires just an extreme Focus
 

3855
01:21:51,179 --> 01:21:54,590
and that requires just an extreme Focus
an extreme focus in like an urgency I

3856
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:54,600
an extreme focus in like an urgency I
 

3857
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:56,270
an extreme focus in like an urgency I
think the fierce

3858
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:56,280
think the fierce
 

3859
01:21:56,280 --> 01:21:58,010
think the fierce
urgency

3860
01:21:58,010 --> 01:21:58,020
urgency
 

3861
01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,110
urgency
that

3862
01:22:00,110 --> 01:22:00,120
that
 

3863
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,930
that
drives him is important

3864
01:22:02,930 --> 01:22:02,940
drives him is important
 

3865
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:05,630
drives him is important
and it's sometimes gend up

3866
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:05,640
and it's sometimes gend up
 

3867
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,910
and it's sometimes gend up
like I say the fierce urgency of getting

3868
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
like I say the fierce urgency of getting
 

3869
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,990
like I say the fierce urgency of getting
to Mars and on a Friday night at the

3883
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:28,430
200 people here by tomorrow working on
this pad we have to have a fierce sense

3884
01:22:28,430 --> 01:22:28,440
this pad we have to have a fierce sense
 

3885
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,010
this pad we have to have a fierce sense
of urgency or we will never get to Mars

3886
01:22:31,010 --> 01:22:31,020
of urgency or we will never get to Mars
 

3887
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:34,490
of urgency or we will never get to Mars
that sense of urgency you know

3888
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:34,500
that sense of urgency you know
 

3889
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:38,750
that sense of urgency you know
is also a vibrancy

3890
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:38,760
is also a vibrancy
 

3891
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:42,410
is also a vibrancy
that's like really taking on life fully

3892
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:42,420
that's like really taking on life fully
 

3893
01:22:42,420 --> 01:22:44,209
that's like really taking on life fully
I mean that to me this the lesson is

3894
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:44,219
I mean that to me this the lesson is
 

3895
01:22:44,219 --> 01:22:45,410
I mean that to me this the lesson is
like

3896
01:22:45,410 --> 01:22:45,420
like
 

3897
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,410
like
even the mundane can be full of this

3898
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:48,420
even the mundane can be full of this
 

3899
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:50,950
even the mundane can be full of this
just richness and like you just have to

3900
01:22:50,950 --> 01:22:50,960
just richness and like you just have to
 

3901
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:55,250
just richness and like you just have to
really uh take it in intensely so like

3902
01:22:55,250 --> 01:22:55,260
really uh take it in intensely so like
 

3903
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:57,229
really uh take it in intensely so like
the switching

3904
01:22:57,229 --> 01:22:57,239
the switching
 

3905
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:59,149
the switching
enables that kind of intensity because

3906
01:22:59,149 --> 01:22:59,159
enables that kind of intensity because
 

3907
01:22:59,159 --> 01:23:00,770
enables that kind of intensity because
most of us can't hold that intense than

3908
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:00,780
most of us can't hold that intense than
 

3909
01:23:00,780 --> 01:23:02,209
most of us can't hold that intense than
any one tasks for a prolonged period of

3910
01:23:02,209 --> 01:23:02,219
any one tasks for a prolonged period of
 

3911
01:23:02,219 --> 01:23:05,330
any one tasks for a prolonged period of
time maybe that's also a lesson

3912
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:05,340
time maybe that's also a lesson
 

3913
01:23:05,340 --> 01:23:08,090
time maybe that's also a lesson
right and I guess it goes back to also

3914
01:23:08,090 --> 01:23:08,100
right and I guess it goes back to also
 

3915
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:10,310
right and I guess it goes back to also
know who you are meaning there are

3916
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
know who you are meaning there are
 

3917
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,990

people who

3918
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:12,000
people who
 

3919
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,330
people who
can focus intensely and there are people

3920
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:14,340
can focus intensely and there are people
 

3921
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:16,370
can focus intensely and there are people
who can see patterns across many things

3922
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:16,380
who can see patterns across many things
 

3923
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:19,010
who can see patterns across many things
look Leonardo da Vinci

3924
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:19,020
look Leonardo da Vinci
 

3925
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:22,010
look Leonardo da Vinci
he was not all that focused he was

3926
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:22,020
he was not all that focused he was
 

3927
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:25,729
he was not all that focused he was
easily distracted it's why he has more

3928
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:25,739
easily distracted it's why he has more
 

3929
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,290
easily distracted it's why he has more

01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:03,000
don't usually amount to much you have to
 

4381
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,669
don't usually amount to much you have to
be creative imaginative to think

4382
01:33:04,669 --> 01:33:04,679
be creative imaginative to think
 

4383
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,770

and so what makes people creative what
 

4387
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,110
and so what makes people creative what
makes them take imaginative leaps that's

4388
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:12,120
makes them take imaginative leaps that's
 

4389
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:15,110
makes them take imaginative leaps that's
the key question you gotta ask you also

4390
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,120
the key question you gotta ask you also
 

4391
01:33:15,120 --> 01:33:16,430
the key question you gotta ask you also
ask the questions like you've asked

jangling in their head and how do they
 

4397
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,570
jangling in their head and how do they
harness them into drives so you look at

4398
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:23,580
harness them into drives so you look at
 

4399
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,390
harness them into drives so you look at
all that and you try to observe really

4400
01:33:26,390 --> 01:33:26,400
all that and you try to observe really
 

4401
