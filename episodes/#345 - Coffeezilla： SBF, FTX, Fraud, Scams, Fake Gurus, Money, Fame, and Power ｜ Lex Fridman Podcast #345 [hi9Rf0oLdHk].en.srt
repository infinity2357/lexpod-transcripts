the price of Bitcoin in Korea was

192
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:41,340
the price of Bitcoin in Korea was
 

193
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,190
the price of Bitcoin in Korea was
substantially higher than in the rest of

substantially higher than in the rest of
 

195
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,930
substantially higher than in the rest of
the world and so you could Arbitrage

196
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:44,940
the world and so you could Arbitrage
 

197
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,330
the world and so you could Arbitrage
that by buying Bitcoin elsewhere and

198
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:47,340
that by buying Bitcoin elsewhere and
 

199
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,850
that by buying Bitcoin elsewhere and
selling it on a Korean exchange so they

200
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:49,860
selling it on a Korean exchange so they
 

201
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,890
selling it on a Korean exchange so they
made their money early doing kind of

202
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:51,900
made their money early doing kind of
 

203
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,050
made their money early doing kind of
smart trades like that they flip that

204
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:54,060
smart trades like that they flip that
 

205

smart trades like that they flip that
into Market making which they were

206
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:56,159
into Market making which they were
 

207
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,490
into Market making which they were
pretty early on that

208
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:58,500
pretty early on that
 

209
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,289

00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:00,299
um just providing liquidity to an
 

211
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,149
um just providing liquidity to an
exchange and it's what's it's a strategy

212
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
exchange and it's what's it's a strategy
 

213
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,670
exchange and it's what's it's a strategy
that is considered delta neutral which

214
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:04,680
that is considered delta neutral which
 

215
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,070
that is considered delta neutral which
means basically if you take kind of both

216
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:07,080
means basically if you take kind of both
 

217
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,229
means basically if you take kind of both
sides of the trade and you're making a

218
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:09,239
sides of the trade and you're making a
 

219
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,809
sides of the trade and you're making a
spread like a fee on that you make money

220
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:11,819
spread like a fee on that you make money
 

221
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:14,149
spread like a fee on that you make money
whether it goes up or down so in theory

222
00:04:14,149 --> 00:04:14,159
whether it goes up or down so in theory
 

223
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,289
whether it goes up or down so in theory
there shouldn't be that much risk

224
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:15,299
there shouldn't be that much risk
 

225
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,229
there shouldn't be that much risk
associated with it so Alameda kind of

226
00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:18,239
associated with it so Alameda kind of
 

227
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,270
associated with it so Alameda kind of
blew up because they would offer these

this really attractive rate of return
 

235
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,290
this really attractive rate of return
and we're doing strategies that

236
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,300
and we're doing strategies that
 

237
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,749
and we're doing strategies that
seemingly are low risk so we're a low

238
00:04:29,749 --> 00:04:29,759
seemingly are low risk so we're a low
 

239

this speculation but also I'm going to
take the ftt that I got which part of

482
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:07,680
take the ftt that I got which part of
 

483
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,710
take the ftt that I got which part of
their balance sheet was this ftt token

484
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:09,720
their balance sheet was this ftt token
 

485
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,910
their balance sheet was this ftt token
which is ftx's like proprietary token

486
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:12,920
which is ftx's like proprietary token
 

487
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,690
which is ftx's like proprietary token
and Alameda and FTX control a lot of it

488
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:17,700
and Alameda and FTX control a lot of it
 

489
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,810
and Alameda and FTX control a lot of it
they were using this token to basically

490
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:20,820
they were using this token to basically
 

491
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,329
they were using this token to basically
be a large amount of collateral for

492
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:23,339
be a large amount of collateral for
 

493
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:25,310
be a large amount of collateral for
their whole balance sheet so it

494
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:25,320
their whole balance sheet so it
 

495
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,530
their whole balance sheet so it
accounted for this huge amount of their

496
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:27,540
accounted for this huge amount of their
 

497
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,070
accounted for this huge amount of their
value and the CEO of binance had a huge

498
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,080
value and the CEO of binance had a huge
 

499
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,389
value and the CEO of binance had a huge
chunk of it as well and he said I'm

500
00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:32,399
chunk of it as well and he said I'm
 

501
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,949
chunk of it as well and he said I'm
going to sell all of it

502
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:33,959
going to sell all of it
 

503
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,990
going to sell all of it
and the I the fuel that that introduced

504
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,000
and the I the fuel that that introduced
 

505
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,150
and the I the fuel that that introduced
to the market is if he sells all this

506
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:38,160
to the market is if he sells all this
 

507
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,389
to the market is if he sells all this
ftt and this ftt is underwriting a lot

508
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:41,399
ftt and this ftt is underwriting a lot
 

509
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,050
ftt and this ftt is underwriting a lot
of the value of FTX does fdt's almost

510
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:45,060
of the value of FTX does fdt's almost
 

511
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,269
of the value of FTX does fdt's almost
approximate like uh similar things if

512
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:47,279
approximate like uh similar things if
 

513
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,949
approximate like uh similar things if
you were to buy a stock in a public

514
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:48,959
you were to buy a stock in a public
 

515
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,170
you were to buy a stock in a public
company is that kind of like a stock in

516
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:51,180
company is that kind of like a stock in
 

517
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,670
company is that kind of like a stock in
FTX it sort of was this proxy because

518
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:54,680
FTX it sort of was this proxy because
 

519
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,769
FTX it sort of was this proxy because
what FTX was committed to doing was sort

520
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:57,779
what FTX was committed to doing was sort
 

521
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,829
what FTX was committed to doing was sort
of like buying back ftt tokens they

522
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:00,839
of like buying back ftt tokens they
 

523
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:02,030
of like buying back ftt tokens they
would do this thing called the buy and

524
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,040
would do this thing called the buy and
 

525
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,949
would do this thing called the buy and
burn I think there was some amount of

526
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:03,959
burn I think there was some amount of
 

527
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:07,430
burn I think there was some amount of
sharing in the revenue fees of FTX it

528
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
sharing in the revenue fees of FTX it
 

529
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,769
sharing in the revenue fees of FTX it
was kind of this convoluted thing in my

530
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:09,779
was kind of this convoluted thing in my
 

531
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,930
was kind of this convoluted thing in my
opinion the exact value of ftt was

532
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:11,940
opinion the exact value of ftt was
 

533
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,670
opinion the exact value of ftt was
speculative from the beginning and it

534
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
speculative from the beginning and it
 

535
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,570
speculative from the beginning and it
was clear that it was very tied to the

536
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:17,580
was clear that it was very tied to the
 

537
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,970
was clear that it was very tied to the
performance of FTX which is important

538
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
performance of FTX which is important
 

539
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,750
performance of FTX which is important
because we'll get to later FTX sort of

540
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
because we'll get to later FTX sort of
 

541
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,870
because we'll get to later FTX sort of
built their whole scaffold on ftt which

542
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:26,880
built their whole scaffold on ftt which
 

543
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,610
built their whole scaffold on ftt which
meant that this scaffold was very wobbly

544
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:28,620
meant that this scaffold was very wobbly
 

545
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,430
meant that this scaffold was very wobbly
because if FTX loses a little bit of

546
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
because if FTX loses a little bit of
 

547
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,410
because if FTX loses a little bit of
confidence then your value goes down

548
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:33,420
confidence then your value goes down
 

549
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,690
confidence then your value goes down
when your value goes down you lose more

550
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:35,700
when your value goes down you lose more
 

551
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,850
when your value goes down you lose more
confidence and this goes down so it was

552
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:37,860
confidence and this goes down so it was
 

553
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,650
confidence and this goes down so it was
kind of like this thing that this

554
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
kind of like this thing that this
 

555
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,410
kind of like this thing that this
flywheel that when it was going well you

556
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:42,420
flywheel that when it was going well you
 

557
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,150
flywheel that when it was going well you
got huge amounts of growth when it's

558
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
got huge amounts of growth when it's
 

559
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,210
got huge amounts of growth when it's
going bad you get a uh exchange death

560
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,220
going bad you get a uh exchange death
 

561
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,030
going bad you get a uh exchange death
spiral so to speak actually this

00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:50,040
spiral so to speak actually this
 

563
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,130

anticipate the wobbliness of the whole

00:10:59,449 --> 00:10:59,459
anticipate the wobbliness of the whole

00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,449
anticipate the wobbliness of the whole

things that happen later aside do you
think it was difficult to anticipate

576
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
think it was difficult to anticipate
 

577
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,590
think it was difficult to anticipate
this kind of FDT FTX elemented research

578
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
this kind of FDT FTX elemented research
 

579
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,090
this kind of FDT FTX elemented research
weird dynamic no because I think

580
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:13,100
weird dynamic no because I think
 

581
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,370
weird dynamic no because I think
sophisticated Traders always think in

582
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:16,380
sophisticated Traders always think in
 

583
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,550
sophisticated Traders always think in
terms of diversification and correlation

584
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:18,560
terms of diversification and correlation
 

585
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,290
terms of diversification and correlation
so if you're trying to the way to think

586
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:21,300
so if you're trying to the way to think
 

587
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,290
so if you're trying to the way to think
about risk in investing is like if I

588
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:24,300
about risk in investing is like if I
 

589
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,430
about risk in investing is like if I
invest in

590
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
invest in
 

591
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,430
invest in
you Lex Friedman and then I also invest

592
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:28,440
you Lex Friedman and then I also invest
 

593
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,829
you Lex Friedman and then I also invest
in some product you produce those those

594
00:11:30,829 --> 00:11:30,839
in some product you produce those those
 

595
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:32,329
in some product you produce those those
the performance of those two things will

596
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:32,339
the performance of those two things will
 

597
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,370
the performance of those two things will
be pretty correlated so whether I invest

598
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:34,380
be pretty correlated so whether I invest
 

599
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,110
be pretty correlated so whether I invest
in you or I invest in this product that

600
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:36,120
in you or I invest in this product that
 

601
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,630
in you or I invest in this product that
you like are completely behind

602
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
you like are completely behind
 

603
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,790
you like are completely behind
I'm not de-risking I'm basically

604
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm not de-risking I'm basically
 

605
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,710
I'm not de-risking I'm basically
counting all on you doing well right and

606
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
counting all on you doing well right and
 

607
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,329
counting all on you doing well right and
if you do bad my investments do very bad

608
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:44,339
if you do bad my investments do very bad
 

609
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:46,610
if you do bad my investments do very bad
so if I'm trying to build a stable thing

610
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,620
so if I'm trying to build a stable thing
 

611
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,190
so if I'm trying to build a stable thing
I shouldn't put all my eggs in The Lex

612
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
I shouldn't put all my eggs in The Lex
 

613
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,710
I shouldn't put all my eggs in The Lex
Friedman basket unless I'm positive that

614
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:51,720
Friedman basket unless I'm positive that
 

615
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,329
Friedman basket unless I'm positive that
you're going to do well right and these

616
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:53,339
you're going to do well right and these
 

617
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:55,430
you're going to do well right and these
people as your financial advisor I would

618
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:55,440
people as your financial advisor I would
 

619
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,829
people as your financial advisor I would
definitely recommend you do not put all

620
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
definitely recommend you do not put all
 

621
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,389
definitely recommend you do not put all
your eggs in this basket right and so

622
00:11:59,389 --> 00:11:59,399
your eggs in this basket right and so
 

623
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,370
your eggs in this basket right and so
you can think about it like if I know

624
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:01,380
you can think about it like if I know
 

625
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:03,829
you can think about it like if I know
that these people were trained to think

626
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
that these people were trained to think
 

627
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,710
that these people were trained to think
like this and so the idea that you could

628
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:06,720
like this and so the idea that you could
 

629
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,750
like this and so the idea that you could
start this exchange you're worth

630
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:08,760
start this exchange you're worth
 

631
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,329
start this exchange you're worth
billions of dollars and you underwrite

632
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:11,339
billions of dollars and you underwrite
 

633
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,850
billions of dollars and you underwrite
your whole system by betting putting

634
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:13,860
your whole system by betting putting
 

635
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,829
your whole system by betting putting
most of it on your own token is is

636
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:15,839
most of it on your own token is is
 

637
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,290
most of it on your own token is is
insane and what and what's crazy is

638
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,300
insane and what and what's crazy is
 

639
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,970
insane and what and what's crazy is
we'll later find out that they were

640
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:19,980
we'll later find out that they were
 

641
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,370
we'll later find out that they were
basically taking customer assets which

642
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:22,380
basically taking customer assets which
 

643
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,590
basically taking customer assets which
were real things like Bitcoin and

644
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:24,600
were real things like Bitcoin and
 

645
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,470
were real things like Bitcoin and
ethereum with with risks that were not

646
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:27,480
ethereum with with risks that were not
 

647
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,449
ethereum with with risks that were not
so correlated to FDX and they were

648
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:29,459
so correlated to FDX and they were
 

649
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:30,949
so correlated to FDX and they were
swapping them out they were using to go

650
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:30,959
swapping them out they were using to go
 

651
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,650
swapping them out they were using to go
go basically gamble those and putting

652
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:33,660
go basically gamble those and putting
 

653
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,269
go basically gamble those and putting
ftt in its place as quote value so they

654
00:12:38,269 --> 00:12:38,279
ftt in its place as quote value so they
 

655
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:39,590
ftt in its place as quote value so they
were increasing the risk of the system

656
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:39,600
were increasing the risk of the system
 

657
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,650
were increasing the risk of the system
in order to bet big with the idea that

658
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:42,660
in order to bet big with the idea that
 

659
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,449
in order to bet big with the idea that
if they bet big in one we'd all be

660
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:44,459
if they bet big in one we'd all be
 

661
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:46,490
if they bet big in one we'd all be
singing their praises if we bet big and

662
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:46,500
singing their praises if we bet big and
 

663
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,590
singing their praises if we bet big and
law if they bet big and lost

664
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:48,600
law if they bet big and lost
 

665
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,449
law if they bet big and lost
I don't know if they had a plan but I

666
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:50,459
I don't know if they had a plan but I
 

667
00:12:50,459 --> 00:12:51,650
I don't know if they had a plan but I
think they were I think they were being

668
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:51,660
think they were I think they were being
 

669
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,449
think they were I think they were being
extremely risky and there's no way to

670
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:53,459
extremely risky and there's no way to
 

671
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:55,610
extremely risky and there's no way to
avoid their knowledge of That So when

672
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:55,620
avoid their knowledge of That So when
 

673
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,710
avoid their knowledge of That So when
you say customer assets is I come to

674
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:57,720
you say customer assets is I come to
 

675
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,990
you say customer assets is I come to
this crypto exchange I have Bitcoin or

676
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:00,000
this crypto exchange I have Bitcoin or
 

677
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,690
this crypto exchange I have Bitcoin or
some other cryptocurrency and this is a

678
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:02,700
some other cryptocurrency and this is a
 

679
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,030
some other cryptocurrency and this is a
a thing that has

680
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,040
a thing that has
 

681
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,670
a thing that has
pretty stable value over time I mean

682
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
pretty stable value over time I mean
 

683
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,230
pretty stable value over time I mean
yeah right that's crypto relative

684
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:09,240
yeah right that's crypto relative
 

685
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,810
yeah right that's crypto relative
relatively so and I'm going to store it

686
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:11,820
relatively so and I'm going to store it
 

687
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,509
relatively so and I'm going to store it
on this crypto exchange and that that's

688
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:14,519
on this crypto exchange and that that's
 

689
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:16,990
on this crypto exchange and that that's
the whole point this is uh

690
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,000
the whole point this is uh
 

691
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,550
the whole point this is uh
so this thing to the degree that crypto

692
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:19,560
so this thing to the degree that crypto
 

693
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,110
so this thing to the degree that crypto
holds value

694
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
holds value
 

695
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,329
holds value
is supposed to continue holding value

696
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:23,339
is supposed to continue holding value
 

697
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,670
is supposed to continue holding value
there's not there's not supposed to be

698
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
there's not there's not supposed to be
 

699
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,590
there's not there's not supposed to be
an extra risk inserted into the thing

700
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
an extra risk inserted into the thing
 

701
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,470
an extra risk inserted into the thing
right and FTX was pretty clear from the

702
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
right and FTX was pretty clear from the
 

703
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,449
right and FTX was pretty clear from the
beginning that they wouldn't invest your

704
00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:32,459
beginning that they wouldn't invest your
 

705
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:34,250
beginning that they wouldn't invest your
assets in anything else they wouldn't do

706
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:34,260
assets in anything else they wouldn't do
 

707
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,569
assets in anything else they wouldn't do
anything else with it they wouldn't

708
00:13:35,569 --> 00:13:35,579
anything else with it they wouldn't
 

709
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,009
anything else with it they wouldn't
trade it

710
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:37,019
trade it
 

711
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:40,970
trade it
that's what made FTX so such like a

712
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:40,980
that's what made FTX so such like a
 

713
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,250
that's what made FTX so such like a
horror story for investor confidence is

714
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:43,260
horror story for investor confidence is
 

715
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,790
horror story for investor confidence is
basically they made every signal that

716
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
basically they made every signal that
 

717
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,410
basically they made every signal that
they would not do anything nefarious

718
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:48,420
they would not do anything nefarious
 

719
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,690
they would not do anything nefarious
with your tokens they would just put

720
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:50,700
with your tokens they would just put
 

721
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,610
with your tokens they would just put
them to the side put them in a separate

722
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:52,620
them to the side put them in a separate
 

723
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,110
them to the side put them in a separate
account that they don't have access to

724
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,120
account that they don't have access to
 

725
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,449
account that they don't have access to
and they just kind of wait there until

726
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:56,459
and they just kind of wait there until
 

727
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:58,430
and they just kind of wait there until
the day that you're ready to withdraw

selling this token that underwrites the

00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:08,579
selling this token that underwrites the
 

737
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:11,750
selling this token that underwrites the
value of FTX there's a total panic

738
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:11,760

um and a day later he basically admits

748
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:23,700
um and a day later he basically admits
 

749
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,490
um and a day later he basically admits
that that wasn't the case they don't

750
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:25,500
that that wasn't the case they don't
 

751
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,410
that that wasn't the case they don't
have the money they're shutting down and

752
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:27,420
have the money they're shutting down and
 

753
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,210
have the money they're shutting down and
then a few days later after that they

754
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,220
then a few days later after that they
 

755
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,889
then a few days later after that they
declared bankruptcy

756
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:30,899
declared bankruptcy
 

757
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:32,870
declared bankruptcy
there's I should be clear there's

758
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:32,880
there's I should be clear there's
 

759
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,050
there's I should be clear there's
Alameda research FTX International and

760
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,060
Alameda research FTX International and
 

761
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,690
Alameda research FTX International and
FTX us which is the U.S side of things

762
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:38,700
FTX us which is the U.S side of things
 

763
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,449
FTX us which is the U.S side of things
these are three different entities

764
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:41,459
these are three different entities
 

765
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:44,269
these are three different entities
all of them are on bankruptcy and it's

766
00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:44,279
all of them are on bankruptcy and it's
 

767
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,550
all of them are on bankruptcy and it's
not clear to the extent that they were

768
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:46,560
not clear to the extent that they were
 

769
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,829
not clear to the extent that they were
co-mingling funds but it's clear that

770
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:48,839
co-mingling funds but it's clear that
 

771
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,210
co-mingling funds but it's clear that
they were co-mingling funds to some

772
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:50,220
they were co-mingling funds to some
 

773
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,610
they were co-mingling funds to some
extent so they kind of worked taking

774
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:52,620
extent so they kind of worked taking
 

775
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,310
extent so they kind of worked taking
from each other and that is where the

776
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:55,320
from each other and that is where the
 

777
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,829
from each other and that is where the
fraud happens right because if going

778
00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
fraud happens right because if going
 

779
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,569
fraud happens right because if going
back to our earlier analogy if you're

780
00:14:59,569 --> 00:14:59,579
back to our earlier analogy if you're
 

781
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,730
back to our earlier analogy if you're
supposed to set funds aside and I find

782
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:01,740
supposed to set funds aside and I find
 

783
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,889
supposed to set funds aside and I find
out you were using it to go make all

784
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:03,899
out you were using it to go make all
 

785
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:05,990
out you were using it to go make all
these Arbitrage trades or do Market

786
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
these Arbitrage trades or do Market
 

787
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,910
these Arbitrage trades or do Market
making or all these activities you were

788
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:07,920
making or all these activities you were
 

789
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,290
making or all these activities you were
known for for your like hedge fund

790
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:09,300
known for for your like hedge fund
 

791
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,210
known for for your like hedge fund
trading firm thing that's a huge problem

792
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,220
trading firm thing that's a huge problem
 

793
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,730
trading firm thing that's a huge problem
because you he basically lied about this

794
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:13,740
because you he basically lied about this
 

795
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,889
because you he basically lied about this
and especially when he's saying

796
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:15,899
and especially when he's saying

958
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,080
didn't get him to ask everything that I
 

959
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,490
didn't get him to ask everything that I
wanted because he like would leave

960
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:21,500

sometimes uh you know after I asked some

962
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:24,660
sometimes uh you know after I asked some
 

963
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,049
sometimes uh you know after I asked some
of the questions but really what I asked

964
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:27,059
of the questions but really what I asked
 

965
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,650
of the questions but really what I asked
was about this 8 billion and zooming in

966
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:30,660
was about this 8 billion and zooming in
 

967
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,289
was about this 8 billion and zooming in
on the improbability of his lack of

968
00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:33,299
on the improbability of his lack of
 

969
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:34,909
on the improbability of his lack of
knowledge

970
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:34,919
knowledge
 

971
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:37,789
knowledge
um it's sort of like if you if you run a

972
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:37,799
um it's sort of like if you if you run a
 

973
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:40,010
um it's sort of like if you if you run a
company and you know the insides and

974
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:40,020
company and you know the insides and
 

975
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,110
company and you know the insides and
outs and you're the top of your field

976
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:42,120
outs and you're the top of your field
 

977
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,450
outs and you're the top of your field
top top in class

978
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:44,460
top top in class
 

979
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,130
top top in class
and all of a sudden it all goes busting

980
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:46,140
and all of a sudden it all goes busting
 

981
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,510
and all of a sudden it all goes busting
you say I had no idea how any of this

982
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:47,520
you say I had no idea how any of this
 

983
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,549
you say I had no idea how any of this
worked yeah I didn't I didn't know it's

984
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
worked yeah I didn't I didn't know it's
 

985
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,529
worked yeah I didn't I didn't know it's
like the guy who runs Whataburger saying

986
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:51,539
like the guy who runs Whataburger saying
 

987
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,270
like the guy who runs Whataburger saying
I didn't know where we sourced our beef

988
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
I didn't know where we sourced our beef
 

989
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,190
I didn't know where we sourced our beef
I didn't know where we that's a Texas

990
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
I didn't know where we that's a Texas
 

991
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,750
I didn't know where we that's a Texas
example actually thank you I appreciate

992
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:56,760
example actually thank you I appreciate
 

993
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,970
example actually thank you I appreciate
it uh let's let's take it like worldwide

994
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:58,980
it uh let's let's take it like worldwide
 

995
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,490
it uh let's let's take it like worldwide
Walmart like I didn't know we used

996
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:01,500
Walmart like I didn't know we used
 

997
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,710
Walmart like I didn't know we used
Chinese manufacturers it's like that's

998
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:03,720
Chinese manufacturers it's like that's
 

999
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,590
Chinese manufacturers it's like that's
impossible to become Walmart you have to

1000
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:06,600
impossible to become Walmart you have to
 

1001
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,750
impossible to become Walmart you have to
know how like how your supply chain

1002
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
know how like how your supply chain
 

1003
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,730
know how like how your supply chain
works you have to know even if you're at

1004
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:10,740
works you have to know even if you're at
 

1005
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,870
works you have to know even if you're at
a high level you know how this stuff

1006
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:11,880
a high level you know how this stuff
 

1007
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,270
a high level you know how this stuff
works can I do a hard turn on that and

1008
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:14,280
works can I do a hard turn on that and
 

1009
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,630
works can I do a hard turn on that and
go sure as one must to Hitler uh

1010
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:17,640
go sure as one must to Hitler uh
 

1011
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,090
go sure as one must to Hitler uh
Hitler's writing is not on any of the

1012
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,100
Hitler's writing is not on any of the
 

1013
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,610
Hitler's writing is not on any of the
documents around as far as I know uh on

1014
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:22,620
documents around as far as I know uh on
 

1015
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,090
documents around as far as I know uh on
the final solution so in in some crazy

1016
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:26,100
the final solution so in in some crazy
 

1017
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,690
the final solution so in in some crazy
world you could theoretically say I knew

1018
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:29,700
world you could theoretically say I knew
 

1019
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,810
world you could theoretically say I knew
I didn't know anything about death camps

1020
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:32,820
I didn't know anything about death camps
 

1021
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,390
I didn't know anything about death camps
uh so there's this plausible deniability

1022
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:35,400
uh so there's this plausible deniability
 

1023
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,810
uh so there's this plausible deniability
in theory so that's but that most people

1024
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:38,820
in theory so that's but that most people
 

1025
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,930
in theory so that's but that most people
would look at that and say uh it's very

1026
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:41,940
would look at that and say uh it's very
 

1027
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,270
would look at that and say uh it's very
unlikely you don't know especially if

1028
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:44,280
unlikely you don't know especially if
 

1029
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,590
unlikely you don't know especially if
all the Insiders are coming out and

1030
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:45,600
all the Insiders are coming out and
 

1031
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,090
all the Insiders are coming out and
saying no no of course he knew he was

1032
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,100
saying no no of course he knew he was
 

1033
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:50,090
saying no no of course he knew he was
directing us from the top I mean um what

1034
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:50,100
directing us from the top I mean um what
 

1035
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,950
directing us from the top I mean um what
was clear what's interesting about the

1036
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:51,960
was clear what's interesting about the
 

1037
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,570
was clear what's interesting about the
structure and like I love the knitting

1038
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,580
structure and like I love the knitting
 

1039
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,570
structure and like I love the knitting
yeah we're back to SPF yeah sorry now

1040
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:56,580
yeah we're back to SPF yeah sorry now
 

1041
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,789
yeah we're back to SPF yeah sorry now
we're back I wanted to turn us as fast

1042
00:19:58,789 --> 00:19:58,799
we're back I wanted to turn us as fast
 

1043
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,010
we're back I wanted to turn us as fast
as possible

1044
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,020
as possible
 

1045
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,029
as possible
um I yeah I so the Insiders in what

1046
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
um I yeah I so the Insiders in what
 

1047
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,190
um I yeah I so the Insiders in what
Almer Alameda research what was

1048
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:07,200
Almer Alameda research what was
 

1049
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,350
Almer Alameda research what was
interesting is that there was this sort

1050
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:09,360
interesting is that there was this sort
 

1051
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,330
interesting is that there was this sort
of one-way window going on between

1052
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:11,340
of one-way window going on between
 

1053
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,810
of one-way window going on between
Alameda and FTX where FTX employees

1054
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:14,820
Alameda and FTX where FTX employees
 

1055
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,450
Alameda and FTX where FTX employees
didn't know a lot of what was going on

1056
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:16,460
didn't know a lot of what was going on
 

1057
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,970
didn't know a lot of what was going on
Alameda insiders and I would say by

1058
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:19,980
Alameda insiders and I would say by
 

1059
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,130
Alameda insiders and I would say by
Design knew almost everything that was

1060
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:22,140
Design knew almost everything that was
 

1061
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:24,710
Design knew almost everything that was
going on at FTX

1062
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
going on at FTX
 

1063
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,650
going on at FTX
um and so I think that was really

1064
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:27,660
um and so I think that was really
 

1065
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,810
um and so I think that was really
interesting from the perspective of a

1066
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:29,820
interesting from the perspective of a
 

1067
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,390
interesting from the perspective of a
lot of the so-called like what you could

1068
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:32,400
lot of the so-called like what you could
 

1069
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,930
lot of the so-called like what you could
which he's trying to ascribe to as like

1070
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:34,940
which he's trying to ascribe to as like
 

1071
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,090
which he's trying to ascribe to as like
failures or mistakes or ignorance and

1072
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,100
failures or mistakes or ignorance and
 

1073
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,570
failures or mistakes or ignorance and
negligence when looked at closely are

1074
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:41,580
negligence when looked at closely are
 

1075
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,150
negligence when looked at closely are
much more designed and they sort of

1076
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:44,160
much more designed and they sort of
 

1077
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,850
much more designed and they sort of
don't arise spontaneously because like

1078
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:46,860
don't arise spontaneously because like
 

1079
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,289
don't arise spontaneously because like
let's say so there's this thing in

1080
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:48,299
let's say so there's this thing in
 

1081
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:50,810
let's say so there's this thing in
banking and like trading where if I run

1082
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:50,820
banking and like trading where if I run
 

1083
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,789
banking and like trading where if I run
a bank and you run like a trading firm

1084
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
a bank and you run like a trading firm
 

1085
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,650
a bank and you run like a trading firm
we need to have informational walls

1086
00:20:54,650 --> 00:20:54,660
we need to have informational walls
 

1087
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,789
we need to have informational walls
between us because there's huge

1088
00:20:55,789 --> 00:20:55,799
between us because there's huge
 

1089
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,230
between us because there's huge
conflicts of interest that can arise

1090
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,240
conflicts of interest that can arise
 

1091
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,990
conflicts of interest that can arise
right so the negligent argument might be

1092
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,000
right so the negligent argument might be
 

1093
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,210
right so the negligent argument might be
that like oh we just didn't know we're

1094
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:02,220
that like oh we just didn't know we're
 

1095
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,710
that like oh we just didn't know we're
sort of these dumb kids in the Bahamas

1096
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:03,720
sort of these dumb kids in the Bahamas
 

1097
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,470
sort of these dumb kids in the Bahamas
so we shared information equally

1098
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:06,480
so we shared information equally
 

1099
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,870
so we shared information equally
but when you see a one-way wall that

1100
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
but when you see a one-way wall that
 

1101
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,970
but when you see a one-way wall that
starts to look a lot different right if

1102
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:10,980
starts to look a lot different right if
 

1103
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,070
starts to look a lot different right if
I have a back-end source of looking at

1104
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,080
I have a back-end source of looking at
 

1105
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,810
I have a back-end source of looking at
or sorry you're the trading firm so you

1106
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:14,820
or sorry you're the trading firm so you
 

1107
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,490
or sorry you're the trading firm so you
have a back-end way to look at all my

1108
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:16,500
have a back-end way to look at all my
 

1109
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,650
have a back-end way to look at all my
accounts and I have no idea that you're

1110
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:18,660
accounts and I have no idea that you're
 

1111
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,690
accounts and I have no idea that you're
doing that that all of a sudden looks

1112
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:20,700
doing that that all of a sudden looks
 

1113
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,690
doing that that all of a sudden looks
like a much more designed thing when it

1114
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:23,700
like a much more designed thing when it
 

1115
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,850
like a much more designed thing when it
would be plausible let's say going to to

1116
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:25,860
would be plausible let's say going to to
 

1117
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,970
would be plausible let's say going to to
use another another analogy too if

1118
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:28,980
use another another analogy too if
 

1119
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,010
use another another analogy too if
you're saying look I co-mingled funds

1120
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,020
you're saying look I co-mingled funds
 

1121
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,330
you're saying look I co-mingled funds
because I was so bad at corporate

1122
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:32,340
because I was so bad at corporate
 

1123
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,909
because I was so bad at corporate
structures you would expect those

1124
00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:34,919
structures you would expect those
 

1125
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:36,950
structures you would expect those
companies to have a very simple

1126
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:36,960
companies to have a very simple
 

1127
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,330
companies to have a very simple
corporate structure because you didn't

1128
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,340
corporate structure because you didn't
 

1129
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,950
corporate structure because you didn't
know what you're doing right but what we

1130
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:39,960
know what you're doing right but what we
 

1131
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,230
know what you're doing right but what we
see with FTX and Alameda

1132
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
see with FTX and Alameda
 

1133
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,810
see with FTX and Alameda
is they had something like 50 companies

1134
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:44,820
is they had something like 50 companies
 

1135
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,990
is they had something like 50 companies
and subsidiaries and it's Inc impossibly

1136
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:48,000
and subsidiaries and it's Inc impossibly
 

1137
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,649
and subsidiaries and it's Inc impossibly
complicated web of corporate activity

1138
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:51,659
complicated web of corporate activity
 

1139
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:54,049
complicated web of corporate activity
you don't get there by accident you

1140
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:54,059
you don't get there by accident you
 

1141
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:56,930
you don't get there by accident you
don't wake up and go oh I designed like

1142
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:56,940
don't wake up and go oh I designed like
 

1143
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,149
don't wake up and go oh I designed like
this watch that ticked a very specific

1144
00:21:59,149 --> 00:21:59,159
this watch that ticked a very specific
 

1145
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,490
this watch that ticked a very specific
way but it was all accidental if you

1146
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:01,500
way but it was all accidental if you
 

1147
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,630
way but it was all accidental if you
really didn't know what you were doing

1148
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:02,640
really didn't know what you were doing
 

1149
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,029
really didn't know what you were doing
you'd end up with a simple structure so

1150
00:22:05,029 --> 00:22:05,039
you'd end up with a simple structure so
 

1151
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,549
you'd end up with a simple structure so
even just like from a fundamental

1152
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:07,559
even just like from a fundamental
 

1153
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,850
even just like from a fundamental

the activities they were engaging in
 

1157
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,049
the activities they were engaging in
were so complicated and purposely

1158
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:15,059
were so complicated and purposely
 

1159
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,730
were so complicated and purposely
designed to obfuscate what they were

1160
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:16,740
designed to obfuscate what they were

00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:22,320
the negligence argument and I want to
 

1165
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,529
the negligence argument and I want to
quickly say too like I don't think a lot

1166
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:24,539
quickly say too like I don't think a lot
 

1167
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:25,970
quickly say too like I don't think a lot
of people have honed in on this there

1168
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:25,980
of people have honed in on this there
 

1169
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,250

was insider trading going on

1170
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:28,260
was insider trading going on
 

1171
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,490
was insider trading going on
From alameda's perspective where

1172
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:31,500
From alameda's perspective where
 

1173
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,190
From alameda's perspective where
they would know what coins FTX was going

1174
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:34,200
they would know what coins FTX was going
 

1175
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,409
they would know what coins FTX was going
to list on their exchange there's a

1176
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:36,419
to list on their exchange there's a
 

1177
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,210
to list on their exchange there's a
famous effect where let's say you're

1178
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:38,220
famous effect where let's say you're
 

1179
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,310
famous effect where let's say you're
this legitimate exchange you list a coin

1180
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
this legitimate exchange you list a coin
 

1181
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,049
this legitimate exchange you list a coin
the price spikes

1182
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:42,059
the price spikes
 

1183
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:44,330
the price spikes
insiders told me it was a regular

1184
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:44,340
insiders told me it was a regular
 

1185
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,750
insiders told me it was a regular
practice for Alameda insiders to know

1186
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:47,760
practice for Alameda insiders to know
 

1187
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,090
practice for Alameda insiders to know
that FTX was going to list a coin and as

1188
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:50,100
that FTX was going to list a coin and as
 

1189
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,490
that FTX was going to list a coin and as
a company buy up that coin so they could

1190
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:52,500
a company buy up that coin so they could
 

1191
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,350
a company buy up that coin so they could
sell it after it listed and they made

1192
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,360
sell it after it listed and they made
 

1193
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,789
sell it after it listed and they made
millions of dollars how do you do that

1194
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
millions of dollars how do you do that
 

1195
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:58,250
millions of dollars how do you do that
accidentally yeah and that's that's

1196
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:58,260
accidentally yeah and that's that's
 

1197
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,370
accidentally yeah and that's that's
illegal totally illegal so that's

1198
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:01,380
illegal totally illegal so that's
 

1199
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,470
illegal totally illegal so that's
illegal from like and if an individual

1200
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:03,480
illegal from like and if an individual
 

1201
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,690
illegal from like and if an individual
does it it's illegal it's fraud what if

1202
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:05,700
does it it's illegal it's fraud what if
 

1203
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,750
does it it's illegal it's fraud what if
a company is systematically doing it and

1204
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:08,760
a company is systematically doing it and
 

1205
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,630
a company is systematically doing it and
you can't tell me that FTX

1206
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:11,640
you can't tell me that FTX
 

1207
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,210
you can't tell me that FTX
or someone at FTX wasn't feeding that

1208
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:14,220
or someone at FTX wasn't feeding that
 

1209
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:17,090
or someone at FTX wasn't feeding that
information about to Alameda or somehow

1210
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:17,100
information about to Alameda or somehow
 

1211
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,850
information about to Alameda or somehow
giving them keys to know that and that

1212
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:19,860
giving them keys to know that and that
 

1213
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,230
giving them keys to know that and that
would happen at the highest level it

1214
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:21,240
would happen at the highest level it
 

1215
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,270
would happen at the highest level it
would happen at SPS level and this is

1216
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:23,280
would happen at SPS level and this is
 

1217
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:26,210
would happen at SPS level and this is
why his arguments of I was dumb I was

1218
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:26,220
why his arguments of I was dumb I was
 

1219
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,730
why his arguments of I was dumb I was
naive I was sort of ignorant or so

1220
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:28,740
naive I was sort of ignorant or so
 

1221
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,590
naive I was sort of ignorant or so
Preposterous because he's dumb and

1222
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:30,600
Preposterous because he's dumb and
 

1223
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,630
Preposterous because he's dumb and
ignorant the second it becomes criminal

1224
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:32,640
ignorant the second it becomes criminal
 

1225
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,810
ignorant the second it becomes criminal
to be smart and sophisticated right

1226
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:35,820
to be smart and sophisticated right
 

1227
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,669
to be smart and sophisticated right
but then also coming out and talking

1228
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
but then also coming out and talking
 

1229
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,529
but then also coming out and talking
about it which is uh

1230
00:23:39,529 --> 00:23:39,539
about it which is uh
 

1231
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,049
about it which is uh
it's a bizarre move it's a bizarre and

1232
00:23:42,049 --> 00:23:42,059
it's a bizarre move it's a bizarre and
 

1233
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,110
it's a bizarre move it's a bizarre and
almost a dark move uh can you tell the

1234
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,120
almost a dark move uh can you tell the
 

1235
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,430
almost a dark move uh can you tell the
story of the 8 billion you mentioned 8

1236
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:46,440
story of the 8 billion you mentioned 8
 

1237
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,750
story of the 8 billion you mentioned 8
billion what's the 8 billion what's the

1238
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
billion what's the 8 billion what's the
 

1239
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,789
billion what's the 8 billion what's the
missing eight billion yeah so it's

1240
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:49,799
missing eight billion yeah so it's
 

1241
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:51,169
missing eight billion yeah so it's
really interesting because it's sort of

1242
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:51,179
really interesting because it's sort of
 

1243
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,710
really interesting because it's sort of
like wire fraud you sort of he's sort of

1244
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:54,720
like wire fraud you sort of he's sort of
 

1245
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,110
like wire fraud you sort of he's sort of
copping to like smaller crimes to avoid

1246
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
copping to like smaller crimes to avoid
 

1247
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,850
copping to like smaller crimes to avoid
the big crime the big crime is you knew

1248
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:58,860
the big crime the big crime is you knew
 

1249
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,890
the big crime the big crime is you knew
everything and you were behind it right

1250
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:00,900
everything and you were behind it right
 

1251
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,770
everything and you were behind it right
the smaller crimes are like a little

1252
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:03,780
the smaller crimes are like a little
 

1253
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,810
the smaller crimes are like a little
wire fraud here little wire fraud there

1254
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:05,820
wire fraud here little wire fraud there
 

1255
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,510
wire fraud here little wire fraud there
so what the 8 billion is is that FTX

1256
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:08,520
so what the 8 billion is is that FTX
 

1257
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,070
so what the 8 billion is is that FTX
didn't always have banking it's hard to

1258
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:10,080
didn't always have banking it's hard to
 

1259
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,870
didn't always have banking it's hard to
get banking as a crypto exchange there's

1260
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:11,880
get banking as a crypto exchange there's
 

1261
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,130
get banking as a crypto exchange there's
all these questions of like where's the

1262
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:13,140

that's the first like thing that I think
 

1299
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,710
that's the first like thing that I think
is legal but

1300
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:48,720
is legal but
 

1301
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,890

1364
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:55,020
right within 10 billion or so
 

1365
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:58,070
right within 10 billion or so
what is that error margin 10 billion

1366
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
what is that error margin 10 billion
 

1367
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,130
what is that error margin 10 billion
dollars for a company that is arguably

1368
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:01,140
dollars for a company that is arguably
 

1369
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,409
dollars for a company that is arguably
never worth more than 100 million yeah

1370
00:26:03,409 --> 00:26:03,419
never worth more than 100 million yeah
 

1371
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,029
never worth more than 100 million yeah
that probably never never even worth

1372
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
that probably never never even worth
 

1373
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,669
that probably never never even worth
more than 50 billion your error margin

1374
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:07,679
more than 50 billion your error margin
 

1375
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,490
more than 50 billion your error margin
is 10 billion you have to be this is a

1376
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:10,500
is 10 billion you have to be this is a
 

1377
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,370
is 10 billion you have to be this is a
guy who is sending around

1378
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:12,380
guy who is sending around
 

1379
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,870
guy who is sending around
statements that like there was no risk

1380
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
statements that like there was no risk
 

1381
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,909
statements that like there was no risk
involved and you're telling me he had a

1382
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:16,919
involved and you're telling me he had a
 

1383
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,890
involved and you're telling me he had a
error margin of 10 billion dollars that

1384
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:18,900
error margin of 10 billion dollars that
 

1385
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,230
error margin of 10 billion dollars that
is the difference between like a healthy

1386
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,240
is the difference between like a healthy
 

1387
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,269
is the difference between like a healthy
company and a company so deep underwater

1388
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
company and a company so deep underwater
 

1389
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,529
company and a company so deep underwater
you're going to jail

1390
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:24,539
you're going to jail
 

1391
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,909
you're going to jail
so it you have to believe that he is

1392
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:28,919
so it you have to believe that he is
 

1393
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,730
so it you have to believe that he is
impossibly stupid and square that with

1394
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:31,740
impossibly stupid and square that with
 

1395
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,169
impossibly stupid and square that with
the sophistication that he brought to

1396
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:33,179
the sophistication that he brought to
 

1397
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:34,490
the sophistication that he brought to
the table it's an I think it's an

1398
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:34,500
the table it's an I think it's an
 

1399
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,870
the table it's an I think it's an
impossible argument I I don't even think

1400
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:35,880
impossible argument I I don't even think
 

1401
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,330
impossible argument I I don't even think
it's do you think he is incompetent

1402
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:38,340
it's do you think he is incompetent
 

1403
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:41,090
it's do you think he is incompetent
insane or evil

1404
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:41,100
insane or evil
 

1405
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,269
insane or evil
if you were to bet

1406
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:44,279

 

1407
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:46,610

money on each of those incompetent

1408
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:46,620
money on each of those incompetent
 

1409
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,510
money on each of those incompetent
insane or evil insane meaning he's lying

1410
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:50,520
insane or evil insane meaning he's lying
 

1411
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,590
insane or evil insane meaning he's lying
to everyone but also to himself

1412
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
to everyone but also to himself
 

1413
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,390
to everyone but also to himself
uh which you could which is a little bit

1414
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,400
uh which you could which is a little bit
 

1415
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,370
uh which you could which is a little bit
different than incompetence he's not

1416
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:58,380
different than incompetence he's not
 

1417
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,230
different than incompetence he's not
incompetent

1418
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,240
incompetent
 

1419
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,590
incompetent

first
uh but quickly when you dig down you

1746
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:13,140
uh but quickly when you dig down you
 

1747
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,690
uh but quickly when you dig down you
realize that most people who lost 10

1748
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:14,700
realize that most people who lost 10
 

1749
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,950
realize that most people who lost 10
million dollars I mean I'm sure that's

1750
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:15,960
million dollars I mean I'm sure that's
 

1751
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,810
million dollars I mean I'm sure that's
terrible for them I wish them to get

1752
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:17,820
terrible for them I wish them to get
 

1753
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,789
terrible for them I wish them to get
their money back but uh it's usually the

1754
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:19,799
their money back but uh it's usually the
 

1755
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,549
their money back but uh it's usually the
people with like 50 000 or less that are

1756
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:22,559
people with like 50 000 or less that are
 

1757
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,529
people with like 50 000 or less that are
most impacted usually they do not have

1758
00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:24,539
most impacted usually they do not have
 

1759
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:26,570
most impacted usually they do not have
the money to spare usually they're not

1760
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:26,580
the money to spare usually they're not
 

1761

Diversified in a sophisticated way
 

1763
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,190
Diversified in a sophisticated way
um so I think it's those people I think

1764
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:31,200
um so I think it's those people I think
 

1765
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,750
um so I think it's those people I think
it's the small account holders that I

1766
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:32,760
it's the small account holders that I
 

1767
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,130
it's the small account holders that I
feel the worst for and unfortunately

1768
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,140
feel the worst for and unfortunately
 

1769
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,289
feel the worst for and unfortunately
they often get the least press time or

1770
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:36,299
they often get the least press time or
 

1771
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,810
they often get the least press time or
air time that's a really difficult truth

1772
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:38,820
air time that's a really difficult truth
 

1773
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,549
air time that's a really difficult truth
of this is that especially in the

1774
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
of this is that especially in the
 

1775
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,590
of this is that especially in the
culture of cryptocurrency there's a lot

1776
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:42,600
culture of cryptocurrency there's a lot
 

1777
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,350
culture of cryptocurrency there's a lot
of young people who are not Diversified

1778
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
of young people who are not Diversified
 

1779
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,049
of young people who are not Diversified
they're basically all in on a particular

1780
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:48,059
they're basically all in on a particular
 

1781
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,250
they're basically all in on a particular
crypto

1782
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:49,260
crypto
 

1783
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,350
crypto
and it just breaks my heart to think

1784
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:51,360
and it just breaks my heart to think
 

1785
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,210
and it just breaks my heart to think
that there's somebody fifty thousand or

1786
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:53,220
that there's somebody fifty thousand or
 

1787
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,009
that there's somebody fifty thousand or
thirty thousand or Twenty Thousand but

1788
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:55,019
thirty thousand or Twenty Thousand but
 

1789
00:33:55,019 --> 00:33:56,630
thirty thousand or Twenty Thousand but
the point is that money

1790
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640
the point is that money
 

1791
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,029
the point is that money
is everything they own

1792
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
is everything they own
 

1793
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,370
is everything they own
right and now

1794
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:01,380
right and now
 

1795
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,230
right and now
now what their life is basically

1796
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:03,240
now what their life is basically
 

1797
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,850
now what their life is basically
destroyed

00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:04,860
destroyed
 

1799
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,909
destroyed
like you know imagine your 18 19 20 21

1800
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
like you know imagine your 18 19 20 21

destroying a life
 

1811
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,250
destroying a life
what's so brutal about this is that this

1812
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:19,260
what's so brutal about this is that this
 

1813
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,169
what's so brutal about this is that this
all comes on the back the entire crypto

1814
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,179
all comes on the back the entire crypto
 

1815
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:24,470
all comes on the back the entire crypto
Market comes on the back of

1816
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
Market comes on the back of
 

1817
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,109
Market comes on the back of
comes from the deep distrust of

1818
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:27,119
comes from the deep distrust of
 

1819
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,530
comes from the deep distrust of
traditional Finance right yeah 2008

1820
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:30,540
traditional Finance right yeah 2008
 

1821
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,149
traditional Finance right yeah 2008
everybody lost trust in the banking

1822
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:32,159
everybody lost trust in the banking
 

1823
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,849
everybody lost trust in the banking
systems and they lost trust that if

1824
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:34,859
systems and they lost trust that if
 

1825
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,829
systems and they lost trust that if
those banking systems acted in a corrupt

1826
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:36,839
those banking systems acted in a corrupt
 

1827
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:39,169
those banking systems acted in a corrupt
way that they would receive the Justice

1828
00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:39,179
way that they would receive the Justice
 

1829
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:40,909
way that they would receive the Justice
it turned out that the banks received

1830
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:40,919
it turned out that the banks received
 

1831
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,190
it turned out that the banks received
favorable treatment people didn't so

1832
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
favorable treatment people didn't so
 

1833
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,750
favorable treatment people didn't so
people

1834
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:44,760
people
 

1835
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:48,589
people
lost faith in the the structure of our

1836
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:48,599
lost faith in the the structure of our
 

1837
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,629
lost faith in the the structure of our
financial system in a way that is we're

1838
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
financial system in a way that is we're
 

1839
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,369
financial system in a way that is we're
still feeling the reverberations of it

1840
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:52,379
still feeling the reverberations of it
 

1841
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:53,990
still feeling the reverberations of it
and so when crypto came along it was

1842
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
and so when crypto came along it was
 

1843
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,490
and so when crypto came along it was
like kind of this way to reinvent the

1844
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:55,500
like kind of this way to reinvent the
 

1845
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,609
like kind of this way to reinvent the
wheel reinvent the world for the the

1846
00:34:58,609 --> 00:34:58,619
wheel reinvent the world for the the
 

1847
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:00,650
wheel reinvent the world for the the
like sort of lowly and the like less

1848
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:00,660
like sort of lowly and the like less
 

1849
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,750
like sort of lowly and the like less
powerful and kind of level the playing

1850
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:02,760
powerful and kind of level the playing
 

1851
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:05,390
powerful and kind of level the playing
field so it's so sad about events like

1852
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:05,400
field so it's so sad about events like
 

1853
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,870
field so it's so sad about events like
this is you see that fundamentally a lot

1854
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
this is you see that fundamentally a lot
 

1855
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,970
this is you see that fundamentally a lot
of the the power structures are the same

1856
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:10,980
of the the power structures are the same
 

1857
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,370
of the the power structures are the same
where the people at the top uh face

1858
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:13,380
where the people at the top uh face
 

1859
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,810
where the people at the top uh face
little repercussions for what they do

1860
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:14,820
little repercussions for what they do
 

1861
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,609
little repercussions for what they do
the people at the bottom are still

1862
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:16,619
the people at the bottom are still
 

1863
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,170
the people at the bottom are still
getting screwed the people at the bottom

1864

1870
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,220
do you think this really uh
 

1871
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,670
do you think this really uh
damage people trust in cryptocurrency

1872
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:28,680
damage people trust in cryptocurrency
 

1873
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,250
damage people trust in cryptocurrency
for sure way bigger than uh Luna way

1874

for sure way bigger than uh Luna way
 

1875
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,349
for sure way bigger than uh Luna way
bigger than three hours Capital it's

because of who SBF was it's not just the
dollar figure behind it it's because he

1880
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:39,300
dollar figure behind it it's because he
 

1881
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,349
dollar figure behind it it's because he
wooed so many of our media Elites who

endorsing something especially in the
 

2125
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,609
endorsing something especially in the
crypto space this is just why I don't do

2126
00:40:19,609 --> 00:40:19,619
crypto space this is just why I don't do
 

2127
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:21,230
crypto space this is just why I don't do
any deals in the crypto space ever

2128
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,240
any deals in the crypto space ever
 

2129
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,390
any deals in the crypto space ever
because it's impossible to know which

2130
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:23,400
because it's impossible to know which
 

2131
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,250
because it's impossible to know which
ones are going to be the like big hits

2132
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,260
ones are going to be the like big hits
 

2133
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,829
ones are going to be the like big hits
or the big frauds or you know whatever

2134
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
or the big frauds or you know whatever
 

2135
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,210
or the big frauds or you know whatever
um but if you're going to make that bet

2136
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:29,220
um but if you're going to make that bet
 

2137
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,190
um but if you're going to make that bet
if you're going to make that play you

2138
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
if you're going to make that play you
 

2139
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,510
if you're going to make that play you
would think

2140
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:32,520
would think
 

2141
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,490
would think
that you would do all the research in

2142
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:34,500
that you would do all the research in
 

2143
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,690
that you would do all the research in
the world and you would get

2144
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:35,700
the world and you would get
 

2145
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,150
the world and you would get
sophisticated looks at their liabilities

2146
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
sophisticated looks at their liabilities
 

2147
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,370
sophisticated looks at their liabilities
at how they were structured all that

2148
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:40,380
at how they were structured all that
 

2149
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,710
at how they were structured all that
stuff and that is the most shocking part

2150
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:42,720
stuff and that is the most shocking part
 

2151
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,650
stuff and that is the most shocking part
is not that you know people missed it

2152
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:45,660
is not that you know people missed it
 

2153
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,630
is not that you know people missed it
because you can miss fraud but that

2154
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:47,640
because you can miss fraud but that
 

2155
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,550
because you can miss fraud but that

right and all of these heuristics can

2202
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:41,820
right and all of these heuristics can
 

2203
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,569
right and all of these heuristics can
lead to Giant blind spots where you kind

2204
00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:44,579
lead to Giant blind spots where you kind
 

2205
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:46,430
lead to Giant blind spots where you kind
of just go oh we'll check like I don't

2206
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,440
of just go oh we'll check like I don't
 

2207
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,050
of just go oh we'll check like I don't
really it's a lot of energy to look into

2208
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:48,060
really it's a lot of energy to look into
 

2209
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:50,510
really it's a lot of energy to look into
people and if enough of those rules of

2210
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:50,520
people and if enough of those rules of
 

2211
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,950
people and if enough of those rules of
thumb are met we just kind of check them

2212
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:51,960
thumb are met we just kind of check them
 

2213
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,569
thumb are met we just kind of check them
off and put them through the system so

2214
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:53,579
off and put them through the system so
 

2215
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,030
off and put them through the system so
uh yeah it's been hugely exposing for

2216
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:56,040
uh yeah it's been hugely exposing for
 

2217
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,510
uh yeah it's been hugely exposing for
sort of like and you don't know maybe

2218
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
sort of like and you don't know maybe
 

2219
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,370
sort of like and you don't know maybe
how to look at for example there's a few

2220
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:01,380
how to look at for example there's a few
 

2221
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:03,589
how to look at for example there's a few
assumptions now there's a lot of people

2222
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
assumptions now there's a lot of people
 

2223
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,210
assumptions now there's a lot of people
are very skeptical of institutions of

2224
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:05,220
are very skeptical of institutions of
 

2225
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,609
are very skeptical of institutions of
government and so on but for um perhaps

2226
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:07,619
government and so on but for um perhaps
 

2227
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,550
government and so on but for um perhaps
too much so I agree but for some part of

2228
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
too much so I agree but for some part of
 

2229
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,310
too much so I agree but for some part of
history there was a too much faith in

2230
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:13,320
history there was a too much faith in
 

2231
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,490
history there was a too much faith in
government yeah and so uh right now I

2232
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:16,500
government yeah and so uh right now I
 

2233
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,990
government yeah and so uh right now I
think there's faith in certain large

2234
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:18,000
think there's faith in certain large
 

2235

think there's faith in certain large
companies there's distrust in certain

2313
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,550
ID what's what's going on here
uh is this was this used by SBF to give

2314
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
uh is this was this used by SBF to give
 

2315

himself a good Public Image or is there

2316
00:43:49,550 --> 00:43:49,560
himself a good Public Image or is there
 

2317
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,710
himself a good Public Image or is there
something about effective altruism that

2318
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:51,720
something about effective altruism that
 

2319
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,910
something about effective altruism that
makes it easy to misuse by bad people

2320
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:55,920
makes it easy to misuse by bad people
 

2321
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,470
makes it easy to misuse by bad people
what do you think yeah it's interesting

2322
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:57,480
what do you think yeah it's interesting
 

2323
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,750
what do you think yeah it's interesting
he could have endorsed a wide range of

2324
00:43:59,750 --> 00:43:59,760
he could have endorsed a wide range of
 

2325
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,609
he could have endorsed a wide range of
philosophies and I guess you just have

2326
00:44:01,609 --> 00:44:01,619
philosophies and I guess you just have
 

2327
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:02,750
philosophies and I guess you just have
to wonder

2328
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:02,760
to wonder
 

2329
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,790
to wonder
are all those would those philosophies

2330
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
are all those would those philosophies
 

2331
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,609
are all those would those philosophies
also be tainted if

2332
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:07,619
also be tainted if
 

2333
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:10,250
also be tainted if
um he had gone bad I guess effective

2334
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:10,260
um he had gone bad I guess effective
 

2335
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,930
um he had gone bad I guess effective
altruism is sort of unique because he

2336
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:11,940
altruism is sort of unique because he
 

2337
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,270
altruism is sort of unique because he
used it as part of his brand it wasn't

2338
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,280
used it as part of his brand it wasn't
 

2339
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,609
used it as part of his brand it wasn't
like he was he described himself as a

2340
00:44:16,609 --> 00:44:16,619
like he was he described himself as a
 

2341
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,829
like he was he described himself as a
consequentialist and like that ended up

2342
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:18,839
consequentialist and like that ended up
 

2343
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:21,410
consequentialist and like that ended up
mattering it was like he described

2344
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:21,420
mattering it was like he described
 

2345
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,329
mattering it was like he described
himself as an effective altruist and he

2346
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:23,339
himself as an effective altruist and he
 

2347
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:25,190
himself as an effective altruist and he
used that part of the brand to lift

2348
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
used that part of the brand to lift
 

2349
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,270
used that part of the brand to lift
himself up I guess that's why it's

2350
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:26,280
himself up I guess that's why it's
 

2351
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,370
himself up I guess that's why it's
getting so much scrutiny

2352
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:28,380
getting so much scrutiny
 

2353
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,890
getting so much scrutiny
um I think the merits of it should speak

2354
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:30,900
um I think the merits of it should speak
 

2355
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:32,690
um I think the merits of it should speak

about when I think about systems is that
 

2427
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,270
about when I think about systems is that
no system saves you from the individual

2428
00:46:02,270 --> 00:46:02,280
no system saves you from the individual

their intentions their their lust for

2432
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:08,460
their intentions their their lust for
 

2433
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,870
their intentions their their lust for
power or greed I mean I think one of the

2434
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:11,880
power or greed I mean I think one of the
 

2435
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,430
power or greed I mean I think one of the
great ideas

2436
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:13,440
great ideas
 

2437
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,910
great ideas
is the decentralization of power and

2438
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:16,920
is the decentralization of power and
 

2439
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,710
is the decentralization of power and
like this is why

2440
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
like this is why
 

2441
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,750
like this is why
I think democracies are so great is

2442
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:20,760
I think democracies are so great is
 

2443
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,470
I think democracies are so great is
because they decentralize power across a

2444
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,480
because they decentralize power across a
 

2445
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,710
because they decentralize power across a
wide range of like interests and groups

2446
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:27,720
wide range of like interests and groups
 

2447
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:30,230
wide range of like interests and groups
and that being an effective way to kind

2448
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:30,240
and that being an effective way to kind
 

2449
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:33,470
and that being an effective way to kind

00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:47,520
evil people sneak in to the top and
 

2513
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,210
evil people sneak in to the top and
start to abuse that power yeah I think

2514
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:50,220
start to abuse that power yeah I think
 

2515
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:52,309
start to abuse that power yeah I think
I mean I don't have a lot of probably

2516
00:47:52,309 --> 00:47:52,319
I mean I don't have a lot of probably
 

2517

I mean I don't have a lot of probably
big brain political takes but what I can

2518
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
big brain political takes but what I can
 

2519
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,290
big brain political takes but what I can
say is that you can never get away from

2520
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:57,300
say is that you can never get away from
 

2521
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,270
say is that you can never get away from
both the system and the individual

2522
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
both the system and the individual
 

2523
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,790
both the system and the individual
mattering for sure some systems

2524
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:01,800
mattering for sure some systems
 

2525
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,770
mattering for sure some systems
incentivize some behaviors in certain

2526
00:48:03,770 --> 00:48:03,780
incentivize some behaviors in certain
 

2527
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,930
incentivize some behaviors in certain
ways but some people will take that and

2528
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:05,940
ways but some people will take that and
 

2529
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,609
ways but some people will take that and
go okay all we need to do is design the

2530
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
go okay all we need to do is design the
 

2531
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,750
go okay all we need to do is design the
perfect system and then these

2532
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:08,760
perfect system and then these
 

2533
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,730
perfect system and then these
individuals will act completely

2534
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:10,740
individuals will act completely
 

2535
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:13,069
individuals will act completely
rationally or responsibly in accordance

2536
00:48:13,069 --> 00:48:13,079
rationally or responsibly in accordance
 

2537
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:14,690
rationally or responsibly in accordance
to what our incentives say that's not

2538
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:14,700
to what our incentives say that's not
 

2539
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,329
to what our incentives say that's not
true you could also say all we have to

2540
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:17,339
true you could also say all we have to
 

2541
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:19,730
true you could also say all we have to
do is focus on the individual and all we

2542
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:19,740
do is focus on the individual and all we
 

2543
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,050
do is focus on the individual and all we
have to do is just create a society

2544
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:21,060
have to do is just create a society
 

2545
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,089
have to do is just create a society
which raises very well-adjusted people

2546
00:48:23,089 --> 00:48:23,099
which raises very well-adjusted people
 

2547
00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:24,710
which raises very well-adjusted people
and then we can throw them into any

2548
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:24,720
and then we can throw them into any
 

2549
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,750
and then we can throw them into any
system with any incentives and they will

2550
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:26,760
system with any incentives and they will
 

2551
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,790
system with any incentives and they will
act like responsibly ethically morally

2552
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
act like responsibly ethically morally
 

2553
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,650
act like responsibly ethically morally
and I also don't think that's true so

2554
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:30,660
and I also don't think that's true so
 

2555
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,349
and I also don't think that's true so
incentives are real but also

2556
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:33,359
incentives are real but also
 

2557
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:35,630
incentives are real but also
the individual ultimately plays a large

2558
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:35,640
the individual ultimately plays a large
 

2559
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,670
the individual ultimately plays a large
role too so yeah I don't know I come

2560
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:37,680
role too so yeah I don't know I come
 

2561
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,530
role too so yeah I don't know I come
down sort of in the middle there and

2562
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:39,540
down sort of in the middle there and
 

2563
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:42,710
down sort of in the middle there and
some of that is just accidents of

2564
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:42,720
some of that is just accidents of
 

2565
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:44,510
some of that is just accidents of
History to which individuals finds which

2566
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:44,520
History to which individuals finds which
 

2567
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:47,089
History to which individuals finds which
system you know uh become the face of

2568
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:47,099
system you know uh become the face of
 

2569
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:50,390
system you know uh become the face of
that yeah with FTX versus uh coinbase

2570
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:50,400
that yeah with FTX versus uh coinbase
 

2571
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,710
that yeah with FTX versus uh coinbase
versus binance which individual would

2762
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:27,000
scammed people we have to go at least
 

2763
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,430
scammed people we have to go at least
make make it look like we're doing the

2764
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:28,440
make make it look like we're doing the
 

2765
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,290
make make it look like we're doing the
right thing right even just so that's on

2766
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:30,300
right thing right even just so that's on
 

2767
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,150
right thing right even just so that's on
the optic side but there's also tons of

2768
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
the optic side but there's also tons of
 

2769
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,150
the optic side but there's also tons of
people who now go oh the basically law

2770
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:35,160
people who now go oh the basically law
 

2771
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,190
people who now go oh the basically law
enforcement is on the scene we can't do

2772
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
enforcement is on the scene we can't do
 

2773
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,710
enforcement is on the scene we can't do
the same thing so there is a very

2774
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:39,720
the same thing so there is a very
 

2775
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:42,770
the same thing so there is a very
pragmatic reason to for this punishment

2776
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:42,780
pragmatic reason to for this punishment
 

2777
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,809
pragmatic reason to for this punishment
it's very much just because people work

2778
00:52:44,809 --> 00:52:44,819
it's very much just because people work
 

2779
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:46,730
it's very much just because people work
it into their math of should I commit

2780
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:46,740
it into their math of should I commit
 

2781
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,890
it into their math of should I commit
fraud and the last several years have

2782
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:48,900
fraud and the last several years have
 

2783
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,510
fraud and the last several years have
been very

2784
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,520
been very
 

2785
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:52,549
been very
um sort of has been like a little bit of

2786
00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:52,559
um sort of has been like a little bit of
 

2787
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:56,630
um sort of has been like a little bit of
a nihilistic landscape where no one was

2788
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
a nihilistic landscape where no one was
 

2789
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,130
a nihilistic landscape where no one was
getting punished and so there's this

2790
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,140
getting punished and so there's this
 

2791
00:52:58,140 --> 00:52:59,930
getting punished and so there's this
question of you're almost an idiot if

2792
00:52:59,930 --> 00:52:59,940
question of you're almost an idiot if
 

2793
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:01,670
question of you're almost an idiot if
you didn't take the deals

2794
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:01,680
you didn't take the deals
 

2795
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,049
you didn't take the deals
um so I think it's really important

2796
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:03,059
um so I think it's really important
 

2797
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:06,470
um so I think it's really important
extremely important for kind of law

2798
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
extremely important for kind of law
 

2799
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,530
extremely important for kind of law
enforcement to play a role regulation to

2800
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:09,540
enforcement to play a role regulation to
 

2801
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,910
enforcement to play a role regulation to
play a role to make it harder to commit

2802
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:10,920
play a role to make it harder to commit
 

2803
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,230
play a role to make it harder to commit
those crimes and if you commit those

2804
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
those crimes and if you commit those
 

2805
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,390
those crimes and if you commit those
crimes there's actual real world

2806
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:14,400
crimes there's actual real world
 

2807
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,130
crimes there's actual real world
punishment for it

2808
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:16,140
punishment for it
 

2809
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:17,630
punishment for it
to your point about like what's going to

00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:33,290
the dissolving of Enron so I mean I
can't imagine someone better equipped to

2826
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:33,300
can't imagine someone better equipped to
 

2827
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,809
can't imagine someone better equipped to
run a complicated corporate fraud like

2828
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:35,819
run a complicated corporate fraud like
 

2829
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:37,910
run a complicated corporate fraud like
dissolution but

2830
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
dissolution but
 

2831
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,890
dissolution but
yeah it's it's tough because everyone's

2832
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:39,900
yeah it's it's tough because everyone's
 

2833
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,930
yeah it's it's tough because everyone's
going to get probably I don't know 10

2834
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:41,940
going to get probably I don't know 10
 

2835
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:44,510
going to get probably I don't know 10
cents on the dollar maybe less I wonder

2836
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:44,520
cents on the dollar maybe less I wonder
 

2837
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:46,490
cents on the dollar maybe less I wonder
if there's a way to do a progressive

2838
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:46,500
if there's a way to do a progressive
 

2839
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,549
if there's a way to do a progressive
redistribution of funds so I just I'm

2840
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:49,559
redistribution of funds so I just I'm
 

2841
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,410
redistribution of funds so I just I'm
just really worried about the pain that

2842
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:51,420
just really worried about the pain that
 

2843
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,470
just really worried about the pain that
small investors feel I think yeah I

2844
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
small investors feel I think yeah I
 

2845
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,930
small investors feel I think yeah I
think um there's a lot of thought around

2846
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:56,940
think um there's a lot of thought around
 

2847
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:00,470
think um there's a lot of thought around
that I forget if

2848
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:00,480
that I forget if
 

2849
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,510
that I forget if
if they actually do do this I mean I

2850
00:54:02,510 --> 00:54:02,520
if they actually do do this I mean I
 

2851
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,250
if they actually do do this I mean I
know there's a lot of law about like you

2852
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:04,260
know there's a lot of law about like you
 

2853
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:05,569
know there's a lot of law about like you
can't treat

2854
00:54:05,569 --> 00:54:05,579
can't treat
 

2855
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,190
can't treat
creditors differently you have to treat

2856
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
creditors differently you have to treat
 

2857
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:10,069
creditors differently you have to treat
them all the same so I think it'll be

2858
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
them all the same so I think it'll be
 

2859
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,530
them all the same so I think it'll be
some kind of proportional payback it's

2860
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:12,540
some kind of proportional payback it's
 

2861
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,329
some kind of proportional payback it's
certainly not going to be that the guys

2862
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:14,339
certainly not going to be that the guys
 

2863
00:54:14,339 --> 00:54:16,069
certainly not going to be that the guys
at the top get you know a significant

2864
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
at the top get you know a significant
 

2865
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,930
at the top get you know a significant
amount of their money back and the rest

2866
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:17,940
amount of their money back and the rest
 

2867
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:19,910
amount of their money back and the rest
get nothing unfortunately I think

2868
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
get nothing unfortunately I think
 

2869
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,589
get nothing unfortunately I think
there's such a

2870
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
there's such a
 

2871
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,930
there's such a
small amount of assets that back this

2872
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:23,940
small amount of assets that back this
 

2873
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:26,930
small amount of assets that back this
whole thing in the end and that value is

2874
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:26,940
whole thing in the end and that value is
 

2875
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,030
whole thing in the end and that value is
actually declining every day because it

2876
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
actually declining every day because it
 

2877
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,910
actually declining every day because it
was inextricably tied to FBF it was like

2878
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
was inextricably tied to FBF it was like
 

2879
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,430
was inextricably tied to FBF it was like
the ftt tokens which now what are those

2880
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:34,440
the ftt tokens which now what are those
 

2881
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,770
the ftt tokens which now what are those
worth the serum tokens that was his

2882
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:36,780
worth the serum tokens that was his
 

2883
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,990
worth the serum tokens that was his
project or the project they made what is

2884
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:39,000
project or the project they made what is
 

2885
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,870
project or the project they made what is
that worth basically nothing so you know

2886
00:54:41,870 --> 00:54:41,880
that worth basically nothing so you know
 

2887
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,510
that worth basically nothing so you know
it's a very it's a hard situation and

2888
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:44,520
it's a very it's a hard situation and
 

2889
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,770
it's a very it's a hard situation and
you know there's a bigger ethical

2890
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780
you know there's a bigger ethical
 

2891
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,190
you know there's a bigger ethical
concern which is FTX us

2892
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:49,200
concern which is FTX us
 

2893
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,589
concern which is FTX us
it's unclear how backed it was but it

2894
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:51,599
it's unclear how backed it was but it
 

2895
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:53,630
it's unclear how backed it was but it
was clearly more backed than FTX

2896
00:54:53,630 --> 00:54:53,640
was clearly more backed than FTX
 

2897
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,950
was clearly more backed than FTX
International

2898
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:54,960
International
 

2899
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,170
International
do you take all that money and throw it

2900
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:57,180
do you take all that money and throw it
 

2901
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:58,790
do you take all that money and throw it
into a big pot and give people money

2902
00:54:58,790 --> 00:54:58,800
into a big pot and give people money
 

2903
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,569
into a big pot and give people money
back or do you give the US people back

2904
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:02,579
back or do you give the US people back
 

2905
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:04,250
back or do you give the US people back
their amount of money which is probably

2906
00:55:04,250 --> 00:55:04,260
their amount of money which is probably
 

2907
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,230
their amount of money which is probably
going to be significantly more and leave

2908
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
going to be significantly more and leave
 

2909
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,849
going to be significantly more and leave
everyone internationally out in the cold

2910
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:07,859
everyone internationally out in the cold
 

2911
00:55:07,859 --> 00:55:11,030
everyone internationally out in the cold
and to add to that ethical issue let's

2912
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:11,040
and to add to that ethical issue let's
 

2913
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,890
and to add to that ethical issue let's
say you're a liquidator and you're

2914
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:12,900
say you're a liquidator and you're
 

2915
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,150
say you're a liquidator and you're
us-based there's a tremendous question

2916
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:17,160
us-based there's a tremendous question
 

2917
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,549
us-based there's a tremendous question
like legal questions about you know how

2918
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:19,559
like legal questions about you know how
 

2919
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,049
like legal questions about you know how
do you ethically do that it's not it's

2920
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:21,059
do you ethically do that it's not it's
 

2921
00:55:21,059 --> 00:55:23,390
do you ethically do that it's not it's
not clear there's a tremendous incentive

2922
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:23,400
not clear there's a tremendous incentive
 

2923
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,670
not clear there's a tremendous incentive
to just favor the U.S people over

2924
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:25,680
to just favor the U.S people over
 

2925
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,930
to just favor the U.S people over
everyone else because it's our country

2926
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:26,940
everyone else because it's our country
 

2927
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,450
everyone else because it's our country
America whatever but um I don't know if

2928
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:29,460
America whatever but um I don't know if
 

2929
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,430
America whatever but um I don't know if
that's necessarily Fair it's it's really

2930
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:31,440
that's necessarily Fair it's it's really
 

2931
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,530
that's necessarily Fair it's it's really
hard it's like it's impossible and some

2932
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:33,540
hard it's like it's impossible and some
 

2933
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,290
hard it's like it's impossible and some
uh I forget where you said this but one

2934
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:36,300
uh I forget where you said this but one
 

2935
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,530
uh I forget where you said this but one
of the I mean it probably uh permeates a

2936
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:39,540
of the I mean it probably uh permeates a
 

2937
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,990
of the I mean it probably uh permeates a
lot of the investigations you do which

2938
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
lot of the investigations you do which
 

2939
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,569
lot of the investigations you do which
is this idea that it's really sad that

2940
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:44,579
is this idea that it's really sad that
 

2941
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:46,910
is this idea that it's really sad that
the middle class in most situations like

2942
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:46,920
the middle class in most situations like
 

2943
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:50,870
the middle class in most situations like
this get [\h__\h] over so the the IRS I'll

2944
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
this get [\h__\h] over so the the IRS I'll
 

2945
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,329
this get [\h__\h] over so the the IRS I'll
go after the middle class they'll go

2946
00:55:53,329 --> 00:55:53,339
go after the middle class they'll go
 

2947
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:56,150
go after the middle class they'll go
after the rich is basically everyone who

2948
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,160
after the rich is basically everyone who
 

2949
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,250
after the rich is basically everyone who
doesn't have a lot of Leverage in terms

2950
00:55:58,250 --> 00:55:58,260
doesn't have a lot of Leverage in terms
 

2951
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,270
doesn't have a lot of Leverage in terms
of lawyers money get [\h__\h] over

2952
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:02,280
of lawyers money get [\h__\h] over
 

2953
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:06,290
of lawyers money get [\h__\h] over
yes and then they're the ones like it's

2954
00:56:06,290 --> 00:56:06,300
yes and then they're the ones like it's
 

2955
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,849
yes and then they're the ones like it's
always the rich and Powerful who get the

2956
00:56:07,849 --> 00:56:07,859
always the rich and Powerful who get the
 

2957
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:09,470
always the rich and Powerful who get the
favorable treatment as it like a

2958
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:09,480
favorable treatment as it like a
 

2959
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,650
favorable treatment as it like a
microcosm of this funny story so

2960
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:12,660
microcosm of this funny story so
 

2961
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,170
microcosm of this funny story so
one of the big criticisms of crypto and

2962
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:15,180
one of the big criticisms of crypto and
 

2963
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:16,790
one of the big criticisms of crypto and
I think rightly so is the

2964
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:16,800
I think rightly so is the
 

2965
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,950
I think rightly so is the
irreversibility of the transaction so if

2966
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:18,960
irreversibility of the transaction so if
 

2967
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,109
irreversibility of the transaction so if
I accidentally send a transaction

2968
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
I accidentally send a transaction
 

2969
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,750
I accidentally send a transaction
somewhere it's gone right yeah so

2970
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:23,760
somewhere it's gone right yeah so
 

2971
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,450
somewhere it's gone right yeah so
crypto.com accidentally sent a lady 10

2972
00:56:26,450 --> 00:56:26,460
crypto.com accidentally sent a lady 10
 

2973
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:28,130
crypto.com accidentally sent a lady 10
million dollars

2974
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:28,140
million dollars
 

2975
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:29,690
million dollars
and now they want the money back and

2976
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:29,700
and now they want the money back and
 

2977
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,730
and now they want the money back and

I believe so
 

3017
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,410
I believe so
and that's in just another case of

3018
00:57:09,410 --> 00:57:09,420
and that's in just another case of
 

3019
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,510

a lot of money you know you do something
 

3949
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,390
a lot of money you know you do something
like that and it would be very

3950
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:35,400
like that and it would be very
 

3951
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,850
like that and it would be very
superficially like okay

3952
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:37,860
superficially like okay
 

3953
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:40,729
superficially like okay
but when you gr when you drill down to

3954
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:40,739
but when you gr when you drill down to

so we treat it as one big pool of funds

4000
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:18,840
so we treat it as one big pool of funds
 

4001
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:20,330
so we treat it as one big pool of funds
and that's sort of the explanation of

4002
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:20,340
and that's sort of the explanation of
 

4003
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:22,189
and that's sort of the explanation of
how this all happened is we had this

4004
01:14:22,189 --> 01:14:22,199
how this all happened is we had this
 

4005
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:23,990
how this all happened is we had this
huge leverage position and we lost

4006
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:24,000
huge leverage position and we lost
 

4007
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,010
huge leverage position and we lost
everything

4008
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:25,020
everything
 

4009
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,110
everything
but what no one has sort of done a good

4010
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:27,120
but what no one has sort of done a good
 

4011
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,630
but what no one has sort of done a good
enough job getting to the heart of is

4012
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:29,640
enough job getting to the heart of is
 

4013
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,910
enough job getting to the heart of is
that this pool of funds never was

4014
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:31,920
that this pool of funds never was
 

4015
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,310
that this pool of funds never was
segregated properly it was all treated

4016
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:34,320
segregated properly it was all treated
 

4017
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,110
segregated properly it was all treated
under the same umbrella of we can use

4018
01:14:36,110 --> 01:14:36,120
under the same umbrella of we can use
 

4019
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,990
under the same umbrella of we can use
your funds there was no amount of we

4020
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:39,000
your funds there was no amount of we
 

4021
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,090
your funds there was no amount of we

01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:48,290
margin trade or do anything over here
These funds over here we have saved they

4028
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:48,300
These funds over here we have saved they
 

4029
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,870
These funds over here we have saved they
didn't fundamentally they lied from the

4030
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:50,880
didn't fundamentally they lied from the
 

4031
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,510
didn't fundamentally they lied from the
get-go about how they were treating the

4032
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
get-go about how they were treating the
 

4033
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,729
get-go about how they were treating the
most precious assets which is your

4034
01:14:55,729 --> 01:14:55,739
most precious assets which is your
 

4035
01:14:55,739 --> 01:14:57,830
most precious assets which is your
customer deposits that you said you

4036
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
customer deposits that you said you
 

4037
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,110
customer deposits that you said you
didn't invest clearly you put them all

4038
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:00,120
didn't invest clearly you put them all
 

4039
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,450
didn't invest clearly you put them all
over here you YOLO gambled them and then

4040
01:15:02,450 --> 01:15:02,460
over here you YOLO gambled them and then
 

4041
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:04,669
over here you YOLO gambled them and then
when everyone starts withdrawing from

4042
01:15:04,669 --> 01:15:04,679
when everyone starts withdrawing from
 

4043
01:15:04,679 --> 01:15:06,830
when everyone starts withdrawing from
here they don't have any money over here

4044
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:06,840
here they don't have any money over here
 

4045
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,510
here they don't have any money over here
so that is like one of the most

4046
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:08,520
so that is like one of the most
 

4047
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:11,090
so that is like one of the most
fundamental things that I haven't seen

4048
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:11,100
fundamental things that I haven't seen
 

4049
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:13,430
fundamental things that I haven't seen
anyone Grill him on and uh the next time

4050
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:13,440
anyone Grill him on and uh the next time
 

4051
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,770
anyone Grill him on and uh the next time
if I get the chance to Ambush them again

4052
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:15,780
if I get the chance to Ambush them again
 

4053
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:16,910
if I get the chance to Ambush them again
that's that's what I'm going to drill

4054
01:15:16,910 --> 01:15:16,920
that's that's what I'm going to drill
 

4055
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:18,950
that's that's what I'm going to drill
down on because it's impossible for that

4056
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:18,960
down on because it's impossible for that
 

4057
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,050
down on because it's impossible for that
not to be fraud

4058
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:21,060
not to be fraud
 

4059
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:23,870
not to be fraud
there's no world where you had a pool of

4060
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:23,880
there's no world where you had a pool of
 

4061

funds over here and now you don't have
them without you somehow borrowing over

4064
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
them without you somehow borrowing over

4066
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:31,020
here because if you deposited one
 

4067

crypto's like five years in real life
 

4377
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:31,189
crypto's like five years in real life
um but it kind of gained a huge amount

4378

Moon how they were going to do this is

4384
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
Moon how they were going to do this is
 

4385
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:39,830
Moon how they were going to do this is
with sort of a sophisticated smart

4386
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
with sort of a sophisticated smart
 

4387
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,590
with sort of a sophisticated smart
contract idea where

there's I kind of have to explain the
 

4391
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:47,930
there's I kind of have to explain the
way some contracts get rug pulled per

coin space the altcoin space anything
like below Bitcoin ethereum and maybe

4400
01:21:57,290 --> 01:21:57,300
like below Bitcoin ethereum and maybe
 

4401
01:21:57,300 --> 01:21:59,689
like below Bitcoin ethereum and maybe
the top five or ten is kind of seen as

4402
01:21:59,689 --> 01:21:59,699
the top five or ten is kind of seen as
 

4403

know you don't know if they're the
 

4407
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:05,209
know you don't know if they're the
developers are going to become anything

4408
01:22:05,209 --> 01:22:05,219
developers are going to become anything
 

4409
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,790
developers are going to become anything
or not you're kind of like reading the

4410
01:22:07,790 --> 01:22:07,800
or not you're kind of like reading the
 

4411
01:22:07,800 --> 01:22:09,890
or not you're kind of like reading the
white paper trying to figure it out so

4412
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:09,900
white paper trying to figure it out so
 

4413
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:11,510
white paper trying to figure it out so
there's this big question about like how

4414
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
there's this big question about like how
 

4415
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,450
there's this big question about like how
can you get scammed how can back to the

4416
01:22:14,450 --> 01:22:14,460
can you get scammed how can back to the
 

4417
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,390
can you get scammed how can back to the
interests you don't want the developer

4418
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:17,400
interests you don't want the developer
 

4419
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:19,790
interests you don't want the developer
to have some like parachute cord where

4420
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:19,800
to have some like parachute cord where
 

4421
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,729
to have some like parachute cord where
they can pull all the money out so one

4422
01:22:22,729 --> 01:22:22,739
they can pull all the money out so one
 

4423
01:22:22,739 --> 01:22:25,010
they can pull all the money out so one
way this happens is that in

4424
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:25,020
way this happens is that in
 

4425
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,169
way this happens is that in
decentralized decentralized finance

4426
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:27,179
decentralized decentralized finance
 

4427
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:29,209
decentralized decentralized finance
there's something called the liquidity

4428
01:22:29,209 --> 01:22:29,219
there's something called the liquidity
 

4429
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:31,729
there's something called the liquidity
pool okay it's basically this big pot of

4430
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:31,739
pool okay it's basically this big pot of
 

4431
01:22:31,739 --> 01:22:33,770
pool okay it's basically this big pot of
money that allows people to trade

4432
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:33,780
money that allows people to trade
 

4433
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:36,530
money that allows people to trade
between two different currencies so

4434
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:36,540
between two different currencies so
 

4435
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:38,870
between two different currencies so
let's say like safe Moon and Bitcoin

4436
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:38,880
let's say like safe Moon and Bitcoin
 

4437
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,970
let's say like safe Moon and Bitcoin
right or ethereum or it's actually on

4438
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:40,980
right or ethereum or it's actually on
 

4439
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:44,149
right or ethereum or it's actually on
the binance smart chain so it'd be BNB

4440
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
the binance smart chain so it'd be BNB
 

4441
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,550
the binance smart chain so it'd be BNB
um and this pool of money can be

4442
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
um and this pool of money can be
 

4443
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,770
um and this pool of money can be
controlled by the developers in such a

4444
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:48,780
controlled by the developers in such a
 

4445
01:22:48,780 --> 01:22:51,169
controlled by the developers in such a
way they can steal it all right they can

4446
01:22:51,169 --> 01:22:51,179
way they can steal it all right they can
 

4447
01:22:51,179 --> 01:22:53,209
way they can steal it all right they can
just grab it I don't want to go too much

4448
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:53,219
just grab it I don't want to go too much
 

4449
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,229
just grab it I don't want to go too much
into details because I feel like I'll

4450
01:22:54,229 --> 01:22:54,239
into details because I feel like I'll
 

4451
01:22:54,239 --> 01:22:55,550
into details because I feel like I'll
lose people here but the point of safe

4452
01:22:55,550 --> 01:22:55,560
lose people here but the point of safe
 

4453
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,669
lose people here but the point of safe
moon was the core idea was we're locking

4454
01:22:58,669 --> 01:22:58,679
moon was the core idea was we're locking
 

4455
01:22:58,679 --> 01:22:59,930
moon was the core idea was we're locking
this money up

4456
01:22:59,930 --> 01:22:59,940
this money up
 

4457
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:02,870
this money up
you can't touch it and actually every

4458
01:23:02,870 --> 01:23:02,880
you can't touch it and actually every
 

4459
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,270
you can't touch it and actually every
transaction that you buy safe moon with

4460
01:23:05,270 --> 01:23:05,280
transaction that you buy safe moon with
 

4461
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:07,250
transaction that you buy safe moon with
will take a five percent tax of that

4462
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:07,260
will take a five percent tax of that
 

4463
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:09,890
will take a five percent tax of that
we'll do a 10 tax but five percent of it

4464
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:09,900
we'll do a 10 tax but five percent of it
 

4465
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,350
we'll do a 10 tax but five percent of it
will go back to all the holders of safe

4466
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:12,360
will go back to all the holders of safe
 

4467
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,990
will go back to all the holders of safe
Moon okay and five percent of it will go

4468
01:23:14,990 --> 01:23:15,000
Moon okay and five percent of it will go
 

4469
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:16,729
Moon okay and five percent of it will go
back into this little pool of money okay

4470
01:23:16,729 --> 01:23:16,739
back into this little pool of money okay
 

4471
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:20,030
back into this little pool of money okay
so the idea is as you trade as this

4472
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:20,040
so the idea is as you trade as this
 

4473
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,189
so the idea is as you trade as this
token becomes more viral

4474
01:23:22,189 --> 01:23:22,199
token becomes more viral
 

4475
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:24,110
token becomes more viral
two things will happen one the people

4476
01:23:24,110 --> 01:23:24,120
two things will happen one the people
 

4477
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:25,729
two things will happen one the people
who are holding it long term will be

4478
01:23:25,729 --> 01:23:25,739
who are holding it long term will be
 

4479
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:27,169
who are holding it long term will be
rewarded for holding it long term by

4480
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,179
rewarded for holding it long term by
 

4481
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:28,970
rewarded for holding it long term by
receiving this five percent tax that's

4482
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:28,980
receiving this five percent tax that's
 

4483
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:31,490
receiving this five percent tax that's
distributed to everyone and two you can

4484
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:31,500
distributed to everyone and two you can
 

4485
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,649
distributed to everyone and two you can
kind of trust that your your money's

4486
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:33,659
kind of trust that your your money's
 

4487

gonna have this stable value because

4488
01:23:35,149 --> 01:23:35,159
gonna have this stable value because
 

4489
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:37,010
gonna have this stable value because
this pool of money here in the middle

4490
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:37,020
this pool of money here in the middle
 

4491
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:38,930
this pool of money here in the middle
that's kind of guaranteeing you can get

4492
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:38,940
that's kind of guaranteeing you can get
 

4493
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:40,850
that's kind of guaranteeing you can get
your safe Moon out into this actually

4494
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:40,860
your safe Moon out into this actually
 

4495
01:23:40,860 --> 01:23:44,510
your safe Moon out into this actually
valuable currency it's not going to move

4496
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:44,520
valuable currency it's not going to move
 

4497
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:46,790
valuable currency it's not going to move
so the story of safe moon was that

4498
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:46,800
so the story of safe moon was that
 

4499
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,490
so the story of safe moon was that
fundamentally this was not the case uh

4500
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:49,500
fundamentally this was not the case uh
 

4501
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:51,050
fundamentally this was not the case uh
they promised that this money was going

4502
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:51,060
they promised that this money was going
 

4503
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,490
they promised that this money was going
to be locked up it was not actually

4504
01:23:52,490 --> 01:23:52,500
to be locked up it was not actually
 

4505
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:53,689
to be locked up it was not actually
locked up at all they said it was

4506
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:53,699
locked up at all they said it was
 

4507
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:54,890
locked up at all they said it was
automatically locked up you don't have

4508
01:23:54,890 --> 01:23:54,900
automatically locked up you don't have
 

4509
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,330
automatically locked up you don't have
to worry about it well it was very

4510
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:56,340
to worry about it well it was very
 

4511
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:57,830
to worry about it well it was very
manually locked up and they didn't

4512
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
manually locked up and they didn't
 

4513
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,870
manually locked up and they didn't
actually lock a lot of it up

4514
01:23:59,870 --> 01:23:59,880
actually lock a lot of it up
 

4515
01:23:59,880 --> 01:24:01,669
actually lock a lot of it up
um they took a lot of it for themselves

4516
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
um they took a lot of it for themselves
 

4517
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:04,130
um they took a lot of it for themselves
for the developers so there's a lot of

4518
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,140
for the developers so there's a lot of
 

4519
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:05,810
for the developers so there's a lot of
players in this

4520
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:05,820
players in this
 

4521
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,669
players in this
um some of the a lot of them have left

4522
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:07,679
um some of the a lot of them have left

process
 

5061
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:04,370
process
so

5062
01:34:04,370 --> 01:34:04,380
so
 

5063
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:06,649
so
if I use different cryptocurrencies some

5064
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:06,659
if I use different cryptocurrencies some
 

5065
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:08,209
if I use different cryptocurrencies some
of them are like really fast some of

5066
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:08,219
of them are like really fast some of
 

5067
01:34:08,219 --> 01:34:10,370
of them are like really fast some of
them have really low fees I just believe

them have really low fees I just believe
 

5069
01:34:10,380 --> 01:34:12,290

it's just that the blockchain is the
 

5083
01:34:27,420 --> 01:34:29,450
it's just that the blockchain is the

go through this complicated system of
 

5089
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:37,250
go through this complicated system of
wire transfers and just happens so I can

5090
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:37,260
wire transfers and just happens so I can
 

5091
01:34:37,260 --> 01:34:38,810
wire transfers and just happens so I can
send you let's say I want to send you

International payments kind of idea so I

5110
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,360
International payments kind of idea so I
 

5111
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:05,870
International payments kind of idea so I
think at like its core if the the lowest

5112
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:05,880
think at like its core if the the lowest
 

5113

form use case of cryptocurrencies is

5114
01:35:07,850 --> 01:35:07,860
form use case of cryptocurrencies is
 

5115
01:35:07,860 --> 01:35:10,550
form use case of cryptocurrencies is
that I think it will

5116
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:10,560
that I think it will
 

5117
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,709
that I think it will
um change the world in some variety it's

5118

01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:14,219
just kind of the larger question is is
 

5121
01:35:14,219 --> 01:35:15,830
just kind of the larger question is is
that gonna is that technology going to

there's narratives that pull you and
 

5933
01:50:24,119 --> 01:50:26,570
there's narratives that pull you and
what I think a great journalist does is

5934
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:26,580
what I think a great journalist does is
 

5935
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:29,570
what I think a great journalist does is
make enemies and plus size and walk

5936
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:29,580
make enemies and plus size and walk
 

5937
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:31,850
make enemies and plus size and walk
through through that fire and not get

5938
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:31,860
through through that fire and not get
 

5939
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:34,669
through through that fire and not get
pulled in to the protection of anyone's

5940
01:50:34,669 --> 01:50:34,679
pulled in to the protection of anyone's
 

5941
01:50:34,679 --> 01:50:37,250
pulled in to the protection of anyone's
side because it gets so harshly attacked

5942
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:37,260
side because it gets so harshly attacked
 

5943
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:38,930
side because it gets so harshly attacked
anytime they deviate from the center

5944
01:50:38,930 --> 01:50:38,940
anytime they deviate from the center
 

5945
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:41,510
anytime they deviate from the center
well and I think also like

5946
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
well and I think also like
 

5947
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,850
well and I think also like
there's a criticism of all centrists

5948
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:43,860
there's a criticism of all centrists
 

5949
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:45,950
there's a criticism of all centrists
which I think in some way is fair and I

5950
01:50:45,950 --> 01:50:45,960
which I think in some way is fair and I
 

5951
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:47,570
which I think in some way is fair and I
say that to someone largely who's this

5952
01:50:47,570 --> 01:50:47,580
say that to someone largely who's this
 

5953
01:50:47,580 --> 01:50:49,430
say that to someone largely who's this
interest which is that this what about

5954
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:49,440
interest which is that this what about
 

5955
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:51,709
interest which is that this what about
is or like this like what about the left

5956
01:50:51,709 --> 01:50:51,719
is or like this like what about the left
 

5957
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:54,350
is or like this like what about the left
or what about the right can skew

5958
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:54,360
or what about the right can skew
 

5959
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:56,570
or what about the right can skew
when it's not a one it's not a both

5960
01:50:56,570 --> 01:50:56,580
when it's not a one it's not a both
 

5961
01:50:56,580 --> 01:50:57,790
when it's not a one it's not a both
sides issue

5962
01:50:57,790 --> 01:50:57,800
sides issue
 

5963
01:50:57,800 --> 01:51:01,609
sides issue
so in the case of like Russia Ukraine I

5964
01:51:01,609 --> 01:51:01,619
so in the case of like Russia Ukraine I
 

5965
01:51:01,619 --> 01:51:03,590
so in the case of like Russia Ukraine I
think like I'm strongly in favor of

5966
01:51:03,590 --> 01:51:03,600
think like I'm strongly in favor of
 

5967
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:05,689
think like I'm strongly in favor of
Ukraine even though I tend to go like on

5968
01:51:05,689 --> 01:51:05,699
Ukraine even though I tend to go like on
 

5969
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:06,830
Ukraine even though I tend to go like on
both sides and that might be partly

5970
01:51:06,830 --> 01:51:06,840
both sides and that might be partly
 

5971
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:09,770
both sides and that might be partly
because one of my employees is Ukrainian

5972
01:51:09,770 --> 01:51:09,780
because one of my employees is Ukrainian
 

5973
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:11,570
because one of my employees is Ukrainian
um and I think

5974
01:51:11,570 --> 01:51:11,580
um and I think
 

5975
01:51:11,580 --> 01:51:13,970
um and I think
what a great journalist does especially

5976
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:13,980
what a great journalist does especially
 

5977
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,310
what a great journalist does especially
like in politics is I think they

5978
01:51:16,310 --> 01:51:16,320
like in politics is I think they
 

5979
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:17,570
like in politics is I think they
criticize

5980
01:51:17,570 --> 01:51:17,580
criticize
 

5981
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:20,450
criticize
the regime that's most in Power most

5982
01:51:20,450 --> 01:51:20,460
the regime that's most in Power most
 

5983
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,850
the regime that's most in Power most
controls the keys and is the most

5984
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:22,860
controls the keys and is the most
 

5985
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,729
controls the keys and is the most
corrupt at that time and they might

5986
01:51:25,729 --> 01:51:25,739
corrupt at that time and they might
 

5987
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:27,890
corrupt at that time and they might
appear to be like let's say during the

5988
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:27,900
appear to be like let's say during the
 

5989
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:29,570
appear to be like let's say during the
realm of trump

5990
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:29,580
realm of trump
 

5991
01:51:29,580 --> 01:51:31,550

5993
01:51:31,560 --> 01:51:33,709
a great journalist would criticize Trump
but that same journalist who held

01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:35,330
but that same journalist who held
Trump's feet to the fire should be

5996
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:35,340
Trump's feet to the fire should be
 

5997
01:51:35,340 --> 01:51:37,129
Trump's feet to the fire should be
capable of holding Biden's feet to the

5998
01:51:37,129 --> 01:51:37,139
capable of holding Biden's feet to the
 

5999
01:51:37,139 --> 01:51:39,530
capable of holding Biden's feet to the
fire four years later if that kind of

6000
01:51:39,530 --> 01:51:39,540
fire four years later if that kind of
 

6001

was that day and

6256
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:29,100
was that day and
 

6257
01:56:29,100 --> 01:56:30,950
was that day and
I was once again fascinated I didn't

6258
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:30,960
I was once again fascinated I didn't
 

6259
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:32,209
I was once again fascinated I didn't
know what I was looking at but I was

6260
01:56:32,209 --> 01:56:32,219
know what I was looking at but I was
 

6261
01:56:32,219 --> 01:56:34,129
know what I was looking at but I was
like what is this weird game we're all

6262
01:56:34,129 --> 01:56:34,139
like what is this weird game we're all
 

6263
01:56:34,139 --> 01:56:36,050
like what is this weird game we're all
playing where we sit in this room we're

6264
01:56:36,050 --> 01:56:36,060
playing where we sit in this room we're
 

6265
01:56:36,060 --> 01:56:37,970
playing where we sit in this room we're
looking at the speaker who says he's so

6266
01:56:37,970 --> 01:56:37,980
looking at the speaker who says he's so
 

6267
01:56:37,980 --> 01:56:40,129
looking at the speaker who says he's so
successful right but why is he taking a

6268
01:56:40,129 --> 01:56:40,139
successful right but why is he taking a
 

6269
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:42,770
successful right but why is he taking a
Friday or a Saturday to do this you know

6270
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:42,780
Friday or a Saturday to do this you know
 

6271
01:56:42,780 --> 01:56:44,330
Friday or a Saturday to do this you know
pitch at night and they're going to

6272
01:56:44,330 --> 01:56:44,340
pitch at night and they're going to
 

6273
01:56:44,340 --> 01:56:45,470
pitch at night and they're going to
telling me I'm going to be financially

6274
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:45,480
telling me I'm going to be financially
 

6275
01:56:45,480 --> 01:56:46,550
telling me I'm going to be financially
free but they're working on their

6276
01:56:46,550 --> 01:56:46,560
free but they're working on their
 

6277
01:56:46,560 --> 01:56:48,410
free but they're working on their
Saturday and Sunday and so it's like how

6278
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:48,420
Saturday and Sunday and so it's like how
 

6279
01:56:48,420 --> 01:56:50,209
Saturday and Sunday and so it's like how
financially free are they so just like

6280
01:56:50,209 --> 01:56:50,219
financially free are they so just like
 

6281
01:56:50,219 --> 01:56:51,649
financially free are they so just like
confused I was like you know none of my

6282
01:56:51,649 --> 01:56:51,659
confused I was like you know none of my
 

6283
01:56:51,659 --> 01:56:52,910
confused I was like you know none of my
friends were Rich they all said they

6284
01:56:52,910 --> 01:56:52,920
friends were Rich they all said they
 

6285
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:54,169
friends were Rich they all said they
were going to be rich no one ever seemed

6286
01:56:54,169 --> 01:56:54,179
were going to be rich no one ever seemed
 

6287
01:56:54,179 --> 01:56:56,990
were going to be rich no one ever seemed
to get rich and so I was sort of baffled

6288
01:56:56,990 --> 01:56:57,000
to get rich and so I was sort of baffled
 

6289
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,149
to get rich and so I was sort of baffled
by what I was looking at later I

6290
01:56:59,149 --> 01:56:59,159
by what I was looking at later I
 

6291
01:56:59,159 --> 01:57:01,189
by what I was looking at later I
graduate I had no interest in doing

6292
01:57:01,189 --> 01:57:01,199
graduate I had no interest in doing
 

6293
01:57:01,199 --> 01:57:03,169
graduate I had no interest in doing
engineering which we can kind of get

6294
01:57:03,169 --> 01:57:03,179
engineering which we can kind of get
 

6295
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:06,350
engineering which we can kind of get
into but I want to do something in media

6296
01:57:06,350 --> 01:57:06,360
into but I want to do something in media
 

6297
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:08,090
into but I want to do something in media
um and I started covering a variety of

6298
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:08,100
um and I started covering a variety of
 

6299
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,609
um and I started covering a variety of
topics but eventually I sort of

6300
01:57:10,609 --> 01:57:10,619
topics but eventually I sort of
 

6301
01:57:10,619 --> 01:57:12,470
topics but eventually I sort of
Revisited this interest in fraud and I

6302
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:12,480
Revisited this interest in fraud and I
 

6303
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,510
Revisited this interest in fraud and I
started talking about these kind of get

6304
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:14,520
started talking about these kind of get
 

6305
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,129
started talking about these kind of get
rich quick grifters that were online

6306
01:57:16,129 --> 01:57:16,139
rich quick grifters that were online
 

6307
01:57:16,139 --> 01:57:18,950
rich quick grifters that were online
sort of the the Tai Lopez variety you

6308
01:57:18,950 --> 01:57:18,960
sort of the the Tai Lopez variety you
 

6309
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:20,810

quick schemes that a lot of people were

6316
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:26,520
quick schemes that a lot of people were
 

6317
01:57:26,520 --> 01:57:28,490
quick schemes that a lot of people were
interested in no one seemed to get rich

6318
01:57:28,490 --> 01:57:28,500
interested in no one seemed to get rich
 

6319
01:57:28,500 --> 01:57:30,169
interested in no one seemed to get rich
once again except for the people at the

6320
01:57:30,169 --> 01:57:30,179
once again except for the people at the
 

6321
01:57:30,179 --> 01:57:32,149
once again except for the people at the
tippity tippity top selling the get rich

6322
01:57:32,149 --> 01:57:32,159
tippity tippity top selling the get rich
 

6323
01:57:32,159 --> 01:57:34,250
tippity tippity top selling the get rich
quick thing and I was like fascinated by

6324
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:34,260
quick thing and I was like fascinated by
 

6325
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:35,450
quick thing and I was like fascinated by
the structure of it I was like does

6326
01:57:35,450 --> 01:57:35,460
the structure of it I was like does
 

6327
01:57:35,460 --> 01:57:37,609
the structure of it I was like does
nobody see what this is like does nobody

6328
01:57:37,609 --> 01:57:37,619
nobody see what this is like does nobody
 

6329
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:39,589
nobody see what this is like does nobody
get it so I started making a series of

6330
01:57:39,589 --> 01:57:39,599
get it so I started making a series of
 

6331
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:41,930
get it so I started making a series of
videos on that and the response was like

6332
01:57:41,930 --> 01:57:41,940
videos on that and the response was like
 

6333
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,550
videos on that and the response was like
palpable I mean it was like I've made a

6334
01:57:43,550 --> 01:57:43,560
palpable I mean it was like I've made a
 

6335
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:45,169
palpable I mean it was like I've made a
lot of stuff before that I had made

6336
01:57:45,169 --> 01:57:45,179
lot of stuff before that I had made
 

6337
01:57:45,179 --> 01:57:47,510
lot of stuff before that I had made
stuff that got a million views I'd had

6338
01:57:47,510 --> 01:57:47,520
stuff that got a million views I'd had
 

6339
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,510
stuff that got a million views I'd had
like some marginal success but the

6340
01:57:50,510 --> 01:57:50,520
like some marginal success but the
 

6341
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:53,209
like some marginal success but the
response of like the emails that came in

6342
01:57:53,209 --> 01:57:53,219
response of like the emails that came in
 

6343
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:55,910
response of like the emails that came in
the I could tell this work even though

6344
01:57:55,910 --> 01:57:55,920
the I could tell this work even though
 

6345
01:57:55,920 --> 01:57:59,089
the I could tell this work even though
it had far less views at the time was

6346
01:57:59,089 --> 01:57:59,099
it had far less views at the time was
 

6347
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:00,470
it had far less views at the time was
having a different level of impact

6348
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:00,480
having a different level of impact
 

6349
01:58:00,480 --> 01:58:02,450
having a different level of impact
that's what I was really interested in

6350
01:58:02,450 --> 01:58:02,460
that's what I was really interested in
 

6351
01:58:02,460 --> 01:58:05,390
that's what I was really interested in
one of my problems with engineering was

6352
01:58:05,390 --> 01:58:05,400
one of my problems with engineering was
 

6353
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,550
one of my problems with engineering was
from my standpoint I did chemical

6354
01:58:07,550 --> 01:58:07,560
from my standpoint I did chemical
 

6355
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,470
from my standpoint I did chemical
engineering at Texas A M

6356
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:09,480
engineering at Texas A M
 

6357
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,390
engineering at Texas A M
and like I was like is my future just

6358
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:11,400
and like I was like is my future just
 

6359
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:12,350
and like I was like is my future just
going to be in a chemical plant

6360
01:58:12,350 --> 01:58:12,360
going to be in a chemical plant
 

6361
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:14,209
going to be in a chemical plant
improving some process by two percent

6362
01:58:14,209 --> 01:58:14,219
improving some process by two percent
 

6363
01:58:14,219 --> 01:58:16,609
improving some process by two percent
and it's like my gift to the world like

6364
01:58:16,609 --> 01:58:16,619
and it's like my gift to the world like
 

6365
01:58:16,619 --> 01:58:19,609
and it's like my gift to the world like
I just I didn't see the hard impact and

6366
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:19,619
I just I didn't see the hard impact and
 

6367
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:21,410
I just I didn't see the hard impact and
that maybe that's a lack of imagination

6368
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:21,420
that maybe that's a lack of imagination
 

6369
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:24,530
that maybe that's a lack of imagination
because chemicals matter but I needed I

6370
01:58:24,530 --> 01:58:24,540
because chemicals matter but I needed I
 

6371
01:58:24,540 --> 01:58:26,810
because chemicals matter but I needed I
wanted to see an impact in the world and

6372
01:58:26,810 --> 01:58:26,820
wanted to see an impact in the world and
 

6373
01:58:26,820 --> 01:58:28,550
wanted to see an impact in the world and
so when like I did started doing this

6374
01:58:28,550 --> 01:58:28,560
so when like I did started doing this
 

6375
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,229
so when like I did started doing this
fraud stuff exposing fraud I like

6376
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:30,239
fraud stuff exposing fraud I like
 

6377
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:32,330
fraud stuff exposing fraud I like
clicked in my brain I was like whoa this

6378
01:58:32,330 --> 01:58:32,340
clicked in my brain I was like whoa this
 

6379
01:58:32,340 --> 01:58:35,089
clicked in my brain I was like whoa this
is kind of doing what I want to do and

6380
01:58:35,089 --> 01:58:35,099
is kind of doing what I want to do and
 

6381
01:58:35,099 --> 01:58:38,270
is kind of doing what I want to do and
so I started posting videos at first it

6382
01:58:38,270 --> 01:58:38,280
so I started posting videos at first it
 

6383
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:40,250
so I started posting videos at first it
really focused on like get rich quick

6384
01:58:40,250 --> 01:58:40,260
really focused on like get rich quick
 

6385
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:43,070
really focused on like get rich quick
scheme grifty advertising which I think

6386
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:43,080
scheme grifty advertising which I think
 

6387
01:58:43,080 --> 01:58:44,990
scheme grifty advertising which I think
is super predatory and we can go into

6388
01:58:44,990 --> 01:58:45,000
is super predatory and we can go into
 

6389
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,169
is super predatory and we can go into
why but um it eventually graduated to

6390
01:58:48,169 --> 01:58:48,179
why but um it eventually graduated to
 

6391
01:58:48,179 --> 01:58:49,490
why but um it eventually graduated to
crypto and

6392
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:49,500
crypto and
 

6393
01:58:49,500 --> 01:58:51,470
crypto and
it's snowballed I guess because now

6394
01:58:51,470 --> 01:58:51,480

to incentivize me to get other salesmen
 

6549
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:41,570
to incentivize me to get other salesmen
because when I get another salesman I'm

because when I get another salesman I'm
 

6551

because when I get another salesman I'm
actually giving myself competition so

actually giving myself competition so
 

6553
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,649
actually giving myself competition so
that's bad so to incentivize me to do

6554
02:01:45,649 --> 02:01:45,659
that's bad so to incentivize me to do
 

6555
02:01:45,659 --> 02:01:47,330
that's bad so to incentivize me to do
that they'll pay me part of what you

6556

whatever so it goes down the line of you

6566
02:01:57,649 --> 02:01:57,659
whatever so it goes down the line of you
 

6567
02:01:57,659 --> 02:01:59,149
whatever so it goes down the line of you
create multiple levels where you can

6568
02:01:59,149 --> 02:01:59,159
create multiple levels where you can

profit from their marketing right
 

6571
02:02:01,619 --> 02:02:04,430
profit from their marketing right
the problem with this system is that

6572
02:02:04,430 --> 02:02:04,440
the problem with this system is that
 

6573
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:07,189
the problem with this system is that
however well-intentioned it is is that

6574
02:02:07,189 --> 02:02:07,199
however well-intentioned it is is that
 

6575
02:02:07,199 --> 02:02:10,310
however well-intentioned it is is that
usually the emphasis of that selling and

6576
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:10,320
usually the emphasis of that selling and
 

6577
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:12,830
usually the emphasis of that selling and
making money ends up not being about the

6578
02:02:12,830 --> 02:02:12,840
making money ends up not being about the
 

6579
02:02:12,840 --> 02:02:14,990
making money ends up not being about the
product at all and ends up entirely

6580
02:02:14,990 --> 02:02:15,000
product at all and ends up entirely
 

6581
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,910
product at all and ends up entirely
being about recruiting new people to

6582
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:16,920
being about recruiting new people to
 

6583
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,410
being about recruiting new people to
recruit new people to recruit new people

6584
02:02:18,410 --> 02:02:18,420
recruit new people to recruit new people
 

6585
02:02:18,420 --> 02:02:20,089
recruit new people to recruit new people
that's the real way to make money in

6586
02:02:20,089 --> 02:02:20,099
that's the real way to make money in
 

6587
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:22,550
that's the real way to make money in
multi-level marketing this is where the

6588
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
multi-level marketing this is where the
 

6589
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,250
multi-level marketing this is where the
very true criticism of most multi-level

6590
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:25,260
very true criticism of most multi-level
 

6591
02:02:25,260 --> 02:02:27,530
very true criticism of most multi-level
marketing if not all are pyramid schemes

6592
02:02:27,530 --> 02:02:27,540
marketing if not all are pyramid schemes
 

6593
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,450
marketing if not all are pyramid schemes
in structure because what a pyramid

6594
02:02:29,450 --> 02:02:29,460
in structure because what a pyramid
 

6595
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:32,570
in structure because what a pyramid
scheme is is it's all about I put in 500

6596
02:02:32,570 --> 02:02:32,580
scheme is is it's all about I put in 500
 

6597
02:02:32,580 --> 02:02:34,729
scheme is is it's all about I put in 500
and I recruit two people to put in 500

6598
02:02:34,729 --> 02:02:34,739
and I recruit two people to put in 500
 

6599
02:02:34,739 --> 02:02:36,589
and I recruit two people to put in 500
and that comes up to me and they put in

6600
02:02:36,589 --> 02:02:36,599
and that comes up to me and they put in
 

6601
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,510
and that comes up to me and they put in
they get two people to put in 500 and it

6602
02:02:38,510 --> 02:02:38,520
they get two people to put in 500 and it
 

6603
02:02:38,520 --> 02:02:40,250
they get two people to put in 500 and it
goes to them and the reason it's a it's

6604
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:40,260
goes to them and the reason it's a it's
 

6605
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:42,229
goes to them and the reason it's a it's
a flawed business model is in order for

6606
02:02:42,229 --> 02:02:42,239
a flawed business model is in order for
 

6607
02:02:42,239 --> 02:02:43,310
a flawed business model is in order for
it to work and everyone to make money

6608
02:02:43,310 --> 02:02:43,320
it to work and everyone to make money
 

6609
02:02:43,320 --> 02:02:45,229
it to work and everyone to make money
you'd have to assume an infinite human

6610
02:02:45,229 --> 02:02:45,239
you'd have to assume an infinite human
 

6611
02:02:45,239 --> 02:02:47,930
you'd have to assume an infinite human
race and so that's not the case most

6612
02:02:47,930 --> 02:02:47,940
race and so that's not the case most
 

6613
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,189
race and so that's not the case most
people end up getting screwed in

6614
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:49,199
people end up getting screwed in
 

6615
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:50,930
people end up getting screwed in
multi-level marketing and in pyramid

6616
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:50,940
multi-level marketing and in pyramid
 

6617
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:51,830
multi-level marketing and in pyramid
schemes

6618
02:02:51,830 --> 02:02:51,840
schemes
 

6619
02:02:51,840 --> 02:02:53,930
schemes
that's what that is that's that thing

6620
02:02:53,930 --> 02:02:53,940
that's what that is that's that thing
 

6621
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,790
that's what that is that's that thing
and the quality of the product it

6622
02:02:55,790 --> 02:02:55,800
and the quality of the product it
 

6623
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:56,990
and the quality of the product it
doesn't necessarily matter where you're

6624
02:02:56,990 --> 02:02:57,000
doesn't necessarily matter where you're
 

6625
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:58,790
doesn't necessarily matter where you're
selling to people who are financially

6626
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
selling to people who are financially
 

6627
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:01,790
selling to people who are financially
incentivized to like buy this thing yeah

6628
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:01,800
incentivized to like buy this thing yeah
 

6629
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:03,770
incentivized to like buy this thing yeah
and so you're um

6630
02:03:03,770 --> 02:03:03,780
and so you're um
 

6631
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:05,510
and so you're um
you're selling the dream of becoming

6632
02:03:05,510 --> 02:03:05,520
you're selling the dream of becoming
 

6633
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:07,669
you're selling the dream of becoming
rich yes to the people down in the

6634
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:07,679
rich yes to the people down in the
 

6635
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,290
rich yes to the people down in the
pyramid that's the real product of

6636
02:03:09,290 --> 02:03:09,300
pyramid that's the real product of
 

6637
02:03:09,300 --> 02:03:11,930
pyramid that's the real product of
multi-level marketing unfortunately

6638
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:11,940
multi-level marketing unfortunately
 

6639
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:13,729
multi-level marketing unfortunately
um and so you look at the statistics of

6640
02:03:13,729 --> 02:03:13,739
um and so you look at the statistics of
 

6641
02:03:13,739 --> 02:03:16,310
um and so you look at the statistics of
these companies and although they'll

6642
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,320
these companies and although they'll
 

6643
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:18,350
these companies and although they'll
make it seem like it's so easy to be the

6644
02:03:18,350 --> 02:03:18,360
make it seem like it's so easy to be the
 

6645
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,209
make it seem like it's so easy to be the
top you know point one percent who's

6646
02:03:20,209 --> 02:03:20,219
top you know point one percent who's
 

6647
02:03:20,219 --> 02:03:22,430
top you know point one percent who's
making all this money the statistics are

6648
02:03:22,430 --> 02:03:22,440
making all this money the statistics are
 

6649
02:03:22,440 --> 02:03:25,910
making all this money the statistics are
that 97 make less than a minimum wage

6650
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
that 97 make less than a minimum wage
 

6651
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,950
that 97 make less than a minimum wage
doing this they spend an enormous amount

6652
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:27,960
doing this they spend an enormous amount
 

6653
02:03:27,960 --> 02:03:29,930
doing this they spend an enormous amount
of time and just what's so cruel about

6654
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:29,940
of time and just what's so cruel about
 

6655
02:03:29,940 --> 02:03:32,570
of time and just what's so cruel about
it is that's not advertised up front I

6656
02:03:32,570 --> 02:03:32,580
it is that's not advertised up front I
 

6657
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:33,890
it is that's not advertised up front I
mean it's like if I go at work at

6658
02:03:33,890 --> 02:03:33,900
mean it's like if I go at work at

02:03:40,139 --> 02:03:42,169
they've sold me visions of beaches and
whatever and more than likely I'm losing

6666
02:03:42,169 --> 02:03:42,179
whatever and more than likely I'm losing
 

6667
02:03:42,179 --> 02:03:44,330
whatever and more than likely I'm losing
money so better than 50 of people lose

the bottom saying they all can do it
when they can't

yeah it's really messed up and the

6686
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:02,340
yeah it's really messed up and the
 

6687
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:04,310
yeah it's really messed up and the
interesting thing of of noticed maybe

6688
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,320
interesting thing of of noticed maybe
 

6689
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:06,109
interesting thing of of noticed maybe
myself too because I've participated in

6690
02:04:06,109 --> 02:04:06,119
myself too because I've participated in
 

6691
02:04:06,119 --> 02:04:07,729
myself too because I've participated in
the knife selling for like a short

6692
02:04:07,729 --> 02:04:07,739
the knife selling for like a short
 

6693
02:04:07,739 --> 02:04:08,870
the knife selling for like a short
amount of time that's probably the

6694
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
amount of time that's probably the
 

6695
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:10,250
amount of time that's probably the
experience that most people from Cutco

6696
02:04:10,250 --> 02:04:10,260
experience that most people from Cutco
 

6697
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:11,149
experience that most people from Cutco
is it

6698
02:04:11,149 --> 02:04:11,159
is it
 

6699

talked about safe Moon you just grab the
pool of funds in the middle and you take

7808
02:24:59,870 --> 02:24:59,880
pool of funds in the middle and you take
 

7809
02:24:59,880 --> 02:25:02,510
pool of funds in the middle and you take
them out okay it's unruggable because we

7810
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:02,520
them out okay it's unruggable because we
 

7811
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:05,510
them out okay it's unruggable because we
have this smart code that is going to

7812
02:25:05,510 --> 02:25:05,520
have this smart code that is going to
 

7813
02:25:05,520 --> 02:25:06,530
have this smart code that is going to
prevent

7814
02:25:06,530 --> 02:25:06,540
prevent
 

7815
02:25:06,540 --> 02:25:09,110

it was really skeezy from the beginning
 

7835
02:25:29,520 --> 02:25:32,450
it was really skeezy from the beginning
and sketchy because their logo matched

um like a knockoff brand and almost
 

7847
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:43,490
um like a knockoff brand and almost
immediately the project rugged the they

7848
02:25:43,490 --> 02:25:43,500
immediately the project rugged the they
 

7849
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:47,090
immediately the project rugged the they
stole the money and tracing back through

7850
02:25:47,090 --> 02:25:47,100
stole the money and tracing back through
 

7851
02:25:47,100 --> 02:25:49,969
stole the money and tracing back through
the code was just changed at the last

7852
02:25:49,969 --> 02:25:49,979
the code was just changed at the last
 

7853
02:25:49,979 --> 02:25:52,190
the code was just changed at the last
second before launch like if you looked

7854
02:25:52,190 --> 02:25:52,200
second before launch like if you looked
 

7855
02:25:52,200 --> 02:25:53,870
second before launch like if you looked
at their code that they launched as a

7856
02:25:53,870 --> 02:25:53,880
at their code that they launched as a
 

7857
02:25:53,880 --> 02:25:55,969
at their code that they launched as a
test versus the code they launched in

7858
02:25:55,969 --> 02:25:55,979
test versus the code they launched in
 

7859
02:25:55,979 --> 02:25:58,610
test versus the code they launched in
actuality they changed only like two

7860
02:25:58,610 --> 02:25:58,620
actuality they changed only like two
 

7861
02:25:58,620 --> 02:26:00,469
actuality they changed only like two
lines and it was the whale code to

7862
02:26:00,469 --> 02:26:00,479
lines and it was the whale code to
 

7863
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:01,370
lines and it was the whale code to
basically make the whale code

7864
02:26:01,370 --> 02:26:01,380
basically make the whale code
 

7865
02:26:01,380 --> 02:26:03,530
basically make the whale code
non-existent like you can sell as much

7866
02:26:03,530 --> 02:26:03,540
non-existent like you can sell as much
 

7867
02:26:03,540 --> 02:26:05,809
non-existent like you can sell as much
as you want as fast as you want

7868
02:26:05,809 --> 02:26:05,819
as you want as fast as you want
 

7869
02:26:05,819 --> 02:26:07,670
as you want as fast as you want
um and it turned out that some of the

7870
02:26:07,670 --> 02:26:07,680
um and it turned out that some of the
 

7871
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:09,770
um and it turned out that some of the
influencers had not only

7872
02:26:09,770 --> 02:26:09,780
influencers had not only
 

7873
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:13,309
influencers had not only
sold that and made money but also had a

7874
02:26:13,309 --> 02:26:13,319
sold that and made money but also had a
 

7875
02:26:13,319 --> 02:26:15,889
sold that and made money but also had a
pattern of pump and dumping tokens so we

7876
02:26:15,889 --> 02:26:15,899
pattern of pump and dumping tokens so we
 

7877
02:26:15,899 --> 02:26:17,150
pattern of pump and dumping tokens so we
can talk about what that is like yeah

7878
02:26:17,150 --> 02:26:17,160
can talk about what that is like yeah
 

7879
02:26:17,160 --> 02:26:19,490
can talk about what that is like yeah
what's pumping up a pump and dump is

7880
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:19,500
what's pumping up a pump and dump is
 

7881
02:26:19,500 --> 02:26:21,469
what's pumping up a pump and dump is
just where you know you have a huge

7882
02:26:21,469 --> 02:26:21,479
just where you know you have a huge
 

7883
02:26:21,479 --> 02:26:23,990
just where you know you have a huge
following you promote your little Lex

7884
02:26:23,990 --> 02:26:24,000
following you promote your little Lex
 

7885

following you promote your little Lex
coin to everybody while holding a big

7886
02:26:26,210 --> 02:26:26,220
coin to everybody while holding a big
 

7887
02:26:26,220 --> 02:26:28,309
coin to everybody while holding a big
portion of it and as everyone rushes in

7888
02:26:28,309 --> 02:26:28,319
portion of it and as everyone rushes in
 

7889
02:26:28,319 --> 02:26:30,230
portion of it and as everyone rushes in
to buy it the price is going to pump

7890
02:26:30,230 --> 02:26:30,240
to buy it the price is going to pump
 

7891
02:26:30,240 --> 02:26:32,929
to buy it the price is going to pump
and you dump at the same time so that's

7892
02:26:32,929 --> 02:26:32,939
and you dump at the same time so that's
 

7893
02:26:32,939 --> 02:26:34,490
and you dump at the same time so that's
where the name comes from pump and dump

7894
02:26:34,490 --> 02:26:34,500
where the name comes from pump and dump
 

7895
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:36,830
where the name comes from pump and dump
you pump the price sell all your tokens

7896
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:36,840
you pump the price sell all your tokens
 

7897
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:39,710
you pump the price sell all your tokens
make a lot of money so I traced

7898
02:26:39,710 --> 02:26:39,720
make a lot of money so I traced
 

7899
02:26:39,720 --> 02:26:40,790
make a lot of money so I traced
basically their Wallets on the

7900
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:40,800
basically their Wallets on the
 

7901
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:43,309
basically their Wallets on the
blockchain and found that two of the

7902
02:26:43,309 --> 02:26:43,319
blockchain and found that two of the
 

7903
02:26:43,319 --> 02:26:45,230
blockchain and found that two of the
actors specifically had had a long

7904
02:26:45,230 --> 02:26:45,240
actors specifically had had a long
 

7905
02:26:45,240 --> 02:26:47,389
actors specifically had had a long
history of doing this

7906
02:26:47,389 --> 02:26:47,399
history of doing this
 

7907
02:26:47,399 --> 02:26:49,910
history of doing this
um which really proved malicious intent

7908
02:26:49,910 --> 02:26:49,920
um which really proved malicious intent
 

7909
02:26:49,920 --> 02:26:51,830
um which really proved malicious intent
and why I called it the worst is not it

7910
02:26:51,830 --> 02:26:51,840
and why I called it the worst is not it
 

7911
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:53,030
and why I called it the worst is not it
certainly wasn't the worst in terms of

7912
02:26:53,030 --> 02:26:53,040
certainly wasn't the worst in terms of
 

7913
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:55,550
certainly wasn't the worst in terms of
like the amount of people affected it uh

7914
02:26:55,550 --> 02:26:55,560
like the amount of people affected it uh
 

7915
02:26:55,560 --> 02:26:58,010
like the amount of people affected it uh
relatively was like a small pump and

7916
02:26:58,010 --> 02:26:58,020
relatively was like a small pump and
 

7917
02:26:58,020 --> 02:26:59,330
relatively was like a small pump and
dump because it rugged almost

7918
02:26:59,330 --> 02:26:59,340
dump because it rugged almost
 

7919
02:26:59,340 --> 02:27:00,650
dump because it rugged almost
immediately

7920
02:27:00,650 --> 02:27:00,660
immediately
 

7921
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:03,110
immediately
but in terms of the amount of people

7922
02:27:03,110 --> 02:27:03,120
but in terms of the amount of people
 

7923
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:05,570
but in terms of the amount of people
that were involved in it in terms of the

7924
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:05,580
that were involved in it in terms of the
 

7925
02:27:05,580 --> 02:27:07,730
that were involved in it in terms of the
amount of malicious behavior before it

7926
02:27:07,730 --> 02:27:07,740
amount of malicious behavior before it
 

7927
02:27:07,740 --> 02:27:09,650
amount of malicious behavior before it
that like sort of proved that this

7928
02:27:09,650 --> 02:27:09,660
that like sort of proved that this
 

7929
02:27:09,660 --> 02:27:11,389
that like sort of proved that this
wasn't an accident the fact that there

7930
02:27:11,389 --> 02:27:11,399
wasn't an accident the fact that there
 

7931
02:27:11,399 --> 02:27:13,309
wasn't an accident the fact that there
was like this whale code it was one of

7932
02:27:13,309 --> 02:27:13,319
was like this whale code it was one of
 

7933
02:27:13,319 --> 02:27:16,010
was like this whale code it was one of
the most cynical attempts to just take

7934
02:27:16,010 --> 02:27:16,020
the most cynical attempts to just take
 

7935
02:27:16,020 --> 02:27:17,870
the most cynical attempts to just take
the money of the followers you had and

7936
02:27:17,870 --> 02:27:17,880
the money of the followers you had and
 

7937
02:27:17,880 --> 02:27:18,770
the money of the followers you had and
just like

7938
02:27:18,770 --> 02:27:18,780
just like
 

7939
02:27:18,780 --> 02:27:21,530
just like
that's mine now so that's that's why I

7940
02:27:21,530 --> 02:27:21,540
that's mine now so that's that's why I
 

7941
02:27:21,540 --> 02:27:23,510
that's mine now so that's that's why I
called it that let's save the kids so

7942
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:23,520

02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:19,080
and that number is some approximation
 

8547
02:38:19,080 --> 02:38:20,389
and that number is some approximation
it's like it's always like hard numbers

8548
02:38:20,389 --> 02:38:20,399
it's like it's always like hard numbers
 

8549
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:23,150
it's like it's always like hard numbers
it's like 100 000 a million 10 million

8550
02:38:23,150 --> 02:38:23,160
it's like 100 000 a million 10 million
 

8551
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:24,889
it's like 100 000 a million 10 million
people just see a number and they just

8552
02:38:24,889 --> 02:38:24,899
people just see a number and they just
 

8553
02:38:24,899 --> 02:38:26,990
people just see a number and they just
go like wow that is and they assign a

8554
02:38:26,990 --> 02:38:27,000
go like wow that is and they assign a
 

8555
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,330
go like wow that is and they assign a
quality to it that may not like it

8556
02:38:29,330 --> 02:38:29,340
quality to it that may not like it
 

8557
02:38:29,340 --> 02:38:31,790
quality to it that may not like it
usually means nothing at all so I agree

8558
02:38:31,790 --> 02:38:31,800
usually means nothing at all so I agree
 

8559
02:38:31,800 --> 02:38:33,889
usually means nothing at all so I agree

in a few years to see how he develops
 

8637
02:39:54,540 --> 02:39:56,750
in a few years to see how he develops
and now that he's like kind of

02:39:58,550 --> 02:39:58,560
revolutionized like the data side of
 

8641
02:39:58,560 --> 02:39:59,450
revolutionized like the data side of
things

8642
02:39:59,450 --> 02:39:59,460
things
 

8643
02:39:59,460 --> 02:40:02,690
things
how he then approaches future videos

8644
02:40:02,690 --> 02:40:02,700
how he then approaches future videos
 

8645
02:40:02,700 --> 02:40:05,389
how he then approaches future videos
because there's a point at which

because there's a point at which
 

8647
02:40:05,399 --> 02:40:07,250
because there's a point at which
you've optimized you've optimized you've

you've optimized you've optimized you've
 

8649
02:40:07,260 --> 02:40:09,889
you've optimized you've optimized you've
optimized but optimizing for short-term

8650
02:40:09,889 --> 02:40:09,899
optimized but optimizing for short-term
 

8651
02:40:09,899 --> 02:40:11,450
optimized but optimizing for short-term
video performance is not the same as

optimizing for long-term viewer
 

8655
02:40:12,840 --> 02:40:15,550

8663
02:40:21,780 --> 02:40:23,750
doesn't but they're trying to obviously
do that optimize for long-term happiness

8664
02:40:23,750 --> 02:40:23,760
do that optimize for long-term happiness
 

8665
02:40:23,760 --> 02:40:26,030
do that optimize for long-term happiness

02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:28,730
you can't so the one mistake to make is
to and map Jimmy's philosophy onto every

to and map Jimmy's philosophy onto every
 

8717
02:41:28,740 --> 02:41:30,950
to and map Jimmy's philosophy onto every
genre because not every genre fits that

8718
02:41:30,950 --> 02:41:30,960
genre because not every genre fits that
 

8719
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:34,490
genre because not every genre fits that
model your model is not an idea Centric

8720
02:41:34,490 --> 02:41:34,500
model your model is not an idea Centric
 

8721
02:41:34,500 --> 02:41:36,950
model your model is not an idea Centric
model it's a people-centric model and so

8722
02:41:36,950 --> 02:41:36,960
model it's a people-centric model and so
 

8723
02:41:36,960 --> 02:41:38,929
model it's a people-centric model and so
you like

you like
 

8725
02:41:38,939 --> 02:41:40,969
you like
if you were in the business of creating

8726

just Mass entertainment for the sake of

8728
02:41:43,309 --> 02:41:43,319
just Mass entertainment for the sake of
 

8729
02:41:43,319 --> 02:41:46,190
just Mass entertainment for the sake of
mass entertainment you might focus on

8730
02:41:46,190 --> 02:41:46,200
mass entertainment you might focus on
 

8731
02:41:46,200 --> 02:41:49,490
mass entertainment you might focus on
Okay the reason going idea focused

8732
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:49,500
Okay the reason going idea focused
 

8733
02:41:49,500 --> 02:41:51,950
Okay the reason going idea focused
instead of person focused is so such a

8734
02:41:51,950 --> 02:41:51,960
instead of person focused is so such a
 

8735
02:41:51,960 --> 02:41:53,870
instead of person focused is so such a
revolutionary idea in some senses is

8736
02:41:53,870 --> 02:41:53,880
revolutionary idea in some senses is
 

8737
02:41:53,880 --> 02:41:56,210
revolutionary idea in some senses is
because ideas can be broader more

8738
02:41:56,210 --> 02:41:56,220
because ideas can be broader more
 

8739
02:41:56,220 --> 02:41:57,889
because ideas can be broader more
broadly appealing than any single human

8740
02:41:57,889 --> 02:41:57,899
broadly appealing than any single human
 

8741
02:41:57,899 --> 02:41:59,750
broadly appealing than any single human
can be

8742
02:41:59,750 --> 02:41:59,760
can be
 

8743
02:41:59,760 --> 02:42:01,849
can be
but you're not going for that you're

8744
02:42:01,849 --> 02:42:01,859
but you're not going for that you're
 

8745
02:42:01,859 --> 02:42:04,070
but you're not going for that you're
going for a podcast interview and I

8746
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:04,080
going for a podcast interview and I
 

8747
02:42:04,080 --> 02:42:05,510
going for a podcast interview and I
think for you

8748
02:42:05,510 --> 02:42:05,520
think for you
 

8749
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,790
think for you
the goal should always be how deep can

8750
02:42:07,790 --> 02:42:07,800
the goal should always be how deep can
 

8751
02:42:07,800 --> 02:42:09,590
the goal should always be how deep can
you get with interesting guests and like

8752
02:42:09,590 --> 02:42:09,600
you get with interesting guests and like
 

8753
02:42:09,600 --> 02:42:11,510
you get with interesting guests and like
finding the most interesting guest which

8754
02:42:11,510 --> 02:42:11,520
finding the most interesting guest which
 

8755
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:13,730
finding the most interesting guest which
is a different probably set of skills

8756
02:42:13,730 --> 02:42:13,740
is a different probably set of skills
 

8757
02:42:13,740 --> 02:42:15,950
is a different probably set of skills
than well really well put but I think

8758
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:15,960
than well really well put but I think
 

8759
02:42:15,960 --> 02:42:17,870
than well really well put but I think
the the right mapping there is finding

8760
02:42:17,870 --> 02:42:17,880
the the right mapping there is finding
 

8761
02:42:17,880 --> 02:42:20,330
the the right mapping there is finding
the most interesting guest yeah and I I

8762
02:42:20,330 --> 02:42:20,340
the most interesting guest yeah and I I
 

8763
02:42:20,340 --> 02:42:23,210
the most interesting guest yeah and I I
think uh I don't do enough work on that

8764
02:42:23,210 --> 02:42:23,220
think uh I don't do enough work on that
 

8765
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:26,210
think uh I don't do enough work on that
so for example I I I I try to be

8766
02:42:26,210 --> 02:42:26,220
so for example I I I I try to be
 

8767
02:42:26,220 --> 02:42:29,150
so for example I I I I try to be
something I do prioritize is is talking

8768
02:42:29,150 --> 02:42:29,160
something I do prioritize is is talking
 

8769
02:42:29,160 --> 02:42:30,530
something I do prioritize is is talking
to people that nobody's talked to before

8770
02:42:30,530 --> 02:42:30,540
to people that nobody's talked to before
 

8771
02:42:30,540 --> 02:42:32,210
to people that nobody's talked to before
so

8772
02:42:32,210 --> 02:42:32,220
so
 

8773
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:34,070
so
because it's like I kind of my see

8774
02:42:34,070 --> 02:42:34,080
because it's like I kind of my see
 

8775
02:42:34,080 --> 02:42:36,469
because it's like I kind of my see
myself as not a good like I know a lot

8776
02:42:36,469 --> 02:42:36,479
myself as not a good like I know a lot

myself as not a good like I know a lot
of people are much better than me I

person and I think
 

8799
02:43:00,420 --> 02:43:05,570
person and I think
I should do a Mr B style rigger in

8800
02:43:05,570 --> 02:43:05,580
I should do a Mr B style rigger in
 

8801
02:43:05,580 --> 02:43:07,790
I should do a Mr B style rigger in
searching for interesting people and you

8802
02:43:07,790 --> 02:43:07,800
searching for interesting people and you
 

8803
02:43:07,800 --> 02:43:10,730
searching for interesting people and you
should probably find people to help you

8804
02:43:10,730 --> 02:43:10,740
should probably find people to help you
 

8805
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:13,070
should probably find people to help you
search sure so he does that but if

8806
02:43:13,070 --> 02:43:13,080
search sure so he does that but if
 

8807
02:43:13,080 --> 02:43:15,050
search sure so he does that but if
you're being honest he does that of

8808
02:43:15,050 --> 02:43:15,060
you're being honest he does that of
 

8809
02:43:15,060 --> 02:43:17,630
you're being honest he does that of
course with other other folks but he is

8810
02:43:17,630 --> 02:43:17,640
course with other other folks but he is
 

8811
02:43:17,640 --> 02:43:20,030
course with other other folks but he is
the main engine yeah you need like sort

8812
02:43:20,030 --> 02:43:20,040
the main engine yeah you need like sort
 

8813
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:23,510
the main engine yeah you need like sort
of like a a pre-filter you're the final

8814
02:43:23,510 --> 02:43:23,520
of like a a pre-filter you're the final
 

8815
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:26,150
of like a a pre-filter you're the final
filter because your problem is

8816
02:43:26,150 --> 02:43:26,160
filter because your problem is
 

8817
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:29,690
filter because your problem is
you're only able to think of humans that

8818
02:43:29,690 --> 02:43:29,700
you're only able to think of humans that
 

8819
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:32,090
you're only able to think of humans that
you've thought of before or been exposed

8820
02:43:32,090 --> 02:43:32,100
you've thought of before or been exposed
 

8821
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:34,309
you've thought of before or been exposed
to and most of the world you've never

8822
02:43:34,309 --> 02:43:34,319
to and most of the world you've never
 

8823
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,349
to and most of the world you've never
been exposed to so you need people to

8824
02:43:36,349 --> 02:43:36,359
been exposed to so you need people to
 

8825
02:43:36,359 --> 02:43:39,110
been exposed to so you need people to
like pre-filter and go okay these guys

8826
02:43:39,110 --> 02:43:39,120
like pre-filter and go okay these guys
 

8827
02:43:39,120 --> 02:43:40,910
like pre-filter and go okay these guys
are just interesting humans Lex has

8828
02:43:40,910 --> 02:43:40,920
are just interesting humans Lex has
 

8829
02:43:40,920 --> 02:43:42,830
are just interesting humans Lex has
never heard of them and then you sort of

8830
02:43:42,830 --> 02:43:42,840
never heard of them and then you sort of
 

8831
02:43:42,840 --> 02:43:45,170
never heard of them and then you sort of
take a batch of like a hundred people

8832
02:43:45,170 --> 02:43:45,180
take a batch of like a hundred people
 

8833
02:43:45,180 --> 02:43:46,550
take a batch of like a hundred people
and you go who seems the most

8834
02:43:46,550 --> 02:43:46,560
and you go who seems the most
 

8835
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:48,710
and you go who seems the most
interesting for me yeah but by the way

8836
02:43:48,710 --> 02:43:48,720
interesting for me yeah but by the way
 

8837
02:43:48,720 --> 02:43:50,469
interesting for me yeah but by the way
on that topic we're

8838
02:43:50,469 --> 02:43:50,479
on that topic we're
 

8839
02:43:50,479 --> 02:43:54,290
on that topic we're
I have uh almost done I'm building up uh

8840
02:43:54,290 --> 02:43:54,300
I have uh almost done I'm building up uh
 

8841
02:43:54,300 --> 02:43:56,870
I have uh almost done I'm building up uh
I I programmed uh this guest

8842
02:43:56,870 --> 02:43:56,880
I I programmed uh this guest
 

8843
02:43:56,880 --> 02:43:59,330
I I programmed uh this guest
recommendation thing where I want to get

8844
02:43:59,330 --> 02:43:59,340
recommendation thing where I want to get
 

8845
02:43:59,340 --> 02:44:01,070
recommendation thing where I want to get
suggestions from other people because I

8846
02:44:01,070 --> 02:44:01,080
suggestions from other people because I
 

8847
02:44:01,080 --> 02:44:03,349
suggestions from other people because I
really want to find people that nobody

8848
02:44:03,349 --> 02:44:03,359
really want to find people that nobody
 

8849
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:05,870
really want to find people that nobody
knows this is the tricky thing like not

8850
02:44:05,870 --> 02:44:05,880
knows this is the tricky thing like not
 

8851
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:09,170
knows this is the tricky thing like not
you're not famous but I I the the idea

8852
02:44:09,170 --> 02:44:09,180
you're not famous but I I the the idea
 

8853
02:44:09,180 --> 02:44:11,090
you're not famous but I I the the idea
is there's probably fascinating humans

8854
02:44:11,090 --> 02:44:11,100
is there's probably fascinating humans
 

8855
02:44:11,100 --> 02:44:14,150
is there's probably fascinating humans
out there that nobody knows correct that

8856
02:44:14,150 --> 02:44:14,160
out there that nobody knows correct that
 

8857
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:15,770
out there that nobody knows correct that
I want to find those and I believe in

8858
02:44:15,770 --> 02:44:15,780
I want to find those and I believe in
 

8859
02:44:15,780 --> 02:44:17,630
I want to find those and I believe in
the crowdsourcing aspect we'll raise

8860
02:44:17,630 --> 02:44:17,640
the crowdsourcing aspect we'll raise
 

8861
02:44:17,640 --> 02:44:19,849
the crowdsourcing aspect we'll raise
them and now of course the top 100 will

8862
02:44:19,849 --> 02:44:19,859
them and now of course the top 100 will
 

8863
02:44:19,859 --> 02:44:23,389
them and now of course the top 100 will
be crypto scams no but yes so like I

8864
02:44:23,389 --> 02:44:23,399
be crypto scams no but yes so like I
 

8865
02:44:23,399 --> 02:44:25,250
be crypto scams no but yes so like I
have to make sure that these kinds of

8866
02:44:25,250 --> 02:44:25,260
have to make sure that these kinds of
 

8867
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:28,070
have to make sure that these kinds of
swarms of human humans that recommend I

8868
02:44:28,070 --> 02:44:28,080
swarms of human humans that recommend I
 

8869
02:44:28,080 --> 02:44:29,870
swarms of human humans that recommend I
can filter through in this whole kinds

8870
02:44:29,870 --> 02:44:29,880
can filter through in this whole kinds
 

8871
02:44:29,880 --> 02:44:31,610
can filter through in this whole kinds
of systems for that but I want to find

8872
02:44:31,610 --> 02:44:31,620
of systems for that but I want to find
 

8873
02:44:31,620 --> 02:44:33,770
of systems for that but I want to find
the the fascinating people out there

8874
02:44:33,770 --> 02:44:33,780
the the fascinating people out there
 

8875
02:44:33,780 --> 02:44:36,650
the the fascinating people out there
that nobody's ever heard from and um

8876
02:44:36,650 --> 02:44:36,660
that nobody's ever heard from and um
 

8877
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:38,450
that nobody's ever heard from and um
from a programmer perspective I thought

8878
02:44:38,450 --> 02:44:38,460
from a programmer perspective I thought
 

8879
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:40,010
from a programmer perspective I thought
surely I could do that by just building

8880
02:44:40,010 --> 02:44:40,020
surely I could do that by just building
 

8881
02:44:40,020 --> 02:44:42,410
surely I could do that by just building
the system yeah that's how programmers

8882
02:44:42,410 --> 02:44:42,420
the system yeah that's how programmers
 

8883
02:44:42,420 --> 02:44:43,730
the system yeah that's how programmers
always think they'll just automate a

8884
02:44:43,730 --> 02:44:43,740
always think they'll just automate a
 

8885
02:44:43,740 --> 02:44:45,230
always think they'll just automate a
system to do it well that's the Jimmy

8886
02:44:45,230 --> 02:44:45,240
system to do it well that's the Jimmy
 

8887

um so I talked to a lot of the people

8954
02:46:02,030 --> 02:46:02,040
um so I talked to a lot of the people
 

8955
02:46:02,040 --> 02:46:03,590
um so I talked to a lot of the people
who had taken this course because it was

8956
02:46:03,590 --> 02:46:03,600
who had taken this course because it was
 

8957
02:46:03,600 --> 02:46:05,990
who had taken this course because it was
pretty expensive I think it was like

8958
02:46:05,990 --> 02:46:06,000
pretty expensive I think it was like
 

8959
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:08,690
pretty expensive I think it was like
2 500 or a thousand dollars and mind you

8960
02:46:08,690 --> 02:46:08,700
2 500 or a thousand dollars and mind you
 

8961
02:46:08,700 --> 02:46:10,070
2 500 or a thousand dollars and mind you
the people who are taking it are like

8962
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:10,080

a lot of money and then you take the
 

8967
02:46:15,479 --> 02:46:17,510
a lot of money and then you take the
course and immediately you find out okay

8968
02:46:17,510 --> 02:46:17,520
course and immediately you find out okay
 

8969

8978
02:46:29,570 --> 02:46:29,580
like the level up right and all of these
 

8979
02:46:29,580 --> 02:46:32,210
like the level up right and all of these
courses are structured like this so they

8980
02:46:32,210 --> 02:46:32,220
courses are structured like this so they
 

8981
02:46:32,220 --> 02:46:34,370
courses are structured like this so they
spend a tremendous amount on Google ads

8982
02:46:34,370 --> 02:46:34,380
spend a tremendous amount on Google ads
 

8983
02:46:34,380 --> 02:46:36,650
spend a tremendous amount on Google ads

actually not done being like the product
 

8989
02:46:41,060 --> 02:46:44,090
actually not done being like the product
you're actually in this system that

9074
02:48:13,730 --> 02:48:13,740
then let's say selling a water bottle
 

9075
02:48:13,740 --> 02:48:15,110
then let's say selling a water bottle
and saying it's the greatest water

and saying it's the greatest water
 

9077
02:48:15,120 --> 02:48:17,090

them are sort of promising things that
aren't true but you get something you

to get this pill that it but obviously

9144
02:49:25,429 --> 02:49:25,439
to get this pill that it but obviously
 

9145
02:49:25,439 --> 02:49:26,809
to get this pill that it but obviously
that gets really predatory really quick

9146
02:49:26,809 --> 02:49:26,819
that gets really predatory really quick

because
 

9149

because
selling something that isn't real is

02:49:30,530 --> 02:49:30,540
selling something that isn't real is
 

9151
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:31,730
selling something that isn't real is
almost as compelling as selling

almost as compelling as selling

almost as compelling as selling
something that is real right so this

02:49:34,309 --> 02:49:34,319
something that is real right so this
 

9155
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:35,809
something that is real right so this
happens in the get rich quick space too

02:49:37,140 --> 02:49:40,490
there's any amount of money you would
pay to make a lot more money right

9160
02:49:40,490 --> 02:49:40,500
pay to make a lot more money right
 

9161
02:49:40,500 --> 02:49:42,530
pay to make a lot more money right
so these products have inelastic demand

9162
02:49:42,530 --> 02:49:42,540
so these products have inelastic demand
 

9163
02:49:42,540 --> 02:49:45,050
so these products have inelastic demand
that's why you see what is essentially a

college because obviously there's
similar like questions about benefits

9182
02:50:06,530 --> 02:50:06,540
similar like questions about benefits
 

9183
02:50:06,540 --> 02:50:08,090
similar like questions about benefits
but in this case there's not even

9184
02:50:08,090 --> 02:50:08,100
but in this case there's not even
 

9185
02:50:08,100 --> 02:50:09,830
but in this case there's not even
statistics available that even shows the

9186
02:50:09,830 --> 02:50:09,840
statistics available that even shows the
 

9187
02:50:09,840 --> 02:50:11,270
statistics available that even shows the
average person gets something out of it

9188
02:50:11,270 --> 02:50:11,280
average person gets something out of it
 

9189
02:50:11,280 --> 02:50:13,429
average person gets something out of it
that's true of like if you go to college

9190
02:50:13,429 --> 02:50:13,439
that's true of like if you go to college
 

9191
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:15,410
that's true of like if you go to college
your average income will improve right

9192
02:50:15,410 --> 02:50:15,420
your average income will improve right
 

9193
02:50:15,420 --> 02:50:17,150
your average income will improve right
that's the justification there there's

9194
02:50:17,150 --> 02:50:17,160
that's the justification there there's
 

9195
02:50:17,160 --> 02:50:18,830
that's the justification there there's
none of that there's no case studies

9196
02:50:18,830 --> 02:50:18,840
none of that there's no case studies
 

9197
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:20,510
none of that there's no case studies
there's nothing backing their

9198
02:50:20,510 --> 02:50:20,520
there's nothing backing their
 

9199
02:50:20,520 --> 02:50:22,429
there's nothing backing their
extravagant claims of you're going to

9200
02:50:22,429 --> 02:50:22,439
extravagant claims of you're going to
 

9201
02:50:22,439 --> 02:50:23,330
extravagant claims of you're going to
make all this money you're going to make

9202
02:50:23,330 --> 02:50:23,340
make all this money you're going to make
 

9203
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:25,309
make all this money you're going to make
all this wealth instead they're just as

9204
02:50:25,309 --> 02:50:25,319
all this wealth instead they're just as
 

9205
02:50:25,319 --> 02:50:26,570
all this wealth instead they're just as
we said before they're selling you a

9206
02:50:26,570 --> 02:50:26,580
we said before they're selling you a
 

9207
02:50:26,580 --> 02:50:29,090
we said before they're selling you a
dream so that's why I find all those

9208
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:29,100
dream so that's why I find all those
 

9209
02:50:29,100 --> 02:50:31,370
dream so that's why I find all those
like types of get rich quick schemes so

9210
02:50:31,370 --> 02:50:31,380
like types of get rich quick schemes so
 

9211
02:50:31,380 --> 02:50:33,170
like types of get rich quick schemes so
problematic and uh that's why I've

9212
02:50:33,170 --> 02:50:33,180
problematic and uh that's why I've
 

9213
02:50:33,180 --> 02:50:34,969
problematic and uh that's why I've
railed against them for a significant

9214
02:50:34,969 --> 02:50:34,979
railed against them for a significant
 

9215
02:50:34,979 --> 02:50:36,530
railed against them for a significant
amount of time what have you learned

9216
02:50:36,530 --> 02:50:36,540
amount of time what have you learned
 

9217
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:39,349
amount of time what have you learned
from attacking exposing some of the

9218
02:50:39,349 --> 02:50:39,359
from attacking exposing some of the
 

9219
02:50:39,359 --> 02:50:41,510
from attacking exposing some of the
things that Den lock is is doing what

9220
02:50:41,510 --> 02:50:41,520
things that Den lock is is doing what
 

9221
02:50:41,520 --> 02:50:43,130
things that Den lock is is doing what
what have you learned about human nature

9222
02:50:43,130 --> 02:50:43,140
what have you learned about human nature
 

9223
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:45,530
what have you learned about human nature
and and frosters and gurus and so on

9224
02:50:45,530 --> 02:50:45,540
and and frosters and gurus and so on
 

9225
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:47,630
and and frosters and gurus and so on
that's a great question so

9226
02:50:47,630 --> 02:50:47,640
that's a great question so
 

9227
02:50:47,640 --> 02:50:50,750
that's a great question so
I think one of them is that

9228
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:50,760
I think one of them is that
 

9229
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:53,570
I think one of them is that
there's this systemic problem that

9230
02:50:53,570 --> 02:50:53,580
there's this systemic problem that
 

9231
02:50:53,580 --> 02:50:56,030
there's this systemic problem that
the the phrase there's a sucker born

9232
02:50:56,030 --> 02:50:56,040
the the phrase there's a sucker born
 

9233
02:50:56,040 --> 02:50:58,910
the the phrase there's a sucker born
every minute it's very true there is no

9234
02:50:58,910 --> 02:50:58,920
every minute it's very true there is no
 

9235
02:50:58,920 --> 02:51:02,450
every minute it's very true there is no
end to the people who will fall for

9236
02:51:02,450 --> 02:51:02,460
end to the people who will fall for
 

9237
02:51:02,460 --> 02:51:04,370
end to the people who will fall for
something like this and the problem is

9238
02:51:04,370 --> 02:51:04,380
something like this and the problem is
 

9239
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:06,410
something like this and the problem is
is because there's just no end to need

9240
02:51:06,410 --> 02:51:06,420
is because there's just no end to need
 

9241
02:51:06,420 --> 02:51:09,710
is because there's just no end to need
and want and like and just lack I mean

9242
02:51:09,710 --> 02:51:09,720
and want and like and just lack I mean
 

9243
02:51:09,720 --> 02:51:12,110
and want and like and just lack I mean
it's easy to on the one hand criticize

9244
02:51:12,110 --> 02:51:12,120
it's easy to on the one hand criticize
 

9245
02:51:12,120 --> 02:51:13,790
it's easy to on the one hand criticize
people's greed but a lot of times you

9246
02:51:13,790 --> 02:51:13,800
people's greed but a lot of times you
 

9247
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:15,770
people's greed but a lot of times you
have to put yourself in their shoes if

9248
02:51:15,770 --> 02:51:15,780
have to put yourself in their shoes if
 

9249
02:51:15,780 --> 02:51:17,510
have to put yourself in their shoes if
you're at a dead-end job

9250
02:51:17,510 --> 02:51:17,520
you're at a dead-end job
 

9251
02:51:17,520 --> 02:51:19,610
you're at a dead-end job
you have nothing going for you you don't

9252
02:51:19,610 --> 02:51:19,620
you have nothing going for you you don't
 

9253
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:20,809
you have nothing going for you you don't
have the money to go to college you want

9254
02:51:20,809 --> 02:51:20,819
have the money to go to college you want
 

9255
02:51:20,819 --> 02:51:22,550
have the money to go to college you want
to get in debt fair play

9256
02:51:22,550 --> 02:51:22,560
to get in debt fair play
 

9257
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:25,490
to get in debt fair play
where do you go right as you said

9258
02:51:25,490 --> 02:51:25,500
where do you go right as you said
 

9259
02:51:25,500 --> 02:51:26,990
where do you go right as you said
there's somebody who's there saying they

9260
02:51:26,990 --> 02:51:27,000
there's somebody who's there saying they
 

9261
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:28,490
there's somebody who's there saying they
believe in you they believe you can make

9262
02:51:28,490 --> 02:51:28,500
believe in you they believe you can make
 

9263
02:51:28,500 --> 02:51:29,690
believe in you they believe you can make
six figures

9264
02:51:29,690 --> 02:51:29,700
six figures
 

9265
02:51:29,700 --> 02:51:31,790
six figures
you know you're you're gonna believe in

9266
02:51:31,790 --> 02:51:31,800
you know you're you're gonna believe in
 

9267
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:33,710
you know you're you're gonna believe in
that and so

9268
02:51:33,710 --> 02:51:33,720
that and so
 

9269
02:51:33,720 --> 02:51:35,630
that and so
I really felt like

9270
02:51:35,630 --> 02:51:35,640
I really felt like
 

9271
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:37,730
I really felt like
it made a lot more sense to tackle it

9272
02:51:37,730 --> 02:51:37,740
it made a lot more sense to tackle it
 

9273
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:40,670
it made a lot more sense to tackle it
from the other side from the side of

9274
02:51:40,670 --> 02:51:40,680
from the other side from the side of
 

9275
02:51:40,680 --> 02:51:43,510
from the other side from the side of
people that can stop they can basically

9276
02:51:43,510 --> 02:51:43,520
people that can stop they can basically
 

9277
02:51:43,520 --> 02:51:47,090
people that can stop they can basically
be exposed and basically be

9278
02:51:47,090 --> 02:51:47,100
be exposed and basically be
 

9279
02:51:47,100 --> 02:51:49,610
be exposed and basically be
um have sort of like a negative put on

9280
02:51:49,610 --> 02:51:49,620
um have sort of like a negative put on
 

9281
02:51:49,620 --> 02:51:51,530
um have sort of like a negative put on
their work I mean they're largely going

9282
02:51:51,530 --> 02:51:51,540
their work I mean they're largely going
 

9283
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:54,469
their work I mean they're largely going
under the radar so I kind of felt like

9284
02:51:54,469 --> 02:51:54,479
under the radar so I kind of felt like
 

9285
02:51:54,479 --> 02:51:57,230
under the radar so I kind of felt like
you know do you want to educate the do

9286
02:51:57,230 --> 02:51:57,240
you know do you want to educate the do
 

9287
02:51:57,240 --> 02:51:58,670
you know do you want to educate the do
you want to like blame it on the victims

9288
02:51:58,670 --> 02:51:58,680
you want to like blame it on the victims
 

9289
02:51:58,680 --> 02:51:59,870
you want to like blame it on the victims
and say you should have known better you

9290
02:51:59,870 --> 02:51:59,880
and say you should have known better you
 

9291
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:01,670
and say you should have known better you
should have done this you should stop

9292
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:01,680
should have done this you should stop
 

9293
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:04,250
should have done this you should stop
but there there's no end no end to that

9294
02:52:04,250 --> 02:52:04,260
but there there's no end no end to that
 

9295
02:52:04,260 --> 02:52:06,290
but there there's no end no end to that
or do you go after the grifters

9296
02:52:06,290 --> 02:52:06,300
or do you go after the grifters
 

9297
02:52:06,300 --> 02:52:07,910
or do you go after the grifters
themselves and so that's what I realized

9298
02:52:07,910 --> 02:52:07,920
themselves and so that's what I realized
 

9299
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:10,309
themselves and so that's what I realized
I realized like that's the tactic

9300
02:52:10,309 --> 02:52:10,319
I realized like that's the tactic
 

9301
02:52:10,319 --> 02:52:12,050
I realized like that's the tactic
that I went with

9302
02:52:12,050 --> 02:52:12,060
that I went with
 

9303
02:52:12,060 --> 02:52:13,370
that I went with
um and it's tough because it's a little

9304
02:52:13,370 --> 02:52:13,380
um and it's tough because it's a little
 

9305
02:52:13,380 --> 02:52:15,889
um and it's tough because it's a little
like legally risky to do that but

9306
02:52:15,889 --> 02:52:15,899
like legally risky to do that but
 

9307
02:52:15,899 --> 02:52:17,150
like legally risky to do that but
um

9308
02:52:17,150 --> 02:52:17,160
um
 

9309
02:52:17,160 --> 02:52:18,290
um
yeah you just kind of got to be smart

9310
02:52:18,290 --> 02:52:18,300
yeah you just kind of got to be smart
 

9311
02:52:18,300 --> 02:52:20,090
yeah you just kind of got to be smart
about it so your your platform has

9312
02:52:20,090 --> 02:52:20,100
about it so your your platform has
 

9313
02:52:20,100 --> 02:52:21,889
about it so your your platform has
gotten really big so there's some

9314
02:52:21,889 --> 02:52:21,899
gotten really big so there's some
 

9315
02:52:21,899 --> 02:52:23,990
gotten really big so there's some
responsibility to that weirdly big yeah

9316
02:52:23,990 --> 02:52:24,000
responsibility to that weirdly big yeah
 

9317
02:52:24,000 --> 02:52:25,610
responsibility to that weirdly big yeah
yeah

9318
02:52:25,610 --> 02:52:25,620
yeah
 

9319
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:26,330
yeah
um

9320
02:52:26,330 --> 02:52:26,340
um
 

9321
02:52:26,340 --> 02:52:28,610
um
let's say because like only a year ago

9322
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:28,620
let's say because like only a year ago
 

9323
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:31,309
let's say because like only a year ago
it was like a lot a lot smaller and then

9324
02:52:31,309 --> 02:52:31,319
it was like a lot a lot smaller and then
 

9325
02:52:31,319 --> 02:52:33,950
it was like a lot a lot smaller and then
it's hard to make that adjustment you

9326
02:52:33,950 --> 02:52:33,960
it's hard to make that adjustment you
 

9327
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,510
it's hard to make that adjustment you
know because like to me it's just the

9328
02:52:35,510 --> 02:52:35,520
know because like to me it's just the
 

9329
02:52:35,520 --> 02:52:38,269
know because like to me it's just the
same it's the same show I've been doing

9330
02:52:38,269 --> 02:52:38,279
same it's the same show I've been doing
 

9331
02:52:38,279 --> 02:52:41,150
same it's the same show I've been doing
so how do you avoid becoming a GUI

9332
02:52:41,150 --> 02:52:41,160
so how do you avoid becoming a GUI
 

9333
02:52:41,160 --> 02:52:45,889
so how do you avoid becoming a GUI
yourself or uh you you go growing in in

9334
02:52:45,889 --> 02:52:45,899
yourself or uh you you go growing in in
 

9335
02:52:45,899 --> 02:52:47,990

my platform and as I've grown I've tried
 

9821

with me and like
 

9825
03:01:58,080 --> 03:02:01,130
with me and like
it does Reach This tricky point where if

9826
03:02:01,130 --> 03:02:01,140
it does Reach This tricky point where if
 

9827
03:02:01,140 --> 03:02:03,889
it does Reach This tricky point where if
you're exposing a grifter with like 50

9828
03:02:03,889 --> 03:02:03,899
you're exposing a grifter with like 50
 

9829
03:02:03,899 --> 03:02:07,370
you're exposing a grifter with like 50
000 Subs who's doing some harm are you

9830
03:02:07,370 --> 03:02:07,380
000 Subs who's doing some harm are you
 

9831
03:02:07,380 --> 03:02:11,570
000 Subs who's doing some harm are you
punching down right and

9832
03:02:11,570 --> 03:02:11,580
punching down right and
 

9833
03:02:11,580 --> 03:02:14,510
punching down right and
so far there's been enough high profile

9834
03:02:14,510 --> 03:02:14,520
so far there's been enough high profile
 

9835
03:02:14,520 --> 03:02:16,309
so far there's been enough high profile
things that I can distract myself with

9836
03:02:16,309 --> 03:02:16,319
things that I can distract myself with
 

9837
03:02:16,319 --> 03:02:17,809
things that I can distract myself with
to where this has never been a problem

9838
03:02:17,809 --> 03:02:17,819
to where this has never been a problem
 

9839
03:02:17,819 --> 03:02:20,210
to where this has never been a problem
you don't ever want to be

9840
03:02:20,210 --> 03:02:20,220
you don't ever want to be
 

9841
03:02:20,220 --> 03:02:22,130
you don't ever want to be
um

9842
03:02:22,130 --> 03:02:22,140
um
 

9843
03:02:22,140 --> 03:02:26,389

um where have you heard this analogy
 

9847
03:02:28,140 --> 03:02:30,530
um where have you heard this analogy
okay so there's this great analogy where

9848
03:02:30,530 --> 03:02:30,540
okay so there's this great analogy where
 

9849
03:02:30,540 --> 03:02:33,290
okay so there's this great analogy where
it's like sir lancelot's the guy who uh

9850
03:02:33,290 --> 03:02:33,300
it's like sir lancelot's the guy who uh
 

9851
03:02:33,300 --> 03:02:35,450
it's like sir lancelot's the guy who uh
slays the dragon right he gets a lot of

9852
03:02:35,450 --> 03:02:35,460
slays the dragon right he gets a lot of
 

9853
03:02:35,460 --> 03:02:37,070
slays the dragon right he gets a lot of
Fame and he gets a lot of Fortune for

9854
03:02:37,070 --> 03:02:37,080
Fame and he gets a lot of Fortune for
 

9855
03:02:37,080 --> 03:02:38,690
Fame and he gets a lot of Fortune for
saving the dragon or at least a lot of

9856
03:02:38,690 --> 03:02:38,700
saving the dragon or at least a lot of
 

9857
03:02:38,700 --> 03:02:41,090
saving the dragon or at least a lot of
you know people love him

9858
03:02:41,090 --> 03:02:41,100
you know people love him
 

9859
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:42,650
you know people love him
but what happens after he slays the

9860
03:02:42,650 --> 03:02:42,660
but what happens after he slays the
 

9861
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:43,790
but what happens after he slays the
first dragon

9862
03:02:43,790 --> 03:02:43,800
first dragon
 

9863
03:02:43,800 --> 03:02:45,290
first dragon
he's got to go find a bigger dragon so

9864
03:02:45,290 --> 03:02:45,300
he's got to go find a bigger dragon so
 

9865
03:02:45,300 --> 03:02:47,389
he's got to go find a bigger dragon so
he goes finds a bigger dragon and

9866
03:02:47,389 --> 03:02:47,399
he goes finds a bigger dragon and
 

9867
03:02:47,399 --> 03:02:49,429
he goes finds a bigger dragon and
eventually depending on how many dragons

9868
03:02:49,429 --> 03:02:49,439
eventually depending on how many dragons
 

9869
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:51,410
eventually depending on how many dragons
you think are there in the world maybe

9870
03:02:51,410 --> 03:02:51,420
you think are there in the world maybe
 

9871
03:02:51,420 --> 03:02:53,090
you think are there in the world maybe
he kills all the dragons

9872
03:02:53,090 --> 03:02:53,100
he kills all the dragons
 

9873
03:02:53,100 --> 03:02:55,490
he kills all the dragons
and one day people go see sir Lancelot

9874
03:02:55,490 --> 03:02:55,500
and one day people go see sir Lancelot
 

9875
03:02:55,500 --> 03:02:57,590
and one day people go see sir Lancelot
and he's in a field with cows and he's

9876

chopping their heads yeah and he's he's
 

9879
03:03:00,600 --> 03:03:03,769
chopping their heads yeah and he's he's
sort of put himself in retirement but he

9880
03:03:03,769 --> 03:03:03,779
sort of put himself in retirement but he
 

9881
03:03:03,779 --> 03:03:05,389
sort of put himself in retirement but he
can't even enjoy the fruits because his

9882
03:03:05,389 --> 03:03:05,399
can't even enjoy the fruits because his
 

9883
03:03:05,399 --> 03:03:07,429
can't even enjoy the fruits because his
whole thing is like I'm killing the

9884
03:03:07,429 --> 03:03:07,439
whole thing is like I'm killing the

9893
03:03:20,279 --> 03:03:22,429
my hat I I try to be aware like if I
significantly improve the problem I put

9894
03:03:22,429 --> 03:03:22,439
significantly improve the problem I put
 

9895
03:03:22,439 --> 03:03:24,590
significantly improve the problem I put
myself out of business

9896

I want to be okay with that basically
 

9899
03:03:28,319 --> 03:03:30,469
I want to be okay with that basically
um and just be fine with it I don't the

9900
03:03:30,469 --> 03:03:30,479
um and just be fine with it I don't the
 

9901
03:03:30,479 --> 03:03:31,910
um and just be fine with it I don't the
funny thing is I was more worried about

9902
03:03:31,910 --> 03:03:31,920
funny thing is I was more worried about
 

9903
03:03:31,920 --> 03:03:33,769
funny thing is I was more worried about
this as like an issue

9904
03:03:33,769 --> 03:03:33,779
this as like an issue
 

9905
03:03:33,779 --> 03:03:36,349
this as like an issue
earlier because I thought there was a

9906
03:03:36,349 --> 03:03:36,359
earlier because I thought there was a
 

9907
03:03:36,359 --> 03:03:38,809
earlier because I thought there was a

kind of I've gained some skills there
 

10017
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:38,929
kind of I've gained some skills there
um and that's kind of this fun I guess I

10018
03:05:38,929 --> 03:05:38,939
um and that's kind of this fun I guess I
 

10019
03:05:38,939 --> 03:05:40,190
um and that's kind of this fun I guess I
would say it's this weird Edge I have

10020
03:05:40,190 --> 03:05:40,200
would say it's this weird Edge I have
 

10021
03:05:40,200 --> 03:05:41,809
would say it's this weird Edge I have
for right now because a lot of people

10022
03:05:41,809 --> 03:05:41,819
for right now because a lot of people
 

10023
03:05:41,819 --> 03:05:44,210
for right now because a lot of people
don't know too much about that

10024
03:05:44,210 --> 03:05:44,220
don't know too much about that
 

10025
03:05:44,220 --> 03:05:45,410
don't know too much about that
um and so I have this weird expertise

10026
03:05:45,410 --> 03:05:45,420
um and so I have this weird expertise
 

10027
03:05:45,420 --> 03:05:47,090
um and so I have this weird expertise
that works now I don't think that'll

10028
03:05:47,090 --> 03:05:47,100
that works now I don't think that'll
 

10029
03:05:47,100 --> 03:05:48,230
that works now I don't think that'll
work forever because I think people will

10030
03:05:48,230 --> 03:05:48,240
work forever because I think people will
 

10031
03:05:48,240 --> 03:05:49,429
work forever because I think people will
kind of figure out how to do very

10032
03:05:49,429 --> 03:05:49,439
kind of figure out how to do very
 

10033
03:05:49,439 --> 03:05:52,670
kind of figure out how to do very
similar analyzes but uh so it's it's

10034
03:05:52,670 --> 03:05:52,680
similar analyzes but uh so it's it's
 

10035
03:05:52,680 --> 03:05:54,170
similar analyzes but uh so it's it's
like kind of an interesting Edge right

10036
03:05:54,170 --> 03:05:54,180
like kind of an interesting Edge right
 

10037
03:05:54,180 --> 03:05:55,910
like kind of an interesting Edge right
now that I have so that's like a data

10038
03:05:55,910 --> 03:05:55,920
now that I have so that's like a data
 

10039
03:05:55,920 --> 03:05:57,349
now that I have so that's like a data

downplay that that's actually really
 

10323
03:10:54,779 --> 03:10:56,870
downplay that that's actually really
important I mean it's like a lot of

you know that's gonna percolate
 

10587
03:15:38,220 --> 03:15:39,889
you know that's gonna percolate
throughout the populace and they're

10588
03:15:39,889 --> 03:15:39,899
throughout the populace and they're

10605
03:15:55,439 --> 03:15:57,349
um I think we'll probably end up at a
space where

10606
03:15:57,349 --> 03:15:57,359
space where
 

10607
03:15:57,359 --> 03:15:59,870

and it's going to take a lot of like
 

10619
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:10,429
and it's going to take a lot of like
self-reflection I've talked to a few

10620
03:16:10,429 --> 03:16:10,439
self-reflection I've talked to a few

self-reflection I've talked to a few
mainstream journalists about this and a

10622
03:16:13,969 --> 03:16:13,979
mainstream journalists about this and a
 

10623
03:16:13,979 --> 03:16:15,769
mainstream journalists about this and a
lot of them will admit it behind closed

that uh people really quickly politicize
 

10687
03:17:30,899 --> 03:17:32,330
that uh people really quickly politicize
it but to me this thing that was

10688
03:17:32,330 --> 03:17:32,340
it but to me this thing that was
 

10689
03:17:32,340 --> 03:17:33,710
it but to me this thing that was
fascinating is just the transparency

10690
03:17:33,710 --> 03:17:33,720
fascinating is just the transparency
 

10691
03:17:33,720 --> 03:17:36,170
fascinating is just the transparency
that I've never see from one of the

that I've never see from one of the
really frustrating things to me because

10694
03:17:37,550 --> 03:17:37,560
really frustrating things to me because
 

10695
03:17:37,560 --> 03:17:39,469
really frustrating things to me because
a lot of this podcast has been about

10696
03:17:39,469 --> 03:17:39,479
a lot of this podcast has been about
 

10697
03:17:39,479 --> 03:17:41,630
a lot of this podcast has been about
interviewing tech people CEOs and so on

10698
03:17:41,630 --> 03:17:41,640
interviewing tech people CEOs and so on
 

10699
03:17:41,640 --> 03:17:43,849

10700
03:17:43,849 --> 03:17:43,859
and they're just so guarded with
 

10701
03:17:43,859 --> 03:17:46,309
and they're just so guarded with
everything it's hard to get to and so

10702
03:17:46,309 --> 03:17:46,319
everything it's hard to get to and so
 

10703
03:17:46,319 --> 03:17:49,010
everything it's hard to get to and so
it's nice to get

10704
03:17:49,010 --> 03:17:49,020
it's nice to get
 

10705
03:17:49,020 --> 03:17:50,990
it's nice to get
um hopefully this is a signal look you

10706
03:17:50,990 --> 03:17:51,000
um hopefully this is a signal look you
 

10707
03:17:51,000 --> 03:17:53,269
um hopefully this is a signal look you
can be transparent like this is a signal

10708
03:17:53,269 --> 03:17:53,279
can be transparent like this is a signal
 

10709
03:17:53,279 --> 03:17:55,730
can be transparent like this is a signal
to increase transparency

10710
03:17:55,730 --> 03:17:55,740
to increase transparency
 

10711
03:17:55,740 --> 03:17:58,910
to increase transparency
hopefully so I don't yeah it's been

10712
03:17:58,910 --> 03:17:58,920
hopefully so I don't yeah it's been
 

10713
03:17:58,920 --> 03:18:00,230
hopefully so I don't yeah it's been
tribalized so quickly it's like I've

10714
03:18:00,230 --> 03:18:00,240
tribalized so quickly it's like I've
 

10715
03:18:00,240 --> 03:18:02,210
tribalized so quickly it's like I've
lost a lot of faith in that and

10716
03:18:02,210 --> 03:18:02,220
lost a lot of faith in that and
 

10717
03:18:02,220 --> 03:18:03,530
lost a lot of faith in that and
unfortunately it's been this like

10718
03:18:03,530 --> 03:18:03,540
unfortunately it's been this like
 

10719
03:18:03,540 --> 03:18:05,690
unfortunately it's been this like
bludgeon match of like

10720
03:18:05,690 --> 03:18:05,700
bludgeon match of like
 

10721
03:18:05,700 --> 03:18:07,250
bludgeon match of like
you know

10722
03:18:07,250 --> 03:18:07,260
you know
 

10723
03:18:07,260 --> 03:18:09,590
you know
if you're on the right you think it's

10724
03:18:09,590 --> 03:18:09,600
if you're on the right you think it's
 

10725
03:18:09,600 --> 03:18:10,849
if you're on the right you think it's
uncovering the greatest story ever about

10726
03:18:10,849 --> 03:18:10,859
uncovering the greatest story ever about
 

10727
03:18:10,859 --> 03:18:12,290
uncovering the greatest story ever about
Hunter Biden if you're on the left you

10728
03:18:12,290 --> 03:18:12,300
Hunter Biden if you're on the left you
 

10729
03:18:12,300 --> 03:18:14,269
Hunter Biden if you're on the left you
think they were just sharing they were

10730
03:18:14,269 --> 03:18:14,279
think they were just sharing they were
 

10731
03:18:14,279 --> 03:18:15,950
think they were just sharing they were
just silencing revenge porn pics of

10732
03:18:15,950 --> 03:18:15,960
just silencing revenge porn pics of
 

10733
03:18:15,960 --> 03:18:17,510
just silencing revenge porn pics of
Hunter Biden so therefore it was

10734
03:18:17,510 --> 03:18:17,520
Hunter Biden so therefore it was
 

10735
03:18:17,520 --> 03:18:19,730
Hunter Biden so therefore it was
justified and by the way Trump also sent

10736
03:18:19,730 --> 03:18:19,740
justified and by the way Trump also sent
 

10737
03:18:19,740 --> 03:18:21,410
justified and by the way Trump also sent
messages to Twitter so doesn't that mean

10738
03:18:21,410 --> 03:18:21,420
messages to Twitter so doesn't that mean
 

10739
03:18:21,420 --> 03:18:22,790
messages to Twitter so doesn't that mean
that like we should be criticizing it

10740
03:18:22,790 --> 03:18:22,800
that like we should be criticizing it
 

10741
03:18:22,800 --> 03:18:25,550
that like we should be criticizing it
just like this is goes back to why I

10742
03:18:25,550 --> 03:18:25,560
just like this is goes back to why I
 

10743
03:18:25,560 --> 03:18:27,889
just like this is goes back to why I
don't touch politics is because I think

10744
03:18:27,889 --> 03:18:27,899
don't touch politics is because I think
 

10745
03:18:27,899 --> 03:18:30,530
don't touch politics is because I think
as many problems as I have I think when

10746
03:18:30,530 --> 03:18:30,540
as many problems as I have I think when
 

10747
03:18:30,540 --> 03:18:32,030
as many problems as I have I think when
you become a polit like a journalist

10748
03:18:32,030 --> 03:18:32,040
you become a polit like a journalist
 

10749
03:18:32,040 --> 03:18:33,769
you become a polit like a journalist
that not even a political journalist

10750
03:18:33,769 --> 03:18:33,779
that not even a political journalist
 

10751
03:18:33,779 --> 03:18:36,170
that not even a political journalist
when you become a journalist in politics

10752
03:18:36,170 --> 03:18:36,180
when you become a journalist in politics
 

10753
03:18:36,180 --> 03:18:38,630
when you become a journalist in politics
you have like twice the problem so I'm

10754
03:18:38,630 --> 03:18:38,640
you have like twice the problem so I'm
 

10755
03:18:38,640 --> 03:18:41,210
you have like twice the problem so I'm
like I'm happy to be well outside of

10756
03:18:41,210 --> 03:18:41,220
like I'm happy to be well outside of
 

10757
03:18:41,220 --> 03:18:43,849
like I'm happy to be well outside of
that um kind of sphere but it's an

10758
03:18:43,849 --> 03:18:43,859
that um kind of sphere but it's an
 

10759
03:18:43,859 --> 03:18:44,750
that um kind of sphere but it's an
interesting

10760
03:18:44,750 --> 03:18:44,760
interesting
 

10761
03:18:44,760 --> 03:18:46,610
interesting
um it is interesting it twit you know

is really really interesting for uh the
 

10767
03:18:52,200 --> 03:18:55,010
is really really interesting for uh the
virality of information transfer yeah

10768
03:18:55,010 --> 03:18:55,020
virality of information transfer yeah
 

10769
03:18:55,020 --> 03:18:57,590
virality of information transfer yeah
and from a journalistic perspective it's

10770
03:18:57,590 --> 03:18:57,600
and from a journalistic perspective it's
 

10771
03:18:57,600 --> 03:18:59,929
and from a journalistic perspective it's
like how information travels how it

10772
03:18:59,929 --> 03:18:59,939
like how information travels how it
 

10773
03:18:59,939 --> 03:19:01,429
like how information travels how it
becomes distributed

10777
03:19:03,600 --> 03:19:06,950
that's interesting what do you think
about Twitter I'm always conflicted on

10778
03:19:06,950 --> 03:19:06,960
about Twitter I'm always conflicted on
 

10779
03:19:06,960 --> 03:19:11,050
about Twitter I'm always conflicted on
Twitter because I almost hate how much I

10780
03:19:11,050 --> 03:19:11,060
Twitter because I almost hate how much I
 

10781
03:19:11,060 --> 03:19:14,090
Twitter because I almost hate how much I
enjoy using it because I'm like this is

10782
03:19:14,090 --> 03:19:14,100
enjoy using it because I'm like this is
 

10783
03:19:14,100 --> 03:19:16,190
enjoy using it because I'm like this is
like this mindless Bird app is consuming

10784
03:19:16,190 --> 03:19:16,200
like this mindless Bird app is consuming
 

10785
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:17,870
like this mindless Bird app is consuming
my time

10786
03:19:17,870 --> 03:19:17,880
my time
 

10787
03:19:17,880 --> 03:19:20,269
my time
um it's this incredible networking tool

10788
03:19:20,269 --> 03:19:20,279
um it's this incredible networking tool
 

10789
03:19:20,279 --> 03:19:22,309
um it's this incredible networking tool
but what's weird is when I think about

10790
03:19:22,309 --> 03:19:22,319
but what's weird is when I think about
 

10791
03:19:22,319 --> 03:19:24,410
but what's weird is when I think about
my own presence on Twitter they've

10792
03:19:24,410 --> 03:19:24,420
my own presence on Twitter they've
 

10793
03:19:24,420 --> 03:19:26,630
my own presence on Twitter they've
almost made it too easy to like say

10794
03:19:26,630 --> 03:19:26,640
almost made it too easy to like say
 

10795
03:19:26,640 --> 03:19:29,269
almost made it too easy to like say
something that you've half thought like

10796
03:19:29,269 --> 03:19:29,279
something that you've half thought like
 

10797
03:19:29,279 --> 03:19:30,889
something that you've half thought like
the friction to send a tweet is so much

10798
03:19:30,889 --> 03:19:30,899
the friction to send a tweet is so much
 

10799
03:19:30,899 --> 03:19:32,450
the friction to send a tweet is so much
less than like if I'm gonna make a

10800
03:19:32,450 --> 03:19:32,460
less than like if I'm gonna make a
 

10801
03:19:32,460 --> 03:19:34,250
less than like if I'm gonna make a
YouTube video there's several points at

10802
03:19:34,250 --> 03:19:34,260
YouTube video there's several points at
 

10803
03:19:34,260 --> 03:19:35,750
YouTube video there's several points at
which I'm like well what's the other

10804
03:19:35,750 --> 03:19:35,760
which I'm like well what's the other
 

10805
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:37,550
which I'm like well what's the other
side what's this what's that there's no

10806
03:19:37,550 --> 03:19:37,560
side what's this what's that there's no
 

10807
03:19:37,560 --> 03:19:39,170
side what's this what's that there's no
friction there and so one thing I've

10808
03:19:39,170 --> 03:19:39,180
friction there and so one thing I've
 

10809
03:19:39,180 --> 03:19:41,929
friction there and so one thing I've
noticed is everyone I follow on Twitter

10810
03:19:41,929 --> 03:19:41,939
noticed is everyone I follow on Twitter
 

10811
03:19:41,939 --> 03:19:44,150
noticed is everyone I follow on Twitter
a lot of them after reading all their

a lot of them after reading all their
tweets I think nothing more of them

nothing less of them but there's a lot
 

10817
03:19:48,060 --> 03:19:49,849
nothing less of them but there's a lot
of them that I think less of and I don't

10818
03:19:49,849 --> 03:19:49,859
of them that I think less of and I don't
 

10819
03:19:49,859 --> 03:19:51,769
of them that I think less of and I don't
think I've ever had an experience where

10820
03:19:51,769 --> 03:19:51,779
think I've ever had an experience where
 

10821
03:19:51,779 --> 03:19:53,870
think I've ever had an experience where
I've read read someone tweets and I

10822
03:19:53,870 --> 03:19:53,880
I've read read someone tweets and I
 

10823

I've read read someone tweets and I
think more of them no way and I'm like

10824

I admire
 

10833
03:20:03,420 --> 03:20:06,769
I admire
that the worst of them is represented on

10834
03:20:06,769 --> 03:20:06,779
that the worst of them is represented on
 

10835

03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:23,570
like emotional messes uh
I don't know yeah what is that

10846
03:20:23,570 --> 03:20:23,580
I don't know yeah what is that
 

10847
03:20:23,580 --> 03:20:26,389
I don't know yeah what is that
um maybe maybe we shouldn't criticize it

10848
03:20:26,389 --> 03:20:26,399
um maybe maybe we shouldn't criticize it
 

10849
03:20:26,399 --> 03:20:29,150
um maybe maybe we shouldn't criticize it
and accept that as like a beautiful raw

10850
03:20:29,150 --> 03:20:29,160
and accept that as like a beautiful raw
 

10851
03:20:29,160 --> 03:20:31,070
and accept that as like a beautiful raw
aspect of that human being but not

10852
03:20:31,070 --> 03:20:31,080
aspect of that human being but not
 

10853
03:20:31,080 --> 03:20:33,290
aspect of that human being but not
encompassing not representing the full

10854
03:20:33,290 --> 03:20:33,300
encompassing not representing the full
 

10855
03:20:33,300 --> 03:20:35,510
encompassing not representing the full
into but it does reflect like it's

10856
03:20:35,510 --> 03:20:35,520
into but it does reflect like it's
 

10857
03:20:35,520 --> 03:20:38,210
into but it does reflect like it's
impossible to not reflect it to some

10858
03:20:38,210 --> 03:20:38,220
impossible to not reflect it to some
 

10859
03:20:38,220 --> 03:20:39,410
impossible to not reflect it to some
extent or you'd have to counter that

10860
03:20:39,410 --> 03:20:39,420
extent or you'd have to counter that
 

10861
03:20:39,420 --> 03:20:41,330
extent or you'd have to counter that
bias really carefully because that is

10862
03:20:41,330 --> 03:20:41,340
bias really carefully because that is
 

10863
03:20:41,340 --> 03:20:43,670
bias really carefully because that is
them it is a thought they had it's just

10864
03:20:43,670 --> 03:20:43,680
them it is a thought they had it's just
 

10865
03:20:43,680 --> 03:20:44,690
them it is a thought they had it's just
probably something that should have been

10866
03:20:44,690 --> 03:20:44,700
probably something that should have been
 

10867
03:20:44,700 --> 03:20:47,690
probably something that should have been
an unexpressed thought perhaps

10868
03:20:47,690 --> 03:20:47,700
an unexpressed thought perhaps
 

10869
03:20:47,700 --> 03:20:51,050
an unexpressed thought perhaps
um so yeah I I kind of Wonder like my

10870
03:20:51,050 --> 03:20:51,060
um so yeah I I kind of Wonder like my

some deep work here two-hour bucket you
 

11177
03:26:34,920 --> 03:26:37,070
some deep work here two-hour bucket you
know account for an hour of lunch and

11178
03:26:37,070 --> 03:26:37,080
know account for an hour of lunch and
 

11179
03:26:37,080 --> 03:26:40,130
know account for an hour of lunch and
some other thing but now now I just

11180
03:26:40,130 --> 03:26:40,140
some other thing but now now I just
 

11181
03:26:40,140 --> 03:26:41,870
some other thing but now now I just
roughly because I manage a team and

11182
03:26:41,870 --> 03:26:41,880
roughly because I manage a team and
 

11183
03:26:41,880 --> 03:26:44,269
roughly because I manage a team and
there's some things that kind of come up

11184
03:26:44,269 --> 03:26:44,279
there's some things that kind of come up
 

11185
03:26:44,279 --> 03:26:45,830
there's some things that kind of come up
I it's only a team of two it's not like

11186
03:26:45,830 --> 03:26:45,840
I it's only a team of two it's not like
 

11187
03:26:45,840 --> 03:26:47,630
I it's only a team of two it's not like
big but I just have things that are not

11188
03:26:47,630 --> 03:26:47,640
big but I just have things that are not
 

11189
03:26:47,640 --> 03:26:49,250
big but I just have things that are not
necessarily controllable by me I like

11190
03:26:49,250 --> 03:26:49,260
necessarily controllable by me I like
 

11191
03:26:49,260 --> 03:26:50,570
necessarily controllable by me I like
have to take some meetings or whatever

11192
03:26:50,570 --> 03:26:50,580
have to take some meetings or whatever
 

11193
03:26:50,580 --> 03:26:52,550
have to take some meetings or whatever
it's not as easy to plan out my day

11194
03:26:52,550 --> 03:26:52,560
it's not as easy to plan out my day
 

11195
03:26:52,560 --> 03:26:54,729
it's not as easy to plan out my day
ahead of time so I do a lot of

11196
03:26:54,729 --> 03:26:54,739
ahead of time so I do a lot of
 

11197
03:26:54,739 --> 03:26:56,929
ahead of time so I do a lot of
retrospective time management where I

11198
03:26:56,929 --> 03:26:56,939
retrospective time management where I
 

11199
03:26:56,939 --> 03:26:58,429
retrospective time management where I
look at my day and that's what I mostly

11200
03:26:58,429 --> 03:26:58,439
look at my day and that's what I mostly
 

11201
03:26:58,439 --> 03:26:59,870
look at my day and that's what I mostly
do now

11202
03:26:59,870 --> 03:26:59,880
do now
 

11203
03:26:59,880 --> 03:27:01,969
do now
um and I account did I spend this day

11204
03:27:01,969 --> 03:27:01,979
um and I account did I spend this day
 

11205
03:27:01,979 --> 03:27:03,710
um and I account did I spend this day
productively what could I do better and

11206
03:27:03,710 --> 03:27:03,720
productively what could I do better and
 

11207
03:27:03,720 --> 03:27:05,290
productively what could I do better and
then try to implement it in the future

11208
03:27:05,290 --> 03:27:05,300
then try to implement it in the future
 

11209
03:27:05,300 --> 03:27:08,389
then try to implement it in the future
so a lot of this I realized is very

11210
03:27:08,389 --> 03:27:08,399
so a lot of this I realized is very
 

11211
03:27:08,399 --> 03:27:09,969
so a lot of this I realized is very
personal for me

11212
03:27:09,969 --> 03:27:09,979
personal for me
 

11213
03:27:09,979 --> 03:27:13,429
personal for me
I do very well in Long streaks of

11214
03:27:13,429 --> 03:27:13,439
I do very well in Long streaks of
 

11215
03:27:13,439 --> 03:27:15,830
I do very well in Long streaks of
working and if I I can't do a lot of

11216
03:27:15,830 --> 03:27:15,840
working and if I I can't do a lot of
 

11217
03:27:15,840 --> 03:27:17,510
working and if I I can't do a lot of
work in 15 minutes I can't do a lot of

11218
03:27:17,510 --> 03:27:17,520
work in 15 minutes I can't do a lot of
 

11219
03:27:17,520 --> 03:27:19,849
work in 15 minutes I can't do a lot of
work in even an hour but if you give me

11220
03:27:19,849 --> 03:27:19,859
work in even an hour but if you give me
 

11221
03:27:19,859 --> 03:27:21,889
work in even an hour but if you give me
like three hours or five hours or six

11222
03:27:21,889 --> 03:27:21,899
like three hours or five hours or six
 

11223
03:27:21,899 --> 03:27:24,170
like three hours or five hours or six
hours of uninterrupted work that's like

11224
03:27:24,170 --> 03:27:24,180
hours of uninterrupted work that's like
 

11225
03:27:24,180 --> 03:27:25,610
hours of uninterrupted work that's like
that's where I get most of my stuff done

11226
03:27:25,610 --> 03:27:25,620
that's where I get most of my stuff done
 

11227
03:27:25,620 --> 03:27:27,769
that's where I get most of my stuff done
so from the it just it'd be fun to

11228
03:27:27,769 --> 03:27:27,779
so from the it just it'd be fun to
 

11229
03:27:27,779 --> 03:27:29,510
so from the it just it'd be fun to
explore those when you did 15 minute

11230
03:27:29,510 --> 03:27:29,520
explore those when you did 15 minute
 

11231
03:27:29,520 --> 03:27:33,469
explore those when you did 15 minute
buckets so you have a day in front of

11232
03:27:33,469 --> 03:27:33,479
buckets so you have a day in front of
 

11233
03:27:33,479 --> 03:27:34,729
buckets so you have a day in front of
you yeah and you have like a Google

11234
03:27:34,729 --> 03:27:34,739
you yeah and you have like a Google
 

11235
03:27:34,739 --> 03:27:36,530
you yeah and you have like a Google
sheet or a spreadsheet or something yeah

11236
03:27:36,530 --> 03:27:36,540
sheet or a spreadsheet or something yeah
 

11237
03:27:36,540 --> 03:27:41,030
sheet or a spreadsheet or something yeah
I did an Excel Excel uh and you're

11238
03:27:41,030 --> 03:27:41,040
I did an Excel Excel uh and you're
 

11239
03:27:41,040 --> 03:27:43,010
I did an Excel Excel uh and you're
do you have a plan for the day or do you

11240
03:27:43,010 --> 03:27:43,020
do you have a plan for the day or do you
 

11241
03:27:43,020 --> 03:27:46,130
do you have a plan for the day or do you
go like when you did it uh or you just

11242
03:27:46,130 --> 03:27:46,140
go like when you did it uh or you just
 

11243
03:27:46,140 --> 03:27:47,330
go like when you did it uh or you just
literally

11244
03:27:47,330 --> 03:27:47,340
literally
 

11245
03:27:47,340 --> 03:27:50,630
literally
sort of focus on a particular task and

11246
03:27:50,630 --> 03:27:50,640
sort of focus on a particular task and
 

11247
03:27:50,640 --> 03:27:52,070
sort of focus on a particular task and
then you're tracking as you're doing

11248
03:27:52,070 --> 03:27:52,080
then you're tracking as you're doing
 

11249
03:27:52,080 --> 03:27:54,110
then you're tracking as you're doing
that task of every 15 minutes yeah I

11250
03:27:54,110 --> 03:27:54,120
that task of every 15 minutes yeah I
 

11251
03:27:54,120 --> 03:27:56,090
that task of every 15 minutes yeah I
would kind of do it live

11252
03:27:56,090 --> 03:27:56,100
would kind of do it live
 

11253
03:27:56,100 --> 03:27:58,070
would kind of do it live
um I'm not so one of the reasons I'm so

11254
03:27:58,070 --> 03:27:58,080
um I'm not so one of the reasons I'm so
 

11255
03:27:58,080 --> 03:27:59,330
um I'm not so one of the reasons I'm so
obsessive about it is because I'm not

11256
03:27:59,330 --> 03:27:59,340
obsessive about it is because I'm not
 

11257
03:27:59,340 --> 03:28:02,750
obsessive about it is because I'm not
organized by nature and I lost like in

11258
03:28:02,750 --> 03:28:02,760
organized by nature and I lost like in
 

11259
03:28:02,760 --> 03:28:05,150
organized by nature and I lost like in
college I learned how much

11260
03:28:05,150 --> 03:28:05,160
college I learned how much
 

11261
03:28:05,160 --> 03:28:07,729
college I learned how much
lack of organization can just hurt you

11262
03:28:07,729 --> 03:28:07,739
lack of organization can just hurt you
 

11263
03:28:07,739 --> 03:28:09,650
lack of organization can just hurt you
in terms of output

11264
03:28:09,650 --> 03:28:09,660
in terms of output
 

11265
03:28:09,660 --> 03:28:11,690
in terms of output
and so I realized like I just had to

11266
03:28:11,690 --> 03:28:11,700
and so I realized like I just had to
 

11267
03:28:11,700 --> 03:28:13,910
and so I realized like I just had to
build systems that would enable me to

11268
03:28:13,910 --> 03:28:13,920
build systems that would enable me to
 

11269
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:17,570
build systems that would enable me to
become more organized so uh

11270
03:28:17,570 --> 03:28:17,580
become more organized so uh
 

11271
03:28:17,580 --> 03:28:20,690
become more organized so uh
really I think I think that doing that

11272
03:28:20,690 --> 03:28:20,700
really I think I think that doing that
 

11273
03:28:20,700 --> 03:28:23,570
really I think I think that doing that
really taught me a lot about time in the

11274
03:28:23,570 --> 03:28:23,580
really taught me a lot about time in the
 

11275
03:28:23,580 --> 03:28:25,070
really taught me a lot about time in the
same way that tracking calories can

11276
03:28:25,070 --> 03:28:25,080
same way that tracking calories can
 

11277
03:28:25,080 --> 03:28:26,630
same way that tracking calories can
teach you about food yes like just

11278
03:28:26,630 --> 03:28:26,640
teach you about food yes like just
 

11279
03:28:26,640 --> 03:28:28,450
teach you about food yes like just
learning accounting for these things

11280
03:28:28,450 --> 03:28:28,460
learning accounting for these things
 

11281
03:28:28,460 --> 03:28:31,070
learning accounting for these things
will give you skills that eventually you

11282
03:28:31,070 --> 03:28:31,080
will give you skills that eventually you
 

11283
03:28:31,080 --> 03:28:32,450
will give you skills that eventually you
might not need to track on such a

11284
03:28:32,450 --> 03:28:32,460
might not need to track on such a
 

11285
03:28:32,460 --> 03:28:34,370
might not need to track on such a
granular level because you've kind of

11286
03:28:34,370 --> 03:28:34,380
granular level because you've kind of
 

11287
03:28:34,380 --> 03:28:36,590
granular level because you've kind of
like figured out so that's kind of how I

11288
03:28:36,590 --> 03:28:36,600
like figured out so that's kind of how I
 

11289
03:28:36,600 --> 03:28:38,750
like figured out so that's kind of how I
feel about it I think everyone should if

11290
03:28:38,750 --> 03:28:38,760
feel about it I think everyone should if
 

11291
03:28:38,760 --> 03:28:40,130
feel about it I think everyone should if
you care about productivity and stuff

11292
03:28:40,130 --> 03:28:40,140
you care about productivity and stuff
 

11293
03:28:40,140 --> 03:28:42,229
you care about productivity and stuff
should do a little bit of it I don't

11294
03:28:42,229 --> 03:28:42,239
should do a little bit of it I don't
 

11295
03:28:42,239 --> 03:28:43,849
should do a little bit of it I don't
think it's sustainable in the long term

11296
03:28:43,849 --> 03:28:43,859
think it's sustainable in the long term
 

11297
03:28:43,859 --> 03:28:45,469
think it's sustainable in the long term
it just takes so much effort and time to

11298
03:28:45,469 --> 03:28:45,479
it just takes so much effort and time to
 

11299
03:28:45,479 --> 03:28:47,809
it just takes so much effort and time to
like and I think the marginal

11300
03:28:47,809 --> 03:28:47,819
like and I think the marginal
 

11301
03:28:47,819 --> 03:28:50,090
like and I think the marginal
effect of it in the long term is kind of

11302
03:28:50,090 --> 03:28:50,100
effect of it in the long term is kind of
 

11303
03:28:50,100 --> 03:28:51,950
effect of it in the long term is kind of
minimal once you learn these basic

11304
03:28:51,950 --> 03:28:51,960
minimal once you learn these basic
 

11305
03:28:51,960 --> 03:28:54,110
minimal once you learn these basic
skills but um

11306
03:28:54,110 --> 03:28:54,120
skills but um
 

11307
03:28:54,120 --> 03:28:55,670
skills but um
yeah I was basically tracking like live

11308
03:28:55,670 --> 03:28:55,680
yeah I was basically tracking like live
 

11309
03:28:55,680 --> 03:29:00,349
yeah I was basically tracking like live
what I did and what I saw is that a lot

11310
03:29:00,349 --> 03:29:00,359
what I did and what I saw is that a lot
 

11311
03:29:00,359 --> 03:29:02,870
what I did and what I saw is that a lot
of my real work would be done in small

11312
03:29:02,870 --> 03:29:02,880
of my real work would be done in small
 

11313
03:29:02,880 --> 03:29:04,670
of my real work would be done in small
sections of the day and then it'd be

11314
03:29:04,670 --> 03:29:04,680
sections of the day and then it'd be
 

11315
03:29:04,680 --> 03:29:06,889
sections of the day and then it'd be
like a lot of just nothing like a lot of

11316
03:29:06,889 --> 03:29:06,899
like a lot of just nothing like a lot of
 

11317
03:29:06,899 --> 03:29:09,530
like a lot of just nothing like a lot of
small things where I'm busy but little

11318
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:09,540
small things where I'm busy but little
 

11319
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:12,530
small things where I'm busy but little
is being achieved and so I think that's

11320
03:29:12,530 --> 03:29:12,540
is being achieved and so I think that's
 

11321
03:29:12,540 --> 03:29:15,229
is being achieved and so I think that's
a really interesting Insight I've never

11322
03:29:15,229 --> 03:29:15,239
a really interesting Insight I've never
 

11323
03:29:15,239 --> 03:29:17,150
a really interesting Insight I've never
figured out how to unbusy myself and

11324
03:29:17,150 --> 03:29:17,160
figured out how to unbusy myself and
 

11325
03:29:17,160 --> 03:29:19,610
figured out how to unbusy myself and
focus on the like core Essentials I'm

11326
03:29:19,610 --> 03:29:19,620
focus on the like core Essentials I'm
 

11327
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:22,130
focus on the like core Essentials I'm
still getting to that but

11328
03:29:22,130 --> 03:29:22,140
still getting to that but
 

11329
03:29:22,140 --> 03:29:23,630
still getting to that but
um it is interesting realizing most of

11330
03:29:23,630 --> 03:29:23,640
um it is interesting realizing most of
 

11331
03:29:23,640 --> 03:29:25,429
um it is interesting realizing most of
your day is like a lot of nothing and

11332
03:29:25,429 --> 03:29:25,439
your day is like a lot of nothing and
 

11333
03:29:25,439 --> 03:29:27,290
your day is like a lot of nothing and
then like some real deep work where most

11334
03:29:27,290 --> 03:29:27,300
then like some real deep work where most
 

11335
03:29:27,300 --> 03:29:29,330
then like some real deep work where most
of your value comes from is like 20 of

11336
03:29:29,330 --> 03:29:29,340
of your value comes from is like 20 of
 

11337
03:29:29,340 --> 03:29:31,250
of your value comes from is like 20 of
your day yeah I try to start every day

11338
03:29:31,250 --> 03:29:31,260
your day yeah I try to start every day
 

11339
03:29:31,260 --> 03:29:33,170
your day yeah I try to start every day
with that so the hardest task of the day

11340
03:29:33,170 --> 03:29:33,180
with that so the hardest task of the day
 

11341
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:34,729
with that so the hardest task of the day
and you focus for long periods of time

11342
03:29:34,729 --> 03:29:34,739
and you focus for long periods of time
 

11343
03:29:34,739 --> 03:29:37,030
and you focus for long periods of time
and I also have the segment of two hours

11344
03:29:37,030 --> 03:29:37,040
and I also have the segment of two hours
 

11345
03:29:37,040 --> 03:29:39,349
and I also have the segment of two hours
or it's a set of tasks that I do every

11346
03:29:39,349 --> 03:29:39,359
or it's a set of tasks that I do every
 

11347
03:29:39,359 --> 03:29:42,229
or it's a set of tasks that I do every
single day the idea is you do that for

11348
03:29:42,229 --> 03:29:42,239
single day the idea is you do that for
 

11349
03:29:42,239 --> 03:29:44,090
single day the idea is you do that for
like your whole life it's like long-term

11350
03:29:44,090 --> 03:29:44,100
like your whole life it's like long-term
 

11351
03:29:44,100 --> 03:29:47,750
like your whole life it's like long-term
investment of Anki and it's just like

11352
03:29:47,750 --> 03:29:47,760
investment of Anki and it's just like
 

11353
03:29:47,760 --> 03:29:49,849
investment of Anki and it's just like
learning and

11354
03:29:49,849 --> 03:29:49,859
learning and
 

11355
03:29:49,859 --> 03:29:50,769
learning and
um

11356
03:29:50,769 --> 03:29:50,779
um
 

11357
03:29:50,779 --> 03:29:52,910
um
reminding yourself of facts you know

11358
03:29:52,910 --> 03:29:52,920
reminding yourself of facts you know
 

11359
03:29:52,920 --> 03:29:55,010
reminding yourself of facts you know
they're useful in your everyday life and

11360
03:29:55,010 --> 03:29:55,020
they're useful in your everyday life and

little bit of music piano piano so like

11364
03:29:59,870 --> 03:29:59,880
little bit of music piano piano so like
 

11365
03:29:59,880 --> 03:30:01,550
little bit of music piano piano so like
keeping that regular thing is part of

11366
03:30:01,550 --> 03:30:01,560
keeping that regular thing is part of
 

11367
03:30:01,560 --> 03:30:03,410
keeping that regular thing is part of
your life and one thing that I've really

11368
03:30:03,410 --> 03:30:03,420
your life and one thing that I've really
 

11369
03:30:03,420 --> 03:30:05,150
your life and one thing that I've really
taken from this is because I've read all

11370
03:30:05,150 --> 03:30:05,160
taken from this is because I've read all
 

11371
03:30:05,160 --> 03:30:07,490
taken from this is because I've read all
the like I had a self-improvement phase

11372
03:30:07,490 --> 03:30:07,500
the like I had a self-improvement phase
 

11373
03:30:07,500 --> 03:30:09,650
the like I had a self-improvement phase
in my early 20s

11374
03:30:09,650 --> 03:30:09,660
in my early 20s
 

11375
03:30:09,660 --> 03:30:11,929
in my early 20s
um and one thing you learn is that

11376
03:30:11,929 --> 03:30:11,939
um and one thing you learn is that
 

11377
03:30:11,939 --> 03:30:13,550
um and one thing you learn is that
everyone wants to give you a broad

11378
03:30:13,550 --> 03:30:13,560
everyone wants to give you a broad
 

11379
03:30:13,560 --> 03:30:14,990
everyone wants to give you a broad
General solution

11380
03:30:14,990 --> 03:30:15,000
General solution
 

11381
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:19,190
General solution
but really the real trick of figuring

11382
03:30:19,190 --> 03:30:19,200
but really the real trick of figuring
 

11383
03:30:19,200 --> 03:30:21,889
but really the real trick of figuring
out like optimizing is figuring out the

11384
03:30:21,889 --> 03:30:21,899
out like optimizing is figuring out the
 

11385
03:30:21,899 --> 03:30:23,690
out like optimizing is figuring out the
things that work for you specifically so

11386
03:30:23,690 --> 03:30:23,700
things that work for you specifically so
 

11387
03:30:23,700 --> 03:30:25,550
things that work for you specifically so
like one interesting thing you said is

11388
03:30:25,550 --> 03:30:25,560
like one interesting thing you said is
 

11389
03:30:25,560 --> 03:30:27,530
like one interesting thing you said is
like oh I like to do my hard work at the

11390
03:30:27,530 --> 03:30:27,540
like oh I like to do my hard work at the
 

11391
03:30:27,540 --> 03:30:29,090
like oh I like to do my hard work at the
beginning of the day

11392
03:30:29,090 --> 03:30:29,100
beginning of the day
 

11393
03:30:29,100 --> 03:30:29,690
beginning of the day
um

11394
03:30:29,690 --> 03:30:29,700
um
 

11395
03:30:29,700 --> 03:30:32,090
um
I know a lot of people recommend this

11396
03:30:32,090 --> 03:30:32,100
I know a lot of people recommend this
 

11397

I know a lot of people recommend this
I've tried so many times and I just do

11398
03:30:35,510 --> 03:30:35,520
I've tried so many times and I just do
 

11399

um and so like a lot of my videos which
 

11409
03:30:47,340 --> 03:30:49,309
um and so like a lot of my videos which
you'll see which is like lit from this

11410
03:30:49,309 --> 03:30:49,319
you'll see which is like lit from this
 

11411
03:30:49,319 --> 03:30:50,929
you'll see which is like lit from this
studio which appears to be daytime it's

11412
03:30:50,929 --> 03:30:50,939
studio which appears to be daytime it's
 

11413
03:30:50,939 --> 03:30:53,870
studio which appears to be daytime it's
like shot at 3am you know just like in a

11414
03:30:53,870 --> 03:30:53,880
like shot at 3am you know just like in a
 

11415
03:30:53,880 --> 03:30:55,670
like shot at 3am you know just like in a
caffeine field Rush

11416
03:30:55,670 --> 03:30:55,680
caffeine field Rush
 

11417
03:30:55,680 --> 03:30:57,530
caffeine field Rush
um but that's kind of how it works for

11418
03:30:57,530 --> 03:30:57,540
um but that's kind of how it works for
 

11419
03:30:57,540 --> 03:31:00,110
um but that's kind of how it works for
me and then also like with the social

11420
03:31:00,110 --> 03:31:00,120
me and then also like with the social
 

11421
03:31:00,120 --> 03:31:02,929
me and then also like with the social
outlets and stuff like that which it's

11422
03:31:02,929 --> 03:31:02,939
outlets and stuff like that which it's
 

11423
03:31:02,939 --> 03:31:04,969
outlets and stuff like that which it's
easy and I know I feel like we think

11424
03:31:04,969 --> 03:31:04,979
easy and I know I feel like we think
 

11425
03:31:04,979 --> 03:31:06,889
easy and I know I feel like we think
similarly on this so it's easy to

11426
03:31:06,889 --> 03:31:06,899
similarly on this so it's easy to
 

11427
03:31:06,899 --> 03:31:09,650
similarly on this so it's easy to
Discount these things as less relevant

11428
03:31:09,650 --> 03:31:09,660
Discount these things as less relevant
 

11429
03:31:09,660 --> 03:31:12,070
Discount these things as less relevant
because they don't have quantitative

11430
03:31:12,070 --> 03:31:12,080
because they don't have quantitative
 

11431
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:14,750
because they don't have quantitative
metrics associated with them

11432
03:31:14,750 --> 03:31:14,760
metrics associated with them
 

11433
03:31:14,760 --> 03:31:18,110
metrics associated with them
but in terms of longevity and like I

11434
03:31:18,110 --> 03:31:18,120
but in terms of longevity and like I
 

11435
03:31:18,120 --> 03:31:20,750
but in terms of longevity and like I
think to be able to do creative work

11436
03:31:20,750 --> 03:31:20,760
think to be able to do creative work
 

11437
03:31:20,760 --> 03:31:23,330
think to be able to do creative work
there's an amount of recharge and like

11438
03:31:23,330 --> 03:31:23,340
there's an amount of recharge and like
 

11439
03:31:23,340 --> 03:31:26,450
there's an amount of recharge and like
re-inputting stuff that is frequently

11440
03:31:26,450 --> 03:31:26,460
re-inputting stuff that is frequently
 

11441
03:31:26,460 --> 03:31:28,070
re-inputting stuff that is frequently
discounted by People Like Us who are

03:31:28,070 --> 03:31:28,080
discounted by People Like Us who are
 

11443
03:31:28,080 --> 03:31:29,809

11444
03:31:29,809 --> 03:31:29,819
like obsessed with you know quantitative
 

11445
03:31:29,819 --> 03:31:32,690
like obsessed with you know quantitative
metrics and so I really found that some

11446
03:31:32,690 --> 03:31:32,700
metrics and so I really found that some
 

11447
03:31:32,700 --> 03:31:34,610
metrics and so I really found that some
of my best work gets done after I take

11448
03:31:34,610 --> 03:31:34,620
of my best work gets done after I take
 

11449
03:31:34,620 --> 03:31:36,590
of my best work gets done after I take
like a break or I like I'll I'll go play

11450
03:31:36,590 --> 03:31:36,600
like a break or I like I'll I'll go play
 

11451

like live sets uh of music and I mean

like that's like for me really
 

11455
03:31:41,399 --> 03:31:43,550
like that's like for me really
recharging but nowhere on a spreadsheet

11456
03:31:43,550 --> 03:31:43,560
recharging but nowhere on a spreadsheet
 

11457
03:31:43,560 --> 03:31:45,170
recharging but nowhere on a spreadsheet
is that going to show up as productive

11458
03:31:45,170 --> 03:31:45,180
is that going to show up as productive
 

11459
03:31:45,180 --> 03:31:48,469
is that going to show up as productive
or like meaningful but for me

03:31:48,469 --> 03:31:48,479
or like meaningful but for me
 

11461
03:31:48,479 --> 03:31:50,450

for whatever reason it recharges me in a
 

11463
03:31:50,460 --> 03:31:52,190
for whatever reason it recharges me in a
way that like I need to pay attention to

11464
03:31:52,190 --> 03:31:52,200
way that like I need to pay attention to
 

11465
03:31:52,200 --> 03:31:53,750
way that like I need to pay attention to
yeah for sure I usually have a

11466
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:53,760
yeah for sure I usually have a

I'm socially interacting with people and
I evaluate how I'm getting roasted right

11472
03:31:59,510 --> 03:31:59,520
I evaluate how I'm getting roasted right
 

11473
03:31:59,520 --> 03:32:02,750
I evaluate how I'm getting roasted right
now no I'm not it's actually I uh

11474
03:32:02,750 --> 03:32:02,760
now no I'm not it's actually I uh
 

11475
03:32:02,760 --> 03:32:05,269
now no I'm not it's actually I uh
probably roasting myself but I do find

a realistic sense of the problems in the

11632
03:35:03,710 --> 03:35:03,720
a realistic sense of the problems in the
 

11633
03:35:03,720 --> 03:35:05,630
a realistic sense of the problems in the
world and with a realistic sense of like

11634

world and with a realistic sense of like
 

11635
03:35:05,640 --> 03:35:09,290
world and with a realistic sense of like
the scale and the challenge ahead

11636
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:09,300
the scale and the challenge ahead
 

11637
03:35:09,300 --> 03:35:12,050
the scale and the challenge ahead
um I I actually think it's much braver

11638
03:35:12,050 --> 03:35:12,060
um I I actually think it's much braver
 

11639
03:35:12,060 --> 03:35:13,910
um I I actually think it's much braver
to be an optimist

11640
03:35:13,910 --> 03:35:13,920
to be an optimist
 

11641
03:35:13,920 --> 03:35:16,010
to be an optimist
when you're aware of what's going on in

11642
03:35:16,010 --> 03:35:16,020
when you're aware of what's going on in
 

11643
03:35:16,020 --> 03:35:17,510
when you're aware of what's going on in
the world than to be a cynic I think

11644
03:35:17,510 --> 03:35:17,520
the world than to be a cynic I think
 

11645
03:35:17,520 --> 03:35:21,410
the world than to be a cynic I think
being a complete cynic is maybe I'm not

11646
03:35:21,410 --> 03:35:21,420
being a complete cynic is maybe I'm not
 

11647
03:35:21,420 --> 03:35:22,969
being a complete cynic is maybe I'm not
saying it's wrong but I'm saying it's

11648
03:35:22,969 --> 03:35:22,979
saying it's wrong but I'm saying it's
 

11649
03:35:22,979 --> 03:35:26,570
saying it's wrong but I'm saying it's
maybe the easier way just mentally to

11650
03:35:26,570 --> 03:35:26,580
maybe the easier way just mentally to
 

11651
03:35:26,580 --> 03:35:29,990
maybe the easier way just mentally to
cope with so much negativity it's like

11652
03:35:29,990 --> 03:35:30,000
cope with so much negativity it's like
 

11653
03:35:30,000 --> 03:35:31,849
cope with so much negativity it's like
just saying well it's all bad it's all

11654
03:35:31,849 --> 03:35:31,859
just saying well it's all bad it's all
 

11655
03:35:31,859 --> 03:35:34,250
just saying well it's all bad it's all
doomed to fail it's all gonna go bust

11656
03:35:34,250 --> 03:35:34,260
doomed to fail it's all gonna go bust
 

11657
03:35:34,260 --> 03:35:35,690
doomed to fail it's all gonna go bust
is

11658
03:35:35,690 --> 03:35:35,700
is
 

11659
03:35:35,700 --> 03:35:38,450
is
easier

11660
03:35:38,450 --> 03:35:38,460
easier
 

11661
03:35:38,460 --> 03:35:41,750
easier
yeah that leap into a believing that's a

11662
03:35:41,750 --> 03:35:41,760
yeah that leap into a believing that's a

11677
03:35:57,660 --> 03:35:59,030
are optimistic but but oftentimes
um just because someone's optimistic

11678
03:35:59,030 --> 03:35:59,040
um just because someone's optimistic
 

11679
03:35:59,040 --> 03:36:00,290
um just because someone's optimistic
does not mean they're naive they could

11680
03:36:00,290 --> 03:36:00,300
does not mean they're naive they could
 

11681
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:02,990

um
like you sort of have to do this weird

11822
03:38:45,950 --> 03:38:45,960
like you sort of have to do this weird
 

11823
03:38:45,960 --> 03:38:48,050
like you sort of have to do this weird
thing where you acknowledge how

11824
03:38:48,050 --> 03:38:48,060
thing where you acknowledge how
 

11825
03:38:48,060 --> 03:38:49,309
thing where you acknowledge how
difficult it will be to achieve

11826
03:38:49,309 --> 03:38:49,319
difficult it will be to achieve
 

11827
03:38:49,319 --> 03:38:51,710
difficult it will be to achieve
something great while also Having the

11828
03:38:51,710 --> 03:38:51,720
something great while also Having the
 

11829
03:38:51,720 --> 03:38:53,450

and understanding that other people
 

11833
03:38:55,920 --> 03:38:57,650
and understanding that other people
don't have it figured out I think is a

11834
03:38:57,650 --> 03:38:57,660
don't have it figured out I think is a
 

11835
03:38:57,660 --> 03:38:59,990
don't have it figured out I think is a
big theme of my work which is that

11836
03:38:59,990 --> 03:39:00,000
big theme of my work which is that
 

11837
03:39:00,000 --> 03:39:02,809
big theme of my work which is that
everyone wants like the guru to show

11838
03:39:02,809 --> 03:39:02,819
everyone wants like the guru to show
 

11839
03:39:02,819 --> 03:39:05,630
everyone wants like the guru to show
them the way to show them the secrets so

11840
03:39:05,630 --> 03:39:05,640
them the way to show them the secrets so
 

11841
03:39:05,640 --> 03:39:07,969
them the way to show them the secrets so
much of life and achieving anything is

11842
03:39:07,969 --> 03:39:07,979
much of life and achieving anything is
 

11843
03:39:07,979 --> 03:39:10,130
much of life and achieving anything is
learning to figure it out yourself and

11844
03:39:10,130 --> 03:39:10,140
learning to figure it out yourself and
 

11845
03:39:10,140 --> 03:39:13,429
learning to figure it out yourself and
like The Meta skill of being an

11846
03:39:13,429 --> 03:39:13,439
like The Meta skill of being an
 

11847
03:39:13,439 --> 03:39:15,229
like The Meta skill of being an
autodidactic where you can I don't know

11848
03:39:15,229 --> 03:39:15,239
autodidactic where you can I don't know
 

11849
03:39:15,239 --> 03:39:16,370
autodidactic where you can I don't know
if I said that word right you basically

11850
03:39:16,370 --> 03:39:16,380
if I said that word right you basically
 

11851
03:39:16,380 --> 03:39:18,530
if I said that word right you basically
use self-teach you learn the meta skill

11852
03:39:18,530 --> 03:39:18,540
use self-teach you learn the meta skill
 

11853
03:39:18,540 --> 03:39:21,410
use self-teach you learn the meta skill
of like learning to learn I think that's

11854
03:39:21,410 --> 03:39:21,420
of like learning to learn I think that's
 

11855
03:39:21,420 --> 03:39:23,510
of like learning to learn I think that's
such an underrated aspect of Education

11856
03:39:23,510 --> 03:39:23,520
such an underrated aspect of Education
 

11857
03:39:23,520 --> 03:39:25,010
such an underrated aspect of Education
people leave education they go when am I

11858
03:39:25,010 --> 03:39:25,020
people leave education they go when am I
 

11859
03:39:25,020 --> 03:39:26,510
people leave education they go when am I
going to use two plus two we're not

11860
03:39:26,510 --> 03:39:26,520
going to use two plus two we're not
 

11861
03:39:26,520 --> 03:39:28,910
going to use two plus two we're not
going to learn you know use calculus but

11862
03:39:28,910 --> 03:39:28,920
going to learn you know use calculus but
 

11863
03:39:28,920 --> 03:39:30,469
going to learn you know use calculus but
so much of it is learning this higher

11864
03:39:30,469 --> 03:39:30,479
so much of it is learning this higher
 

11865
03:39:30,479 --> 03:39:32,870
so much of it is learning this higher
level abstract thinking that can apply

11866
03:39:32,870 --> 03:39:32,880
level abstract thinking that can apply
 

11867
03:39:32,880 --> 03:39:35,510
level abstract thinking that can apply
to anything and

11868
03:39:35,510 --> 03:39:35,520
to anything and
 

11869
03:39:35,520 --> 03:39:39,490
to anything and
getting that early on is um

11870
03:39:39,490 --> 03:39:39,500
getting that early on is um
 

11871
03:39:39,500 --> 03:39:42,769
getting that early on is um
incredibly powerful so yeah I would say

11872
03:39:42,769 --> 03:39:42,779
incredibly powerful so yeah I would say
 

11873
03:39:42,779 --> 03:39:45,530
incredibly powerful so yeah I would say
like a lot of it is

11874
03:39:45,530 --> 03:39:45,540
like a lot of it is
 

11875
03:39:45,540 --> 03:39:47,809
like a lot of it is
I guess to some extent like you kind of

11876
03:39:47,809 --> 03:39:47,819
I guess to some extent like you kind of
 

11877
03:39:47,819 --> 03:39:49,190
I guess to some extent like you kind of
have to do that Steve Jobs thing where

11878
03:39:49,190 --> 03:39:49,200
have to do that Steve Jobs thing where
 

11879
03:39:49,200 --> 03:39:51,229
have to do that Steve Jobs thing where
you realize that nobody else in the

11880
03:39:51,229 --> 03:39:51,239
you realize that nobody else in the
 

11881
03:39:51,239 --> 03:39:52,790
you realize that nobody else in the
world is smarter than you

11882
03:39:52,790 --> 03:39:52,800
world is smarter than you
 

11883
03:39:52,800 --> 03:39:55,490
world is smarter than you
and that both means that like they can't

11884
03:39:55,490 --> 03:39:55,500
and that both means that like they can't
 

11885
03:39:55,500 --> 03:39:56,870
and that both means that like they can't
show you the perfect way but it also

11886
03:39:56,870 --> 03:39:56,880
show you the perfect way but it also
 

11887
03:39:56,880 --> 03:39:58,670
show you the perfect way but it also
means you could do great things and kind

11888
03:39:58,670 --> 03:39:58,680
means you could do great things and kind
 

11889
03:39:58,680 --> 03:39:59,990
means you could do great things and kind
of chart your own path I don't know

11890
03:39:59,990 --> 03:40:00,000
of chart your own path I don't know
 

11891
03:40:00,000 --> 03:40:02,210
of chart your own path I don't know
that's so cheesy this is why I'm giving

11892
03:40:02,210 --> 03:40:02,220
that's so cheesy this is why I'm giving
 

11893
03:40:02,220 --> 03:40:04,610
that's so cheesy this is why I'm giving
advice it's like a cheese I mean and I

11894
03:40:04,610 --> 03:40:04,620
advice it's like a cheese I mean and I
 

11895
03:40:04,620 --> 03:40:07,550
advice it's like a cheese I mean and I
don't think it is I think my my journey

11896
03:40:07,550 --> 03:40:07,560
don't think it is I think my my journey
 

11897
03:40:07,560 --> 03:40:10,250
don't think it is I think my my journey
is so full of luck and like specific

11898
03:40:10,250 --> 03:40:10,260
is so full of luck and like specific
 

11899
03:40:10,260 --> 03:40:12,410
is so full of luck and like specific
experience I wonder how generalizable it

11900
03:40:12,410 --> 03:40:12,420
experience I wonder how generalizable it
 

11901
03:40:12,420 --> 03:40:13,550
experience I wonder how generalizable it
is but

11902
03:40:13,550 --> 03:40:13,560
is but
 

11903
03:40:13,560 --> 03:40:15,469
is but
if I've learned anything and if I could

11904
03:40:15,469 --> 03:40:15,479
if I've learned anything and if I could
 

11905
03:40:15,479 --> 03:40:17,570
if I've learned anything and if I could
talk specifically to myself I guess

11906
03:40:17,570 --> 03:40:17,580
talk specifically to myself I guess
 

11907
03:40:17,580 --> 03:40:18,950
talk specifically to myself I guess
that's what I would say I mean you

11908

11911
03:40:21,420 --> 03:40:23,389
you've taken a very difficult path
and I think part of taking that path

11912
03:40:23,389 --> 03:40:23,399
and I think part of taking that path
 

11913
03:40:23,399 --> 03:40:26,210
and I think part of taking that path
like of a great journalist uh frankly is
