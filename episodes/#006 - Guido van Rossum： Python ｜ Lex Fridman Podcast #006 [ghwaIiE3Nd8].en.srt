don't think there's a creative element
to the design you know some would say

00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:24,889
to the design you know some would say

our design of a language is art I'm not

our design of a language is art I'm not
disagreeing with that I'm just saying

disagreeing with that I'm just saying

00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:37,320
disagreeing with that I'm just saying
that sort of I don't feel direct

I designed my own circuits that were

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:35,360
I designed my own circuits that were
 

205
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,570
I designed my own circuits that were
sort of interesting somewhat

00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:40,580
sort of interesting somewhat
 

207
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,980
sort of interesting somewhat
but a lot of that time I literally just

208
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:43,990
but a lot of that time I literally just
 

209
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,320
but a lot of that time I literally just
took a model kit and follow the

took a model kit and follow the
 

211
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,209
took a model kit and follow the

I mean that I think the first few years

214
00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:52,039
I mean that I think the first few years
 

215
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:54,369
I mean that I think the first few years
that I build electronics kits I really

216
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:54,379
that I build electronics kits I really
 

217
00:05:54,379 --> 00:05:57,700
that I build electronics kits I really
did not have enough understanding of

did not have enough understanding of

sort of electronics to really understand

what I was doing I mean I could debug it

what I was doing I mean I could debug it
 

223
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,709
what I was doing I mean I could debug it
and I could sort of follow the

00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:05,719
and I could sort of follow the
 

225
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:08,649
and I could sort of follow the
instructions very carefully which has

226
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:08,659
instructions very carefully which has
 

227
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,689
instructions very carefully which has
had which has always stayed with me but

00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:10,699
had which has always stayed with me but
 

229
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,999
had which has always stayed with me but
I had a very naive model of like how a

230
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:16,009
I had a very naive model of like how a
 

231
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,930
I had a very naive model of like how a
transistor works and I don't think that

232
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:19,940
transistor works and I don't think that
 

233
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,760
transistor works and I don't think that
that in those days I had any

that in those days I had any
 

235

that in those days I had any
understanding of coils and capacitors

understanding of coils and capacitors
 

237
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,850
understanding of coils and capacitors
which which actually sort of was a major

238
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:30,860
which which actually sort of was a major
 

239
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,800
which which actually sort of was a major
problem when I started to build more

240
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:32,810
problem when I started to build more
 

241
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,189
problem when I started to build more
complex digital circuits because I was

242
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:36,199
complex digital circuits because I was
 

243
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,429
complex digital circuits because I was
unaware of the sort of the analog part

244
00:06:39,429 --> 00:06:39,439
unaware of the sort of the analog part
 

245
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,080
unaware of the sort of the analog part
of the how they actually work and I

246
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,090
of the how they actually work and I
 

247
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,149
of the how they actually work and I
would have things that the scheme the

248
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:49,159
would have things that the scheme the
 

249
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,249
would have things that the scheme the
schematic looked every everything looked

250
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:51,259
schematic looked every everything looked
 

251
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,869
schematic looked every everything looked
fine and it didn't work and what I

252
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:55,879
fine and it didn't work and what I
 

253
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,260
fine and it didn't work and what I
didn't realize was that there was some

254
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:58,270
didn't realize was that there was some
 

255
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,180
didn't realize was that there was some
megahertz level oscillation that was

256
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,190
megahertz level oscillation that was
 

257
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,600
megahertz level oscillation that was
throwing the circuit off because I had a

258
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:03,610
throwing the circuit off because I had a
 

259
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,379
throwing the circuit off because I had a
sort of two wires were too close or the

260
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:08,389
sort of two wires were too close or the
 

261
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:12,329
sort of two wires were too close or the
switches were were kind of poorly built

262
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:12,339
switches were were kind of poorly built
 

263
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:17,050
switches were were kind of poorly built
but through that time I think it's

264
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,060
but through that time I think it's
 

265
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,309
but through that time I think it's
really interesting and instructive to

266
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
really interesting and instructive to
 

267
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,619
really interesting and instructive to
think about because as echoes of it are

268
00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:20,629
think about because as echoes of it are
 

269
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:23,800
think about because as echoes of it are
in this time now so in the 1970s the

270
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:23,810
in this time now so in the 1970s the
 

271
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,670
in this time now so in the 1970s the
personal computer was being born

272
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:26,680
personal computer was being born
 

273
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,339
personal computer was being born
so did you sense in tinkering with these

274
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:30,349
so did you sense in tinkering with these
 

275
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:33,279
so did you sense in tinkering with these
circuits did you sense the encroaching

276
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:33,289
circuits did you sense the encroaching
 

277
00:07:33,289 --> 00:07:35,890
circuits did you sense the encroaching
revolution and personal computing so if

278
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:35,900
revolution and personal computing so if
 

279
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,350
revolution and personal computing so if
at that point you're sick we will see

280
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:38,360
at that point you're sick we will see
 

281
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,689
at that point you're sick we will see
you down and ask you to predict the 80s

282
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:40,699
you down and ask you to predict the 80s
 

283
00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:43,600
you down and ask you to predict the 80s
and the 90s do you think you would be

284
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:43,610
and the 90s do you think you would be
 

285
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:47,350
and the 90s do you think you would be
able to do so successfully to unroll

286
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:47,360
able to do so successfully to unroll
 

287
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,610
able to do so successfully to unroll
this the process that's no I had no clue

00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:51,620
this the process that's no I had no clue

remember I think in the summer after my
 

293
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,010
remember I think in the summer after my
senior year or maybe it was the summer

I think when I was 18 I went on a trip

298
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:08,110
I think when I was 18 I went on a trip
 

299

I think when I was 18 I went on a trip
to the Math Olympiad in Eastern Europe

to the Math Olympiad in Eastern Europe
 

301
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,410
to the Math Olympiad in Eastern Europe
and there was like I was part of the

302
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:14,420
and there was like I was part of the
 

303
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,020
and there was like I was part of the
Dutch team and there were other nerdy

304
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,030
Dutch team and there were other nerdy
 

305
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,570
Dutch team and there were other nerdy
kids that sort of had different

306
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:19,580
kids that sort of had different
 

307
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,880
kids that sort of had different
experiences and one of them told me

308
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:21,890
experiences and one of them told me
 

309
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,010
experiences and one of them told me
about this amazing thing called a

310
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,020
about this amazing thing called a
 

311
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,480
about this amazing thing called a
computer and I had never heard that word

312
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:27,490
computer and I had never heard that word

my own explorations in electronics were

my own explorations in electronics were
 

315
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,510
my own explorations in electronics were
sort of about very simple digital

316
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:34,520
sort of about very simple digital
 

317
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:39,790
sort of about very simple digital
circuits and I I had sort of I had the

318

circuits and I I had sort of I had the
 

319
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,790
circuits and I I had sort of I had the
idea that I somewhat understood how a

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,120
idea that I somewhat understood how a
digital calculator worked hmm and so

322
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:46,130
digital calculator worked hmm and so
 

323
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,560
digital calculator worked hmm and so
there is maybe some echoes of computers

324
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:50,570
there is maybe some echoes of computers
 

325
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,720
there is maybe some echoes of computers
there but I didn't didn't I never made

326
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:52,730
there but I didn't didn't I never made
 

327
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,720
there but I didn't didn't I never made
that connection I didn't know that when

328
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,730
that connection I didn't know that when
 

329
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,780
that connection I didn't know that when
my parents were paying for magazine

330
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:58,790
my parents were paying for magazine
 

331
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,630
my parents were paying for magazine
subscriptions using punched cards that

332
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:01,640
subscriptions using punched cards that
 

333
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,000
subscriptions using punched cards that
there was something called a computer

334
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:04,010
there was something called a computer
 

335
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,340
there was something called a computer
that was involved that read those cards

336
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,350
that was involved that read those cards
 

337
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,570
that was involved that read those cards
and transferred the money between

338
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:07,580
and transferred the money between
 

339
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,360
and transferred the money between
accounts that was also not really

340
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,370
accounts that was also not really
 

341
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,940
accounts that was also not really
interested in those things it was only

342
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:12,950
interested in those things it was only
 

343
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,930
interested in those things it was only
when I went to university to study math

344
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:16,940
when I went to university to study math
 

345
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,500
when I went to university to study math
that I found out that they had a

346
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:20,510
that I found out that they had a
 

347
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,630
that I found out that they had a
computer and students were allowed to

348
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:22,640
computer and students were allowed to
 

349
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,790
computer and students were allowed to
use it and there were some you're

350
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:24,800
use it and there were some you're
 

351
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,530
use it and there were some you're
supposed to talk to that computer by

352
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:26,540
supposed to talk to that computer by
 

353
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,350
supposed to talk to that computer by
programming it what did that feel like

354
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
programming it what did that feel like
 

355
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,540
programming it what did that feel like
yeah that was the only thing you could

356
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:31,550
yeah that was the only thing you could
 

357
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,050
yeah that was the only thing you could
do with it

358
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,060
do with it
 

359
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:34,500
do with it
I think the computer wasn't really

360
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:34,510
I think the computer wasn't really
 

361
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,790
I think the computer wasn't really
connected to the real world the only

362
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:36,800
connected to the real world the only
 

363
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
connected to the real world the only
thing you could do was sort of you typed

364
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:40,730
thing you could do was sort of you typed
 

365
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,840
thing you could do was sort of you typed
your program on a bunch of punched cards

366
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:42,850
your program on a bunch of punched cards
 

367
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:45,940
your program on a bunch of punched cards
you gave the punched cards to the

368
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:45,950
you gave the punched cards to the
 

369
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,910
you gave the punched cards to the
operator and an hour later the operator

370
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:48,920
operator and an hour later the operator
 

371
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,810
operator and an hour later the operator
gave you back your printout and so all

372
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:52,820
gave you back your printout and so all
 

373
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,250
gave you back your printout and so all
you could do was write a program that

374
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:56,260
you could do was write a program that
 

375
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,490
you could do was write a program that
did something very abstract and I don't

376
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:00,500
did something very abstract and I don't
 

377
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,010
did something very abstract and I don't
even remember what my first forays into

378
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,020
even remember what my first forays into
 

379
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,310
even remember what my first forays into
programming were

380
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:04,320
programming were
 

381
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,740
programming were
but they were sort of doing simple math

382
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:09,750
but they were sort of doing simple math
 

383
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,980
but they were sort of doing simple math
exercises and just to learn how a

384
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:12,990
exercises and just to learn how a
 

385
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,770
exercises and just to learn how a
programming language worked did you

386
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:15,780
programming language worked did you
 

387
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:19,790
programming language worked did you
sense ok first year of college you see

388
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:19,800
sense ok first year of college you see
 

389
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,830
sense ok first year of college you see
this computer you're able to have a

390
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:21,840
this computer you're able to have a
 

391
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,500
this computer you're able to have a
program and it generates some output did

392
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:24,510
program and it generates some output did
 

393
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:28,090
program and it generates some output did
you start seeing the possibility of this

394
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,100
you start seeing the possibility of this
 

395
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,040
you start seeing the possibility of this
or was it a continuation of the

396
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:31,050
or was it a continuation of the
 

397
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,560
or was it a continuation of the
tinkering with circuits the did you

398
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:33,570
tinkering with circuits the did you
 

399
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,990
tinkering with circuits the did you
start to imagine that one the personal

400
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
start to imagine that one the personal
 

401
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,570
start to imagine that one the personal
computer but did you see it as something

402
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:38,580
computer but did you see it as something
 

403
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,500
computer but did you see it as something
that is a tool so got a tool like a word

404
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:42,510
that is a tool so got a tool like a word
 

405
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,630
that is a tool so got a tool like a word
processing tool maybe maybe for gaming

406
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
processing tool maybe maybe for gaming
 

407
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,580
processing tool maybe maybe for gaming
or something or did you start to imagine

408
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:46,590
or something or did you start to imagine
 

409
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:48,530
or something or did you start to imagine
that it could be you know going to the

410
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:48,540
that it could be you know going to the
 

411
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,640
that it could be you know going to the
world of robotics

412
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:49,650
world of robotics
 

413
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,160
world of robotics
like you you know the Franklin is that

414
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,170
like you you know the Franklin is that
 

415
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,080
like you you know the Franklin is that
picture that you could create an

416
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,090
picture that you could create an
 

417
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,820
picture that you could create an
artificial being there's like another

418
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:55,830
artificial being there's like another
 

419
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,300
artificial being there's like another
entity in front of you you did not say I

420
00:10:59,300 --> 00:10:59,310
entity in front of you you did not say I
 

421
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:02,570
entity in front of you you did not say I
don't think I really saw it that way I

422
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:02,580
don't think I really saw it that way I
 

423
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,970
don't think I really saw it that way I
was really more interested in the

424
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:04,980
was really more interested in the
 

425
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,060
was really more interested in the
tinkering it's maybe not a sort of a

426
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,070
tinkering it's maybe not a sort of a
 

427
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,320
tinkering it's maybe not a sort of a
complete coincidence that I ended up

428
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,330
complete coincidence that I ended up
 

429
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,020
complete coincidence that I ended up
sort of creating a programming language

430
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,030
sort of creating a programming language
 

431
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,210
sort of creating a programming language
which is a tool for other programmers

432
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:17,220
which is a tool for other programmers
 

433
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,150
which is a tool for other programmers
I've always been very focused on the

434
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
I've always been very focused on the
 

435
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,460
I've always been very focused on the
sort of activity of programming itself

436
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:22,470
sort of activity of programming itself
 

437
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,430
sort of activity of programming itself
and not so much what happens with with

438
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:27,440
and not so much what happens with with
 

439
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,890
and not so much what happens with with
the program you write right I do

440
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:30,900
the program you write right I do
 

441
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,220
the program you write right I do
remember and I don't dream it maybe in

442
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,230
remember and I don't dream it maybe in
 

443
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,220
remember and I don't dream it maybe in
my second or third year probably my

444
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:37,230
my second or third year probably my
 

445
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,820
my second or third year probably my
second actually someone pointed out to

446
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:40,830
second actually someone pointed out to
 

447
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,610
second actually someone pointed out to
me that there was this thing called

448
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:42,620
me that there was this thing called
 

449
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:46,970
me that there was this thing called
Conway's Game of Life you're probably

450
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:46,980
Conway's Game of Life you're probably
 

451
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,350
Conway's Game of Life you're probably
familiar with it I think the seventies I

452
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:51,360
familiar with it I think the seventies I
 

453
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,510
familiar with it I think the seventies I
think yeah he came up with it so there

454
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:53,520
think yeah he came up with it so there
 

455
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:57,160
think yeah he came up with it so there
was a scientific American column by

456
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,170
was a scientific American column by
 

457
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,830
was a scientific American column by
someone who did a monthly column about

458
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:00,840
someone who did a monthly column about
 

459
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,750
someone who did a monthly column about
mathematical diversions

460
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:02,760
mathematical diversions
 

461
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,120
mathematical diversions
I'm also blanking out on the guy's name

462
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:05,130
I'm also blanking out on the guy's name
 

463
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,220
I'm also blanking out on the guy's name
it was it was very famous at the time

464
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:07,230
it was it was very famous at the time
 

465
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:10,430
it was it was very famous at the time
and I think up to the 90s or so and one

466
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:10,440
and I think up to the 90s or so and one
 

467
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,230
and I think up to the 90s or so and one
of his columns was about Conway's Game

468
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:12,240
of his columns was about Conway's Game
 

469
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,540
of his columns was about Conway's Game
of Life and he had some illustrations

470
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:14,550
of Life and he had some illustrations
 

471
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:16,920
of Life and he had some illustrations
and he wrote down all the rules

472
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:16,930
and he wrote down all the rules
 

473
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,050
and he wrote down all the rules
and sort of there was the suggestion

474
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:19,060
and sort of there was the suggestion
 

475
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,570
and sort of there was the suggestion
that this was philosophically

476
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:21,580
that this was philosophically
 

477
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,760
that this was philosophically
interesting that that was why Conway had

478
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:23,770
interesting that that was why Conway had
 

479
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:27,750
interesting that that was why Conway had
called it that and all I had was like

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,450
called it that and all I had was like
the two pages photocopy of that article

the two pages photocopy of that article
 

483
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,560
the two pages photocopy of that article
I didn't even remember where I got it

484
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:33,570
I didn't even remember where I got it
 

485
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:36,590
I didn't even remember where I got it
but it spoke to me and I remember

486
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:36,600
but it spoke to me and I remember
 

487
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:43,290
but it spoke to me and I remember
implementing a version of that game for

488
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:43,300
implementing a version of that game for
 

489
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:46,340
implementing a version of that game for
the batch computer we were using where I

490
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,350
the batch computer we were using where I
 

491
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,380
the batch computer we were using where I
had a whole Pascal program that sort of

492
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:49,390
had a whole Pascal program that sort of
 

493
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,260
had a whole Pascal program that sort of
read an initial situation from input and

494
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:52,270
read an initial situation from input and
 

495
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,310
read an initial situation from input and
read some numbers that that said do so

496
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
read some numbers that that said do so
 

497
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,280
read some numbers that that said do so
many generations and print every so many

498
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,290
many generations and print every so many
 

499
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:01,980
many generations and print every so many
generations and then out would come

500
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:01,990
generations and then out would come
 

501
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:08,610

pages and pages of sort of things kinds
 

503
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,160
pages and pages of sort of things kinds
of different kinds and yeah and I

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,170
of different kinds and yeah and I
 

505
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,490

remember much later I've done a similar

remember much later I've done a similar
 

507
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,220
remember much later I've done a similar
thing using Python but I'd sort of that

508
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:17,230
thing using Python but I'd sort of that
 

509
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,240
thing using Python but I'd sort of that
original version I wrote at the time I

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,250
original version I wrote at the time I
 

511
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:24,060
original version I wrote at the time I
found interesting because I combined it

512
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,070
found interesting because I combined it
 

513
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,199
found interesting because I combined it
with some trick I had learned during my

514
00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:28,209
with some trick I had learned during my
 

515
00:13:28,209 --> 00:13:30,980

essentially first on paper I designed a

518
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,150
essentially first on paper I designed a
 

519
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:39,140
essentially first on paper I designed a
simple circuit built out of logic gates

520
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,150
simple circuit built out of logic gates
 

521
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,960
simple circuit built out of logic gates
that took nine bits of input which is

522
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:42,970
that took nine bits of input which is
 

523
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,290
that took nine bits of input which is
the sort of the cell and its neighbors

524
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:46,300
the sort of the cell and its neighbors
 

525
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,480
the sort of the cell and its neighbors
and produced a new value for that cell

526
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:50,490
and produced a new value for that cell
 

527
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:53,910
and produced a new value for that cell
and it's like a combination of a half

528
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
and it's like a combination of a half
 

529
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,460
and it's like a combination of a half
adder and some other clipping you know

530
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,470
adder and some other clipping you know
 

531
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,819
adder and some other clipping you know
it's actually a full adder and so I had

532
00:13:59,819 --> 00:13:59,829
it's actually a full adder and so I had
 

533
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,310
it's actually a full adder and so I had
worked that out and then I translated

534
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
worked that out and then I translated
 

535
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,590
worked that out and then I translated
that into a series of boolean operations

536
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:07,600
that into a series of boolean operations
 

537
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,130
that into a series of boolean operations
on Pascal integers where you could use

538
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:11,140
on Pascal integers where you could use
 

539
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,190
on Pascal integers where you could use
the integers as bitwise values and so I

540
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:17,200
the integers as bitwise values and so I
 

541
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,019
the integers as bitwise values and so I
could basically generate 60 bits of a

542
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:22,029
could basically generate 60 bits of a
 

543
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:28,019
could basically generate 60 bits of a
generation in in like eight instructions

544
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:28,029
generation in in like eight instructions
 

545
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:29,290
generation in in like eight instructions
or so

546
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,300
or so
 

547
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,829
or so
nice I was proud of that it's it's funny

638
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:31,940
actually wanted the efficient
 

639
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,600
actually wanted the efficient
implementation because I also wanted to

640
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:34,610
implementation because I also wanted to
 

641
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,620
implementation because I also wanted to
explore what would happen with a larger

642
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:38,630
explore what would happen with a larger
 

643
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:42,610
explore what would happen with a larger
number of generations and a larger sort

644
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:42,620
number of generations and a larger sort
 

645
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,000
number of generations and a larger sort
of

646
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,010
of
 

647
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,580
of
size of the of the board and so once the

648
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:47,590
size of the of the board and so once the
 

649
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:52,630
size of the of the board and so once the
implementation was flawless I would feed

650
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:52,640
implementation was flawless I would feed
 

651
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,690
implementation was flawless I would feed
at different patterns and then I think

652
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:55,700
at different patterns and then I think
 

653
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,460
at different patterns and then I think
maybe there was a follow-up article

654
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:57,470
maybe there was a follow-up article
 

655
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:00,460
maybe there was a follow-up article
where there were patterns that that were

656
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,470
where there were patterns that that were
 

657
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:03,670
where there were patterns that that were
like gliders parents that repeated

658
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
like gliders parents that repeated
 

659
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,600
like gliders parents that repeated
themselves after a number of generations

660
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:06,610
themselves after a number of generations
 

661
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:12,670
themselves after a number of generations
but translated one or two positions to

662
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:12,680
but translated one or two positions to
 

663
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,750
but translated one or two positions to
the right or up or something like that

664
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:15,760
the right or up or something like that
 

665
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,120
the right or up or something like that
and there were I remember things like

666
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,130
and there were I remember things like
 

667
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,130
and there were I remember things like
glider guns well you can you can google

668
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,140
glider guns well you can you can google

still go on and over it

00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,020
still go on and over it
 

673
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:29,170
still go on and over it
for a reason because it's not really

Stephen Wolfram is obsessed about yeah
 

679
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,020
Stephen Wolfram is obsessed about yeah
okay so he's just the the we don't have

680
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,030
okay so he's just the the we don't have
 

681
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,790
okay so he's just the the we don't have
the mathematical tools to describe the

the mathematical tools to describe the
 

683

689
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,790
to do is to run it I'm not convinced
that that it's sort of a problem that

artificial being is you kind of have to
 

699
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,990
artificial being is you kind of have to

send with a game of life you kind of
 

701
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,680

have to create a universe and let it run

00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:10,690
have to create a universe and let it run

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:28,870
well you might have to experiment with a
 

719
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:32,070
well you might have to experiment with a
lot of different universes before there

lot of different universes before there
 

721
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,580

there is a set of rules that doesn't
 

723

there is a set of rules that doesn't
essentially always just end up repeating

essentially always just end up repeating

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:42,870
essentially always just end up repeating
itself in in a trivial way yeah and

analyst Steve wolf from Stephen Wolfram
 

729
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,420
analyst Steve wolf from Stephen Wolfram
works with these simple rules says that

730
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:48,430
works with these simple rules says that
 

731
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,790
works with these simple rules says that
it's kind of surprising how quickly find

732
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:50,800
it's kind of surprising how quickly find
 

733
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,790
it's kind of surprising how quickly find
rules that create interesting things you

734
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:53,800
rules that create interesting things you
 

735
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,710
rules that create interesting things you
shouldn't be able to but somehow you do

736
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:55,720
shouldn't be able to but somehow you do
 

737
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,360
shouldn't be able to but somehow you do
and so maybe our universe is laden with

738
00:18:59,360 --> 00:18:59,370
and so maybe our universe is laden with
 

739
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,860
and so maybe our universe is laden with
with rules that will create interesting

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:01,870
with rules that will create interesting
 

741

with rules that will create interesting
things that might not look like humans

00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,310
things that might not look like humans
 

743
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,000
things that might not look like humans
but yeah you know emergent phenomena

744
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,010
but yeah you know emergent phenomena
 

745
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,440
but yeah you know emergent phenomena
that's interesting may not be as

746
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,450
that's interesting may not be as
 

747
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:08,910
that's interesting may not be as
difficult to create as we think

748
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:08,920
difficult to create as we think
 

749
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:12,450
difficult to create as we think
sure but let me sort of ask at that time

750
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:12,460
sure but let me sort of ask at that time
 

751
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,310
sure but let me sort of ask at that time
you know some of the world's least in

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:14,320
you know some of the world's least in
 

753
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,720
you know some of the world's least in
popular press was kind of captivated

754
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:18,730
popular press was kind of captivated
 

755
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:21,510
popular press was kind of captivated
perhaps at least in America by the idea

756
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:21,520
perhaps at least in America by the idea
 

757
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,290
perhaps at least in America by the idea
of artificial intelligence that that

758
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:25,300
of artificial intelligence that that
 

759
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,570
of artificial intelligence that that
these computers would be able to think

760
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:27,580
these computers would be able to think
 

761
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,900
these computers would be able to think
pretty soon and yeah that touch you at

762
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:30,910
pretty soon and yeah that touch you at
 

763
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,960
pretty soon and yeah that touch you at
all did that in science fiction or in

764
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:33,970
all did that in science fiction or in
 

765
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:38,490
all did that in science fiction or in
reality in uh in anyway I didn't really

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:38,500
reality in uh in anyway I didn't really
 

767
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,660
reality in uh in anyway I didn't really
start reading science fiction until much

768
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:42,670
start reading science fiction until much
 

769
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:45,910
start reading science fiction until much
much later

770
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:45,920

 

771
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,800

I think as a teenager I I read maybe one

772
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:50,810
I think as a teenager I I read maybe one
 

773
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,640
I think as a teenager I I read maybe one
bundle of science fiction stories was in

774
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:54,650
bundle of science fiction stories was in
 

775
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,530
bundle of science fiction stories was in
my background somewhere like in your

776
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:56,540
my background somewhere like in your
 

777
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,280
my background somewhere like in your
thoughts that sort of the using

778
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:00,290
thoughts that sort of the using
 

779
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,590
thoughts that sort of the using
computers to build something intelligent

780
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:02,600
computers to build something intelligent
 

781
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,100
computers to build something intelligent
always fell to me because I had I felt I

782
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,110
always fell to me because I had I felt I
 

783
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,170
always fell to me because I had I felt I
had so much understanding of what

784
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:08,180
had so much understanding of what
 

785
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:12,280
had so much understanding of what
actually goes on inside a computer I I

786
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,290
actually goes on inside a computer I I
 

787
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,950
actually goes on inside a computer I I
knew how many bits of memory it had and

788
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:14,960
knew how many bits of memory it had and
 

789
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,210
knew how many bits of memory it had and
how difficult it was to program and sort

790
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,220
how difficult it was to program and sort
 

791
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,540
how difficult it was to program and sort
of I didn't believe at all that that you

792
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:25,550
of I didn't believe at all that that you
 

793
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,630
of I didn't believe at all that that you
could just build something intelligent

794
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:28,640
could just build something intelligent
 

795
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,060
could just build something intelligent
out of that that that would really sort

796
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,070
out of that that that would really sort
 

797
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:36,700
out of that that that would really sort
of satisfy my definition of intelligence

798
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:36,710
of satisfy my definition of intelligence
 

799
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,190
of satisfy my definition of intelligence
I think the most the most influential

800
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:39,200
I think the most the most influential
 

801
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,990
I think the most the most influential
thing that I read in my early 20s was

802
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:44,000
thing that I read in my early 20s was
 

803
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,960
thing that I read in my early 20s was
girlish ABBA that was about

804
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:46,970
girlish ABBA that was about
 

805
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,060
girlish ABBA that was about
consciousness and that was a big

806
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,070
consciousness and that was a big
 

807
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:54,250
consciousness and that was a big
eye-opener in in some sense in what

808
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:54,260
eye-opener in in some sense in what
 

809
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,040
eye-opener in in some sense in what
sense oh so console yeah so on your own

810
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,050
sense oh so console yeah so on your own
 

811
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,500
sense oh so console yeah so on your own
brain did you do use did you at the time

812
00:20:59,500 --> 00:20:59,510
brain did you do use did you at the time
 

813
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,270
brain did you do use did you at the time
or do you now see your own brain as a

814
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:01,280
or do you now see your own brain as a
 

815
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,450
or do you now see your own brain as a
computer or is there a total separation

816
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:04,460
computer or is there a total separation
 

817
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,730
computer or is there a total separation
of the way so yeah you're very

818
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:06,740
of the way so yeah you're very
 

819
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:09,580
of the way so yeah you're very
pragmatically practically know the

820
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:09,590
pragmatically practically know the
 

821
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,190
pragmatically practically know the
limits of memory the limits of this

822
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:12,200
limits of memory the limits of this
 

823
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,190
limits of memory the limits of this
sequential computing or weakly paralyzed

824
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,200
sequential computing or weakly paralyzed
 

825
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,410
sequential computing or weakly paralyzed
computing and you just know what we have

826
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,420
computing and you just know what we have
 

827
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,980
computing and you just know what we have
now and it's hard to see how it creates

828
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:19,990
now and it's hard to see how it creates
 

829
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:24,370
now and it's hard to see how it creates
but it's also easy to see it was in the

830
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:24,380
but it's also easy to see it was in the
 

831
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,620
but it's also easy to see it was in the
40s 50s 60s and now at least

832
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:28,630
40s 50s 60s and now at least
 

833
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:30,610
40s 50s 60s and now at least
similarities between the brain and our

834
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:30,620
similarities between the brain and our
 

835
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:34,840
similarities between the brain and our
computers oh yeah I mean I I totally

836
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:34,850
computers oh yeah I mean I I totally
 

837
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,220
computers oh yeah I mean I I totally
believe that brains are computers in

838
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,230
believe that brains are computers in
 

839
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:43,930
believe that brains are computers in
some sense I mean the rules they they

840
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:43,940
some sense I mean the rules they they
 

841
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,360
some sense I mean the rules they they
used to play by are pretty different

842
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:46,370
used to play by are pretty different
 

843
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:49,140
used to play by are pretty different
from the rules we we can sort of

844
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,150
from the rules we we can sort of
 

845
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:53,650
from the rules we we can sort of
implement in in our current hardware but

846
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:53,660
implement in in our current hardware but
 

847
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:59,260
implement in in our current hardware but
I don't believe in like

848
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,270
I don't believe in like
 

849
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:02,760
I don't believe in like
a separate thing that infuses us with

850
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:02,770
a separate thing that infuses us with
 

851
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,630
a separate thing that infuses us with
intelligence or consciousness or any of

852
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:07,640
intelligence or consciousness or any of
 

853
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,850
intelligence or consciousness or any of
that there's no soul I've been an

854
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:09,860
that there's no soul I've been an
 

855
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,140
that there's no soul I've been an
atheist probably from when I was 10

856
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,150
atheist probably from when I was 10
 

857
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,350
atheist probably from when I was 10
years old just by thinking a bit about

858
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:17,360
years old just by thinking a bit about
 

859
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,780
years old just by thinking a bit about
math and the universe and then well my

860
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:19,790
math and the universe and then well my
 

861
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:24,580
math and the universe and then well my
parents were atheists now I know that

862
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:24,590
parents were atheists now I know that
 

863
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,410
parents were atheists now I know that
you you you could be an atheist and

864
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:26,420
you you you could be an atheist and
 

865
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,530
you you you could be an atheist and
still believe that there is something

866
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:28,540
still believe that there is something
 

867
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,860
still believe that there is something
sort of about intelligence or

868
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:32,870
sort of about intelligence or
 

869
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,330
sort of about intelligence or
consciousness that cannot possibly

870
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:34,340
consciousness that cannot possibly
 

871
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:38,950
consciousness that cannot possibly
emerge from a fixed set of rules I am

872
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
emerge from a fixed set of rules I am
 

873
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,090
emerge from a fixed set of rules I am
NOT in that camp

874
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,100
NOT in that camp
 

875
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,450
NOT in that camp
I I totally see that sort of given how

876
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,460
I I totally see that sort of given how
 

877
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,150
I I totally see that sort of given how
many millions of years evolution took

878
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:49,160
many millions of years evolution took
 

879
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,040
many millions of years evolution took
its time DNA is is a particular machine

its time DNA is is a particular machine

00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:59,140
its time DNA is is a particular machine
that that sort of encodes information

882
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,150
that that sort of encodes information
 

883
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,950
that that sort of encodes information
and an unlimited amount of information

884
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:01,960
and an unlimited amount of information
 

885

and an unlimited amount of information
in in chemical form and has figured out

00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,410
in in chemical form and has figured out

in in chemical form and has figured out
a way to replicate itself I thought that

888
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:12,920
a way to replicate itself I thought that
 

889
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,490
a way to replicate itself I thought that
death was maybe it's 300 million years

890
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:15,500
death was maybe it's 300 million years
 

891
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,410
death was maybe it's 300 million years
ago but I thought it was closer to half

892
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:17,420
ago but I thought it was closer to half
 

893
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,960
ago but I thought it was closer to half
a billion years ago that that's sort of

894
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:21,970
a billion years ago that that's sort of
 

895
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,550
a billion years ago that that's sort of
originated and it hasn't really changed

896
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:24,560
originated and it hasn't really changed
 

897
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,440
originated and it hasn't really changed
that the sort of the structure of DNA

898
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,450
that the sort of the structure of DNA
 

899
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,520
that the sort of the structure of DNA
hasn't changed ever since that is like

900
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:29,530
hasn't changed ever since that is like
 

901
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,460
hasn't changed ever since that is like
our binary code that you're having

902
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:33,470
our binary code that you're having
 

903
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,010
our binary code that you're having
hardware I mean the basic programming

904
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:36,020
hardware I mean the basic programming
 

905
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,680
hardware I mean the basic programming
language hasn't changed but maybe the

906
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:38,690
language hasn't changed but maybe the
 

907
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:41,770
language hasn't changed but maybe the
programming itself of has lead it did it

908
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:41,780
programming itself of has lead it did it
 

909
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:45,160
programming itself of has lead it did it
sort of it it happened to be a set of

910
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:45,170
sort of it it happened to be a set of
 

911
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,640
sort of it it happened to be a set of
rules that was good enough to to sort of

912
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:48,650
rules that was good enough to to sort of
 

913
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:53,290
rules that was good enough to to sort of
develop endless variability and and sort

914
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:53,300
develop endless variability and and sort
 

915
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,700
develop endless variability and and sort
of the the idea of self-replicating

916
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:57,710
of the the idea of self-replicating
 

917
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,850
of the the idea of self-replicating
molecules competing with each other for

918
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:00,860
molecules competing with each other for
 

919
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:04,030
molecules competing with each other for
resources and and one type eventually

920
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,040
resources and and one type eventually
 

921
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,900

sort of always taking over that happened

922
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:07,910
sort of always taking over that happened
 

923
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,540
sort of always taking over that happened
before there were any fossils so we

924
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:10,550
before there were any fossils so we
 

925
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,490
before there were any fossils so we
don't know how that exactly happened

926
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:12,500
don't know how that exactly happened
 

927
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,420
don't know how that exactly happened
but I believe it it's it's clear that

928
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,430
but I believe it it's it's clear that
 

929
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,870
but I believe it it's it's clear that
that did happen and can you comment on

930
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:19,880
that did happen and can you comment on
 

931
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,800
that did happen and can you comment on
consciousness and how you see it because

932
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:23,810
consciousness and how you see it because
 

933
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,900
consciousness and how you see it because
I think we'll talk about programming

934
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:25,910
I think we'll talk about programming
 

935
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:28,060
I think we'll talk about programming
quite a bit we'll talk about you know

936
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,070
quite a bit we'll talk about you know
 

937
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,300
quite a bit we'll talk about you know
intelligence connecting to programming

938
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:30,310
intelligence connecting to programming
 

939
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,620
intelligence connecting to programming
fundamentally but consciousness

940
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:32,630
fundamentally but consciousness
 

941
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,600
fundamentally but consciousness
consciousness is this whole lot of other

942
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:34,610
consciousness is this whole lot of other
 

943
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,070
consciousness is this whole lot of other
thing do you think about it often as a

00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,080
thing do you think about it often as a
 

945
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,700
thing do you think about it often as a
developer of a programming language and

946
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:41,710
developer of a programming language and
 

947
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,030
developer of a programming language and
and as a human those those are pretty

948
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,040
and as a human those those are pretty

intelligence or consciousness but sort

958
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:03,020
intelligence or consciousness but sort

of privately as an avid reader of

960
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:05,860
of privately as an avid reader of
 

961
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:13,270
of privately as an avid reader of
popular science writing I I have some

962
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,280
popular science writing I I have some
 

963
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,880
popular science writing I I have some
thoughts which which is mostly that I

964
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:17,890
thoughts which which is mostly that I
 

965
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,990
thoughts which which is mostly that I
don't actually believe that

966
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
don't actually believe that
 

967
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,500
don't actually believe that
consciousness is an all-or-nothing thing

968
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,510
consciousness is an all-or-nothing thing
 

969
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:28,810
consciousness is an all-or-nothing thing
I have a feeling that and and I forget

970
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:28,820
I have a feeling that and and I forget
 

971
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,740
I have a feeling that and and I forget
what I read that influenced this but I

972
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:34,750
what I read that influenced this but I
 

973
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,360
what I read that influenced this but I
feel that if you look at a cat or a dog

974
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,370
feel that if you look at a cat or a dog
 

975
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,790
feel that if you look at a cat or a dog
or a mouse they have some form of

976
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:39,800
or a mouse they have some form of
 

977
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,830
or a mouse they have some form of
intelligence if you look at a fish it

978
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:43,840
intelligence if you look at a fish it
 

979
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:51,250
intelligence if you look at a fish it
has some form of intelligence and that

980
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:51,260
has some form of intelligence and that
 

981
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:54,070
has some form of intelligence and that
evolution just took a long time but I

982
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:54,080
evolution just took a long time but I
 

983
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,840
evolution just took a long time but I
feel that the the sort of the evolution

984
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:55,850
feel that the the sort of the evolution
 

985
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,340
feel that the the sort of the evolution
of more and more intelligence that led

986
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,350
of more and more intelligence that led
 

987
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,140
of more and more intelligence that led
to to sort of the human form of

988
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,150
to to sort of the human form of
 

989
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:08,890
to to sort of the human form of
intelligence follow the evolution of the

990
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:08,900
intelligence follow the evolution of the
 

991
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:13,560
intelligence follow the evolution of the
senses especially the visual sense I

992
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:13,570
senses especially the visual sense I
 

993
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,110
senses especially the visual sense I
mean there is an enormous amount of

994
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:17,120
mean there is an enormous amount of
 

995
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,590
mean there is an enormous amount of
processing that's needed to interpret a

996
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:20,600
processing that's needed to interpret a
 

997
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,290
processing that's needed to interpret a
scene and humans are still better at

998
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:23,300
scene and humans are still better at
 

999
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,810
scene and humans are still better at
that than then computers

1000
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:25,820
that than then computers
 

1001
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,240
that than then computers
yeah and so and and and I have a feeling

1002
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:29,250
yeah and so and and and I have a feeling
 

1003
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:37,310
yeah and so and and and I have a feeling
that there is a sort of the reason that

1004
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,320
that there is a sort of the reason that
 

1005
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,680
that there is a sort of the reason that
that like mammals is in particular

1006
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,690
that like mammals is in particular
 

1007
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:42,950
that like mammals is in particular
developed the levels of consciousness

1008
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
developed the levels of consciousness
 

1009
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,040
developed the levels of consciousness
that they have and that eventually read

1010
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,050
that they have and that eventually read
 

1011
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,200
that they have and that eventually read
sort of informative going from

1012
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:48,210
sort of informative going from
 

1013
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:50,720
sort of informative going from
intelligence to to self-awareness in

1014
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:50,730
intelligence to to self-awareness in
 

1015
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,170
intelligence to to self-awareness in
consciousness has to do with sort of

1016
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:54,180
consciousness has to do with sort of
 

1017
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,900
consciousness has to do with sort of
being a robot that has very highly

1018
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:56,910
being a robot that has very highly
 

1019
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,020
being a robot that has very highly
developed senses as a lot of rich

1020
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,030
developed senses as a lot of rich
 

1021
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:02,320
developed senses as a lot of rich
sensory information coming in so the

1022
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:02,330
sensory information coming in so the
 

1023
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,030
sensory information coming in so the
it's a really interesting thought that

1024
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:05,040
it's a really interesting thought that
 

1025
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,960
it's a really interesting thought that
the that whatever that basic mechanism

1026
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:08,970
the that whatever that basic mechanism
 

1027
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:09,740
the that whatever that basic mechanism
of DNA

1028
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:09,750
of DNA
 

1029
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,380
of DNA
whatever that basic building blocks are

1030
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:12,390
whatever that basic building blocks are
 

1031
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,320
whatever that basic building blocks are
programming is you if you just add more

1032
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:15,330
programming is you if you just add more
 

1033
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,890
programming is you if you just add more
abilities more more high resolution

1034
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:18,900
abilities more more high resolution
 

1035
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,290
abilities more more high resolution
sensors more sensors you just keep

1036
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:21,300
sensors more sensors you just keep
 

1037
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,910
sensors more sensors you just keep
stacking those things on top that

1038
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:22,920
stacking those things on top that
 

1039
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,190
stacking those things on top that
there's basic programming in trying to

1040
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
there's basic programming in trying to
 

1041
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,920
there's basic programming in trying to
survive develops very interesting things

1042
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:27,930
survive develops very interesting things
 

1043
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,770
survive develops very interesting things
that start to us humans to appear like

1044
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:30,780
that start to us humans to appear like
 

1045
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,110
that start to us humans to appear like
intelligence and consciousness yeah so

1046
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,120
intelligence and consciousness yeah so
 

1047
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,040
intelligence and consciousness yeah so
in in as far as robots go I think that

1048
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,050
in in as far as robots go I think that
 

1049
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:40,630
in in as far as robots go I think that
the self-driving cars have the sort of

1050
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:40,640
the self-driving cars have the sort of
 

1051
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,030
the self-driving cars have the sort of
the greatest opportunity of developing

1052
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:44,040
the greatest opportunity of developing
 

1053
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,230
the greatest opportunity of developing
something like that

1054
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:45,240
something like that
 

1055
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,830
something like that
because when I Drive myself

1056
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:48,840
because when I Drive myself
 

1057
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,620
because when I Drive myself
I don't just pay attention to the rules

1058
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:51,630
I don't just pay attention to the rules
 

1059
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:55,610
I don't just pay attention to the rules
of the road I also look around and I get

1060
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:55,620
of the road I also look around and I get
 

1061
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,950
of the road I also look around and I get
clues from that oh this is a shopping

1062
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:57,960
clues from that oh this is a shopping
 

1063
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,150
clues from that oh this is a shopping
district oh here's an old lady crossing

1064
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:02,160
district oh here's an old lady crossing
 

1065
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,880
district oh here's an old lady crossing
the street oh here is someone carrying a

1066
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:06,890
the street oh here is someone carrying a
 

1067
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,920
the street oh here is someone carrying a
pile of mail there's a mailbox thatthat

1068
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:09,930
pile of mail there's a mailbox thatthat
 

1069
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,230
pile of mail there's a mailbox thatthat
should they're gonna cross the street to

1070
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
should they're gonna cross the street to
 

1071
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,080
should they're gonna cross the street to
reach that mailbox and I slowed down and

1072
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,090
reach that mailbox and I slowed down and
 

1073
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,910
reach that mailbox and I slowed down and
I don't even think about that yeah and

1074
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:16,920
I don't even think about that yeah and
 

1075
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,020
I don't even think about that yeah and
and so there is there's so much where

1076
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,030
and so there is there's so much where
 

1077
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,020
and so there is there's so much where
you turn your observations into an

1078
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,030
you turn your observations into an
 

1079
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,860
you turn your observations into an
understanding of what utter

1080
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:26,870
understanding of what utter
 

1081
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,750
understanding of what utter
consciousnesses are going to do or what

1082
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:29,760
consciousnesses are going to do or what
 

1083
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,450
consciousnesses are going to do or what
what utter systems in the world are

1084
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:32,460
what utter systems in the world are
 

1085
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,940
what utter systems in the world are
going to be oh that tree is gone at

1086
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:34,950
going to be oh that tree is gone at
 

1087
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,220
going to be oh that tree is gone at

1088
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,230
fault
 

1089
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:42,850

yeah I see sort of I see much more of

1090
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:42,860
yeah I see sort of I see much more of
 

1091
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,190
yeah I see sort of I see much more of
expect somehow that if anything is going

00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
expect somehow that if anything is going
 

1093
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,260

to become conscious it's going to be the

1094
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:48,270
to become conscious it's going to be the
 

1095
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,900
to become conscious it's going to be the
self-driving car and not the network of

1096
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:50,910
self-driving car and not the network of
 

1097
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:56,510
self-driving car and not the network of
a bazillion computers at in a Google or

1098
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:56,520
a bazillion computers at in a Google or
 

1099
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,060
a bazillion computers at in a Google or

00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,070
Amazon data center that are all
 

1101
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:02,750
Amazon data center that are all
networked together to to do whatever

1102
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:02,760
networked together to to do whatever
 

1103
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,740
networked together to to do whatever
they do so in that sense so you actually

1104
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:06,750
they do so in that sense so you actually
 

1105
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,390
they do so in that sense so you actually
have like is that's what I work in

1106
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:08,400
have like is that's what I work in
 

1107
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,460
have like is that's what I work in
autonomous vehicles you highlight a big

1108
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:10,470
autonomous vehicles you highlight a big
 

1109
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:13,970
autonomous vehicles you highlight a big
gap between what we currently can't do

1110
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:13,980
gap between what we currently can't do
 

1111
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,310
gap between what we currently can't do
and what we truly need to be able to do

1112
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
and what we truly need to be able to do
 

1113
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,740
and what we truly need to be able to do

hey I make those mistakes myself all the
time I see someone that I only know s

1270
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:12,580
time I see someone that I only know s
 

1271
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,850
time I see someone that I only know s
like oh this person is a colleague of my

1272
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:14,860
like oh this person is a colleague of my
 

1273
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,250
like oh this person is a colleague of my
wife's yeah and then I see them at the

1274
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:17,260
wife's yeah and then I see them at the
 

1275
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,850
wife's yeah and then I see them at the
movies and I didn't recognize them but

1276
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:20,860
movies and I didn't recognize them but
 

1277
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,919
movies and I didn't recognize them but
do you see those you call it pattern

1278
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:22,929
do you see those you call it pattern
 

1279
00:33:22,929 --> 00:33:29,190
do you see those you call it pattern
matching do you see that rules is unable

1280
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200

00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:39,880
a human all these you can there's
 

1291
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:42,270
a human all these you can there's
probably tens of thousands of facts you

1292
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:42,280
probably tens of thousands of facts you
 

1293
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,789
probably tens of thousands of facts you
pick up moment by moment about this

you don't think all that could be

you don't think all that could be
 

1303
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,710
you don't think all that could be

you can just put it all on the table and

00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:54,700
you can just put it all on the table and
 

1307
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:58,169
you can just put it all on the table and
calculate oh I don't know what that

covered enough of of that distance it's
 

1325
00:34:29,169 --> 00:34:31,590
covered enough of of that distance it's
like if you take a human body and you

1326
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:31,600
like if you take a human body and you
 

1327
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:35,760
like if you take a human body and you
realize it's built out of atoms well

00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,400
out of atoms and then you get to quantum
mechanics so that's a very pragmatic

let's philosopher so like this how

1368
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,000
let's philosopher so like this how
 

1369
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,150
let's philosopher so like this how
philosophers often think right and

00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:29,160
philosophers often think right and

essentially that's what the car was is

1372
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,170
essentially that's what the car was is

essentially that's what the car was is
wait a minute if there is like you said

1374
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:33,630
wait a minute if there is like you said
 

1375
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,960
wait a minute if there is like you said
no magic

1376
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:34,970
no magic
 

1377
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,670
no magic
so you basically says it doesn't appear

1378
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:37,680
so you basically says it doesn't appear
 

1379
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
so you basically says it doesn't appear
like there is any magic but we know so

1380
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:39,690
like there is any magic but we know so
 

1381
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:42,800
like there is any magic but we know so
little about it that it might as well be

1382
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:42,810
little about it that it might as well be
 

1383
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,800
little about it that it might as well be
magic so just because we know that we're

1384
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:45,810
magic so just because we know that we're
 

1385
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,690
magic so just because we know that we're
made of atoms just because we know we're

1386
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:47,700
made of atoms just because we know we're
 

1387
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,700
made of atoms just because we know we're
made of organs the fact that we know

00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:49,710
made of organs the fact that we know
 

1389
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:51,620
made of organs the fact that we know
very little hot to get from the atoms to

figured out that we're made of atoms

1398

00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,650
little details underlying it
there's compilers on top of sec Turtles

1578
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:41,660
there's compilers on top of sec Turtles
 

1579
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,360
there's compilers on top of sec Turtles
on top of turtles or Turtles all the way

1580
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,370
on top of turtles or Turtles all the way
 

1581
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,390
on top of turtles or Turtles all the way
down it's compilers all the way down but

1582
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:46,400
down it's compilers all the way down but
 

1583
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,220
down it's compilers all the way down but
that's essentially you see that there's

1584
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,230
that's essentially you see that there's
 

1585
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:52,300
that's essentially you see that there's
no magic that's what I what I was trying

1586
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,310
no magic that's what I what I was trying
 

1587
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:54,970
no magic that's what I what I was trying
to get at I think is with decart started

1588
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:54,980
to get at I think is with decart started
 

1589
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,380
to get at I think is with decart started
this whole train of saying that there's

1590
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:56,390
this whole train of saying that there's
 

1591
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,470
this whole train of saying that there's
no magic I mean there's always before

1592
00:40:59,470 --> 00:40:59,480
no magic I mean there's always before
 

1593
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,570
no magic I mean there's always before
well then the cart also have the notion

1594
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:01,580
well then the cart also have the notion
 

1595
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,110
well then the cart also have the notion
though that the soul and the body were

1596
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:04,120
though that the soul and the body were
 

1597
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,030
though that the soul and the body were
were fundamentally separate yeah I think

1598
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:07,040
were fundamentally separate yeah I think
 

1599
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,870
were fundamentally separate yeah I think
you had to write in God in there for

1600
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:09,880
you had to write in God in there for
 

1601
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,950
you had to write in God in there for
political reasons so I don't actually

1602
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:11,960
political reasons so I don't actually
 

1603
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,950
political reasons so I don't actually
not historian but there's notions in

1604
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
not historian but there's notions in
 

1605
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,430
not historian but there's notions in
there that all of reasoning all of human

1606
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:18,440
there that all of reasoning all of human
 

1607
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,620
there that all of reasoning all of human
thought can be formalized I think that

1608
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:20,630
thought can be formalized I think that
 

1609
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:24,850
thought can be formalized I think that

00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:30,140
incompleteness theorem this debate of
 

1615
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,810
incompleteness theorem this debate of
what what what are the limits of the

1616
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:31,820
what what what are the limits of the

00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,050
things that could be formalized that's
where the touring machine came along and

1620
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:35,060
where the touring machine came along and
 

1621
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,720
where the touring machine came along and
this exciting idea I mean underlying a

1622
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:37,730
this exciting idea I mean underlying a
 

1623
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,300
this exciting idea I mean underlying a
lot of computing that you can do quite a

1624
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:40,310
lot of computing that you can do quite a
 

1625
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:43,360
lot of computing that you can do quite a
lot with a computer you can you can

1626
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:43,370
lot with a computer you can you can
 

1627
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,940
lot with a computer you can you can
encode a lot of the stuff we're talking

1628
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:45,950
encode a lot of the stuff we're talking
 

1629
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,560
encode a lot of the stuff we're talking
about in terms of recognizing faces and

1630
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:47,570
about in terms of recognizing faces and
 

1631
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:51,100
about in terms of recognizing faces and
so on theoretically in an algorithm they

1632
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:51,110
so on theoretically in an algorithm they
 

1633
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:55,350
so on theoretically in an algorithm they
can then run on a computer and in that

1634
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:55,360
can then run on a computer and in that
 

1635
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,480
can then run on a computer and in that
context I'd like to ask programming in a

1636
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,490
context I'd like to ask programming in a
 

1637
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:04,260
context I'd like to ask programming in a
philosophical way so what so what it

1638
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,270
philosophical way so what so what it
 

1639
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:05,820
philosophical way so what so what it
what does it mean to program a computer

1640
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:05,830
what does it mean to program a computer
 

1641
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:08,130
what does it mean to program a computer
so you said you write a Python program

1642
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:08,140
so you said you write a Python program
 

1643
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,030
so you said you write a Python program
or a compiled a C++ program that

1644
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:12,040
or a compiled a C++ program that
 

1645
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,410
or a compiled a C++ program that
compiles to somebody code it's forming

1646
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:16,420
compiles to somebody code it's forming
 

1647
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,470
compiles to somebody code it's forming
layers your your programming a layer of

1648
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:19,480
layers your your programming a layer of
 

1649
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,660
layers your your programming a layer of
abstraction is higher how do you see

1650
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:21,670
abstraction is higher how do you see
 

1651
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:25,290
abstraction is higher how do you see
programming in that context can it keep

1652
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:25,300
programming in that context can it keep
 

1653
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,180
programming in that context can it keep
getting higher and higher levels of

1654
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:27,190
getting higher and higher levels of
 

1655
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:31,500
getting higher and higher levels of
abstraction I think and at some point

1656
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:31,510
abstraction I think and at some point
 

1657
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,420
abstraction I think and at some point
the higher level of levels of

1658
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:33,430
the higher level of levels of
 

1659
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,070
the higher level of levels of
abstraction will not be called

1660
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:35,080
abstraction will not be called
 

1661
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,960
abstraction will not be called
programming and they will not resemble

1662
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:38,970
programming and they will not resemble
 

1663
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:43,830
programming and they will not resemble
what we we call programming at the

1664
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:43,840
what we we call programming at the
 

1665
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,560
what we we call programming at the
moment there will not be source code I

1666
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:46,570
moment there will not be source code I
 

1667
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,860
moment there will not be source code I
mean there will still be source code

1668
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:48,870
mean there will still be source code
 

1669
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:53,550
mean there will still be source code
sort of at a lower level of the machine

1670
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:53,560
sort of at a lower level of the machine
 

1671
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:56,660
sort of at a lower level of the machine
just like they're still molecules and

1672
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:56,670
just like they're still molecules and
 

1673
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:00,240
just like they're still molecules and
electrons and and sort of proteins in

1674
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:00,250
electrons and and sort of proteins in
 

1675
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:05,930
electrons and and sort of proteins in
our brains but and and so they're still

1676
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:05,940
our brains but and and so they're still
 

1677
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,310
our brains but and and so they're still
programming and and and system

1678
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:08,320
programming and and and system
 

1679
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,930

administration and who knows what's

1680
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:09,940
administration and who knows what's
 

1681
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,720
administration and who knows what's
keeping to keep the machine running but

1682
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:12,730
keeping to keep the machine running but
 

1683
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:15,390
keeping to keep the machine running but
what the machine does is is a different

1684
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:15,400
what the machine does is is a different
 

1685
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,360
what the machine does is is a different

it looks like the researchers who

00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:50,940
it looks like the researchers who
publish the results don't necessarily

know exactly how how their algorithms
 

1709
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,830
know exactly how how their algorithms
work and that I often get upset when I

1710
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:58,840
work and that I often get upset when I
 

1711
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:01,860

sort of read a sort of a fluff piece

1712
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:01,870
sort of read a sort of a fluff piece
 

1713
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,250
sort of read a sort of a fluff piece
about Facebook in the newspaper or

about Facebook in the newspaper or
 

1715
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:08,010
about Facebook in the newspaper or
social networks and they say well Albert

social networks and they say well Albert
 

1717

00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:17,800
yeah because for me the way I was

that programming it's just a different
 

1797
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:59,820
that programming it's just a different
activity just like building organs out

activity just like building organs out
 

1799
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,230

of cells is not called chemistry well so

1800
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:04,240
of cells is not called chemistry well so
 

1801
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,350
of cells is not called chemistry well so
let's just set that back and think sort

1802
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:07,360
let's just set that back and think sort
 

1803
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,170
let's just set that back and think sort
of more generally of course but you know

1804
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:10,180
of more generally of course but you know
 

1805
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:14,610
of more generally of course but you know
it's like as a parent teaching teaching

1806
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:14,620
it's like as a parent teaching teaching

00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:16,990
your kids things can be called
 

1809
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:19,860
your kids things can be called
programming in that same sense that

1810
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:19,870
programming in that same sense that
 

1811
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:21,329
programming in that same sense that
that's

00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:21,339
that's
 

1813
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:22,799
that's
how program has been used you're

1814
00:46:22,799 --> 00:46:22,809
how program has been used you're
 

1815
00:46:22,809 --> 00:46:26,130
how program has been used you're
providing them data examples use cases

1816
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:26,140
providing them data examples use cases
 

1817
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:31,799
providing them data examples use cases
so imagine writing a function not by not

1818
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:31,809
so imagine writing a function not by not
 

1819
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:36,239
so imagine writing a function not by not
with for loops and clearly readable text

1820
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:36,249
with for loops and clearly readable text
 

1821
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:39,180
with for loops and clearly readable text
but more saying well here's a lot of

1822
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:39,190
but more saying well here's a lot of
 

1823
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:41,670
but more saying well here's a lot of
examples of what this function should

1824
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:41,680
examples of what this function should
 

1825
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,729
examples of what this function should
take and here's a lot of examples when

1826
00:46:44,729 --> 00:46:44,739
take and here's a lot of examples when
 

1827
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:46,499
take and here's a lot of examples when
it takes those functions it should do

1828
00:46:46,499 --> 00:46:46,509
it takes those functions it should do
 

1829
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:50,309
it takes those functions it should do
this and then figure out the rest so

1830
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:50,319
this and then figure out the rest so
 

1831
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,400
this and then figure out the rest so
that's the 2.0 concept and the this is

1832
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:53,410
that's the 2.0 concept and the this is
 

1833
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,430
that's the 2.0 concept and the this is
the question I have for you is like it's

1834
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:56,440
the question I have for you is like it's
 

1835
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,400
the question I have for you is like it's
a very fuzzy way this is a reality of a

00:46:59,400 --> 00:46:59,410
a very fuzzy way this is a reality of a
 

1837
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,109
a very fuzzy way this is a reality of a
lot of these pattern recognition systems

1838
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
lot of these pattern recognition systems
 

1839
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,589
lot of these pattern recognition systems
and so on

1840
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:01,599
and so on
 

1841
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:03,599
and so on
it's a fuzzy way of quote-unquote

1842
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:03,609
it's a fuzzy way of quote-unquote
 

1843
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:06,539
it's a fuzzy way of quote-unquote
programming what do you think about this

1844
00:47:06,539 --> 00:47:06,549
programming what do you think about this
 

1845
00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:09,569

something totally different than
 

1849
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:13,950
something totally different than
programming it's like if you're a

00:52:49,150 --> 00:52:51,270
mean every summer here at Dropbox we
have a large number of interns every

2042
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:51,280
have a large number of interns every
 

2043
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:54,750
have a large number of interns every
tech company on the west coast has the

2044
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:54,760
tech company on the west coast has the
 

2045
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:58,170
tech company on the west coast has the
same thing these interns are always

2046
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:58,180
same thing these interns are always
 

2047
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,680
same thing these interns are always
amazed because this is the first time in

2048
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:01,690
amazed because this is the first time in
 

2049
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,230
amazed because this is the first time in
their life

2050
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,240
their life
 

2051
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,580
their life
that they see what goes on in a really

2052
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:06,590
that they see what goes on in a really
 

2053
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,160
that they see what goes on in a really
large software development environment

2054
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,170
large software development environment
 

2055
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:14,470
large software development environment
and everything they've learned in

2056
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,480
and everything they've learned in
 

2057
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,910
and everything they've learned in
college was almost always about a much

2058
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:18,920
college was almost always about a much
 

2059
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,640
college was almost always about a much
smaller scale and somehow the difference

2060
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:21,650
smaller scale and somehow the difference
 

2061
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:22,540
smaller scale and somehow the difference
in scale

2062
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:22,550
in scale

makes a qualitative difference in how
 

2065
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,150
makes a qualitative difference in how
you how you do things and how you think

00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
you how you do things and how you think
 

2067
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,060
you how you do things and how you think
about it if you then take a few steps

2068
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,070
about it if you then take a few steps
 

2069
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:34,690
about it if you then take a few steps
back in two decades seventies and

2070
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:34,700
back in two decades seventies and
 

2071
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,370
back in two decades seventies and
eighties when you're first thinking

00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:36,380
eighties when you're first thinking
 

2073
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,170
eighties when you're first thinking

about Python or just that world of
 

2075
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,900
about Python or just that world of
programming languages did you ever think

2076
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:40,910
programming languages did you ever think
 

2077
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,510
programming languages did you ever think
that there would be systems as large as

2081
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:50,040

00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,050
did you when you were thinking about
 

2083
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:52,960
did you when you were thinking about
Python I was actually always caught by

2084
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:52,970
Python I was actually always caught by
 

2085
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:54,990
Python I was actually always caught by
surprise by

2086
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:55,000
surprise by
 

2087
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,359
surprise by
yeah pretty much every stage of

2088
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:57,369
yeah pretty much every stage of
 

2089
00:53:57,369 --> 00:54:03,730
yeah pretty much every stage of
computing so maybe just because uh you

2090
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:03,740
computing so maybe just because uh you
 

2091
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,680
computing so maybe just because uh you
spoken in other interviews but I think

2092
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:05,690
spoken in other interviews but I think
 

2093
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,750
spoken in other interviews but I think
the evolution of programming languages

2094
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:07,760
the evolution of programming languages
 

2095
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:10,870
the evolution of programming languages
are fascinating it's especially because

2096
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:10,880
are fascinating it's especially because
 

2097
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:13,090
are fascinating it's especially because
it leads from my perspective towards

2098
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:13,100
it leads from my perspective towards
 

2099
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,230
it leads from my perspective towards
greater and greater degrees of

2100
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:14,240
greater and greater degrees of
 

2101
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,190
greater and greater degrees of

2107
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:26,680
I played with in in Russia was with the
turtle logo logo yeah and if you look I

2108
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:26,690
turtle logo logo yeah and if you look I
 

2109
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:27,849
turtle logo logo yeah and if you look I
just have a list of programming

2110
00:54:27,849 --> 00:54:27,859
just have a list of programming
 

2111
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,800
just have a list of programming

2113
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,540
languages all of which I've known played
with a little bit and they're all

00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:31,550
with a little bit and they're all
 

2115

what H we trying to scratch with Python
 

2181
00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,270
what H we trying to scratch with Python
well I'm glad I wasn't aware of all the

00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:08,280
well I'm glad I wasn't aware of all the
 

2183
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,120
well I'm glad I wasn't aware of all the
itches because I would probably not have

2184
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:11,130
itches because I would probably not have
 

2185
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:14,569
itches because I would probably not have
been able to do anything I mean if

2186
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:14,579
been able to do anything I mean if
 

2187
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,700
been able to do anything I mean if
you're trying to solve every problem at

you're trying to solve every problem at
 

2189
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:21,020
you're trying to solve every problem at
once you saw nothing well yeah that it's

00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:21,030
once you saw nothing well yeah that it's
 

2191
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:25,010
once you saw nothing well yeah that it's
it's too overwhelming and so I had a

00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,020
it's too overwhelming and so I had a
 

2193
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:29,089
it's too overwhelming and so I had a
very very focused problem I wanted a

2194
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:29,099
very very focused problem I wanted a
 

2195
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:33,050
very very focused problem I wanted a
programming language that set somewhere

00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:41,319
programming language that set somewhere
in between shell scripting and C and now

00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:45,240
arguably there is like one is higher
 

2201
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:50,599
arguably there is like one is higher
level one is lower level and Python is

2202
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:50,609
level one is lower level and Python is
 

2203
00:56:50,609 --> 00:56:54,170
level one is lower level and Python is
sort of a language of an intermediate

2204
00:56:54,170 --> 00:56:54,180
sort of a language of an intermediate
 

2205
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,750
sort of a language of an intermediate
level although it's still pretty much at

2206
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:56,760
level although it's still pretty much at
 

2207
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,339
level although it's still pretty much at
the high level and no I was I was

2208
00:57:01,339 --> 00:57:01,349
the high level and no I was I was
 

2209
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:06,890
the high level and no I was I was
thinking about much more about I want a

2210
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:06,900
thinking about much more about I want a
 

2211
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:10,520
thinking about much more about I want a
tool that I can use to be more

2212
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:10,530
tool that I can use to be more
 

2213
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,829
tool that I can use to be more
productive as a programmer in a very

2214
00:57:12,829 --> 00:57:12,839
productive as a programmer in a very
 

2215
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:17,750
productive as a programmer in a very
specific environment and I also had

2216
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
specific environment and I also had
 

2217
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,000
specific environment and I also had
given myself a time budget for the

2218
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:20,010
given myself a time budget for the
 

2219
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,790
given myself a time budget for the
development of the tool and that was

2220
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:22,800
development of the tool and that was
 

2221
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,020
development of the tool and that was
sort of about three months for both the

2222
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,030
sort of about three months for both the
 

2223
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,700
sort of about three months for both the
design like thinking through

2224
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:28,710
design like thinking through
 

2225
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:30,620
design like thinking through
what are all the features of the

2226
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:30,630
what are all the features of the
 

2227
00:57:30,630 --> 00:57:35,240
what are all the features of the
language syntactically and semantically

2228
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:35,250
language syntactically and semantically
 

2229
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:39,140
language syntactically and semantically
and how do i implement the whole

2230
00:57:39,140 --> 00:57:39,150
and how do i implement the whole
 

2231
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:42,049
and how do i implement the whole
pipeline from parsing the source code to

2232
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:42,059
pipeline from parsing the source code to
 

2233
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:46,910
pipeline from parsing the source code to
executing it so I think both were the

2234
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:46,920
executing it so I think both were the
 

2235
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:49,880
executing it so I think both were the
timeline and the goals it seems like

2236
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:49,890
timeline and the goals it seems like
 

2237
00:57:49,890 --> 00:57:52,700

2239
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:58,430
productivity was at the core of it as a

2285
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,569
get the job done much much faster so how
do you think whatever that qualitative

2286

do you think whatever that qualitative

trying to do so what is it about Python
 

2327
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:51,360
trying to do so what is it about Python
how do you think of productivity in

2328
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:51,370
how do you think of productivity in
 

2329
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:53,310
how do you think of productivity in
general as you were designing it now

2330
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:53,320
general as you were designing it now
 

2331
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,830

sort of through the decades last three

2332
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:55,840
sort of through the decades last three
 

2333
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,810
sort of through the decades last three
decades what do you think it means to be

2334
00:59:57,810 --> 00:59:57,820
decades what do you think it means to be
 

2335
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:00,510
decades what do you think it means to be
a productive programmer and how did you

2336
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:00,520
a productive programmer and how did you
 

2337
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,570
a productive programmer and how did you
try to design it into the language there

2338
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:03,580
try to design it into the language there
 

2339
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,690
try to design it into the language there
are different tasks and as a programmer

2340
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:06,700
are different tasks and as a programmer
 

2341
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,300
are different tasks and as a programmer
it's it's useful to have different tools

2342
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:09,310
it's it's useful to have different tools
 

2343
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:12,300
it's it's useful to have different tools
available that sort of are suitable for

2344
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:12,310
available that sort of are suitable for
 

2345
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:15,090
available that sort of are suitable for
different tasks so I still write C code

2346
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:15,100
different tasks so I still write C code
 

2347
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:20,130
different tasks so I still write C code
I still write shellcode but I write most

2348
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:20,140
I still write shellcode but I write most
 

2349
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:26,280
I still write shellcode but I write most
of my things in Python why do I still

2350
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:26,290
of my things in Python why do I still
 

2351
01:00:26,290 --> 01:00:28,110
of my things in Python why do I still
use those other languages because

2352
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:28,120
use those other languages because
 

2353
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:32,930
use those other languages because
sometimes the task just demands it and

2354
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:32,940
sometimes the task just demands it and
 

2355
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:36,390
sometimes the task just demands it and
well I would say most of the time the

2356
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
well I would say most of the time the
 

2357
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,340
well I would say most of the time the
task actually demands a certain language

2358
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:38,350
task actually demands a certain language
 

2359
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,340
task actually demands a certain language
because the task is not write a program

2360
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:41,350
because the task is not write a program
 

2361
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:43,890
because the task is not write a program
that solves problem x from scratch but

2362
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:43,900
that solves problem x from scratch but
 

2363
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,190
that solves problem x from scratch but
it's more like fix bug in existing

2364
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:47,200
it's more like fix bug in existing
 

2365
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,370
it's more like fix bug in existing
program X or add a small feature to an

01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:50,380
program X or add a small feature to an
 

2367
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:59,340
program X or add a small feature to an
existing large program but even if if

2368
01:00:59,340 --> 01:00:59,350
existing large program but even if if
 

2369
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:03,330
existing large program but even if if
you sort of if you're not constrained in

01:01:03,330 --> 01:01:03,340
you sort of if you're not constrained in
 

2371
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:06,840
you sort of if you're not constrained in
your choice of language by context like

2372
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:06,850
your choice of language by context like
 

2373
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:12,540
your choice of language by context like
that there is still the fact that if you

2374
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:12,550
that there is still the fact that if you
 

2375
01:01:12,550 --> 01:01:15,270
that there is still the fact that if you
write it in a certain language then you

2376
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:15,280
write it in a certain language then you
 

2377
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,330
write it in a certain language then you
sort of you you have this balance

2378
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:21,340
sort of you you have this balance
 

2379
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,540
sort of you you have this balance
between how long does it time does it

take you to write the code and how long

take you to write the code and how long
 

2383
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:34,230
take you to write the code and how long
does the code run and when you're in

01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:34,240
does the code run and when you're in
 

2385

01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:42,520
solutions you often spend much more time
 

2389
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,000
solutions you often spend much more time
writing the code than running it because

2390
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:45,010
writing the code than running it because
 

2391
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:48,570
writing the code than running it because
every time you've sort of you've run it

01:01:48,570 --> 01:01:48,580
every time you've sort of you've run it
 

2393
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,390
every time you've sort of you've run it
you see that the output is not quite

you see that the output is not quite
 

2395
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,030
you see that the output is not quite
what you wanted and you spend some more

shook it it would stop working because
 

2429
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:55,070
shook it it would stop working because
it was not put together very well but it

01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,859
it was not put together very well but it

01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:33,810
disruption I mean I know nothing about

that when it comes to designing
 

2457
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:37,310
that when it comes to designing
electronics but I know a lot about that

01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:37,320
electronics but I know a lot about that
 

2459
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,550
electronics but I know a lot about that
when it comes to to writing code so the

2460
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:40,560
when it comes to to writing code so the
 

2461
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:44,330
when it comes to to writing code so the
initial initial steps are efficient fast

2462
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:44,340
initial initial steps are efficient fast
 

2463
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:46,040
initial initial steps are efficient fast
and there's not much stuff that gets in

2464
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:46,050
and there's not much stuff that gets in

2477
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,750
art of if the act of creating languages
is art and you had three months to do it

2478
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:08,760
is art and you had three months to do it
 

2479
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,040
is art and you had three months to do it
and initial steps and ha so you just

01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:13,050
and initial steps and ha so you just
 

2481
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,260

specified a bunch of goals sort of

2482
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:15,270
specified a bunch of goals sort of
 

2483
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,850
specified a bunch of goals sort of
things that you observe about Python

2484
01:04:16,850 --> 01:04:16,860
things that you observe about Python
 

2485
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,230
things that you observe about Python
perhaps you had those goals but how do

2486
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
perhaps you had those goals but how do
 

2487
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,390
perhaps you had those goals but how do
you create the rules the syntactic

2488
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:20,400
you create the rules the syntactic
 

2489
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,170
you create the rules the syntactic
structure the the features that result

2490
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:24,180
structure the the features that result
 

2491
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:27,500
structure the the features that result
in those so I have in the beginning and

01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:27,510
in those so I have in the beginning and
 

2493
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:29,120
in those so I have in the beginning and
I have follow-up questions about through

01:04:29,120 --> 01:04:29,130
I have follow-up questions about through
 

2495
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:31,520
I have follow-up questions about through
the evolution of Python 2 but in the

01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:31,530
the evolution of Python 2 but in the
 

2497
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:33,010
the evolution of Python 2 but in the
very beginning when you're sitting there

01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:33,020
very beginning when you're sitting there
 

2499
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:35,930
very beginning when you're sitting there
creating the lexical analyzers or

01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,540
everything from scratch I'm going to
borrow features from other languages

2510
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:53,550
borrow features from other languages
 

2511
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:55,220
borrow features from other languages
that I like Oh interesting so you

2512
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:55,230
that I like Oh interesting so you
 

2513
01:04:55,230 --> 01:04:57,500
that I like Oh interesting so you
basically exactly you first observe what

2514
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:57,510
basically exactly you first observe what
 

2515
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:00,680
basically exactly you first observe what
you like yeah and so that's why if

2516
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:00,690
you like yeah and so that's why if
 

2517
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,710
you like yeah and so that's why if
you're 17 years old and you want to sort

2518
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:03,720
you're 17 years old and you want to sort
 

2519
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,450
you're 17 years old and you want to sort
of create a programming language you're

2520
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:05,460
of create a programming language you're
 

2521
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,050
of create a programming language you're
not going to be very successful at it

2522
01:05:08,050 --> 01:05:08,060
not going to be very successful at it
 

2523
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,480
not going to be very successful at it
because you have no experience with

2524
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:11,490
because you have no experience with
 

2525
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:16,930
because you have no experience with
other languages whereas I was in my

2526
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:16,940
other languages whereas I was in my
 

2527
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:23,510
other languages whereas I was in my
let's say mid-30s I had written parsers

2528
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520
let's say mid-30s I had written parsers
 

2529
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,460
let's say mid-30s I had written parsers
before so I had worked on the

2530
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:25,470
before so I had worked on the
 

2531
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:28,540
before so I had worked on the
implementation of ABC I had spent years

2532
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:28,550
implementation of ABC I had spent years
 

2533
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:31,490
implementation of ABC I had spent years
debating the design of ABC with its

2534
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:31,500
debating the design of ABC with its
 

2535
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:34,610
debating the design of ABC with its
authors its with its designers I had

2536
01:05:34,610 --> 01:05:34,620
authors its with its designers I had
 

2537
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:36,050
authors its with its designers I had
nothing to do with the design it was

2538
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:36,060
nothing to do with the design it was
 

2539
01:05:36,060 --> 01:05:39,680
nothing to do with the design it was
designed fully as it was ended up being

2540
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:39,690
designed fully as it was ended up being
 

2541
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:42,110
designed fully as it was ended up being
implemented when I joined the team but

2542
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:42,120
implemented when I joined the team but
 

2543
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:47,840
implemented when I joined the team but
so you borrow ideas and concepts and

2544
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:47,850
so you borrow ideas and concepts and
 

2545
01:05:47,850 --> 01:05:51,050
so you borrow ideas and concepts and
very concrete sort of local rules from

2546
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:51,060
very concrete sort of local rules from
 

2547
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:52,820
very concrete sort of local rules from
different languages like the indentation

2548
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:52,830
different languages like the indentation
 

2549
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,970
different languages like the indentation
and certain other syntactic features

2550
01:05:55,970 --> 01:05:55,980
and certain other syntactic features
 

2551
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:00,260
and certain other syntactic features
from ABC but I chose to borrow string

2552
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:00,270
from ABC but I chose to borrow string
 

2553
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:05,920
from ABC but I chose to borrow string
literals and how numbers work from C and

2554
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:05,930
literals and how numbers work from C and
 

2555
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:09,590
literals and how numbers work from C and
various other things so in then if you

2556
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:09,600
various other things so in then if you
 

2557
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,170
various other things so in then if you
take that further so yet you've had this

2558
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:12,180
take that further so yet you've had this
 

2559
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:14,630
take that further so yet you've had this
funny sounding but I think surprisingly

2560
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:14,640
funny sounding but I think surprisingly
 

2561
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,860
funny sounding but I think surprisingly
accurate and or at least practical title

2562
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:18,870
accurate and or at least practical title
 

2563
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,110
accurate and or at least practical title
of a benevolent dictator for life for

01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:21,120

whatever or no not the actual title but

2568
01:06:25,309 --> 01:06:25,319
whatever or no not the actual title but
 

2569
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:28,519
whatever or no not the actual title but
functionally speaking so you had to make

2570
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:28,529
functionally speaking so you had to make
 

2571
01:06:28,529 --> 01:06:35,299
functionally speaking so you had to make
decisions design decisions can you maybe

2572
01:06:35,299 --> 01:06:35,309
decisions design decisions can you maybe

let's take Python - there's a Python

2574
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:37,829
let's take Python - there's a Python
 

2575
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:41,029
let's take Python - there's a Python
releasing Python 3 as an example mm-hmm

releasing Python 3 as an example mm-hmm
 

2577
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,569
releasing Python 3 as an example mm-hmm
it's not backward-compatible - Python -

2578
01:06:44,569 --> 01:06:44,579
it's not backward-compatible - Python -

it's not backward-compatible - Python -
in ways that a lot of people know so

2580
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:47,279
in ways that a lot of people know so
 

2581
01:06:47,279 --> 01:06:49,579
in ways that a lot of people know so
what was that deliberation discussion

2582
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:49,589
what was that deliberation discussion
 

2583
01:06:49,589 --> 01:06:51,559
what was that deliberation discussion
decision like we have what was the

2584
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:51,569
decision like we have what was the
 

2585
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,589
decision like we have what was the
psychology of that experience

2586
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
psychology of that experience
 

2587
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:56,299
psychology of that experience
do you regret any aspects of how that

2588
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:56,309
do you regret any aspects of how that
 

2589
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:59,989
do you regret any aspects of how that
experiments undergone that else yeah so

2590
01:06:59,989 --> 01:06:59,999
experiments undergone that else yeah so
 

2591
01:06:59,999 --> 01:07:03,319
experiments undergone that else yeah so
it was a group process really it at that

2592
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:03,329
it was a group process really it at that
 

2593
01:07:03,329 --> 01:07:07,099
it was a group process really it at that
point even though I was be DFL in nine a

2594
01:07:07,099 --> 01:07:07,109
point even though I was be DFL in nine a
 

2595
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:10,989
point even though I was be DFL in nine a
name and and certainly everybody sort of

01:07:10,989 --> 01:07:10,999
name and and certainly everybody sort of
 

2597
01:07:10,999 --> 01:07:16,130

respected my my position as the creator

2598
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:16,140
respected my my position as the creator
 

2599
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:19,489
respected my my position as the creator
and and the current sort of owner of the

and and the current sort of owner of the
 

2601
01:07:19,499 --> 01:07:22,999
and and the current sort of owner of the
language design I was looking at

2602
01:07:22,999 --> 01:07:23,009
language design I was looking at
 

2603
01:07:23,009 --> 01:07:26,799
language design I was looking at
everyone else for feedback sort of

2604
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:26,809
everyone else for feedback sort of
 

2605
01:07:26,809 --> 01:07:31,489
everyone else for feedback sort of
Python 300 in some sense was sparked by

2606
01:07:31,489 --> 01:07:31,499
Python 300 in some sense was sparked by
 

2607
01:07:31,499 --> 01:07:35,239
Python 300 in some sense was sparked by
other people in the community pointing

2608
01:07:35,239 --> 01:07:35,249
other people in the community pointing
 

2609
01:07:35,249 --> 01:07:41,470
other people in the community pointing
out oh well there are a few issues that

2610
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:41,480
out oh well there are a few issues that
 

2611
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:46,400
out oh well there are a few issues that
sort of bite users over and over can we

2612
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:46,410
sort of bite users over and over can we
 

2613
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:50,299
sort of bite users over and over can we
do something about that and for Python

2614
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:50,309
do something about that and for Python
 

2615
01:07:50,309 --> 01:07:53,749
do something about that and for Python
three we took a number of those Python

2616
01:07:53,749 --> 01:07:53,759
three we took a number of those Python
 

2617
01:07:53,759 --> 01:07:55,370
three we took a number of those Python
wards as they were called at the time

2618
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:55,380
wards as they were called at the time
 

2619
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:59,739
wards as they were called at the time
and we said can we try to sort of make

2620
01:07:59,739 --> 01:07:59,749
and we said can we try to sort of make
 

2621
01:07:59,749 --> 01:08:03,170
and we said can we try to sort of make
small changes to the language that

2622
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:03,180
small changes to the language that
 

2623
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,489
small changes to the language that
address those warts and we had sort of

2624
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:07,499
address those warts and we had sort of
 

2625
01:08:07,499 --> 01:08:11,599
address those warts and we had sort of
in the past we had always taken

2626
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:11,609
in the past we had always taken
 

2627
01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:14,029
in the past we had always taken
backwards compatibility very seriously

2628
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,039
backwards compatibility very seriously
 

2629
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:17,689
backwards compatibility very seriously
and so many Python warts in earlier

2630
01:08:17,689 --> 01:08:17,699
and so many Python warts in earlier
 

2631
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:19,789
and so many Python warts in earlier
versions had already been resolved

2632
01:08:19,789 --> 01:08:19,799
versions had already been resolved
 

2633
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:22,550
versions had already been resolved
because they could be resolved while

2634
01:08:22,550 --> 01:08:22,560
because they could be resolved while
 

2635
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,499
because they could be resolved while
maintaining backwards compatibility or

2636
01:08:24,499 --> 01:08:24,509
maintaining backwards compatibility or
 

2637
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:29,059
maintaining backwards compatibility or
sort of using a very gradual path of

2638
01:08:29,059 --> 01:08:29,069
sort of using a very gradual path of
 

2639
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:31,010
sort of using a very gradual path of
evolution of the language in a certain

2640
01:08:31,010 --> 01:08:31,020
evolution of the language in a certain
 

2641
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:33,740
evolution of the language in a certain
area and so we were stuck with a number

2642
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:33,750
area and so we were stuck with a number
 

2643
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:35,539
area and so we were stuck with a number
of warts that were

2644
01:08:35,539 --> 01:08:35,549
of warts that were
 

2645
01:08:35,549 --> 01:08:39,979
of warts that were
widely recognized as problems not like

2646
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:39,989
widely recognized as problems not like
 

2647
01:08:39,989 --> 01:08:42,370
widely recognized as problems not like
road blocks but nevertheless sort of

2648
01:08:42,370 --> 01:08:42,380
road blocks but nevertheless sort of
 

2649
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:45,109
road blocks but nevertheless sort of
things that some people trip over and

2650
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:45,119
things that some people trip over and
 

2651
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,379
things that some people trip over and
you know that that's always the same

2652
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:48,389
you know that that's always the same
 

2653
01:08:48,389 --> 01:08:50,329
you know that that's always the same
thing that that people trip over when

2654
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:50,339
thing that that people trip over when
 

2655
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:54,049
thing that that people trip over when
they trip and we could not think of a

2656
01:08:54,049 --> 01:08:54,059
they trip and we could not think of a
 

2657
01:08:54,059 --> 01:08:57,289
they trip and we could not think of a
backwards compatible way of resolving

2658
01:08:57,289 --> 01:08:57,299
backwards compatible way of resolving
 

2659
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,620
backwards compatible way of resolving
those issues but it's still an option to

2660
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:00,630
those issues but it's still an option to
 

2661
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:03,140
those issues but it's still an option to
not resolve the issues and so yes for

2662
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:03,150
not resolve the issues and so yes for
 

2663
01:09:03,150 --> 01:09:05,839
not resolve the issues and so yes for
for a long time we had sort of resigned

2664
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:05,849
for a long time we had sort of resigned
 

2665
01:09:05,849 --> 01:09:08,089
for a long time we had sort of resigned
ourselves to well okay the language is

2666
01:09:08,089 --> 01:09:08,099
ourselves to well okay the language is
 

2667
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:10,430
ourselves to well okay the language is
not going to be perfect in this way and

2668
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:10,440
not going to be perfect in this way and
 

2669
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:16,700
not going to be perfect in this way and
that way that way and we sort of certain

2670
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:16,710
that way that way and we sort of certain
 

2671
01:09:16,710 --> 01:09:18,470
that way that way and we sort of certain
of these I mean there are still plenty

2672
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
of these I mean there are still plenty
 

2673
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,589
of these I mean there are still plenty
of things where you can say well that's

2674
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:20,599
of things where you can say well that's

that particular detail is better in Java

2676
01:09:24,109 --> 01:09:24,119
that particular detail is better in Java
 

2677
01:09:24,119 --> 01:09:30,189
that particular detail is better in Java
or in R or in Visual Basic or whatever

2678

or in R or in Visual Basic or whatever
 

2679
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:34,669
or in R or in Visual Basic or whatever
and we're okay with that because well we

2680
01:09:34,669 --> 01:09:34,679
and we're okay with that because well we
 

2681
01:09:34,679 --> 01:09:38,539
and we're okay with that because well we
can't easily change it it's not too bad

2682
01:09:38,539 --> 01:09:38,549
can't easily change it it's not too bad
 

2683

we can do a little bit with user

2684
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:40,489
we can do a little bit with user
 

2685
01:09:40,489 --> 01:09:43,519
we can do a little bit with user
education or we can have a static

something
 

2691
01:09:48,659 --> 01:09:51,799
something
but there were things where we thought

2692
01:09:51,799 --> 01:09:51,809
but there were things where we thought
 

2693
01:09:51,809 --> 01:09:54,350
but there were things where we thought
well these are really problems that are

2694
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:54,360
well these are really problems that are
 

2695
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,350
well these are really problems that are
not going away they are getting worse in

2696
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:57,360
not going away they are getting worse in

the future we should do something about

2698
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:02,070
the future we should do something about
 

2699
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:03,799
the future we should do something about
do something but ultimately there is a

2700

do something but ultimately there is a
 

2701
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:08,660

2702
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:08,670
decision to be made right yes so was
 

2703
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:10,100
decision to be made right yes so was
that the toughest decision in the

2704
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:10,110
that the toughest decision in the
 

2705
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:12,470
that the toughest decision in the
history of Python yet to make as the

2706
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
history of Python yet to make as the
 

2707
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,620

scale what was a decision where you were
 

2713
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,120
scale what was a decision where you were
really torn up about well the toughest

2714
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:23,130
really torn up about well the toughest
 

2715
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:27,169
really torn up about well the toughest
decision was probably to resign all

2716
01:10:27,169 --> 01:10:27,179
decision was probably to resign all
 

2717

a favorite activity in the programming

2952
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:19,230
a favorite activity in the programming
 

2953
01:16:19,230 --> 01:16:21,110
a favorite activity in the programming
community and what is the psychology

2954

2969
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:48,979
would not be a good thing I think there
is a middle ground where sort of being

2970
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:48,989
is a middle ground where sort of being
 

2971
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:52,780
is a middle ground where sort of being
nasty to each other is not okay but

2972
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:52,790
nasty to each other is not okay but
 

2973
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:56,180
nasty to each other is not okay but

I think that Python is not the language

3142
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:41,560
I think that Python is not the language
 

3143
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:45,210
I think that Python is not the language
for that there are there are ways to

3144
01:21:45,210 --> 01:21:45,220
for that there are there are ways to
 

3145
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:48,630
for that there are there are ways to
work around it but you sort of you can't

3146
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:48,640
work around it but you sort of you can't
 

3147
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:53,220
work around it but you sort of you can't
expect to write an algorithm in Python

3148
01:21:53,220 --> 01:21:53,230
expect to write an algorithm in Python
 

3149
01:21:53,230 --> 01:21:55,380
expect to write an algorithm in Python
and have a compiler or

3150
01:21:55,380 --> 01:21:55,390
and have a compiler or
 

3151
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:58,830
and have a compiler or
paralyzed that what you can do is use a

3152
01:21:58,830 --> 01:21:58,840
paralyzed that what you can do is use a
 

3153
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:01,020
paralyzed that what you can do is use a
package like numpy and they're a bunch

3154
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:01,030
package like numpy and they're a bunch
 

3155
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:04,560
package like numpy and they're a bunch
of other very powerful packages that

3156
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:04,570
of other very powerful packages that
 

3157
01:22:04,570 --> 01:22:08,070
of other very powerful packages that
sort of use all the CPUs available

3158
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
sort of use all the CPUs available
 

3159
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,340
sort of use all the CPUs available
because you tell the package here's the

3160
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:11,350
because you tell the package here's the
 

3161
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:14,220
because you tell the package here's the
data here's the abstract operation to

3162
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:14,230
data here's the abstract operation to
 

3163
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:17,040
data here's the abstract operation to
apply over it go at it and then then

3164
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:17,050
apply over it go at it and then then
 

3165
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:19,980
apply over it go at it and then then
we're back in the c++ world but those

3166
01:22:19,980 --> 01:22:19,990
we're back in the c++ world but those
 

3167
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,230
we're back in the c++ world but those
packages are themselves implemented

3168
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:22,240
packages are themselves implemented
 

3169
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,420
packages are themselves implemented
usually in c++ that's right that's so

3170
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:24,430
usually in c++ that's right that's so
 

3171
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:25,620
usually in c++ that's right that's so
that's where Tenzin phoned all these

3172
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:25,630
that's where Tenzin phoned all these
 

3173
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,970
that's where Tenzin phoned all these
acts just come in where they paralyze

3174
01:22:26,970 --> 01:22:26,980
acts just come in where they paralyze
 

3175
01:22:26,980 --> 01:22:29,010
acts just come in where they paralyze
across GPUs for example they take care

01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:29,020
across GPUs for example they take care
 

3177
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:32,340
across GPUs for example they take care
of that fit so in terms of packaging can

3178
01:22:32,340 --> 01:22:32,350
of that fit so in terms of packaging can
 

3179
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:36,630
of that fit so in terms of packaging can
you comment on this yeah my it packaging

3180
01:22:36,630 --> 01:22:36,640
you comment on this yeah my it packaging
 

3181
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:39,960
you comment on this yeah my it packaging
has always been my least favorite topic

3182
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:39,970
has always been my least favorite topic
 

3183
01:22:39,970 --> 01:22:43,950
has always been my least favorite topic
it's it's it's a really tough problem

3184
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:43,960
it's it's it's a really tough problem
 

3185
01:22:43,960 --> 01:22:50,160
it's it's it's a really tough problem
because the OS and the platform want to

because the OS and the platform want to
 

3187
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:56,490
because the OS and the platform want to
own packaging but their packaging

like if you take Linux there are two

3192
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:02,350
like if you take Linux there are two
 

3193
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:04,680
like if you take Linux there are two
competing packaging solutions for Linux

competing packaging solutions for Linux
 

3195
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:10,260
competing packaging solutions for Linux
or for UNIX in in general and but they

01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:10,270
or for UNIX in in general and but they
 

3197
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:14,060
or for UNIX in in general and but they
all work across all languages and

3198
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:14,070
all work across all languages and
 

3199
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:19,670
all work across all languages and
several languages like node JavaScript

3200
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:19,680
several languages like node JavaScript
 

3201
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:23,220
several languages like node JavaScript
and Ruby and Python all have their own

3202
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:23,230
and Ruby and Python all have their own
 

3203
01:23:23,230 --> 01:23:25,590
and Ruby and Python all have their own
packaging solutions that only work

01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:25,600
packaging solutions that only work
 

3205
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:28,070

well what should you use that is a tough

3208
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:33,210
well what should you use that is a tough
 

3209
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:37,440
well what should you use that is a tough
problem my own own approach is I use the

3210
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:37,450
problem my own own approach is I use the
 

3211
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:41,070
problem my own own approach is I use the
system packaging system to install

3212
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:41,080
system packaging system to install
 

3213
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:44,130

Python and I use the Python packaging

3214
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:44,140
Python and I use the Python packaging
 

3215
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:46,620
Python and I use the Python packaging
system then to install third party

3216
01:23:46,620 --> 01:23:46,630
system then to install third party
 

3217
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:50,160

Python packages that's what most people

3218
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:50,170
Python packages that's what most people
 

3219
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:50,520

ten years ago Python packaging was
 

3223
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,900
ten years ago Python packaging was
really a terrible situation nowadays pip

01:23:57,900 --> 01:23:57,910
really a terrible situation nowadays pip

is the future there is there is a

01:23:59,880 --> 01:23:59,890
is the future there is there is a

don't think there is a need for more

01:25:19,490 --> 01:25:21,750
well I would say that Python is
definitely the best thing I've ever done
