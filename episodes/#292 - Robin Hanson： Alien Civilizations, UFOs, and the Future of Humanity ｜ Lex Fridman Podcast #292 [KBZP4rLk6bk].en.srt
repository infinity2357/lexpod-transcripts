115
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,750
stuff
that's the key concept so if they were

116
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:11,760
that's the key concept so if they were
 

117
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,949
that's the key concept so if they were
out there

118
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:12,959
out there
 

119
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,830
out there
we would notice that's the key idea

120
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
we would notice that's the key idea
 

121
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,470
we would notice that's the key idea
so the question is where are the grabby

122
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:18,480
so the question is where are the grabby
 

123
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,030
so the question is where are the grabby
aliens so fermi's question is where are

124
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:21,040
aliens so fermi's question is where are
 

125
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,750
aliens so fermi's question is where are
the aliens and we could vary that in two

126
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:23,760
the aliens and we could vary that in two
 

127
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,070
the aliens and we could vary that in two
terms right where are the quiet hard to

128
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,080
terms right where are the quiet hard to
 

129
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,470
terms right where are the quiet hard to
see aliens and where are the big loud

130
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:28,480
see aliens and where are the big loud
 

131
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,150
see aliens and where are the big loud
grabby aliens

132
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,160
grabby aliens
 

133
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,710
grabby aliens
so it's actually hard to say where all

134
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
so it's actually hard to say where all
 

135
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,710
so it's actually hard to say where all
the quiet ones are right

136
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:34,720
the quiet ones are right
 

137
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,630
the quiet ones are right
there could be a lot of them out there

138
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:36,640
there could be a lot of them out there
 

139
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,830
there could be a lot of them out there
because they're not doing much they're

140
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
because they're not doing much they're
 

141
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,589
because they're not doing much they're
not making a big difference in the world

142
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:39,599

we don't know exactly what they do with
where they went but the idea is they're

00:02:48,229 --> 00:02:48,239
where they went but the idea is they're
 

151
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,550
where they went but the idea is they're
in some sort of competitive world where

in some sort of competitive world where
 

153
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,949
in some sort of competitive world where
each part of them is trying to grab more

and do something with it

and do something with it

00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:04,480
isn't to leave it
 

167
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,910
isn't to leave it
alone the way it

168
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:05,920
alone the way it
 

169
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,589
alone the way it
started right so we humans when we go

170
00:03:07,589 --> 00:03:07,599
started right so we humans when we go
 

171
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,670
started right so we humans when we go
around the earth and use stuff we change

172
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
around the earth and use stuff we change
 

173
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,630
around the earth and use stuff we change
it we turn a forest into a farmland

174
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:12,640
it we turn a forest into a farmland
 

175
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,710
it we turn a forest into a farmland
turn a harbor into a city

176
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:14,720
turn a harbor into a city
 

177
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,390
turn a harbor into a city
so the idea is

178
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:16,400
so the idea is
 

179
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,550
so the idea is
aliens would do something with it and so

180
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
aliens would do something with it and so
 

181
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,990
aliens would do something with it and so
we're not exactly sure what it would

182
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,000
we're not exactly sure what it would
 

183
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,350
we're not exactly sure what it would
look like but it would look different so

184
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,360
look like but it would look different so
 

185
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,869
look like but it would look different so
somewhere in the sky we would see big

186
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
somewhere in the sky we would see big
 

187
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,309
somewhere in the sky we would see big
spheres

188
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:24,319
spheres
 

189
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,550
spheres
of different activity where things had

190
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
of different activity where things had
 

191
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,949
of different activity where things had
been changed because they had been there

192
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:28,959
been changed because they had been there
 

193
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,750
been changed because they had been there
expanding spheres right so as you expand

194
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
expanding spheres right so as you expand
 

195
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,509
expanding spheres right so as you expand
you aggressively interact and change the

196
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:33,519
you aggressively interact and change the
 

197
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,949
you aggressively interact and change the
environment so the word grabby versus

198
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:36,959
environment so the word grabby versus
 

199
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,710
environment so the word grabby versus
loud you're using them sometimes

200
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
loud you're using them sometimes
 

201
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,990
loud you're using them sometimes
synonymously sometimes not gravity to me

202
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
synonymously sometimes not gravity to me
 

203
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,229
synonymously sometimes not gravity to me
is a little bit more

204
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:44,239
is a little bit more
 

205
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,750
is a little bit more
aggressive

206
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
aggressive
 

207
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,750
aggressive
what does it mean to be loud what does

208
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
what does it mean to be loud what does
 

209
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,190
what does it mean to be loud what does
it mean to be grabby what's the

210
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,200
it mean to be grabby what's the
 

211
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,509
it mean to be grabby what's the
difference and loud in what way is it

212
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:51,519
difference and loud in what way is it
 

213
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,309
difference and loud in what way is it
visual is it sound is it some other

214
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:54,319
visual is it sound is it some other
 

215
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,229
visual is it sound is it some other
physical phenomena like gravitational

216
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
physical phenomena like gravitational
 

217
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,869
physical phenomena like gravitational
waves what are you using this kind of in

218
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
waves what are you using this kind of in
 

219
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,509
waves what are you using this kind of in
a broad philosophical sense so there's a

220
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:01,519
a broad philosophical sense so there's a
 

221
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,949
a broad philosophical sense so there's a
specific

222
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:02,959
specific
 

223
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,190

thing that it means to be

224
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,200
thing that it means to be
 

225
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,750
thing that it means to be
loud in this universe of ours my

226
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:07,760
loud in this universe of ours my
 

227
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,750
loud in this universe of ours my
co-authors and i put together a paper

228
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:09,760
co-authors and i put together a paper
 

229
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,789
co-authors and i put together a paper
with a particular mathematical model

230
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:12,799
with a particular mathematical model
 

231
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,429
with a particular mathematical model
and so we use the term grabby aliens to

232
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:15,439
and so we use the term grabby aliens to
 

233
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,830
and so we use the term grabby aliens to
describe that more particular model and

234
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:17,840
describe that more particular model and
 

235
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,749
describe that more particular model and
the idea is it's a more particular model

236
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
the idea is it's a more particular model
 

237
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,230
the idea is it's a more particular model
of the general concept of loud so loud

238
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
of the general concept of loud so loud
 

239
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,070
of the general concept of loud so loud
would just be the general idea that they

240
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:24,080
would just be the general idea that they
 

241
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,749
would just be the general idea that they
would be really obvious

242
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
would be really obvious
 

243
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,670
would be really obvious
so grabby is the technical term is it in

244
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
so grabby is the technical term is it in
 

245
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,710
so grabby is the technical term is it in
the title of the paper it's in the body

246
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:30,720
the title of the paper it's in the body
 

247
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,469
the title of the paper it's in the body
the title is actually about loud and

248
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
the title is actually about loud and
 

249
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,870
the title is actually about loud and
quiet right so the idea is there's you

250
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:34,880
quiet right so the idea is there's you
 

251
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,230
quiet right so the idea is there's you
know you want to distinguish your

252
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:36,240
know you want to distinguish your
 

253
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,670
know you want to distinguish your
particular model of things from the

254
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:37,680
particular model of things from the
 

255
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,189
particular model of things from the
general category of things everybody

256
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
general category of things everybody
 

257
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,710
general category of things everybody
else might talk about so that's how we

258
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:40,720
else might talk about so that's how we
 

259
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,710
else might talk about so that's how we
distinguish the paper titles if loud

260
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:42,720
distinguish the paper titles if loud
 

261
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,430
distinguish the paper titles if loud
aliens explain human earliness quiet

262
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
aliens explain human earliness quiet
 

263
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,070
aliens explain human earliness quiet
aliens are also rare

00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
humanity's level then the chance of this

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,110
humanity's level then the chance of this
event rose as time to the nth power so

event rose as time to the nth power so
 

275
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,550
event rose as time to the nth power so
we'll talk about power we'll talk about

00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
we'll talk about power we'll talk about

so what is the technical definition of

280
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:08,840
so what is the technical definition of
 

281
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,550
so what is the technical definition of
grabby how do you envision grabbiness

282
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
grabby how do you envision grabbiness
 

283
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,629
grabby how do you envision grabbiness
and why are

284
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:14,639
and why are
 

285
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,110
and why are
uh in contrast with humans why aren't

286
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
uh in contrast with humans why aren't
 

287
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,909
uh in contrast with humans why aren't
humans grabby so like where's that line

288
00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:19,919
humans grabby so like where's that line
 

289
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,909
humans grabby so like where's that line
is it well definable what is grabbing

290
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:21,919
is it well definable what is grabbing
 

291
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,670
is it well definable what is grabbing
what is non-grabby

292
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
what is non-grabby
 

293
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,909
what is non-grabby
we have a mathematical model of the

294
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
we have a mathematical model of the
 

295
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,629
we have a mathematical model of the
distribution of advanced civilizations

296
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:28,639
distribution of advanced civilizations
 

297
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,110
distribution of advanced civilizations
i.e aliens in space and time

298
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:31,120
i.e aliens in space and time
 

299
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,070
i.e aliens in space and time
that model has three parameters

300
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:34,080
that model has three parameters
 

301
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,430
that model has three parameters
and we can set each one of those

302
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
and we can set each one of those
 

303
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,270
and we can set each one of those
parameters from data

304
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
parameters from data
 

305
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,150
parameters from data
and therefore we claim this is actually

306
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,160
and therefore we claim this is actually
 

307
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,590
and therefore we claim this is actually
what we know about where they are in

308
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
what we know about where they are in
 

309
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,870
what we know about where they are in
space time

310
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:42,880
space time
 

311
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,270
space time
so the key idea is they appear at some

312
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,280
so the key idea is they appear at some
 

313
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,430
so the key idea is they appear at some
point in space time

314
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
point in space time
 

315
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,830
point in space time
and then after some short delay they

316
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:49,840
and then after some short delay they
 

317
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,110
and then after some short delay they
start expanding

318
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:51,120
start expanding
 

319
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,270
start expanding
and they expand at some speed

320
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
and they expand at some speed
 

321
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,189
and they expand at some speed
and the speed is one of those parameters

322
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
and the speed is one of those parameters
 

323
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,950
and the speed is one of those parameters
that's one of the three and the other

324
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
that's one of the three and the other
 

325
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,870
that's one of the three and the other
two parameters are about

326
00:05:58,870 --> 00:05:58,880
two parameters are about
 

327
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,390
two parameters are about
how they appear in time that is they

328
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:00,400
how they appear in time that is they
 

329
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,550
how they appear in time that is they
appear at random places

330
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:02,560
appear at random places
 

331
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,469
appear at random places
and they appear in time according to a

332
00:06:04,469 --> 00:06:04,479
and they appear in time according to a
 

333
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,590
and they appear in time according to a
power law

334
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:05,600
power law
 

335
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,430
power law
and that power law has two parameters

336
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
and that power law has two parameters
 

337
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,270
and that power law has two parameters
and we can fit each of those parameters

338
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:09,280
and we can fit each of those parameters
 

339
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,670
and we can fit each of those parameters
to data and so then we can say

340
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:11,680
to data and so then we can say
 

341
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,870
to data and so then we can say
now we know

342
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:12,880
now we know
 

343
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,550
now we know
we know the distribution of advanced

344
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:14,560
we know the distribution of advanced
 

345
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,870
we know the distribution of advanced
civilizations in space and time so

346
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
civilizations in space and time so
 

347
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,350
civilizations in space and time so
we are right now a new civilization and

348
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
we are right now a new civilization and
 

349
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,830
we are right now a new civilization and
we have not yet started to expand but

350
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
we have not yet started to expand but
 

351
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,430
we have not yet started to expand but
plausibly we would start to do that

352
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
plausibly we would start to do that
 

353
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,430
plausibly we would start to do that
within say 10 million years of the

354
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,440
within say 10 million years of the
 

355
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,710
within say 10 million years of the
current moment

356
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
current moment
 

357
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,390
current moment
that's plenty of time and 10 million

358
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
that's plenty of time and 10 million
 

359
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,390
that's plenty of time and 10 million
years is a really short duration in the

360
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
years is a really short duration in the
 

361
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,230
years is a really short duration in the
history of the universe so

362
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
history of the universe so
 

363
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,350
history of the universe so
we are

364
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
we are
 

365
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,070
we are
at the moment a sort of random sample of

366
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
at the moment a sort of random sample of
 

367
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,830
at the moment a sort of random sample of
the kind of times at which an advanced

368
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
the kind of times at which an advanced
 

369
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,990
the kind of times at which an advanced
civilization might appear because we may

370
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:40,000
civilization might appear because we may
 

371
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,670
civilization might appear because we may
or may not become grabby but if we do

372
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:41,680
or may not become grabby but if we do
 

373
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,390
or may not become grabby but if we do
we'll do it soon and so our current date

374
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:44,400
we'll do it soon and so our current date
 

375
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,830
we'll do it soon and so our current date
is a sample and that gives us one of the

376
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
is a sample and that gives us one of the
 

377
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,110
is a sample and that gives us one of the
other parameters

378
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,120
other parameters
 

379
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,870
other parameters
the second parameter is the constant in

380
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
the second parameter is the constant in
 

381
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,950
the second parameter is the constant in
front of the power law and that's

382
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
front of the power law and that's
 

383
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,510
front of the power law and that's
arrived from our current date

384
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:53,520
arrived from our current date
 

385
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,790
arrived from our current date
so power law what is the n

386
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:56,800
so power law what is the n
 

387
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,990
so power law what is the n
in the

388
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,000
in the
 

389
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,749
in the
in the power law that's the what is the

390
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
in the power law that's the what is the
 

391
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,830
in the power law that's the what is the
complicated thing to explain right

392
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
complicated thing to explain right
 

393
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,390
complicated thing to explain right
advanced life appeared by going through

394
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:04,400
advanced life appeared by going through
 

395
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,270
advanced life appeared by going through
a sequence of hard steps

396
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:07,280
a sequence of hard steps
 

397
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,430
a sequence of hard steps
so starting with very simple life and

398
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
so starting with very simple life and
 

399
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,029
so starting with very simple life and
here we are at the end of this process

400
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:11,039
here we are at the end of this process
 

401
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,950
here we are at the end of this process
at pretty advanced life and so we had to

402
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:12,960
at pretty advanced life and so we had to
 

403
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,029
at pretty advanced life and so we had to
go through some intermediate steps such

404
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:15,039
go through some intermediate steps such
 

405
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,510
go through some intermediate steps such
as you know sexual selection

406
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
as you know sexual selection
 

407
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,790
as you know sexual selection
photosynthesis multicellular animals

408
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
photosynthesis multicellular animals
 

409
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,870
photosynthesis multicellular animals
and the idea is that each of those steps

410
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:22,880
and the idea is that each of those steps
 

411
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,550
and the idea is that each of those steps
was hard

412
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
was hard
 

413
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,150
was hard
evolution just took a long time

414
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,160
evolution just took a long time
 

415
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,189
evolution just took a long time
searching in a big space of

416
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:27,199
searching in a big space of
 

417
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,430
searching in a big space of
possibilities to find each of those

418
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
possibilities to find each of those
 

419
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,710
possibilities to find each of those
steps

420
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:30,720
steps
 

421
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,029
steps
and the challenge was to achieve all of

422
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
and the challenge was to achieve all of
 

423
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,350
and the challenge was to achieve all of
those steps by a deadline of when the

424
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:35,360
those steps by a deadline of when the
 

425
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,469
those steps by a deadline of when the
planets

426
00:07:36,469 --> 00:07:36,479
planets
 

427
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,270
planets
would no longer host a simple life

428
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,280
would no longer host a simple life
 

429
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,749
would no longer host a simple life
and so earth has been really lucky

430
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:41,759
and so earth has been really lucky
 

431
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,670
and so earth has been really lucky
compared to all the other billions of

432
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,680
compared to all the other billions of
 

433
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,670
compared to all the other billions of
planets out there and that we managed to

434
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:45,680
planets out there and that we managed to
 

435
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,230
planets out there and that we managed to
achieve all these steps in the short

436
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:48,240
achieve all these steps in the short
 

437
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,909
achieve all these steps in the short
time of the

438
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
time of the
 

439
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,390
time of the
five billion years that earth

440
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:52,400
five billion years that earth
 

441
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,390
five billion years that earth
is can support simple life so not all

442
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:54,400
is can support simple life so not all
 

443
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,990
is can support simple life so not all
steps but a lot of them because we don't

444
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:56,000
steps but a lot of them because we don't
 

445
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,749
steps but a lot of them because we don't
know how many steps there are before you

446
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:57,759
know how many steps there are before you
 

447
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,350
know how many steps there are before you
start the expansion so these are all the

448
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,360
start the expansion so these are all the
 

449
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,350
start the expansion so these are all the
steps from the birth

450
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:01,360
steps from the birth
 

451
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,550
steps from the birth
of life to the initiation of major

452
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:04,560
of life to the initiation of major
 

453
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,550
of life to the initiation of major
expansion right so we're pretty sure

454
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
expansion right so we're pretty sure
 

455
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,710
expansion right so we're pretty sure
that it would happen really soon so that

456
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:08,720
that it would happen really soon so that
 

457
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,070
that it would happen really soon so that
it couldn't be

458
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,080
it couldn't be
 

459
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,749
it couldn't be
the same sort of a hard step as the last

460
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
the same sort of a hard step as the last
 

461
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,150
the same sort of a hard step as the last
ones in terms of taking a long time so

462
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:14,160
ones in terms of taking a long time so
 

463
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,869
ones in terms of taking a long time so
when we look at the history of earth we

464
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
when we look at the history of earth we
 

465
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,790
when we look at the history of earth we
look at the durations of the major

466
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:18,800
look at the durations of the major
 

467
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,790
look at the durations of the major
things that have happened

468
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
things that have happened
 

469
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,589
things that have happened
that

470
00:08:21,589 --> 00:08:21,599
that
 

471
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,830
that
suggests that there's roughly say six

472
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
suggests that there's roughly say six
 

473
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,070
suggests that there's roughly say six
hard steps that happened say between 3

474
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:26,080
hard steps that happened say between 3
 

475
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,589
hard steps that happened say between 3
and 12

476
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:27,599
and 12
 

477
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,990
and 12
and that we have just achieved the last

478
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
and that we have just achieved the last
 

479
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,230
and that we have just achieved the last
one that would take a long time

480
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,240
one that would take a long time
 

481
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,990
one that would take a long time
which is um

482
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:34,000
which is um
 

483
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,829
which is um
well we don't know

484
00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:35,839
well we don't know
 

485
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,589
well we don't know
but whatever it is we've just achieved

486
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:37,599
but whatever it is we've just achieved
 

487
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,269
but whatever it is we've just achieved
the last one are we talking about humans

488
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:39,279
the last one are we talking about humans
 

489
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,430
the last one are we talking about humans
or aliens here so let's talk about some

490
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:41,440
or aliens here so let's talk about some
 

491
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,350
or aliens here so let's talk about some
of these steps yeah so uh earth is

492
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:43,360
of these steps yeah so uh earth is
 

493
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,110
of these steps yeah so uh earth is
really special in some way we don't

494
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,120
really special in some way we don't
 

495
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,470
really special in some way we don't
exactly know

496
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:46,480
exactly know
 

497
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,150
exactly know
the level of specialness we don't really

498
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:48,160
the level of specialness we don't really
 

499
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,790
the level of specialness we don't really
know which steps were the hardest or not

500
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
know which steps were the hardest or not
 

501
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,350
know which steps were the hardest or not
because we just have a sample of one but

502
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,360
because we just have a sample of one but
 

503
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,190
because we just have a sample of one but
you're saying that there's three to 12

504
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:55,200
you're saying that there's three to 12
 

505
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,269
you're saying that there's three to 12
steps that we have to go through to get

506
00:08:57,269 --> 00:08:57,279
steps that we have to go through to get
 

507
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,430
steps that we have to go through to get
to where we are that are hard steps hard

508
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
to where we are that are hard steps hard
 

509
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,269
to where we are that are hard steps hard
to find by something that

510
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:01,279
to find by something that
 

511
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,070
to find by something that
took

512
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
took
 

513
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,750
took
uh a long time and is unlikely there's a

514
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
uh a long time and is unlikely there's a
 

515
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,550
uh a long time and is unlikely there's a
lot of

516
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:06,560
lot of
 

517
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,910
lot of
there's a lot of ways to fail there's a

518
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:07,920
there's a lot of ways to fail there's a
 

519
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,790
there's a lot of ways to fail there's a
lot more ways to fail than to succeed

520
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:10,800
lot more ways to fail than to succeed
 

521
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,630
lot more ways to fail than to succeed
the first step would be sort of the very

522
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
the first step would be sort of the very
 

523
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,829
the first step would be sort of the very
simplest form of life of any sort

524
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:15,839
simplest form of life of any sort
 

525
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,790
simplest form of life of any sort
and then um we don't know whether that

526
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:18,800
and then um we don't know whether that
 

527
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,630
and then um we don't know whether that
first word is the first sort that we see

528
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
first word is the first sort that we see
 

529
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,710
first word is the first sort that we see
in the historical record or not

530
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:22,720
in the historical record or not
 

531
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,150
in the historical record or not
but then some other steps are say the

532
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,160
but then some other steps are say the
 

533
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,070
but then some other steps are say the
development of photosynthesis

534
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
development of photosynthesis
 

535
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,350
development of photosynthesis
the development of sexual reproduction

536
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
the development of sexual reproduction
 

537
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,670
the development of sexual reproduction
there's the development of eukaryote

538
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:31,680
there's the development of eukaryote
 

539
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,949
there's the development of eukaryote
cells which are certain kind of

540
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:32,959
cells which are certain kind of
 

541
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:35,110
cells which are certain kind of
complicated cell that seems to have only

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:35,120
complicated cell that seems to have only

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,710
complicated cell that seems to have only
appeared once

544
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:36,720
appeared once
 

545
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,949
appeared once
and then there's multicellularity that

546
00:09:38,949 --> 00:09:38,959
and then there's multicellularity that
 

547
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,710
and then there's multicellularity that
is multiple cells coming together to

548
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
is multiple cells coming together to
 

549
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,030
is multiple cells coming together to
large organisms like us

550
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,040
large organisms like us
 

551
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,070

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:49,200
fit all these steps into a finite window
 

557
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,870
fit all these steps into a finite window
the model actually predicts that these

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:50,880
the model actually predicts that these
 

559
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,110

steps could be a varying difficulties
 

561
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,710
steps could be a varying difficulties
that is they could each take different

562
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
that is they could each take different
 

563
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,269
that is they could each take different
amounts of time on average but if you're

564
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:57,279
amounts of time on average but if you're
 

565
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,949
amounts of time on average but if you're
lucky enough that they all appear in a

566
00:09:58,949 --> 00:09:58,959
lucky enough that they all appear in a
 

567
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,030
lucky enough that they all appear in a
very short time then the durations

568
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
very short time then the durations
 

569
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,509
very short time then the durations
between them will be roughly equal

570
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
between them will be roughly equal
 

571
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,150
between them will be roughly equal
and the time remaining left over in the

572
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
and the time remaining left over in the
 

573
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,910
and the time remaining left over in the
rest of the window will also be the same

574
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:07,920
rest of the window will also be the same
 

575
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,110
rest of the window will also be the same
length so

576
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
length so
 

577
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,870
length so
we at the moment have roughly a billion

life appeared roughly 400 million years

586
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
life appeared roughly 400 million years
 

587
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,389
life appeared roughly 400 million years
after the very first time when life was

588
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
after the very first time when life was
 

589
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,389

possible at the very beginning
 

591
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,230
possible at the very beginning
so those two numbers right there give

592
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
so those two numbers right there give
 

593
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,870
so those two numbers right there give
you the rough estimate of six hard steps

657
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,430
solving for e using the observed
durations of 1.1 and 0.4 then gives e

just to get to where we are right we
 

669
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,269
just to get to where we are right we
started at the bottom now we're here and

that took six steps on average the key

672
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
that took six steps on average the key

00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,350
that took six steps on average the key

random planet would take you know

678
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:03,440
random planet would take you know
 

679
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,670
random planet would take you know
trillions or trillions of trill you know

680
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
trillions or trillions of trill you know
 

681
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,990
trillions or trillions of trill you know
of years just a really long time and so

682
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:08,000
of years just a really long time and so
 

683
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,350
of years just a really long time and so
we're really lucky that they all

684
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
we're really lucky that they all
 

685
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,750
we're really lucky that they all
happened really fast in a short time

686
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
happened really fast in a short time
 

687
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,829
happened really fast in a short time
before our window closed

688
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
before our window closed
 

689
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,470
before our window closed
and the chance of that happening

690
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:16,480
and the chance of that happening
 

691
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,470
and the chance of that happening
in that short window goes as that time

692
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:18,480
in that short window goes as that time
 

693
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,069
in that short window goes as that time
period to the power of the number of

694
00:12:20,069 --> 00:12:20,079
period to the power of the number of
 

695
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,069
period to the power of the number of
steps and so that was where the power we

696
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:22,079
steps and so that was where the power we
 

697
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,190
steps and so that was where the power we
talked about before it came from and so

698
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:25,200
talked about before it came from and so
 

699
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,629
talked about before it came from and so
that means in the history of the

700
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
that means in the history of the
 

701
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,550
that means in the history of the
universe we should overall roughly

702
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:28,560
universe we should overall roughly
 

703
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,110
universe we should overall roughly
expect advanced life to appear as a

704
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
expect advanced life to appear as a
 

705
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,590
expect advanced life to appear as a
power law in time

706
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
power law in time
 

707
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,190
power law in time
so that very early on there was very

708
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:35,200
so that very early on there was very
 

709
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,629
so that very early on there was very
little chance of anything appearing and

710
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
little chance of anything appearing and
 

711
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,629
little chance of anything appearing and
then later on as things appear other

712
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:38,639
then later on as things appear other
 

713
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,470
then later on as things appear other
things are appearing somewhat closer to

714
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:40,480
things are appearing somewhat closer to
 

715
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,710
things are appearing somewhat closer to
them in time because they're all going

716
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
them in time because they're all going
 

717
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,150
them in time because they're all going
as this power law

718
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
as this power law
 

719
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,470
as this power law
what is the power law can we for people

720
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:46,480
what is the power law can we for people
 

721
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,949
what is the power law can we for people
who are not sure math inclined can you

722
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
who are not sure math inclined can you
 

723
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,790
who are not sure math inclined can you
describe what a power so

724
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
describe what a power so
 

725
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,590
describe what a power so
say the function x is linear and x

726
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:53,600
say the function x is linear and x
 

727
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,310
say the function x is linear and x
squared is quadratic so it's the power

728
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
squared is quadratic so it's the power
 

729
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,430
squared is quadratic so it's the power
of 2. if we make x to the 3 that's

730
00:12:59,430 --> 00:12:59,440
of 2. if we make x to the 3 that's
 

731
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,629
of 2. if we make x to the 3 that's
cubic or the power of 3. and so x to the

732
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
cubic or the power of 3. and so x to the
 

733
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,790
cubic or the power of 3. and so x to the
6th is the power of 6. and so we'd say

734
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
6th is the power of 6. and so we'd say
 

735
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,190
6th is the power of 6. and so we'd say
life appears in the universe on a planet

736
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
life appears in the universe on a planet
 

737
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,590
life appears in the universe on a planet
like earth in that proportion to the

738
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
like earth in that proportion to the
 

739
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,269
like earth in that proportion to the
time that it's been

740
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:13,279
time that it's been
 

741
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,230
time that it's been
you know uh ready for life

742
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
you know uh ready for life
 

743
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,069
you know uh ready for life
to appear

744
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
to appear
 

745
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,110
to appear
and that

746
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
and that
 

747
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,269
and that
over the universe in general it'll

748
00:13:21,269 --> 00:13:21,279
over the universe in general it'll
 

749
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,990
over the universe in general it'll
appear at roughly a power law like that

750
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,000
appear at roughly a power law like that
 

751
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,069
appear at roughly a power law like that
what is the exponent what is n

752
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:26,079
what is the exponent what is n
 

753
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,069
what is the exponent what is n
uh is it the number of hearts yes the

754
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
uh is it the number of hearts yes the
 

755
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,230
uh is it the number of hearts yes the
number of hard steps so that's so yeah

756
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:30,240
number of hard steps so that's so yeah
 

757
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,550
number of hard steps so that's so yeah
it's like if you're gambling

758
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
it's like if you're gambling
 

759
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,629
it's like if you're gambling
and you're doubling up every time this

760
00:13:34,629 --> 00:13:34,639
and you're doubling up every time this
 

761
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,970
and you're doubling up every time this
is the probability you just keep winning

762
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:36,980
is the probability you just keep winning
 

763
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,629
is the probability you just keep winning
[Laughter]

764
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
[Laughter]
 

765
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,750
[Laughter]
uh so

766
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:39,760
uh so
 

767
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,189
uh so
it gets very unlikely very quickly and

768
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
it gets very unlikely very quickly and
 

769
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,030
it gets very unlikely very quickly and
so we are the result of this unlikely

770
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
so we are the result of this unlikely
 

771
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,710
so we are the result of this unlikely
chain of successes it's actually a lot

772
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:46,720
chain of successes it's actually a lot
 

773
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,670
chain of successes it's actually a lot
like cancer so the dominant model of

774
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
like cancer so the dominant model of
 

775
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,310
like cancer so the dominant model of
cancer in an organism like each of us is

776
00:13:52,310 --> 00:13:52,320
cancer in an organism like each of us is
 

777
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,069
cancer in an organism like each of us is
that we have all these cells and in

778
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
that we have all these cells and in
 

779
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,310
that we have all these cells and in
order to become cancerous a single cell

780
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
order to become cancerous a single cell
 

781
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,870
order to become cancerous a single cell
has to go through a number of mutations

782
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
has to go through a number of mutations
 

783
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,629
has to go through a number of mutations
and these are very unlikely mutations

784
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:00,639
and these are very unlikely mutations
 

785
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,629
and these are very unlikely mutations
and so any one cell is very unlikely to

786
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
and so any one cell is very unlikely to
 

787
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,550
and so any one cell is very unlikely to
have any have all these mutations happen

788
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:04,560
have any have all these mutations happen
 

789
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,790
have any have all these mutations happen
by the time your life spans over

790
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:06,800
by the time your life spans over
 

791
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,829
by the time your life spans over
but

792
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,839
but
 

793
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,110
but
we have enough cells in our body that

794
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:09,120
we have enough cells in our body that
 

795
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,189
we have enough cells in our body that
the chance of any one cell producing

796
00:14:11,189 --> 00:14:11,199
the chance of any one cell producing
 

797
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,629
the chance of any one cell producing
cancer by the end of your life is

798
00:14:12,629 --> 00:14:12,639
cancer by the end of your life is
 

799
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,189
cancer by the end of your life is
actually pretty high more like 40

800
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:15,199
actually pretty high more like 40
 

801
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,509
actually pretty high more like 40
and so the chance of cancer appearing in

802
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
and so the chance of cancer appearing in
 

803
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,189
and so the chance of cancer appearing in
the linear lifetime also goes as power

804
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
the linear lifetime also goes as power
 

805
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,790
the linear lifetime also goes as power
law this power of the number of

806
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
when you look at all the people that are
 

981
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,990
when you look at all the people that are
suffering in the world that money can be

982
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,000
suffering in the world that money can be
 

983
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,669
suffering in the world that money can be
spent so much better

984
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:29,679
spent so much better
 

985
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,110
spent so much better
and yet

986
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,120
and yet
 

987
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,710
and yet
there's something about human nature

988
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:34,720
there's something about human nature
 

989
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,789
there's something about human nature
that wants to help the person in front

990
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
that wants to help the person in front
 

991
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,110
that wants to help the person in front
of you and that is actually the right

992
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:39,120
of you and that is actually the right
 

993
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,470
of you and that is actually the right
thing to do

994
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:40,480
thing to do
 

995
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,710
thing to do
despite the analysis

996
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
despite the analysis
 

997
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,110
despite the analysis
and sometimes when you do the analysis

998
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:45,120
and sometimes when you do the analysis
 

999
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,430
and sometimes when you do the analysis
you um there's something about the human

1000
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:47,440
you um there's something about the human
 

1001
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,430
you um there's something about the human
mind that allows you to not take that

1002
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:49,440
mind that allows you to not take that
 

1003
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,950
mind that allows you to not take that
leap that

1004
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:50,960
leap that
 

1005
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,029
leap that
irrational leap

1006
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
irrational leap
 

1007
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,830
irrational leap
uh to act in this way that the analysis

1008
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
uh to act in this way that the analysis
 

1009
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,470
uh to act in this way that the analysis
explains it away well it's like uh for

1010
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
explains it away well it's like uh for
 

1011
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,430
explains it away well it's like uh for
example uh the u.s government

1012
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
example uh the u.s government
 

1013
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,350
example uh the u.s government
you know the d.o.t department of

1014
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,360
you know the d.o.t department of
 

1015
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,270
you know the d.o.t department of
transportation puts a

1016
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
transportation puts a
 

1017
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,750
transportation puts a
value of i think like 9 million dollars

1018
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:07,760
value of i think like 9 million dollars
 

1019
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,990
value of i think like 9 million dollars
on a human life and the moment you put

1020
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,000
on a human life and the moment you put
 

1021
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,909
on a human life and the moment you put
that number on a human life you can

1022
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
that number on a human life you can
 

1023
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,830
that number on a human life you can
start thinking well okay i can start

1024
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:13,840
start thinking well okay i can start
 

1025
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,510
start thinking well okay i can start
making decisions about

1026
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
making decisions about
 

1027
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,029
making decisions about
this or that and with a sort of cold

1028
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
this or that and with a sort of cold
 

1029
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,190
this or that and with a sort of cold
economic perspective and then you might

1030
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
economic perspective and then you might
 

1031
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,870
economic perspective and then you might
lose

1032
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:22,880
lose
 

1033
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,830
lose
you might deviate from a deeper truth

1034
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:25,840
you might deviate from a deeper truth
 

1035
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,310
you might deviate from a deeper truth
of what it means to be human somehow you

1036
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,320
of what it means to be human somehow you
 

1037
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,590
of what it means to be human somehow you
have to dance because uh then if you put

1038
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,600
have to dance because uh then if you put
 

1039
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,350
have to dance because uh then if you put
too much weight on the anecdotal

1040
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
too much weight on the anecdotal
 

1041
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,750
too much weight on the anecdotal
evidence on these kinds of human

1042
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:35,760
evidence on these kinds of human
 

1043
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,870
evidence on these kinds of human
emotions

1044
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
emotions
 

1045
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,789
emotions
then you're going to lose

1046
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:38,799
then you're going to lose
 

1047
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,470
then you're going to lose
uh you can also

1048
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
uh you can also
 

1049
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,870
uh you can also
probably more likely deviate from truth

1050
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
probably more likely deviate from truth
 

1051
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,310
probably more likely deviate from truth
but there's something about that cold

1052
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:44,320
but there's something about that cold
 

1053
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,230
but there's something about that cold
analysis like i've been listening to a

1054
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
analysis like i've been listening to a
 

1055
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,789
analysis like i've been listening to a
lot of people coldly analyze

1056
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
lot of people coldly analyze
 

1057
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,909
lot of people coldly analyze

war in ukraine and there's something
 

1065
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,510
war in ukraine and there's something
lost when you do a cold analysis of why

1066
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
lost when you do a cold analysis of why
 

1067
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,350
lost when you do a cold analysis of why
something happened when you talk about

geopolitics and why a certain war
 

1081
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,150
geopolitics and why a certain war
happened you lose something about the

happened you lose something about the
 

1083
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,990

suffering that happens
i don't know it's an interesting thing

1086
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:19,919
i don't know it's an interesting thing
 

1087
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,590
i don't know it's an interesting thing
because you're both you're exceptionally

good at
 

1091
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,710
good at
uh models

1092
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:24,720
uh models
 

1093
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,710
uh models
in all domains

1094
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
in all domains
 

1095
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,830
in all domains
literally um but also there's a humanity

1096
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:29,840
literally um but also there's a humanity
 

1097

to you
 

1099

to you
uh so it's an interesting dance i don't

1100
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
uh so it's an interesting dance i don't
 

1101
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,990
uh so it's an interesting dance i don't
know if you can comment on that dance

1102
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,000
know if you can comment on that dance
 

1103
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,029
know if you can comment on that dance
sure

1104
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
sure
 

1105
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,350
sure
it's definitely true as you say

1106
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:37,360
it's definitely true as you say
 

1107
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,270
it's definitely true as you say
that for many people

1108
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:39,280
that for many people
 

1109
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,669
that for many people
if you are accurate in your judgment of

1110
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
if you are accurate in your judgment of
 

1111
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,150
if you are accurate in your judgment of
say for a medical patient right what's

1112
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
say for a medical patient right what's
 

1113
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,549
say for a medical patient right what's
the chance that this treatment might

1114
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
the chance that this treatment might
 

1115
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,590
the chance that this treatment might
help

1116
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
help
 

1117
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,669
help
and what's the cost

1118
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
and what's the cost
 

1119
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,669
and what's the cost
and compare those to each other and you

1120
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:51,679
and compare those to each other and you
 

1121
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,830
and compare those to each other and you
might say

1122
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:53,840
might say
 

1123
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,830
might say
this looks like a lot of cost for a

1124
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
this looks like a lot of cost for a
 

1125
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,470
this looks like a lot of cost for a
small medical gain

1126
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
small medical gain
 

1127
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,549
small medical gain
and at that point

1128
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
and at that point
 

1129
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,710
and at that point
knowing that fact that might take the

1130
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
knowing that fact that might take the
 

1131
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,510
knowing that fact that might take the
wing

1132
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
wing
 

1133
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,590
wing
you know the air out of your sails

1134
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
you know the air out of your sails
 

1135
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,549
you know the air out of your sails
you might

1136
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
you might
 

1137
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:08,710
you might
not be willing to do the thing that

1138
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
not be willing to do the thing that
 

1139
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,950
not be willing to do the thing that
maybe you feel is right anyway which is

1140
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:10,960
maybe you feel is right anyway which is
 

1141
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,870
maybe you feel is right anyway which is
still to pay for it

1142
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
still to pay for it
 

1143
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,830
still to pay for it
um

1144
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:13,840
um
 

1145
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,990
um
and then somebody knowing that might

1146
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,000
and then somebody knowing that might
 

1147
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,909
and then somebody knowing that might
want to keep that news from you not tell

1148
00:20:17,909 --> 00:20:17,919
want to keep that news from you not tell
 

1149
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,990
want to keep that news from you not tell
you about the low chance of success or

1150
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,000
you about the low chance of success or
 

1151
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,870
you about the low chance of success or
the high cost in order to save you this

1152
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:22,880
the high cost in order to save you this
 

1153
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,870
the high cost in order to save you this
tension this this awkward moment where

1154
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:24,880
tension this this awkward moment where
 

1155
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,990
tension this this awkward moment where
you might

1156
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,000
you might
 

1157
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,070
you might
fail to do what they and you think is

1158
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
fail to do what they and you think is
 

1159
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,070
fail to do what they and you think is
right

1160
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:30,080
right
 

1161
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,270
right
but i think the higher calling the the

1162
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:33,280
but i think the higher calling the the
 

1163
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,270
but i think the higher calling the the
higher standard to hold you to which

1164
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
higher standard to hold you to which
 

1165
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,549
higher standard to hold you to which
many people can be held to is to say

1166
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:38,559
many people can be held to is to say
 

1167
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,310
many people can be held to is to say
i will look at things accurately i will

1168
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
i will look at things accurately i will
 

1169
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,190
i will look at things accurately i will
know the truth and then i will also

1170
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
know the truth and then i will also
 

1171
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,870
know the truth and then i will also
do the right thing with it

1172
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
do the right thing with it
 

1173
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,870
do the right thing with it
i will be at peace with my judgment

1174
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:46,880
i will be at peace with my judgment
 

1175
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,630
i will be at peace with my judgment
about what the right thing is in terms

1176
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:48,640
about what the right thing is in terms
 

1177
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,350
about what the right thing is in terms
of the truth i don't need to be lied to

1178
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:51,360
of the truth i don't need to be lied to
 

1179
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,029
of the truth i don't need to be lied to
in order to figure out what the right

1180
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
in order to figure out what the right
 

1181
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,190
in order to figure out what the right
thing to do is and i think if you do

1182
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
thing to do is and i think if you do
 

1183
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,950
thing to do is and i think if you do
think you need to be lied to in order to

1184
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
think you need to be lied to in order to
 

1185
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,510
think you need to be lied to in order to
figure out what the right thing to do is

1186
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
figure out what the right thing to do is
 

1187
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,070
figure out what the right thing to do is
you're at a great disadvantage because

1188
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,080
you're at a great disadvantage because
 

1189
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,669
you're at a great disadvantage because
then people will be lying to you will be

1190
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:03,679
then people will be lying to you will be
 

1191
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,190
then people will be lying to you will be
lying to yourself and you won't be as

1192
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
lying to yourself and you won't be as
 

1193
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,669
lying to yourself and you won't be as
effective yes and achieving whatever

1194
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
effective yes and achieving whatever
 

1195
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,510
effective yes and achieving whatever
good you are trying to achieve but

1196
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
good you are trying to achieve but
 

1197
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,270
good you are trying to achieve but
getting the data getting the facts is

1198
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:13,280
getting the data getting the facts is
 

1199
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,630
getting the data getting the facts is
step one

1200
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:14,640
step one
 

1201
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,950
step one
now that's the final step absolutely so

1202
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:16,960
now that's the final step absolutely so
 

1203
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,870
now that's the final step absolutely so
it's uh i would say

1204
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
it's uh i would say
 

1205
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,549
it's uh i would say
having a good model getting the good

1206
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:20,559
having a good model getting the good
 

1207
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,590
having a good model getting the good
data

1208
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
data
 

1209
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,710
data
is step one and it's a burden

1210
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:24,720
is step one and it's a burden
 

1211
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,230
is step one and it's a burden
because you can't just use that data

1212
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
because you can't just use that data
 

1213
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,470
because you can't just use that data
to um

1214
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:30,480
to um
 

1215
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,630
to um
arrive at sort of the easy convenient

1216
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
arrive at sort of the easy convenient
 

1217
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,710
arrive at sort of the easy convenient
thing you have to really deeply think

1218
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,720
thing you have to really deeply think
 

1219
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,870
thing you have to really deeply think
about what is the right thing

1220
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
about what is the right thing
 

1221
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,909
about what is the right thing
you can't use the so the the dark aspect

1222
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
you can't use the so the the dark aspect
 

1223
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,190
you can't use the so the the dark aspect
of data

1224
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,200
of data
 

1225
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,470
of data
uh of models is you can

1226
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
uh of models is you can
 

1227
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,909
uh of models is you can
use it to excuse away actions

1228
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
use it to excuse away actions
 

1229
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,310
use it to excuse away actions
that are unethical you can use data to

1230
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
that are unethical you can use data to
 

1231
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,789
that are unethical you can use data to
basically excuse away anything but not

1232
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:52,799
basically excuse away anything but not
 

1233
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,070
basically excuse away anything but not
looking at data

1234
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
looking at data
 

1235
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,870
looking at data
lets you expose yourself to pretend and

1236
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
lets you expose yourself to pretend and
 

1237
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,310
lets you expose yourself to pretend and
think that you're doing good when you're

1238
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
think that you're doing good when you're
 

1239
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,110
think that you're doing good when you're
not

1240
00:21:59,110 --> 00:21:59,120
not
 

1241
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,149
not
exactly

1242
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:00,159
exactly
 

1243
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,710
exactly
uh but it is a burden it doesn't excuse

1244
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:02,720
uh but it is a burden it doesn't excuse
 

1245
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,909
uh but it is a burden it doesn't excuse
you from

1246
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:03,919
you from
 

1247
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,750
you from
still being human and deeply thinking

1248
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
still being human and deeply thinking
 

1249
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,430
still being human and deeply thinking
about what is right

1250
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
about what is right
 

1251
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,830
about what is right
that very kind of gray area that very

1252
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:09,840
that very kind of gray area that very
 

1253
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,510
that very kind of gray area that very
subjective area

1254
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
subjective area
 

1255
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,470
subjective area
um

1256
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
um
 

1257
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,029
um
that's part of the human condition

1258
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:15,039
that's part of the human condition
 

1259
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,230
that's part of the human condition
but let us return for a time to aliens

1260
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
but let us return for a time to aliens
 

1261
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,950
but let us return for a time to aliens
so you started to define sort of the

1262
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:20,960
so you started to define sort of the
 

1263
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,190
so you started to define sort of the
the model the parameters

1264
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
the model the parameters
 

1265
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,110
the model the parameters
of uh grabbiness

1266
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:25,120
of uh grabbiness
 

1267
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,710
of uh grabbiness
right or the uh

1268
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:26,720
right or the uh
 

1269
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,549
right or the uh
as we approach crabbiness so what

1270
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:28,559
as we approach crabbiness so what
 

1271
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,549
as we approach crabbiness so what
happens so again when there's three

1272
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:30,559
happens so again when there's three
 

1273
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:31,909
happens so again when there's three
parameters yes

1274
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
parameters yes
 

1275
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,310
parameters yes
there's the speed at which they expand

1276
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
there's the speed at which they expand
 

1277
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,549
there's the speed at which they expand
there's the rate at which they appear in

1278
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
there's the rate at which they appear in
 

1279
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,270
there's the rate at which they appear in
time and that rate has a constant and a

1280
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:39,280
time and that rate has a constant and a
 

1281
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,950
time and that rate has a constant and a
power so we've talked about the history

1282
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
power so we've talked about the history
 

1283
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,630
power so we've talked about the history
of life on earth suggest that power is

1284
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
of life on earth suggest that power is
 

1285
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,430
of life on earth suggest that power is
around 6 but maybe 3 to 12.

1286
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
around 6 but maybe 3 to 12.
 

1287
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,430
around 6 but maybe 3 to 12.
we can say that constant comes from our

1288
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:47,440
we can say that constant comes from our
 

1289
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,350
we can say that constant comes from our
current date sort of sets the overall

1290
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
current date sort of sets the overall
 

1291
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,390
current date sort of sets the overall
rate

1292
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:50,400
rate
 

1293
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,390
rate
and the speed which is the last

1294
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
and the speed which is the last
 

1295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,310
and the speed which is the last
parameter comes from the fact that we

1296
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:54,320
parameter comes from the fact that we
 

1297
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,630
parameter comes from the fact that we
look in the sky we don't see them so the

1298
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:56,640
look in the sky we don't see them so the
 

1299
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,549
look in the sky we don't see them so the
model predicts very strongly that if

1300
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
model predicts very strongly that if
 

1301
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,310
model predicts very strongly that if
they were expanding slowly say one

1302
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:00,320
they were expanding slowly say one
 

1303
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,909
they were expanding slowly say one
percent of the speed of light

1304
00:23:01,909 --> 00:23:01,919
percent of the speed of light
 

1305
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,789
percent of the speed of light
our sky would be full of vast spheres

1306
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:04,799
our sky would be full of vast spheres
 

1307
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,430
our sky would be full of vast spheres
that were full of activity that is

1308
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
that were full of activity that is
 

1309
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,909
that were full of activity that is
at a random time when a civilization is

1310
00:23:09,909 --> 00:23:09,919
at a random time when a civilization is
 

1311
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,909
at a random time when a civilization is
first appearing if it looks out into its

1312
00:23:11,909 --> 00:23:11,919
first appearing if it looks out into its
 

1313
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,310
first appearing if it looks out into its
sky it would see many other grabby alien

1314
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
sky it would see many other grabby alien
 

1315
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,669
sky it would see many other grabby alien
civilizations in the sky and they would

1316
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
civilizations in the sky and they would
 

1317
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,950
civilizations in the sky and they would
be much bigger than the full moon they'd

1318
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:16,960
be much bigger than the full moon they'd
 

1319
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,630
be much bigger than the full moon they'd
be huge spheres in the sky and they

1320
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,640
be huge spheres in the sky and they
 

1321
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,870
be huge spheres in the sky and they
would be visibly different we don't see

1322
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:20,880
would be visibly different we don't see
 

1323
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,149
would be visibly different we don't see
them can we pause for a second okay

1324
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
them can we pause for a second okay
 

1325
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,390
them can we pause for a second okay
there's a bunch of hard steps that earth

1326
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:26,400
there's a bunch of hard steps that earth
 

1327
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,110
there's a bunch of hard steps that earth
had to pass to arrive at this place we

1328
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
had to pass to arrive at this place we
 

1329
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,430
had to pass to arrive at this place we
are currently which we're starting to

1330
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
are currently which we're starting to
 

1331
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,430
are currently which we're starting to
launch rockets out into space we're kind

1332
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
launch rockets out into space we're kind
 

1333
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,070
launch rockets out into space we're kind
of starting to expand a bit right very

1334
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
of starting to expand a bit right very
 

1335
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,510
of starting to expand a bit right very
slowly okay

1336
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
slowly okay
 

1337
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,669
slowly okay
but this is like the birth

1338
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:39,679
but this is like the birth
 

1339
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,269
but this is like the birth
if you look at the entirety of the

1340
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:41,279
if you look at the entirety of the
 

1341
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,110
if you look at the entirety of the
history of earth

1342
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,120
history of earth
 

1343
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,510
history of earth
we're now at this precipice of like

1344
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:45,520
we're now at this precipice of like
 

1345
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,909
we're now at this precipice of like
expansion we could we might not choose

1346
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
expansion we could we might not choose
 

1347
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,590
expansion we could we might not choose
to but if we do we will do it in the

1348
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:49,600
to but if we do we will do it in the
 

1349
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,669
to but if we do we will do it in the
next 10 million years

1350
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
next 10 million years
 

1351
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,269
next 10 million years
10 million wow

1352
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:53,279
10 million wow
 

1353
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,190
10 million wow
time flies when you're having fun

1354
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,200
time flies when you're having fun
 

1355
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,350
time flies when you're having fun
uh i was thinking a short time on the on

1356
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:57,360
uh i was thinking a short time on the on
 

1357
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,950
uh i was thinking a short time on the on
the cosmological scale so that is it

1358
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
the cosmological scale so that is it
 

1359
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,390
the cosmological scale so that is it
might be only a thousand but the point

1360
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:00,400
might be only a thousand but the point
 

1361
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,070
might be only a thousand but the point
is if it's even if it's up to 10 million

1362
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:02,080
is if it's even if it's up to 10 million
 

1363
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,430
is if it's even if it's up to 10 million
that hardly makes any difference to the

1364
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:03,440
that hardly makes any difference to the
 

1365
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,870
that hardly makes any difference to the
model so i might as well give you 10

1366
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
model so i might as well give you 10
 

1367
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,390
model so i might as well give you 10
million this this

1368
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
million this this
 

1369
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,310
million this this
this makes me feel i was i was so

1370
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,320
this makes me feel i was i was so
 

1371
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,669
this makes me feel i was i was so
stressed about planning what i'm going

1372
00:24:09,669 --> 00:24:09,679
stressed about planning what i'm going
 

1373
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,830
stressed about planning what i'm going
to do today and now you've got plenty of

1374
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:11,840
to do today and now you've got plenty of
 

1375
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,909
to do today and now you've got plenty of
time plenty of time

1376
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:13,919
time plenty of time
 

1377
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,750
time plenty of time
uh i just need to be generating some

1378
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:15,760
uh i just need to be generating some
 

1379
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,669
uh i just need to be generating some
offspring quickly here okay um

1380
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
offspring quickly here okay um
 

1381
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,290
offspring quickly here okay um
so and there's this moment

1382
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:21,300
so and there's this moment
 

1383
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,029
so and there's this moment
[Laughter]

1384
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:23,039
[Laughter]
 

1385
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,630
[Laughter]
this 10 million

1386
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:24,640
this 10 million
 

1387
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,430
this 10 million
year gap uh or window when we start

1388
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:27,440
year gap uh or window when we start
 

1389
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,750
year gap uh or window when we start
expanding and you're saying okay so this

1390
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
expanding and you're saying okay so this
 

1391
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,310
expanding and you're saying okay so this
is an interesting moment where there's a

1392
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
is an interesting moment where there's a
 

1393
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,149
is an interesting moment where there's a
bunch of other alien civilizations that

1394
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:34,159
bunch of other alien civilizations that
 

1395
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,230
bunch of other alien civilizations that
might at some history of the universe

1396
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
might at some history of the universe
 

1397
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,149
might at some history of the universe
arrived at this moment were here they

1398
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
arrived at this moment were here they
 

1399
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,149
arrived at this moment were here they
passed all the hard steps there's a

1400
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:40,159
passed all the hard steps there's a
 

1401
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,230
passed all the hard steps there's a
there's a model for how

1402
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:42,240
there's a model for how
 

1403
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,230
there's a model for how
likely it is that that happens and then

1404
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:44,240
likely it is that that happens and then
 

1405
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,149
likely it is that that happens and then
they start expanding and you think of an

1406
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
they start expanding and you think of an
 

1407
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,630
they start expanding and you think of an
expansion it's almost like a a sphere

1408
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:48,640
expansion it's almost like a a sphere
 

1409
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,870
expansion it's almost like a a sphere
right that's when you say speed we're

1410
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:50,880
right that's when you say speed we're
 

1411
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,269
right that's when you say speed we're
talking about the speed of the radius

1412
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
talking about the speed of the radius
 

1413
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,350
talking about the speed of the radius
growth exactly like the surface how fast

1414
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:55,360
growth exactly like the surface how fast
 

1415
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,470
growth exactly like the surface how fast
the surface

1416
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:56,480
the surface
 

1417
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,310
the surface
okay and so you're saying that there is

1418
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,320
okay and so you're saying that there is
 

1419
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,789
okay and so you're saying that there is
some speed for that expansion average

1420
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:00,799
some speed for that expansion average
 

1421
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,269
some speed for that expansion average
speed and then we can play with that

1422
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:03,279
speed and then we can play with that
 

1423
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,390
speed and then we can play with that
parameter

1424
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:04,400
parameter
 

1425
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,269
parameter
and

1426
00:25:05,269 --> 00:25:05,279
and
 

1427
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,830
and
if that speed is super slow then maybe

1428
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
if that speed is super slow then maybe
 

1429
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,190
if that speed is super slow then maybe
that explains

1430
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,200
that explains
 

1431
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,710
that explains
why we haven't seen anything if it's

1432
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:10,720
why we haven't seen anything if it's
 

1433
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,029
why we haven't seen anything if it's
super fast well it gets the slow would

1434
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:13,039
super fast well it gets the slow would
 

1435
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,110
super fast well it gets the slow would
create the puzzle it's low predicts we

1436
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
create the puzzle it's low predicts we
 

1437
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,549
create the puzzle it's low predicts we
would see them but we don't see them

1438
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:16,559
would see them but we don't see them
 

1439
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,230
would see them but we don't see them
okay so the way to explain that is that

1440
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:18,240
okay so the way to explain that is that
 

1441
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,549
okay so the way to explain that is that
they're fast so the idea is

1442
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
they're fast so the idea is
 

1443
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,230
they're fast so the idea is
if they're moving really fast then we

1444
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:22,240
if they're moving really fast then we
 

1445
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,950
if they're moving really fast then we
don't see them until they're almost here

1446
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:24,960
don't see them until they're almost here
 

1447
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,549
don't see them until they're almost here
and okay this is counterintuitive all

1448
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:26,559
and okay this is counterintuitive all
 

1449
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,630
and okay this is counterintuitive all
right hold on a second so i think this

1450
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:28,640
right hold on a second so i think this
 

1451
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,310
right hold on a second so i think this
works best when i say a bunch of dumb

1452
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:30,320
works best when i say a bunch of dumb
 

1453
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,029
works best when i say a bunch of dumb
things okay um

1454
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:33,039
things okay um
 

1455
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,390
things okay um
and then uh

1456
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:34,400
and then uh
 

1457
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,310
and then uh
you uh elucidate

1458
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,320
you uh elucidate
 

1459
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,149
you uh elucidate
the full complexity and the beauty of

1460
00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:38,159
the full complexity and the beauty of
 

1461
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,630
the full complexity and the beauty of
the dumbness okay

1462
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
the dumbness okay
 

1463
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,190
the dumbness okay
so there's these spheres out there in

1464
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,200
so there's these spheres out there in
 

1465
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,390
so there's these spheres out there in
the universe

1466
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:44,400
the universe
 

1467
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,310
the universe
that are made visible because they're

1468
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
that are made visible because they're
 

1469
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,549
that are made visible because they're
sort of uh using a lot of energy so

1470
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
sort of uh using a lot of energy so
 

1471
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,149
sort of uh using a lot of energy so
they're generating a lot of light

1472
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:50,159
they're generating a lot of light
 

1473
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,830
they're generating a lot of light
they're changing things they're changing

1474
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
they're changing things they're changing
 

1475
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,190
they're changing things they're changing
things and change would be visible

1476
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
things and change would be visible
 

1477
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,269
things and change would be visible
long way off yes they would take apart

1478
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:57,279
long way off yes they would take apart
 

1479
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,350
long way off yes they would take apart
stars rearrange them restructure

1480
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,360
stars rearrange them restructure
 

1481
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,430
stars rearrange them restructure
galaxies they would just be kind of big

1482
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:01,440
galaxies they would just be kind of big
 

1483
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,470
galaxies they would just be kind of big
huge stuff

1484
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
huge stuff
 

1485
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,990
huge stuff
okay if they're expanding slowly

1486
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
okay if they're expanding slowly
 

1487
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,230
okay if they're expanding slowly
we would see a lot of them

1488
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
we would see a lot of them
 

1489
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,470
we would see a lot of them
because the universe is old as relative

1490
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
because the universe is old as relative
 

1491
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,710
because the universe is old as relative
is old enough to where we would see that

1492
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
is old enough to where we would see that
 

1493
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,789
is old enough to where we would see that
we're assuming we're just typical you

1494
00:26:14,789 --> 00:26:14,799
we're assuming we're just typical you
 

1495
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,549
we're assuming we're just typical you
know maybe at the 50th percentile of

1496
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:16,559
know maybe at the 50th percentile of
 

1497
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,149
know maybe at the 50th percentile of
them so like half of them have appeared

1498
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:18,159
them so like half of them have appeared
 

1499
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,070
them so like half of them have appeared
so far the other half will still appear

1500
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
so far the other half will still appear
 

1501
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,149
so far the other half will still appear
later

1502
00:26:22,149 --> 00:26:22,159
later
 

1503
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,590
later
and um the the math of our best estimate

1504
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:25,600
and um the the math of our best estimate
 

1505
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,669
and um the the math of our best estimate
is that they appear roughly once per

1506
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
is that they appear roughly once per
 

1507
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,990
is that they appear roughly once per
million galaxies

1508
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
million galaxies
 

1509
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,510
million galaxies
and we would meet them in roughly a

1510
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
and we would meet them in roughly a
 

1511
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,029
and we would meet them in roughly a
billion years

1512
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
billion years
 

1513
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:35,590
billion years
if uh we expanded out to meet them so

1514
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:35,600
if uh we expanded out to meet them so
 

1515
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,830
if uh we expanded out to meet them so
we're looking at a grabby aliens model

1516
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:37,840
we're looking at a grabby aliens model
 

1517
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,830
we're looking at a grabby aliens model
3d sim right

1518
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
3d sim right
 

1519
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,430
3d sim right
what's what's this that's the actual

1520
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,440
what's what's this that's the actual
 

1521
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,669
what's what's this that's the actual
name of the video what uh

1522
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
name of the video what uh
 

1523
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,750
name of the video what uh
by the time we get to 13.8 billion years

1524
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
by the time we get to 13.8 billion years
 

1525
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,750
by the time we get to 13.8 billion years
the fun begins

1526
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:49,760
the fun begins
 

1527
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,990
the fun begins
okay so this is this is a um right we're

1528
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
okay so this is this is a um right we're
 

1529
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,269
okay so this is this is a um right we're
watching a

1530
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
watching a
 

1531
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,149
watching a
three-dimensional sphere rotating i

1532
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
three-dimensional sphere rotating i
 

1533
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,669
three-dimensional sphere rotating i
presume that's the universe and then

1534
00:26:57,669 --> 00:26:57,679
presume that's the universe and then
 

1535
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,750
presume that's the universe and then
right crabby aliens are expanding and

1536
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
right crabby aliens are expanding and
 

1537
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,990
right crabby aliens are expanding and
filling that universe exactly with all

1538
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:02,000
filling that universe exactly with all
 

1539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,630
filling that universe exactly with all
kinds of uh and then pretty soon it's

1540
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:04,640
kinds of uh and then pretty soon it's
 

1541
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,669
kinds of uh and then pretty soon it's
all full it's full so that's how

1542
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
all full it's full so that's how
 

1543
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,310
all full it's full so that's how
the grabby aliens come

1544
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:10,320
the grabby aliens come
 

1545
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,990
the grabby aliens come
in contact first of all with other

1546
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,000
in contact first of all with other
 

1547
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,269
in contact first of all with other
aliens

1548
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
aliens
 

1549
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,710
aliens
and then um with us humans the following

1550
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
and then um with us humans the following
 

1551
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,230
and then um with us humans the following
is a simulation of the grabby aliens

1552
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:18,240
is a simulation of the grabby aliens
 

1553
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,230
is a simulation of the grabby aliens
model of alien civilizations

1554
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,240
model of alien civilizations
 

1555
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,710
model of alien civilizations
civilizations are born that expand

1556
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
civilizations are born that expand
 

1557
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,110
civilizations are born that expand
outwards at constant speed a spherical

1558
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
outwards at constant speed a spherical
 

1559
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,590
outwards at constant speed a spherical
region of space is shown by the time we

1560
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:27,600
region of space is shown by the time we
 

1561
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,070
region of space is shown by the time we
get to 13.8 billion years

1562
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
get to 13.8 billion years
 

1563
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,269
get to 13.8 billion years
this sphere will be about 3 000 times as

1564
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:33,279
this sphere will be about 3 000 times as
 

1565
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:35,590
this sphere will be about 3 000 times as
wide as the distance from the milky way

1566
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
wide as the distance from the milky way
 

1567
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,350
wide as the distance from the milky way
to andromeda

1568
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
to andromeda
 

1569
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,830
to andromeda
okay this is fun it's huge okay it's

1570
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
okay this is fun it's huge okay it's
 

1571
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,789
okay this is fun it's huge okay it's
huge um all right

1572
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:42,799
huge um all right
 

1573
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,830
huge um all right
so

1574
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:43,840
so
 

1575
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,070
so
why don't we see

1576
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
why don't we see
 

1577
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,789
why don't we see
uh we're one little tiny tiny tiny tiny

1578
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
uh we're one little tiny tiny tiny tiny
 

1579
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,510
uh we're one little tiny tiny tiny tiny
dot in that giant giant sphere right why

1580
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:51,520
dot in that giant giant sphere right why
 

1581
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,710
dot in that giant giant sphere right why
don't we

1582
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:52,720
don't we
 

1583
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,190
don't we
see any of the grabby aliens

1584
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,200
see any of the grabby aliens
 

1585
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,510
see any of the grabby aliens
it depends on how fast they expand

1586
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:57,520
it depends on how fast they expand
 

1587
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,110
it depends on how fast they expand
so you could see that if they expanded

1588
00:27:59,110 --> 00:27:59,120
so you could see that if they expanded
 

1589
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,110
so you could see that if they expanded
at the speed of light you wouldn't see

1590
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:01,120
at the speed of light you wouldn't see
 

1591
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,870
at the speed of light you wouldn't see
them until they were here

1592
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:02,880
them until they were here
 

1593
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,389
them until they were here
uh so like out there if somebody is

1594
00:28:04,389 --> 00:28:04,399
uh so like out there if somebody is
 

1595
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,389
uh so like out there if somebody is
destroying the universe with a

1596
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
destroying the universe with a
 

1597
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,110
destroying the universe with a
vacuum decay there's this there's this

1598
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
vacuum decay there's this there's this
 

1599
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,870
vacuum decay there's this there's this
you know doomsday scenario where

1600
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:10,880
you know doomsday scenario where
 

1601
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,269
you know doomsday scenario where
somebody somewhere could change the

1602
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
somebody somewhere could change the
 

1603
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,710
somebody somewhere could change the
vacuum of the universe and that would

1604
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:14,720
vacuum of the universe and that would
 

1605
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,830
vacuum of the universe and that would
expand at the speed of light and

1606
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
expand at the speed of light and
 

1607
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,590
expand at the speed of light and
basically destroy everything it hit but

1608
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:17,600
basically destroy everything it hit but
 

1609
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,190
basically destroy everything it hit but
you'd never see that until i got here

1610
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
you'd never see that until i got here
 

1611
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,470
you'd never see that until i got here
because it's expanding at the speed of

1612
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:20,480
because it's expanding at the speed of
 

1613
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,269
because it's expanding at the speed of
light

1614
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
light
 

1615
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:23,029
light
if you're spinning really slow then you

1616
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:23,039
if you're spinning really slow then you
 

1617
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,110
if you're spinning really slow then you
see it from a long way off so the fact

1618
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
see it from a long way off so the fact
 

1619
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,950
see it from a long way off so the fact
we don't see anything in the sky tells

1620
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:26,960
we don't see anything in the sky tells
 

1621
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,430
we don't see anything in the sky tells
us they're expanding fast say over a

1622
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:29,440
us they're expanding fast say over a
 

1623
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,269
us they're expanding fast say over a
third the speed of light and that's

1624
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:31,279
third the speed of light and that's
 

1625
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,269
third the speed of light and that's
really really fast

1626
00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:33,279
really really fast
 

1627
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,909
really really fast
but that's what you have to believe if

1628
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:35,919
but that's what you have to believe if
 

1629
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,590
but that's what you have to believe if
you look out and you don't see anything

1630
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
you look out and you don't see anything
 

1631
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,350
you look out and you don't see anything
now you might say well how maybe i just

1632
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
now you might say well how maybe i just
 

1633
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,389
now you might say well how maybe i just
don't want to believe this whole model

1634
00:28:40,389 --> 00:28:40,399
don't want to believe this whole model
 

1635
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,990
don't want to believe this whole model
why should i believe this whole model at

1636
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
why should i believe this whole model at
 

1637
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,350
why should i believe this whole model at
all and

1638
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
all and
 

1639
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,350
all and
our best evidence why you should believe

1640
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
our best evidence why you should believe
 

1641
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,149
our best evidence why you should believe
this model is our early date

1642
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
this model is our early date
 

1643
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,990
this model is our early date
we are right now

1644
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
we are right now
 

1645
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,750
we are right now
almost 14 million years into the

1646
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:51,760
almost 14 million years into the
 

1647
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,870
almost 14 million years into the
universe

1648
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:52,880
universe
 

1649
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,230
universe
on a

1650
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,240
on a
 

1651
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,990
on a
planet around a star that's roughly 5

1652
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
planet around a star that's roughly 5
 

1653
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,389
planet around a star that's roughly 5
billion years old

1654
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
billion years old
 

1655
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,269
billion years old
but the average star out there will last

1656
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
but the average star out there will last
 

1657
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,830
but the average star out there will last
roughly five trillion years

1658
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
roughly five trillion years
 

1659
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,870
roughly five trillion years
that is

1660
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
that is
 

1661
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,789
that is
a thousand times longer

1662
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
a thousand times longer
 

1663
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,950
a thousand times longer
and remember that power law it says that

1664
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:08,960
and remember that power law it says that
 

1665
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,870
and remember that power law it says that
the chance of advanced life appearing on

1666
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:10,880
the chance of advanced life appearing on
 

1667
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,110
the chance of advanced life appearing on
a planet goes as the power of sixth of

1668
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
a planet goes as the power of sixth of
 

1669
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,669
a planet goes as the power of sixth of
the time so if a planet lasts a thousand

1670
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
the time so if a planet lasts a thousand
 

1671
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,029
the time so if a planet lasts a thousand
times longer

1672
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
times longer
 

1673
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,110
times longer
then the chance of it appearing on that

1674
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
then the chance of it appearing on that
 

1675
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,350
then the chance of it appearing on that
planet if everything would stay empty at

1676
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
planet if everything would stay empty at
 

1677
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,269
planet if everything would stay empty at
least is a thousand to the sixth power

1678
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
least is a thousand to the sixth power
 

1679
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,190
least is a thousand to the sixth power
or ten to the eighteen

1680
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:25,200
or ten to the eighteen
 

1681
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,389
or ten to the eighteen
so

1682
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:26,399
so
 

1683
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,750
so
enormous

1684
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:27,760
enormous
 

1685
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,669
enormous
overwhelming chance that if the universe

1686
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
overwhelming chance that if the universe
 

1687
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,269
overwhelming chance that if the universe
would just stay sit and empty and

1688
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
would just stay sit and empty and
 

1689
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,190
would just stay sit and empty and
waiting for advanced life to appear when

1690
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:33,200
waiting for advanced life to appear when
 

1691
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,190
waiting for advanced life to appear when
it would appear would be

1692
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,200
it would appear would be
 

1693
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,230
it would appear would be
way at the end of all these

1694
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
way at the end of all these
 

1695
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,990
way at the end of all these
planet lifetimes that is the long

1696
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,000
planet lifetimes that is the long
 

1697
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,149
planet lifetimes that is the long
planets near the end of the lifetime

1698
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
planets near the end of the lifetime
 

1699
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,990
planets near the end of the lifetime
trillions of years into the future

1700
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:44,000
trillions of years into the future
 

1701
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,669
trillions of years into the future
so but we're really early compared to

1702
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
so but we're really early compared to
 

1703
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,909
so but we're really early compared to
that and our explanation is at the

1704
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:47,919
that and our explanation is at the
 

1705
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,430
that and our explanation is at the
moment as you saw in the video the

1706
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
moment as you saw in the video the
 

1707
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,110
moment as you saw in the video the
universe is filling up in roughly a

1708
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
universe is filling up in roughly a
 

1709
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,110
universe is filling up in roughly a
billion years it'll all be full and at

1710
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
billion years it'll all be full and at
 

1711
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,630
billion years it'll all be full and at
that point it's too late for advanced

1712
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
that point it's too late for advanced
 

1713
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,549
that point it's too late for advanced
life to show up so you had to show up

1714
00:29:56,549 --> 00:29:56,559
life to show up so you had to show up
 

1715
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,789
life to show up so you had to show up
now before that deadline okay can we

1716
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:58,799
now before that deadline okay can we
 

1717
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,029
now before that deadline okay can we
break that apart a little bit okay

1718
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:01,039
break that apart a little bit okay
 

1719
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,110
break that apart a little bit okay
or linger on some of the things you said

1720
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
or linger on some of the things you said
 

1721
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,029
or linger on some of the things you said
so with the power law the things we've

1722
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
so with the power law the things we've
 

1723
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,870
so with the power law the things we've
done on earth

1724
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:06,880
done on earth
 

1725
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,430
done on earth
the model you have says that it's very

1726
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:09,440
the model you have says that it's very
 

1727
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,110
the model you have says that it's very
unlikely like we're lucky sobs

1728
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
unlikely like we're lucky sobs
 

1729
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,710
unlikely like we're lucky sobs
is that is that mathematically correct

1730
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:14,720
is that is that mathematically correct
 

1731
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,470
is that is that mathematically correct
to say

1732
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
to say
 

1733
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,430
to say
we we're crazy early that is when early

1734
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:19,440
we we're crazy early that is when early
 

1735
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,950
we we're crazy early that is when early
means like in the history of the

1736
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:20,960
means like in the history of the
 

1737
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,190
means like in the history of the
universe in the history okay so

1738
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200

 

1739
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,269

given this model

1740
00:30:27,269 --> 00:30:27,279
given this model
 

1741
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,190
given this model
how do we make sense of that for super

1742
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
how do we make sense of that for super
 

1743
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,590
how do we make sense of that for super
can we just be the lucky ones

1744
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:31,600
can we just be the lucky ones
 

1745
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,990
can we just be the lucky ones
well 10 to the 18 lucky you know how

1746
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:34,000
well 10 to the 18 lucky you know how
 

1747
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,430
well 10 to the 18 lucky you know how
lucky do you feel

1748
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,440
lucky do you feel
 

1749
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,830
lucky do you feel
uh so you know

1750
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:37,840
uh so you know
 

1751
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,990
uh so you know
that's pretty lucky right you know 10 to

1752
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,000
that's pretty lucky right you know 10 to
 

1753
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,470
that's pretty lucky right you know 10 to
18 is a billion billion

1754
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
18 is a billion billion
 

1755
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,789
18 is a billion billion
so then if you were just being honest

1756
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
so then if you were just being honest
 

1757
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,990
so then if you were just being honest
and humble

1758
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
and humble
 

1759
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,750
and humble
that that means

1760
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:47,760
that that means
 

1761
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,430
that that means
what does that mean it means one of the

1762
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
what does that mean it means one of the
 

1763
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,350
what does that mean it means one of the
assumptions that calculated this crazy

1764
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:51,360
assumptions that calculated this crazy
 

1765
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,430
assumptions that calculated this crazy
early must be wrong that's what it means

1766
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,440
early must be wrong that's what it means
 

1767
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,510
early must be wrong that's what it means
so the key assumption we suggest is that

1768
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
so the key assumption we suggest is that
 

1769
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,750
so the key assumption we suggest is that
the universe would stay empty

1770
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
the universe would stay empty
 

1771
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,029
the universe would stay empty
so

1772
00:30:59,029 --> 00:30:59,039
so
 

1773
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,190
so
most life would appear like a thousand

1774
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:01,200
most life would appear like a thousand
 

1775
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,669
most life would appear like a thousand
times longer later than now yeah if

1776
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
times longer later than now yeah if
 

1777
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,110
times longer later than now yeah if
everything would stay empty waiting for

1778
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,120
everything would stay empty waiting for
 

1779
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,190
everything would stay empty waiting for
it to appear what was so what is

1780
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
it to appear what was so what is
 

1781
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,269
it to appear what was so what is
non-empty so the gravity aliens are

1782
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:09,279
non-empty so the gravity aliens are
 

1783
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,870
non-empty so the gravity aliens are
filling the universe right now roughly

1784
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:10,880
filling the universe right now roughly
 

1785
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,230
filling the universe right now roughly
at the moment they've filled half of the

1786
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
at the moment they've filled half of the
 

1787
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,710
at the moment they've filled half of the
universe and they've changed it and when

1788
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
universe and they've changed it and when
 

1789
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,310
universe and they've changed it and when
they fill everything it's too late for

1790
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
they fill everything it's too late for
 

1791
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,909
they fill everything it's too late for
stuff like us to appear but wait hold on

1792
00:31:17,909 --> 00:31:17,919
stuff like us to appear but wait hold on
 

1793
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,230
stuff like us to appear but wait hold on
a second

1794
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,240
a second
 

1795
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,950
a second
did anyone help us get lucky

1796
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
did anyone help us get lucky
 

1797
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,590
did anyone help us get lucky
if it's so difficult what how do

1798
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:25,600
if it's so difficult what how do
 

1799
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,070
if it's so difficult what how do
like so it's like cancer right

1800
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
like so it's like cancer right
 

1801
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,909
like so it's like cancer right
there's all these cells each of which

1802
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:29,919
there's all these cells each of which
 

1803
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,789
there's all these cells each of which
randomly does or doesn't get cancer and

1804
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
randomly does or doesn't get cancer and
 

1805
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,029
randomly does or doesn't get cancer and
eventually some cell gets cancer and you

1806
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
eventually some cell gets cancer and you
 

1807
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,190
eventually some cell gets cancer and you
know we were one of those

1808
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:37,200
know we were one of those
 

1809
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,789
know we were one of those
but hold on a second

1810
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:38,799
but hold on a second
 

1811
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,909
but hold on a second
okay

1812
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
okay
 

1813
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,669
okay
but we got it early

1814
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:41,679
but we got it early
 

1815
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,310
but we got it early
early compared to the prediction with an

1816
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,320
early compared to the prediction with an
 

1817
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,470
early compared to the prediction with an
assumption that's wrong that's so that's

1818
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
assumption that's wrong that's so that's
 

1819
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,549
assumption that's wrong that's so that's
how we do a lot of you know theoretical

1820
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:48,559
how we do a lot of you know theoretical
 

1821
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,230
how we do a lot of you know theoretical
analysis you have a model that makes a

1822
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,240
analysis you have a model that makes a
 

1823
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,990
analysis you have a model that makes a
prediction that's wrong then that helps

1824
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
prediction that's wrong then that helps
 

1825
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,470
prediction that's wrong then that helps
you reject that model okay let's try to

1826
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:54,480
you reject that model okay let's try to
 

1827
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,470
you reject that model okay let's try to
understand exactly where the wrong is so

1828
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
understand exactly where the wrong is so
 

1829
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,710
understand exactly where the wrong is so
the assumption is that the universe

1830
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
the assumption is that the universe
 

1831
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,750
the assumption is that the universe
is empty stays empty stays empty and and

1832
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
is empty stays empty stays empty and and
 

1833
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,070
is empty stays empty stays empty and and
waits until this advanced life appears

1834
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
waits until this advanced life appears
 

1835
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,590
waits until this advanced life appears
in trillions of years

1836
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:05,600
in trillions of years
 

1837
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,029
in trillions of years
that is if the universe would just stay

1838
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
that is if the universe would just stay
 

1839
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,470
that is if the universe would just stay
empty if there was just

1840
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:08,480
empty if there was just
 

1841
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,750
empty if there was just
you know nobody else out there yeah then

1842
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:11,760
you know nobody else out there yeah then
 

1843
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,750
you know nobody else out there yeah then
when you should expect advanced life to

1844
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:13,760
when you should expect advanced life to
 

1845
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,870
when you should expect advanced life to
appear if you're the only one in the

1846
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
appear if you're the only one in the
 

1847
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,070
appear if you're the only one in the
universe when should you expect to

1848
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
universe when should you expect to
 

1849
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,509
universe when should you expect to
appear you should expect to appear

1850
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
appear you should expect to appear
 

1851
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,509
appear you should expect to appear
trillions of years in the future

1852
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:19,519
trillions of years in the future
 

1853
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,590
trillions of years in the future
i see right right so this is a very sort

1854
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:21,600
i see right right so this is a very sort
 

1855
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,990
i see right right so this is a very sort

uh but
 

1865
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,950
uh but
if you assume that you're just wait the

if you assume that you're just wait the

if you assume that you're just wait the
universe stays empty and you're waiting

00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:35,200
universe stays empty and you're waiting

life

1874
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,240
life
 

1875
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,630
life
uh civilization to pop up

1876
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:40,640
uh civilization to pop up
 

1877
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,789
uh civilization to pop up
then it's gonna it should happen very

1878
00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:42,799
then it's gonna it should happen very
 

1879
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:45,509
then it's gonna it should happen very
late much later than now and

1880
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
late much later than now and
 

1881
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,269
late much later than now and
if you look at earth

1882
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
if you look at earth
 

1883
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,269
if you look at earth
uh the way things happen on earth it

1884
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:49,279
uh the way things happen on earth it
 

1885
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,190
uh the way things happen on earth it
happened much much much much much

1886
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
happened much much much much much
 

1887
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,549
happened much much much much much
earlier than it was supposed to

1888
00:32:52,549 --> 00:32:52,559
earlier than it was supposed to
 

1889
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,990
earlier than it was supposed to
according to this model if you take the

1890
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
according to this model if you take the
 

1891
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,389
according to this model if you take the
initial assumption therefore you can say

1892
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
initial assumption therefore you can say
 

1893
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,149
initial assumption therefore you can say
well the initial assumption of the

1894
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
well the initial assumption of the
 

1895
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,630
well the initial assumption of the
universe staying empty is very unlikely

1896
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:00,640
universe staying empty is very unlikely
 

1897
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,909
universe staying empty is very unlikely
right

1898
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
right
 

1899
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,909
right
and the other the other alternative

1900
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:03,919
and the other the other alternative
 

1901
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,509
and the other the other alternative
theory is the universe is filling up and

1902
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:05,519
theory is the universe is filling up and
 

1903
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,029
theory is the universe is filling up and
will fill up soon

1904
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
will fill up soon
 

1905
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,590
will fill up soon
and so we are typical for the origin

1906
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:09,600
and so we are typical for the origin
 

1907
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,350
and so we are typical for the origin
date of things that can appear before

1908
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:11,360
date of things that can appear before
 

1909
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,269
date of things that can appear before
the deadline before that okay it's

1910
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
the deadline before that okay it's
 

1911
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,269
the deadline before that okay it's
filling up so why don't we see anything

1912
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
filling up so why don't we see anything
 

1913
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,710
filling up so why don't we see anything
if it's filling up because they're

1914
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:16,720
if it's filling up because they're
 

1915
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,870
if it's filling up because they're
expanding really fast

1916
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:18,880
expanding really fast
 

1917
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,710
expanding really fast
close to the speed of light exactly so

1918
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:20,720
close to the speed of light exactly so
 

1919
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,310
close to the speed of light exactly so
we will only see it when it's here

1920
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:22,320
we will only see it when it's here
 

1921
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,269
we will only see it when it's here
almost here okay

1922
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:25,279
almost here okay
 

1923
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,590
almost here okay
uh what are the ways in which we might

1924
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
uh what are the ways in which we might
 

1925
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,870
uh what are the ways in which we might
see a quickly expanding

1926
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:30,880
see a quickly expanding
 

1927
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,789
see a quickly expanding
this is both exciting and terrifying it

1928
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
this is both exciting and terrifying it
 

1929
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,269
this is both exciting and terrifying it
is terrifying it's like watching a truck

1930
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
is terrifying it's like watching a truck
 

1931
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,149
is terrifying it's like watching a truck
like driving at you at 100 miles an hour

1932
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
like driving at you at 100 miles an hour
 

1933
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,029
like driving at you at 100 miles an hour
and uh right so we would see spheres in

1934
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:41,039
and uh right so we would see spheres in
 

1935
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,269
and uh right so we would see spheres in
the sky at least one sphere in the sky

1936
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
the sky at least one sphere in the sky
 

1937
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,509
the sky at least one sphere in the sky
growing very rapidly

1938
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:45,519
growing very rapidly
 

1939
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,389
growing very rapidly
and

1940
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:46,399
and
 

1941
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,110
and
like very rapidly right

1942
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
like very rapidly right
 

1943
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,870
like very rapidly right
yes very rapidly

1944
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:50,880
yes very rapidly
 

1945
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,509
yes very rapidly
so we're not so there's there's you know

1946
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:53,519
so we're not so there's there's you know
 

1947
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,710
so we're not so there's there's you know
different def because we were just

1948
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:54,720
different def because we were just
 

1949
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,549
different def because we were just
talking about 10 million years

1950
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
talking about 10 million years
 

1951
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,590
talking about 10 million years
this would be

1952
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
this would be
 

1953
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,509
this would be
you might see it 10 million years in

1954
00:33:59,509 --> 00:33:59,519
you might see it 10 million years in
 

1955
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,350
you might see it 10 million years in
advance coming i mean you still might

1956
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
advance coming i mean you still might
 

1957
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,350
advance coming i mean you still might
have a long warning or again

1958
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
have a long warning or again
 

1959
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,070
have a long warning or again
the universe is 14 billion years old the

1960
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
the universe is 14 billion years old the
 

1961
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,230
the universe is 14 billion years old the
typical origin times of these things are

1962
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:08,240
typical origin times of these things are
 

1963
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,230
typical origin times of these things are
spread over several billion years so the

1964
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:10,240
spread over several billion years so the
 

1965
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,470
spread over several billion years so the
chance of one originating at a you know

1966
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
chance of one originating at a you know
 

1967
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,669
chance of one originating at a you know
very close to you in time is very low so

1968
00:34:15,669 --> 00:34:15,679
very close to you in time is very low so
 

1969
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,310
very close to you in time is very low so
it still might take millions of years

1970
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:18,320
it still might take millions of years
 

1971
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,990
it still might take millions of years
from the time you see it from the time

1972
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
from the time you see it from the time
 

1973
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,270
from the time you see it from the time
it gets here

1974
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:21,280
it gets here
 

1975
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,430
it gets here
yeah a million years to be terrified

1976
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:23,440
yeah a million years to be terrified
 

1977
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,829
yeah a million years to be terrified
there's a bad spirit coming at you but

1978
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:25,839
there's a bad spirit coming at you but
 

1979
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:27,270
there's a bad spirit coming at you but
but coming at you very fast so if

1980
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,280
but coming at you very fast so if
 

1981
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,629
but coming at you very fast so if
they're traveling close to the speed of

1982
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
they're traveling close to the speed of
 

1983
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,790
they're traveling close to the speed of
light but they're coming from a long way

1984
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:30,800
light but they're coming from a long way
 

1985
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,310
light but they're coming from a long way
away so remember

1986
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,320
away so remember
 

1987
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,230
away so remember
the rate at which they appear is one per

1988
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:34,240
the rate at which they appear is one per
 

1989
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,909
the rate at which they appear is one per
million galaxies

1990
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
million galaxies
 

1991
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:36,710
million galaxies
right

1992
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
right
 

1993
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,710
right
so they're they're roughly 100 galaxies

1994
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
so they're they're roughly 100 galaxies
 

1995
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,990
so they're they're roughly 100 galaxies
away

1996
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:40,000
away
 

1997
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,470
away
i see so the delta between the speed of

1998
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
i see so the delta between the speed of
 

1999
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,589
i see so the delta between the speed of
light

2000
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
light
 

2001
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,589
light
and their actual travel speed is very

2002
00:34:45,589 --> 00:34:45,599
and their actual travel speed is very
 

2003
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,550
and their actual travel speed is very
important

2004
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:46,560
important
 

2005
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,990
important
right so even if they're going at say

2006
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,000
right so even if they're going at say
 

2007
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,909
right so even if they're going at say
half the speed of light we'll have a

2008
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
half the speed of light we'll have a
 

2009
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,430
half the speed of light we'll have a
long time

2010
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
long time
 

2011
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,950
long time
yeah but what if they're traveling

2012
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:52,960
yeah but what if they're traveling
 

2013
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,349
yeah but what if they're traveling
exactly at a speed of light then we see

2014
00:34:55,349 --> 00:34:55,359
exactly at a speed of light then we see
 

2015
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,869
exactly at a speed of light then we see
them like then we wouldn't have much

2016
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
them like then we wouldn't have much
 

2017
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,790
them like then we wouldn't have much
warning but that's less likely well we

2018
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
warning but that's less likely well we
 

2019
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,550
warning but that's less likely well we
can't exclude it

2020
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,560
can't exclude it
 

2021
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,630
can't exclude it
and they could also be somehow traveling

2022
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
and they could also be somehow traveling
 

2023
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,630
and they could also be somehow traveling
faster than the speed of light

2024
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:04,640
faster than the speed of light
 

2025
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,870
faster than the speed of light
or i think we can exclude because if

2026
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
or i think we can exclude because if
 

2027
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,390
or i think we can exclude because if
they could go faster than speed of light

2028
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,400
they could go faster than speed of light
 

2029
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,750
they could go faster than speed of light
then they would just already be

2030
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
then they would just already be
 

2031
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,870
then they would just already be
everywhere

2032
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:10,880
everywhere
 

2033
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,710
everywhere
so in a universe where you can travel

2034
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:12,720
so in a universe where you can travel
 

2035
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,990
so in a universe where you can travel
faster than the speed of light you can

2036
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
faster than the speed of light you can
 

2037
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,310
faster than the speed of light you can
go backwards in space-time so any time

2038
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,320
go backwards in space-time so any time
 

2039
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,750
go backwards in space-time so any time
you appeared anywhere in space time you

2040
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:17,760
you appeared anywhere in space time you
 

2041
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,109
you appeared anywhere in space time you
could just fill up everything yeah and

2042
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
could just fill up everything yeah and
 

2043
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,550
could just fill up everything yeah and
so anybody in the future whoever

2044
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:22,560
so anybody in the future whoever
 

2045
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,310
so anybody in the future whoever
appeared they would have been here by

2046
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
appeared they would have been here by
 

2047
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,390
appeared they would have been here by
now can you exclude the possibility that

2048
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:26,400
now can you exclude the possibility that
 

2049
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,910
now can you exclude the possibility that
those kinds of aliens aren't already

2050
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
those kinds of aliens aren't already
 

2051
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,589
those kinds of aliens aren't already
here

2052
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:29,599
here
 

2053
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:30,470
here
uh

2054
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
uh
 

2055
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,230
uh
well you have we should have a different

2056
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:32,240
well you have we should have a different
 

2057
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,829
well you have we should have a different
discussion of that right okay so let's

2058
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
discussion of that right okay so let's
 

2059
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,190
discussion of that right okay so let's
actually lead that let's leave that

2060
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:35,200
actually lead that let's leave that
 

2061
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,270
actually lead that let's leave that
discussion aside just to linger and

2062
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:37,280
discussion aside just to linger and
 

2063
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,589
discussion aside just to linger and
understand the grabby alien expansion

2064
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
understand the grabby alien expansion
 

2065
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,829
understand the grabby alien expansion
which is beautiful and fascinating

2066
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
which is beautiful and fascinating
 

2067
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,550
which is beautiful and fascinating
okay so there's these giant expanding

2068
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:46,560
okay so there's these giant expanding
 

2069
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,829
okay so there's these giant expanding
spheres spheres of alien civilizations

2070
00:35:49,829 --> 00:35:49,839
spheres spheres of alien civilizations
 

2071
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:50,790
spheres spheres of alien civilizations
now

2072
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
now
 

2073
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,670
now
um

2074
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:53,680

 

2075
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,910

when those fears spheres collide

2076
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
when those fears spheres collide
 

2077
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,589
when those fears spheres collide
mathematically

2078
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599

 

2079
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,910

it was it's very likely that we're not

2080
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:01,920
it was it's very likely that we're not
 

2081
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,430
it was it's very likely that we're not
the first

2082
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:03,440
the first
 

2083
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,270
the first
collision of grabby

2084
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
collision of grabby
 

2085
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,750
collision of grabby
of alien civilizations i suppose there's

2086
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:07,760
of alien civilizations i suppose there's
 

2087
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,470
of alien civilizations i suppose there's
one way to say it so there's like the

2088
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:10,480
one way to say it so there's like the
 

2089
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,390
one way to say it so there's like the
first time the spheres touch each other

2090
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:12,400
first time the spheres touch each other
 

2091
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,270
first time the spheres touch each other
we recognize each other right they meet

2092
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
we recognize each other right they meet
 

2093
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,910
we recognize each other right they meet
um they they recognize each other first

2094
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
um they they recognize each other first
 

2095
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,349
um they they recognize each other first
before they meet

2096
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
before they meet
 

2097
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,030
before they meet
um they see each other coming they see

2098
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
um they see each other coming they see
 

2099
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,790
um they see each other coming they see
each other coming and then so there's a

2100
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:22,800
each other coming and then so there's a
 

2101
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,950
each other coming and then so there's a
bunch of them there's a combinatorial

2102
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
bunch of them there's a combinatorial
 

2103
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,390
bunch of them there's a combinatorial
thing where they start seeing each other

2104
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:26,400
thing where they start seeing each other
 

2105
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,069
thing where they start seeing each other
coming and then there's a third neighbor

2106
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
coming and then there's a third neighbor
 

2107
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:29,349
coming and then there's a third neighbor
it's like what the hell and then there's

2108
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
it's like what the hell and then there's
 

2109
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,910
it's like what the hell and then there's
a fourth one okay so what does that you

2110
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:31,920
a fourth one okay so what does that you
 

2111
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,990
a fourth one okay so what does that you
think look like um what lessons

2112
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
think look like um what lessons
 

2113
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,150
think look like um what lessons
from human nature that's the only data

2114
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
from human nature that's the only data
 

2115
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,829
from human nature that's the only data
we

2116
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:38,839
we
 

2117
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,069
we
have what can you draw the story of the

2118
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
have what can you draw the story of the
 

2119
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,990
have what can you draw the story of the
history of the universe here is what i

2120
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,000
history of the universe here is what i
 

2121
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,630
history of the universe here is what i
would call a living cosmology so

2122
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
would call a living cosmology so
 

2123
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,950
would call a living cosmology so
what i'm excited about in part by this

2124
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
what i'm excited about in part by this
 

2125
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,109
what i'm excited about in part by this
model is that it lets us tell a story of

2126
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:51,119
model is that it lets us tell a story of
 

2127
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:53,430
model is that it lets us tell a story of
cosmology where there are actors who

2128
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,440
cosmology where there are actors who
 

2129
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,710
cosmology where there are actors who
have agendas

2130
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
have agendas
 

2131
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,870
have agendas
so most ancient peoples they had

2132
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:56,880
so most ancient peoples they had
 

2133
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,870
so most ancient peoples they had
cosmologies stories they told about

2134
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:58,880
cosmologies stories they told about
 

2135
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,069
cosmologies stories they told about
where the universe came from and where

2136
00:37:00,069 --> 00:37:00,079
where the universe came from and where
 

2137
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,190
where the universe came from and where
it's going and what's happening out

2138
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,200
it's going and what's happening out
 

2139
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,550
it's going and what's happening out
there and their stories they like to

2140
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:02,560
there and their stories they like to
 

2141
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,550
there and their stories they like to
have agents and actors gods or something

2142
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
have agents and actors gods or something
 

2143
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,109
have agents and actors gods or something
out there doing things and lately our

2144
00:37:07,109 --> 00:37:07,119
out there doing things and lately our
 

2145
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:09,589
out there doing things and lately our
favorite cosmology is dead kind of

2146
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:09,599
favorite cosmology is dead kind of
 

2147
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:10,630
favorite cosmology is dead kind of
boring

2148
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:10,640
boring
 

2149
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,550
boring
you know we're the only activity we know

2150
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
you know we're the only activity we know
 

2151
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,310
you know we're the only activity we know
about or see and everything else just

2152
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:14,320
about or see and everything else just
 

2153
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,550
about or see and everything else just
looks dead and empty but

2154
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
looks dead and empty but
 

2155
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,790
looks dead and empty but
this is now telling us no that's not

2156
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
this is now telling us no that's not
 

2157
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,630
this is now telling us no that's not
quite right at the moment the universe

2158
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
quite right at the moment the universe
 

2159
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,870
quite right at the moment the universe
is filling up and in a few billion years

2160
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:22,880
is filling up and in a few billion years
 

2161
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,630
is filling up and in a few billion years
it'll be all full

2162
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
it'll be all full
 

2163
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,310
it'll be all full
and from then on the history of the

2164
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
and from then on the history of the
 

2165
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,470
and from then on the history of the
universe will be the universe full of

2166
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:28,480
universe will be the universe full of
 

2167
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,910
universe will be the universe full of
aliens

2168
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
aliens
 

2169
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,910
aliens
yeah so that's a it's a really good

2170
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:31,920
yeah so that's a it's a really good
 

2171
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,270
yeah so that's a it's a really good
reminder a really good way to think

2172
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
reminder a really good way to think
 

2173
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,109
reminder a really good way to think
about cosmology is

2174
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:35,119
about cosmology is
 

2175
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,910
about cosmology is
we're surrounded by vast darkness and we

2176
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:37,920
we're surrounded by vast darkness and we
 

2177
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,510
we're surrounded by vast darkness and we
don't know what's going on in that

2178
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:39,520
don't know what's going on in that
 

2179
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,710
don't know what's going on in that
darkness

2180
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
darkness
 

2181
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,870
darkness
until the light

2182
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
until the light
 

2183
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,790
until the light
from whatever generate lights arrives

2184
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:44,800
from whatever generate lights arrives
 

2185
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,589
from whatever generate lights arrives
here

2186
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:45,599
here
 

2187
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,069
here
so we kind of yeah we look up at the sky

2188
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
so we kind of yeah we look up at the sky
 

2189
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,230
so we kind of yeah we look up at the sky
okay they're stars oh they're pretty but

2190
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240
okay they're stars oh they're pretty but
 

2191
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,109
okay they're stars oh they're pretty but
you don't think about

2192
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
you don't think about
 

2193
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,390
you don't think about
the giant expanding spheres of aliens

2194
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:56,400
the giant expanding spheres of aliens
 

2195
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,430
the giant expanding spheres of aliens
right

2196
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
right
 

2197
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,829
right
see them but now you're approaching

2198
00:37:59,829 --> 00:37:59,839
see them but now you're approaching
 

2199
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:01,190
see them but now you're approaching
looking at the clock if you're clever

2200
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
looking at the clock if you're clever
 

2201
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,630
looking at the clock if you're clever
the clock tells you so i like the

2202
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:02,640
the clock tells you so i like the
 

2203
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,870
the clock tells you so i like the
analogy with the ancient greeks so yes

2204
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:04,880
analogy with the ancient greeks so yes
 

2205
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,790
analogy with the ancient greeks so yes
you might think that an ancient greek

2206
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:06,800
you might think that an ancient greek
 

2207
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,069
you might think that an ancient greek
you know staring at the universe

2208
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
you know staring at the universe
 

2209
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,150
you know staring at the universe
couldn't possibly tell how far away the

2210
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:10,160
couldn't possibly tell how far away the
 

2211
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,310
couldn't possibly tell how far away the
sun was or how far away the moon is or

2212
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
sun was or how far away the moon is or
 

2213
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,829
sun was or how far away the moon is or
how big the earth is

2214
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:13,839
how big the earth is
 

2215
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,750
how big the earth is
that all you can see is just big things

2216
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:15,760
that all you can see is just big things
 

2217
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,109
that all you can see is just big things
in the sky you can't tell but they were

2218
00:38:17,109 --> 00:38:17,119
in the sky you can't tell but they were
 

2219
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,550
in the sky you can't tell but they were
clever enough actually to be able to

2220
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,560
clever enough actually to be able to
 

2221
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,630
clever enough actually to be able to
figure out the size of the earth and the

2222
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:20,640
figure out the size of the earth and the
 

2223
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,230
figure out the size of the earth and the
distance to the moon and the sun and the

2224
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
distance to the moon and the sun and the
 

2225
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,750
distance to the moon and the sun and the
size of the moon

2226
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
size of the moon
 

2227
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,589
size of the moon
and sun that is they could figure those

2228
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:25,599
and sun that is they could figure those
 

2229
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:27,430
and sun that is they could figure those
things out actually by being clever

2230
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:27,440
things out actually by being clever
 

2231
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,190
things out actually by being clever
enough and so similarly we can actually

2232
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,200
enough and so similarly we can actually
 

2233
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,710
enough and so similarly we can actually
figure out where are the aliens out

2234
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:30,720
figure out where are the aliens out
 

2235
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,390
figure out where are the aliens out
there in space time by being clever

2236
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
there in space time by being clever
 

2237
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,990
there in space time by being clever
about the few things we can see one of

2238
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
about the few things we can see one of
 

2239
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,670
about the few things we can see one of
which is our current date

2240
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,680
which is our current date
 

2241
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,470
which is our current date
and

2242
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:36,480
and
 

2243
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,589
and
so now that you have this living

2244
00:38:37,589 --> 00:38:37,599
so now that you have this living
 

2245
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,990
so now that you have this living
cosmology we can tell the story that the

2246
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,000
cosmology we can tell the story that the
 

2247
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,230
cosmology we can tell the story that the
universe starts out empty and then at

2248
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
universe starts out empty and then at
 

2249
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,310
universe starts out empty and then at
some point things like us appear very

2250
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:44,320
some point things like us appear very
 

2251
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,710
some point things like us appear very
primitive and then some of those

2252
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
primitive and then some of those
 

2253
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,109
primitive and then some of those
just stop being quiet and expand and

2254
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
just stop being quiet and expand and
 

2255
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,790
just stop being quiet and expand and
then for a few billion years they expand

2256
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:50,800
then for a few billion years they expand
 

2257
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,710
then for a few billion years they expand

and then they meet each other and then
 

2259
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,030
and then they meet each other and then
for the next 100 billion years they

for the next 100 billion years they
 

2261
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,790
for the next 100 billion years they
commune with each other

the expansion of the universe will

is some galaxy clusters and they that

are sort of disconnected from each other
 

2277
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,030
are sort of disconnected from each other
but before then for the next 100 million

they will interact there will be this

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
they will interact there will be this
 

2283
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,310
they will interact there will be this
community of all the grabby alien

2284
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,320
community of all the grabby alien
 

2285
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,829
community of all the grabby alien
civilizations and each one of them will

2286
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
civilizations and each one of them will
 

2287
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,589
civilizations and each one of them will
hear about and even meet thousands of

00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
hear about and even meet thousands of
 

2289
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,870
hear about and even meet thousands of

and we might hope to join them someday

2292
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160
and we might hope to join them someday
 

2293
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,990
and we might hope to join them someday
and become part of that community that's

2294
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,000
and become part of that community that's
 

2295
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,109
and become part of that community that's
an interesting thing to aspire to yes

2296
00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:33,119
an interesting thing to aspire to yes
 

2297
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,710
an interesting thing to aspire to yes
interesting is an interesting word

2298
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
interesting is an interesting word
 

2299
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,790
interesting is an interesting word
is the universe of alien civilizations

2300
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
is the universe of alien civilizations
 

2301
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,870
is the universe of alien civilizations
defined by war

2302
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
defined by war
 

2303
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,670
defined by war
as much or more

2304
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:43,680
as much or more
 

2305
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,510
as much or more
than uh

2306
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
than uh
 

2307
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,790
than uh
war defined human history

2308
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
war defined human history
 

2309
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,990
war defined human history
i would say it's defined by competition

2310
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
i would say it's defined by competition
 

2311
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,829
i would say it's defined by competition
and then the question is how much

2312
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
and then the question is how much
 

2313
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,109
and then the question is how much
competition

2314
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:55,119
competition
 

2315
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,109
competition
implies war

2316
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
implies war
 

2317
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,710
implies war
so

2318
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
so
 

2319
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,990
so
up until recently competition defined

2320
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,000
up until recently competition defined
 

2321
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,670
up until recently competition defined
life on earth

2322
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:03,680
life on earth
 

2323
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,710
life on earth
yes

2324
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:04,720
yes
 

2325
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,710
yes
competition between species and

2326
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
competition between species and
 

2327
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,030
competition between species and
organisms and among humans competitions

2328
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:09,040
organisms and among humans competitions
 

2329
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,589
organisms and among humans competitions
among individuals and communities and

2330
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:11,599
among individuals and communities and
 

2331
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,270
among individuals and communities and
that competition often took the form of

2332
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:13,280
that competition often took the form of
 

2333
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,630
that competition often took the form of
war in the last 10 000 years

2334
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:16,640
war in the last 10 000 years
 

2335
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,230
war in the last 10 000 years
many people now

2336
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
many people now
 

2337
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,790
many people now
are hoping or even expecting to sort of

2338
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
are hoping or even expecting to sort of
 

2339
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,109
are hoping or even expecting to sort of
suppress and end competition in human

2340
00:40:23,109 --> 00:40:23,119
suppress and end competition in human
 

2341
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,190
suppress and end competition in human
affairs

2342
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:25,200
affairs
 

2343
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,589
affairs
they regulate business competition they

2344
00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:27,599
they regulate business competition they
 

2345
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,390
they regulate business competition they
prevent military competition

2346
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:30,400
prevent military competition
 

2347
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,349
prevent military competition
and

2348
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:31,359
and
 

2349
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:33,109
and
that's a future i think a lot of people

2350
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:33,119
that's a future i think a lot of people
 

2351
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:34,230
that's a future i think a lot of people
will like

2352
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
will like
 

2353
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,750
will like
to continue and strengthen people will

2354
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:35,760
to continue and strengthen people will
 

2355
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,270
to continue and strengthen people will
like to have something close to world

2356
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,280
like to have something close to world
 

2357
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,349
like to have something close to world
government or world governance or at

2358
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:39,359
government or world governance or at
 

2359
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,190
government or world governance or at
least a world community and they will

2360
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,200
least a world community and they will
 

2361
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,990
least a world community and they will
like to suppress war and many forms of

2362
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,000
like to suppress war and many forms of
 

2363
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,750
like to suppress war and many forms of
business and personal competition over

2364
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
business and personal competition over
 

2365
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,910
business and personal competition over
the coming centuries

2366
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:47,920
the coming centuries
 

2367
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,270
the coming centuries
and

2368
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
and
 

2369
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,190
and
they may like that so much that they

2370
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
they may like that so much that they
 

2371
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,270
they may like that so much that they
prevent interstellar colonization which

2372
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
prevent interstellar colonization which
 

2373
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,589
prevent interstellar colonization which
would become the end of that era that is

2374
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:55,599
would become the end of that era that is
 

2375
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,109
would become the end of that era that is
interstellar colonization would just

2376
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
interstellar colonization would just
 

2377
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,150
interstellar colonization would just
return

2378
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
return
 

2379
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,390
return
severe competition to human or our

2380
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
severe competition to human or our
 

2381
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,309
severe competition to human or our
descendant affairs and many

2382
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:02,319
descendant affairs and many
 

2383
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:04,390
descendant affairs and many
civilizations may prefer that and ours

2384
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
civilizations may prefer that and ours
 

2385
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,870
civilizations may prefer that and ours
may prefer that but if they choose to

2386
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
may prefer that but if they choose to
 

2387
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,109
may prefer that but if they choose to
allow interstellar colonization they

2388
00:41:09,109 --> 00:41:09,119
allow interstellar colonization they
 

2389
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,589
allow interstellar colonization they
will have chosen to allow competition to

2390
00:41:11,589 --> 00:41:11,599
will have chosen to allow competition to
 

2391
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,430
will have chosen to allow competition to
return with great force that is there's

2392
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:13,440
return with great force that is there's
 

2393
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,510
return with great force that is there's
really not much of a way to centrally

2394
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:15,520
really not much of a way to centrally
 

2395
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,309
really not much of a way to centrally
govern a rapidly expanding sphere of

2396
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
govern a rapidly expanding sphere of
 

2397
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,790
govern a rapidly expanding sphere of
civilization and so i think the one of

2398
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:20,800
civilization and so i think the one of
 

2399
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,670
civilization and so i think the one of
the most

2400
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:21,680
the most
 

2401
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,950
the most
you know solid things we can predict

2402
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:22,960
you know solid things we can predict
 

2403
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,030
you know solid things we can predict
about gravians is they have accepted

2404
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
about gravians is they have accepted
 

2405
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,630
about gravians is they have accepted
competition

2406
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
competition
 

2407
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,950
competition
and they have internal competition and

2408
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:28,960
and they have internal competition and
 

2409
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,990
and they have internal competition and
therefore

2410
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,000
therefore
 

2411
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,670
therefore
they have the potential for competition

2412
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
they have the potential for competition
 

2413
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,270
they have the potential for competition
when they meet each other at the borders

2414
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:33,280
when they meet each other at the borders
 

2415
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,150
when they meet each other at the borders
but whether that's military competition

2416
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
but whether that's military competition
 

2417
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,870
but whether that's military competition
is more of an open question so military

2418
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
is more of an open question so military
 

2419
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,349
is more of an open question so military
meaning destro physically destructive

2420
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
meaning destro physically destructive
 

2421
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,069
meaning destro physically destructive
right

2422
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:46,079

 

2423
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,390

so there's a lot to say there so one

2424
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:48,400
so there's a lot to say there so one
 

2425
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,030
so there's a lot to say there so one
idea that you kind of proposed

2426
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:51,040
idea that you kind of proposed
 

2427
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,790
idea that you kind of proposed
is

2428
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:52,800
is
 

2429
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,069
is
progress might be maximized through

2430
00:41:56,069 --> 00:41:56,079
progress might be maximized through
 

2431
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,910
progress might be maximized through
competition

2432
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
competition
 

2433
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,550
competition
through some kind of healthy competition

2434
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:00,560
through some kind of healthy competition
 

2435
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,109
through some kind of healthy competition
some definition of healthy so like

2436
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
some definition of healthy so like
 

2437
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,390
some definition of healthy so like
constructive not destructive competition

2438
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:06,400
constructive not destructive competition
 

2439
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,109
constructive not destructive competition
so like we would likely

2440
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:09,119
so like we would likely
 

2441
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,750
so like we would likely
grabby alien civilizations would be

2442
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
grabby alien civilizations would be
 

2443
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,430
grabby alien civilizations would be
likely defined by competition because

2444
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440
likely defined by competition because
 

2445
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,670
likely defined by competition because
they can expand faster because they

2446
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
they can expand faster because they
 

2447
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,510
they can expand faster because they
competition allows

2448
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:17,520
competition allows
 

2449
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,190
competition allows
innovation and sort of the battle of

2450
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:19,200
innovation and sort of the battle of
 

2451
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,349
innovation and sort of the battle of
ideas the way i would take the logic is

2452
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
ideas the way i would take the logic is
 

2453
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,950
ideas the way i would take the logic is
to say you know competition just happens

2454
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
to say you know competition just happens
 

2455
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,430
to say you know competition just happens
if you can't coordinate to stop it

2456
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
if you can't coordinate to stop it
 

2457
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,270
if you can't coordinate to stop it
and you probably can't coordinate to

2458
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,280
and you probably can't coordinate to
 

2459
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,750
and you probably can't coordinate to
stop it in an expanding interstellar

2460
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:31,760
stop it in an expanding interstellar
 

2461
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,069
stop it in an expanding interstellar
wave so competition is a

2462
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079
wave so competition is a
 

2463
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,630
wave so competition is a
fundamental force

2464
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:36,640
fundamental force
 

2465
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,190
fundamental force
in the universe it has been so far and

2466
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:39,200
in the universe it has been so far and
 

2467
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:39,910
in the universe it has been so far and
it

2468
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
it
 

2469
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,309
it
would be within an expanding grabby

2470
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
would be within an expanding grabby
 

2471
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,790
would be within an expanding grabby
alien civilization but we today have the

2472
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:44,800
alien civilization but we today have the
 

2473
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,829
alien civilization but we today have the
chance many people think and hope of

2474
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
chance many people think and hope of
 

2475
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:49,349
chance many people think and hope of
greatly controlling and limiting

2476
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
greatly controlling and limiting
 

2477
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,589
greatly controlling and limiting
competition within our civilization for

2478
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:51,599
competition within our civilization for
 

2479
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:52,710
competition within our civilization for
a while

2480
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:52,720
a while
 

2481
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,670
a while
and that's an interesting choice

2482
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
and that's an interesting choice
 

2483
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,630
and that's an interesting choice
whether to allow competition to reap

2484
00:42:58,630 --> 00:42:58,640
whether to allow competition to reap
 

2485
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,870
whether to allow competition to reap
to sort of regain its full force

2486
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
to sort of regain its full force
 

2487
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,829
to sort of regain its full force
or whether to suppress and manage it

2488
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:03,839
or whether to suppress and manage it
 

2489
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:06,710
or whether to suppress and manage it
well one of the open questions

2490
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
well one of the open questions
 

2491
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,870
well one of the open questions
that has been raised

2492
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:08,880
that has been raised
 

2493
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,430
that has been raised
in the past

2494
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
in the past
 

2495
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,430
in the past
less than 100 years

2496
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
less than 100 years
 

2497
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,390
less than 100 years
is whether our desire

2498
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
is whether our desire
 

2499
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,390
is whether our desire
to lessen the destructive nature of

2500
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
to lessen the destructive nature of
 

2501
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,589
to lessen the destructive nature of
competition

2502
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:19,599
competition
 

2503
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,150
competition
or the destructive kind of competition

2504
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
or the destructive kind of competition
 

2505
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,510
or the destructive kind of competition
will be outpaced by the destructive

2506
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
will be outpaced by the destructive
 

2507
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,790
will be outpaced by the destructive
power of our weapons

2508
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
power of our weapons
 

2509
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,069
power of our weapons
sort of uh

2510
00:43:30,069 --> 00:43:30,079
sort of uh
 

2511
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:30,870
sort of uh
if

2512
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
if
 

2513
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,670
if
nuclear weapons and weapons of that kind

2514
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:35,680

 

2515
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:39,109

become more destructive than our desire

2516
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:39,119
become more destructive than our desire
 

2517
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,470
become more destructive than our desire
for peace

2518
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
for peace
 

2519
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,630
for peace
then it all it takes is one at

2520
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
then it all it takes is one at
 

2521
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,069
then it all it takes is one at
the party

2522
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
the party
 

2523
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,710
the party
to ruin the party it takes one

2524
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:46,720
to ruin the party it takes one
 

2525
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,349
to ruin the party it takes one
to make a delay but not that much of a

2526
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
to make a delay but not that much of a
 

2527
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,589
to make a delay but not that much of a
delay on the cosmological scales we're

2528
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
delay on the cosmological scales we're
 

2529
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,470
delay on the cosmological scales we're
talking about so you could even party on

2530
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:54,480
talking about so you could even party on
 

2531
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,870
talking about so you could even party on
even a vast nuclear war if it happened

2532
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
even a vast nuclear war if it happened
 

2533
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,510
even a vast nuclear war if it happened
here right now on earth

2534
00:43:59,510 --> 00:43:59,520
here right now on earth
 

2535
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,069
here right now on earth
it would not kill all humans

2536
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
it would not kill all humans
 

2537
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:02,950
it would not kill all humans
yes

2538
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:02,960
yes
 

2539
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,190
yes
it certainly wouldn't kill all life

2540
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:05,200
it certainly wouldn't kill all life
 

2541
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,829
it certainly wouldn't kill all life
and so human civilization would return

2542
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
and so human civilization would return
 

2543
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,069
and so human civilization would return
within a hundred thousand years

2544
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
within a hundred thousand years
 

2545
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,750
within a hundred thousand years
so all

2546
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:11,760
so all
 

2547
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,230
so all
the history of atrocities

2548
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
the history of atrocities
 

2549
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,349
the history of atrocities
and

2550
00:44:15,349 --> 00:44:15,359
and
 

2551
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,790
and
um if you look at uh

2552
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
um if you look at uh
 

2553
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,030
um if you look at uh
uh the

2554
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:21,040
uh the
 

2555
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,270
uh the
black plague right

2556
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
black plague right
 

2557
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,309
black plague right
which is

2558
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
which is
 

2559
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,390
which is
not human cause atrocities or whatever

2560
00:44:26,390 --> 00:44:26,400
not human cause atrocities or whatever
 

2561
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,230
not human cause atrocities or whatever
there are a lot of military

2562
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:28,240
there are a lot of military
 

2563
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,829
there are a lot of military
atrocities in history absolutely in the

2564
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:29,839
atrocities in history absolutely in the
 

2565
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:32,150
atrocities in history absolutely in the
20th century those are

2566
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:32,160
20th century those are
 

2567
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,190
20th century those are
um

2568
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,200
um
 

2569
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,030
um
those challenges

2570
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
those challenges
 

2571
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,030
those challenges
to think about human nature but the

2572
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,040
to think about human nature but the
 

2573
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,309
to think about human nature but the
cosmic scale of time and space

2574
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
cosmic scale of time and space
 

2575
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,430
cosmic scale of time and space
they do not stop the human spirit

2576
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
they do not stop the human spirit
 

2577
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,870
they do not stop the human spirit
essentially the humanity goes on

2578
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
essentially the humanity goes on
 

2579
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,349
essentially the humanity goes on
through all the atrocities it goes on

2580
00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:49,359
through all the atrocities it goes on
 

2581
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,230
through all the atrocities it goes on
like most likely so even a nuclear war

2582
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,240
like most likely so even a nuclear war
 

2583
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,950
like most likely so even a nuclear war
isn't enough to destroy us

2584
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
isn't enough to destroy us
 

2585
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,270
isn't enough to destroy us
or to stop our potential from expanding

2586
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
or to stop our potential from expanding
 

2587
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,309
or to stop our potential from expanding
but

2588
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
but
 

2589
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,870
but
we could institute a

2590
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:00,880
we could institute a
 

2591
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,270
we could institute a
regime of global governance that limited

2592
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
regime of global governance that limited
 

2593
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,190
regime of global governance that limited
competition including military and

2594
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:05,200
competition including military and
 

2595
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,589
competition including military and
business competition of sorts and that

2596
00:45:07,589 --> 00:45:07,599
business competition of sorts and that
 

2597
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,589
business competition of sorts and that
could prevent our expansion

2598
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
could prevent our expansion
 

2599
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:10,710
could prevent our expansion
of course

2600
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
of course
 

2601
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,349
of course
to play devil's advocate

2602
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359

 

2603
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,829

global

2604

global
 

2605
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,870
global
governance is centralized power

2606
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:20,880
governance is centralized power
 

2607
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,470
governance is centralized power
power corrupts

2608
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:22,480
power corrupts
 

2609
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,430
power corrupts
and absolute power corrupts absolutely

2610
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:25,440
and absolute power corrupts absolutely
 

2611
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,990
and absolute power corrupts absolutely
one of the aspects of competition that's

2612
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,000
one of the aspects of competition that's
 

2613
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,910
one of the aspects of competition that's
been very productive

2614
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:29,920
been very productive
 

2615
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,030
been very productive
is

2616
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:31,040
is
 

2617
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,470
is
not letting

2618
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:32,480
not letting
 

2619
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,750
not letting
any one person any one country any one

2620
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
any one person any one country any one
 

2621
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,750
any one person any one country any one
center of power become

2622
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:37,760
center of power become
 

2623
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,829
center of power become
absolutely powerful

2624
00:45:39,829 --> 00:45:39,839
absolutely powerful
 

2625
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,309
absolutely powerful
because that's another lesson is it

2626
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:42,319
because that's another lesson is it
 

2627
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:43,910
because that's another lesson is it
seems to corrupt there's something about

2628
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
seems to corrupt there's something about
 

2629
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,069
seems to corrupt there's something about
ego in the human mind that seems to be

2630
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
ego in the human mind that seems to be
 

2631
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,069
ego in the human mind that seems to be
corrupted by power so when you say

2632
00:45:48,069 --> 00:45:48,079
corrupted by power so when you say
 

2633
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,230
corrupted by power so when you say
global governance

2634
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,240
global governance
 

2635
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,190
global governance
that

2636
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,200
that
 

2637
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,030
that
terrifies me

2638
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
terrifies me
 

2639
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,630
terrifies me
more than the possibility of war because

2640
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:56,640
more than the possibility of war because
 

2641
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,190
more than the possibility of war because
it's uh i think that people will be less

2642
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
it's uh i think that people will be less
 

2643
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,589
it's uh i think that people will be less
terrified than you are right now and let

2644
00:46:01,589 --> 00:46:01,599
terrified than you are right now and let
 

2645
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:02,710
terrified than you are right now and let
me try to

2646
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:02,720
me try to
 

2647
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,990
me try to
paint the picture from their point of

2648
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:04,000
paint the picture from their point of
 

2649
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,670
paint the picture from their point of
view this isn't my point of view but i

2650
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:05,680
view this isn't my point of view but i
 

2651
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,349
view this isn't my point of view but i
think it's going to be a widely shared

2652
00:46:07,349 --> 00:46:07,359
think it's going to be a widely shared
 

2653
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,270
think it's going to be a widely shared
point of view yes this is two devil's

2654
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,280
point of view yes this is two devil's
 

2655
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,069
point of view yes this is two devil's
advocates arguing two devils okay

2656
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:12,079
advocates arguing two devils okay
 

2657
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,270
advocates arguing two devils okay
so

2658
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
so
 

2659
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,750
so
for the last half century and into the

2660
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:15,760
for the last half century and into the
 

2661
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:19,190
for the last half century and into the
continuing future we actually have had

2662
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
continuing future we actually have had
 

2663
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,550
continuing future we actually have had
a strong

2664
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:20,560
a strong
 

2665
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,670
a strong
elite global community that shares a lot

2666
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:23,680
elite global community that shares a lot
 

2667
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,150
elite global community that shares a lot
of values and beliefs and has

2668
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:26,160
of values and beliefs and has
 

2669
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,630
of values and beliefs and has
created a lot of convergence in global

2670
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
created a lot of convergence in global
 

2671
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,750
created a lot of convergence in global
policy

2672
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
policy
 

2673
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,510
policy
so if you look at electromagnetic

2674
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
so if you look at electromagnetic
 

2675
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,109
so if you look at electromagnetic
spectrum or

2676
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
spectrum or
 

2677
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,990
spectrum or
medical experiments or pandemic policy

2678
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:36,000
medical experiments or pandemic policy
 

2679
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,790
medical experiments or pandemic policy
or

2680
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:36,800
or
 

2681
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,190
or
nuclear power energy or regulating

2682
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
nuclear power energy or regulating
 

2683
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,109
nuclear power energy or regulating
airplanes or just in a wide range of

00:46:41,109 --> 00:46:41,119
airplanes or just in a wide range of
 

2685
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:43,589
airplanes or just in a wide range of
area in fact the world

2686
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
area in fact the world
 

2687
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,069
area in fact the world
has very similar regulations and rules

2688
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
has very similar regulations and rules
 

2689
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,069
has very similar regulations and rules
everywhere and it's not a coincidence

2690
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
everywhere and it's not a coincidence
 

2691
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,750
everywhere and it's not a coincidence
because they are part of a world

2692
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
because they are part of a world
 

2693
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,990
because they are part of a world
community where people get together at

2694
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,000
community where people get together at
 

2695
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,230
community where people get together at
places like davos et cetera where world

2696
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:54,240
places like davos et cetera where world
 

2697
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,670
places like davos et cetera where world
elites

2698
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
elites
 

2699
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,990
elites
want to be respected by other world

2700
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,000
want to be respected by other world
 

2701
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,710
want to be respected by other world
elites and they have a you know

2702
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:00,720
elites and they have a you know
 

2703
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,990
elites and they have a you know
convergence of opinion and that produces

2704
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
convergence of opinion and that produces
 

2705
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,230
convergence of opinion and that produces
something like global governance but

2706
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:06,240
something like global governance but
 

2707
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,710
something like global governance but
without a global center this is sort of

2708
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
without a global center this is sort of
 

2709
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,030
without a global center this is sort of
what human mobs or communities have done

2710
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:11,040
what human mobs or communities have done
 

2711
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,710
what human mobs or communities have done
for a long time that is humans can

2712
00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:12,720
for a long time that is humans can
 

2713
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,630
for a long time that is humans can
coordinate together on shared behavior

2714
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:14,640
coordinate together on shared behavior
 

2715
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,750
coordinate together on shared behavior
without a center by having gossip and

2716
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
without a center by having gossip and
 

2717
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,870
without a center by having gossip and
reputation within a community of elites

2718
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
reputation within a community of elites
 

2719
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,790
reputation within a community of elites
and that is what we have been doing and

2720
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:22,800
and that is what we have been doing and
 

2721
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:25,109
and that is what we have been doing and
are likely to do a lot more of so for

2722
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
are likely to do a lot more of so for
 

2723
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,069
are likely to do a lot more of so for
example

2724
00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:26,079
example
 

2725
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:27,430
example
you know one of the things that's

2726
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
you know one of the things that's
 

2727
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,190
you know one of the things that's
happening say with the war in ukraine is

2728
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:29,200
happening say with the war in ukraine is
 

2729
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,750
happening say with the war in ukraine is
that this world community of elites has

2730
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:31,760
that this world community of elites has
 

2731
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,990
that this world community of elites has
decided that they disapprove of the

2732
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:34,000
decided that they disapprove of the
 

2733

the world in order to oppose it and they
 

2741
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:43,270
the world in order to oppose it and they
are proud of that

2742
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
are proud of that
 

2743
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,589
are proud of that
sharing that opinion and their and their

sharing that opinion and their and their
 

2745
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,150
sharing that opinion and their and their
feel that they are morally justified in

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,190
feel that they are morally justified in
their stance there and um

their stance there and um
 

2749
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,349
their stance there and um
that's the kind of event that actually

that's the kind of event that actually
 

2751
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,349
that's the kind of event that actually
brings world elite communities together

2752

brings world elite communities together
 

2753
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,470
brings world elite communities together
where they

2865
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,030
victim is defending itself against the
cruelty of the world and it's actually

2866
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040
cruelty of the world and it's actually
 

2867
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,549

about a better world
 

2871
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,349
about a better world
so

2872
00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:51,359
so
 

2873
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,430
so
every power center thinks they're doing

2874
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
every power center thinks they're doing
 

2875
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,230
every power center thinks they're doing
good

2876
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,240
good
 

2877
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:57,510
good
and so this is uh

2878
00:49:57,510 --> 00:49:57,520
and so this is uh
 

2879
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,750
and so this is uh
this is the positive of competition of

2880
00:49:59,750 --> 00:49:59,760
this is the positive of competition of
 

2881
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,069
this is the positive of competition of
not of having multiple power centers

2882
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:02,079
not of having multiple power centers
 

2883
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,349
not of having multiple power centers

00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:48,160
of life out there that's the thing we
 

2923
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,630
of life out there that's the thing we
would lose by deciding that we wouldn't

2924
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:50,640
would lose by deciding that we wouldn't
 

2925
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,870
would lose by deciding that we wouldn't
expand that we would stay here and keep

2926
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
expand that we would stay here and keep
 

2927
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,390
expand that we would stay here and keep
our comfortable

2928
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
our comfortable
 

2929
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,829
our comfortable
shared governance

2930
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:55,839
shared governance
 

2931
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,549
shared governance
so you wait you think that

2932
00:50:58,549 --> 00:50:58,559
so you wait you think that
 

2933
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,390
so you wait you think that
global

2934
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
global
 

2935
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,270
global
governance

2936
00:51:03,270 --> 00:51:03,280

 

2937
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:04,790

is

2938
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,800
is
 

2939
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,109
is
makes it more likely or less likely that

2940
00:51:07,109 --> 00:51:07,119
makes it more likely or less likely that
 

2941
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,990
makes it more likely or less likely that
we expand out into the universe less

2942
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:10,000
we expand out into the universe less
 

2943
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,150
we expand out into the universe less
so okay this is the key this is the key

2944
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:12,160
so okay this is the key this is the key
 

2945
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,510
so okay this is the key this is the key
point

2946
00:51:13,510 --> 00:51:13,520
point
 

2947
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,150
point
right so screw the elites

2948
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,160
right so screw the elites
 

2949
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,150
right so screw the elites
so right we want to exp wait do we want

2950
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:18,160
so right we want to exp wait do we want
 

2951
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,349
so right we want to exp wait do we want
to expand

2952
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:19,359
to expand
 

2953
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,630
to expand
so again i want to separate my neutral

2954
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:22,640
so again i want to separate my neutral
 

2955
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,910
so again i want to separate my neutral
analysis from my evaluation and say

2956
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
analysis from my evaluation and say
 

2957
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,589
analysis from my evaluation and say
first of all i have an analysis that

2958
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:27,599
first of all i have an analysis that
 

2959
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,510
first of all i have an analysis that
tells us this is a key choice that we

2960
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
tells us this is a key choice that we
 

2961
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,190
tells us this is a key choice that we
will face and that it's a key choice

2962
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:31,200
will face and that it's a key choice
 

2963
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,270
will face and that it's a key choice
other aliens have faced out there and it

2964
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
other aliens have faced out there and it
 

2965
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,750
other aliens have faced out there and it
could be that only one in 10 or 100

2966
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:35,760
could be that only one in 10 or 100
 

2967
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,670
could be that only one in 10 or 100
civilizations chooses to expand and the

2968
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
civilizations chooses to expand and the
 

2969
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,829
civilizations chooses to expand and the
rest of them stay quiet and that's how

2970
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
rest of them stay quiet and that's how
 

2971
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:41,670
rest of them stay quiet and that's how
it goes out there and we face that

2972
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:41,680
it goes out there and we face that
 

2973
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,910
it goes out there and we face that
choice too

2974
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
choice too
 

2975
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,710
choice too
and

2976
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:44,720
and
 

2977
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,150
and
it'll happen sometime in the next 10

2978
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:46,160
it'll happen sometime in the next 10
 

2979
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,990
it'll happen sometime in the next 10
million years maybe the next thousand

2980
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
million years maybe the next thousand
 

2981
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,069
million years maybe the next thousand
but the key thing to notice from our

2982
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
but the key thing to notice from our
 

2983
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,589
but the key thing to notice from our
point of view is that

2984
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
point of view is that
 

2985
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,829
point of view is that
uh even though you might like our global

2986
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:53,839
uh even though you might like our global
 

2987
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,270
uh even though you might like our global
governance you might like the fact that

2988
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:55,280
governance you might like the fact that
 

2989
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,870
governance you might like the fact that
we've come together we know we no longer

2990
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
we've come together we know we no longer
 

2991
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,870
we've come together we know we no longer
have massive wars and we no longer have

2992
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
have massive wars and we no longer have
 

2993
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,790
have massive wars and we no longer have
destructive competition

2994
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:00,800
destructive competition
 

2995
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:04,470
destructive competition
um and that we could continue that the

2996
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:04,480
um and that we could continue that the
 

2997
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,829
um and that we could continue that the
cost of continuing that would be to

2998
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:05,839
cost of continuing that would be to
 

2999
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:07,990
cost of continuing that would be to
prevent interstellar colonization that

3000
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:08,000
prevent interstellar colonization that
 

3001
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,349
prevent interstellar colonization that
is once you allow interstellar

3002
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
is once you allow interstellar
 

3003
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:11,589
is once you allow interstellar
colonization then you've lost control of

3004
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
colonization then you've lost control of
 

3005
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,670
colonization then you've lost control of
those colonies and whatever they change

3006
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
those colonies and whatever they change
 

3007
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,150
those colonies and whatever they change
into they could come back here and

3008
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
into they could come back here and
 

3009
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:18,549
into they could come back here and
compete with you back here as a result

3010
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
compete with you back here as a result
 

3011
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,870
compete with you back here as a result
of having lost control and i think if

3012
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
of having lost control and i think if
 

3013
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,630
of having lost control and i think if
people value that

3014
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:22,640
people value that
 

3015
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,549
people value that
global governance and the global

3016
00:52:24,549 --> 00:52:24,559
global governance and the global
 

3017
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,630
global governance and the global
community and regulation and all the

community and regulation and all the
 

3019
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,190
community and regulation and all the
things it can do enough they would then

3020
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
things it can do enough they would then
 

3021
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,870
things it can do enough they would then
want to prevent interstellar

3022
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
want to prevent interstellar
 

3023
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,150
want to prevent interstellar
colonization i want to have a

3024
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
colonization i want to have a
 

3025
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,309
colonization i want to have a
conversation with those people i believe

what i believe is good in humanity and
for expansion exploration

3034
00:52:44,309 --> 00:52:44,319
for expansion exploration
 

3035
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,990
for expansion exploration
um innovation distributing the centers

3036
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
um innovation distributing the centers
 

3037
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,150
um innovation distributing the centers
of power is very beneficial so this

3038
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:50,160
of power is very beneficial so this
 

3039
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,910

00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,640
it's easy to lose touch of reality
 

3051

3083
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,750
so we the human civilization and alien
civilizations come to a uh a crossroads

3084
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
civilizations come to a uh a crossroads
 

3085
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,069
civilizations come to a uh a crossroads
they have to decide do we want to expand

3086
00:53:50,069 --> 00:53:50,079
they have to decide do we want to expand
 

3087
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,109
they have to decide do we want to expand
or not

3088
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:51,119
or not
 

3089
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:53,829
or not
and connected to that do we want to give

3090
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:53,839
and connected to that do we want to give
 

3091
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,470
and connected to that do we want to give
a lot of power to a central elite right

3092
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
a lot of power to a central elite right
 

3093
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,069
a lot of power to a central elite right
do we want to

3094
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
do we want to
 

3095
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,510
do we want to
uh

3096
00:53:59,510 --> 00:53:59,520
uh
 

3097
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,390
uh
distribute the the power centers which

3098
00:54:02,390 --> 00:54:02,400
distribute the the power centers which
 

3099
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,430
distribute the the power centers which
is naturally connected to the expansion

3100
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:05,440
is naturally connected to the expansion
 

3101
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,870
is naturally connected to the expansion
when you expand you distribute the power

3102
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
when you expand you distribute the power
 

3103
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,510
when you expand you distribute the power
if say over the next thousand years we

3104
00:54:11,510 --> 00:54:11,520
if say over the next thousand years we
 

3105
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,589
if say over the next thousand years we
fill up the solar system right we go out

3106
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:13,599
fill up the solar system right we go out
 

3107
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:15,589
fill up the solar system right we go out
from earth and we colonize mars and we

3108
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
from earth and we colonize mars and we
 

3109
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,349
from earth and we colonize mars and we
change a lot of things

3110
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:17,359
change a lot of things
 

3111
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,109
change a lot of things
within a solar system still everything

3112
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:19,119
within a solar system still everything
 

3113
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,950
within a solar system still everything
is within reach that is if there's a

3114
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
is within reach that is if there's a
 

3115
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,950
is within reach that is if there's a
rebellious colony around neptune you can

3116
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:22,960
rebellious colony around neptune you can
 

3117
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,710
rebellious colony around neptune you can
throw rocks at it and smash it and then

3118
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
throw rocks at it and smash it and then
 

3119
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,349
throw rocks at it and smash it and then
teach them discipline okay

3120
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
teach them discipline okay
 

3121
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,109
teach them discipline okay
a they said that work for the business

3122
00:54:29,109 --> 00:54:29,119
a they said that work for the business
 

3123
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:31,270
a they said that work for the business
central control over the solar system is

3124
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:31,280
central control over the solar system is
 

3125
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,030
central control over the solar system is
feasible

3126
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:33,040
feasible
 

3127
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,630
feasible
but once you let it escape the solar

3128
00:54:34,630 --> 00:54:34,640
but once you let it escape the solar
 

3129
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,630
but once you let it escape the solar
system it's no longer feasible but if

3130
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
system it's no longer feasible but if
 

3131
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,069
system it's no longer feasible but if
you have a solar system that doesn't

3132
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
you have a solar system that doesn't
 

3133
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,670
you have a solar system that doesn't
have a central control may be broken

3134
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:39,680
have a central control may be broken
 

3135
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,270
have a central control may be broken
into a thousand different political

3136
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
into a thousand different political
 

3137
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,950
into a thousand different political
units in the solar system

3138
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
units in the solar system
 

3139
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,910
units in the solar system
then

3140
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:43,920
then
 

3141
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,990
then
any one part of that that allows

3142
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:46,000
any one part of that that allows
 

3143
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,829
any one part of that that allows
interstellar colonization and it happens

3144
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
interstellar colonization and it happens
 

3145
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:48,950
interstellar colonization and it happens
that is

3146
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:48,960
that is
 

3147
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,950
that is
interstellar colonization happens when

3148
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:50,960
interstellar colonization happens when
 

3149
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,349
interstellar colonization happens when
only one party chooses to do it and is

3150
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:53,359
only one party chooses to do it and is
 

3151
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:55,430
only one party chooses to do it and is
able to do it and that's what it is

3152
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:55,440
able to do it and that's what it is
 

3153
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,190
able to do it and that's what it is
therefore so we can just say in a world

3154
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:57,200
therefore so we can just say in a world
 

3155
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,630
therefore so we can just say in a world
of competition

3156
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:58,640
of competition
 

3157
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,549
of competition
if interstellar colonization is possible

3158
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
if interstellar colonization is possible
 

3159
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,150
if interstellar colonization is possible
it will happen and then competition will

3160
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:02,160
it will happen and then competition will
 

3161
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,750
it will happen and then competition will
continue and that will sort of ensure

3162
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:03,760
continue and that will sort of ensure
 

3163
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:05,510
continue and that will sort of ensure
the continuation of competition into the

3164
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:05,520
the continuation of competition into the
 

3165
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,190
the continuation of competition into the
indefinite future

3166
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
indefinite future
 

3167
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,270
indefinite future
that's and competition

3168
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:09,280
that's and competition
 

3169
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,950
that's and competition
we don't know but competition could take

3170
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:10,960
we don't know but competition could take
 

3171
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,349
we don't know but competition could take
violent forms okay many productive forms

3172
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:13,359
violent forms okay many productive forms
 

3173
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:15,270
violent forms okay many productive forms
and the case i was going to make is that

3174
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:15,280
and the case i was going to make is that
 

3175
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,549
and the case i was going to make is that
i think one of the things that most

3176
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:16,559
i think one of the things that most
 

3177
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,789
i think one of the things that most
scares people about competition is not

3178
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
scares people about competition is not
 

3179
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,789
scares people about competition is not
just that it creates holocausts and

3180
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:20,799
just that it creates holocausts and
 

3181
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:24,230
just that it creates holocausts and
death on massive scales is that it's

3182
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
death on massive scales is that it's
 

3183
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,589
death on massive scales is that it's
likely to

3184
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:25,599
likely to
 

3185
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,750
likely to
change who we are and what we value yes

3186
00:55:29,750 --> 00:55:29,760
change who we are and what we value yes
 

3187
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:33,990
change who we are and what we value yes
so this is the other thing with power

3188
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,000
so this is the other thing with power
 

3189
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,589
so this is the other thing with power
as we grow

3190
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
as we grow
 

3191
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,430
as we grow
as human civilization grows becomes

3192
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
as human civilization grows becomes
 

3193
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,950
as human civilization grows becomes
multi-planetary

3194
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
multi-planetary
 

3195
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,430
multi-planetary
multi-solar system potentially

3196
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:41,440
multi-solar system potentially
 

3197
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,309
multi-solar system potentially
how does that change us do you think

3198
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:44,319
how does that change us do you think
 

3199
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:45,750
how does that change us do you think
i think the more you think about it the

3200
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
i think the more you think about it the
 

3201
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,150
i think the more you think about it the
more you realize it can change us a lot

3202
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:48,160
more you realize it can change us a lot
 

3203
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,309
more you realize it can change us a lot
so first of all this is pretty dark by

3204
00:55:50,309 --> 00:55:50,319
so first of all this is pretty dark by
 

3205
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:52,230
so first of all this is pretty dark by
the way well

3206
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:52,240
the way well
 

3207
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,430
the way well
it's just honest

3208
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:53,440
it's just honest
 

3209
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,950
it's just honest
right so i'm trying to do that but i

3210
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:54,960
right so i'm trying to do that but i
 

3211
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,069
right so i'm trying to do that but i
think the first thing you should say if

3212
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:56,079
think the first thing you should say if
 

3213
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:57,829
think the first thing you should say if
you look at history just human history

3214
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
you look at history just human history
 

3215
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:59,750
you look at history just human history
over the last ten thousand years

3216
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
over the last ten thousand years
 

3217
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,829
over the last ten thousand years
if you really understood what people

3218
00:56:01,829 --> 00:56:01,839
if you really understood what people
 

3219
00:56:01,839 --> 00:56:03,510
if you really understood what people
were like a long time ago you'd realize

3220
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:03,520
were like a long time ago you'd realize
 

3221
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,270
were like a long time ago you'd realize
they were really quite different

3222
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:05,280
they were really quite different
 

3223
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,789
they were really quite different
ancient cultures

3224
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
ancient cultures
 

3225
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,549
ancient cultures
created people who were really quite

3226
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:08,559
created people who were really quite
 

3227
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,069
created people who were really quite
different most historical fiction lies

3228
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
different most historical fiction lies
 

3229
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,589
different most historical fiction lies
to you about that

3230
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
to you about that
 

3231
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,750
to you about that
it often offers you modern characters in

3232
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
it often offers you modern characters in
 

3233
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,309
it often offers you modern characters in
an ancient world but if you actually

3234
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:16,319
an ancient world but if you actually
 

3235
00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:17,670
an ancient world but if you actually
study history you will see just how

3236
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:17,680
study history you will see just how
 

3237
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,030
study history you will see just how
different they were and how differently

3238
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:19,040
different they were and how differently
 

3239
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,549
different they were and how differently
they thought

3240
00:56:20,549 --> 00:56:20,559
they thought
 

3241
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,870
they thought
and that's they've changed a lot many

3242
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
and that's they've changed a lot many
 

3243
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,950
and that's they've changed a lot many
times and they've changed a lot across

3244
00:56:24,950 --> 00:56:24,960
times and they've changed a lot across
 

3245
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,390
times and they've changed a lot across
time so i think the most obvious

3246
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:26,400
time so i think the most obvious
 

3247
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,069
time so i think the most obvious
prediction about the future is

3248
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
prediction about the future is
 

3249
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,349
prediction about the future is
even if that you only have the

3250
00:56:29,349 --> 00:56:29,359
even if that you only have the
 

3251
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:30,870
even if that you only have the
mechanisms of change we've seen in the

3252
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
mechanisms of change we've seen in the
 

3253
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,549
mechanisms of change we've seen in the
past you should still expect a lot of

3254
00:56:32,549 --> 00:56:32,559
past you should still expect a lot of
 

3255
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:35,030
past you should still expect a lot of
change in the future but we have a lot

3256
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
change in the future but we have a lot
 

3257
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,549
change in the future but we have a lot
bigger mechanisms for change in the

3258
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
bigger mechanisms for change in the
 

3259
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,030
bigger mechanisms for change in the
future than we had in the past

3260
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:39,040
future than we had in the past
 

3261
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,630
future than we had in the past
so um

3262
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
so um
 

3263
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,470
so um
i have this book called the age of m

3264
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:42,480
i have this book called the age of m
 

3265
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,150
i have this book called the age of m
work love and life when robots rule the

3266
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
work love and life when robots rule the
 

3267
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,309
work love and life when robots rule the
earth and it's about what happens if

3268
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:46,319
earth and it's about what happens if
 

3269
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,309
earth and it's about what happens if
brain emulations become possible so a

3270
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:48,319
brain emulations become possible so a
 

3271
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:50,230
brain emulations become possible so a
brain emulation is where you take a

3272
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
brain emulation is where you take a
 

3273
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,150
brain emulation is where you take a
actual human brain and you scan it in

3274
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:52,160
actual human brain and you scan it in
 

3275
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,990
actual human brain and you scan it in
fine spatial and chemical detail to

3276
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:54,000
fine spatial and chemical detail to
 

3277
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,030
fine spatial and chemical detail to
create

3278
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
create
 

3279
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,430
create
a computer simulation of that brain

3280
00:56:57,430 --> 00:56:57,440
a computer simulation of that brain
 

3281
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,510
a computer simulation of that brain
and then those computer simulations of

3282
00:56:59,510 --> 00:56:59,520
and then those computer simulations of
 

3283
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,670
and then those computer simulations of
brains are basically citizens in a new

3284
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:01,680
brains are basically citizens in a new
 

3285
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:03,990
brains are basically citizens in a new
world they work and they vote and they

3286
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
world they work and they vote and they
 

3287
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,750
world they work and they vote and they
fall in love and they get mad and they

3288
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:05,760
fall in love and they get mad and they
 

3289
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,670
fall in love and they get mad and they
lie to each other and this is a whole

3290
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
lie to each other and this is a whole
 

3291
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,750
lie to each other and this is a whole
new world and my book is about analyzing

3292
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:09,760
new world and my book is about analyzing
 

3293
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,270
new world and my book is about analyzing
how that world is different than our

3294
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:11,280
how that world is different than our
 

3295
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,630
how that world is different than our
world

3296
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
world
 

3297
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,630
world
basically using competition as my key

3298
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
basically using competition as my key
 

3299
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,030
basically using competition as my key
lever of analysis that is if that world

3300
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:17,040
lever of analysis that is if that world
 

3301
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,630
lever of analysis that is if that world
remains competitive that i can figure

3302
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:18,640
remains competitive that i can figure
 

3303
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,630
remains competitive that i can figure
out how they change in that world what

3304
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
out how they change in that world what
 

3305
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,190
out how they change in that world what
they do differently than we do

3306
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
they do differently than we do
 

3307
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,670
they do differently than we do
and it's very different

3308
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
and it's very different
 

3309
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,349
and it's very different
and it's different in ways that are

3310
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:27,359
and it's different in ways that are
 

3311
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:29,589
and it's different in ways that are
shocking sometimes to many people

3312
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599
shocking sometimes to many people
 

3313
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,829
shocking sometimes to many people
in ways some people don't like i think

3314
00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:31,839
in ways some people don't like i think
 

3315
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:33,750
in ways some people don't like i think
it's an okay world but i have to admit

3316
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
it's an okay world but i have to admit
 

3317
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,990
it's an okay world but i have to admit
it's quite different and that's just

3318
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
it's quite different and that's just
 

3319
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,910
it's quite different and that's just
one technology

3320
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:37,920
one technology
 

3321
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,150
one technology
if we add you know dozens more

3322
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
if we add you know dozens more
 

3323
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,710
if we add you know dozens more
technologies changes into the future you

3324
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:42,720
technologies changes into the future you
 

3325
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,470
technologies changes into the future you
know we should just expect

3326
00:57:44,470 --> 00:57:44,480
know we should just expect
 

3327
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,470
know we should just expect
it's possible to become very different

3328
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:46,480
it's possible to become very different
 

3329
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,630
it's possible to become very different
than who we are i mean in the space of

3330
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:48,640
than who we are i mean in the space of
 

3331
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,789
than who we are i mean in the space of
all possible minds our minds are a

3332
00:57:50,789 --> 00:57:50,799
all possible minds our minds are a
 

3333
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,470
all possible minds our minds are a
particular architecture a particular

3334
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:52,480
particular architecture a particular
 

3335
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,190
particular architecture a particular
structure a particular set of habits and

3336
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:55,200
structure a particular set of habits and
 

3337
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:57,510
structure a particular set of habits and
they are only you know one piece in a

3338
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
they are only you know one piece in a
 

3339
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,589
they are only you know one piece in a
vast face of possibilities the space of

3340
00:57:59,589 --> 00:57:59,599
vast face of possibilities the space of
 

3341
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,829
vast face of possibilities the space of
possible minds is really huge

3342
00:58:01,829 --> 00:58:01,839
possible minds is really huge
 

3343
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:02,630
possible minds is really huge
so

3344
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
so
 

3345
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,789
so
yeah let's linger on the space of

3346
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
yeah let's linger on the space of
 

3347
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:07,190
yeah let's linger on the space of
possible minds for a moment

3348
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
possible minds for a moment
 

3349
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,510
possible minds for a moment
just to sort of humble ourselves

3350
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
just to sort of humble ourselves
 

3351
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,030
just to sort of humble ourselves
uh

3352
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
uh
 

3353
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,069
uh
how

3354
00:58:12,069 --> 00:58:12,079
how
 

3355
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:13,750
how
peculiar

3356
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:13,760
peculiar
 

3357
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:17,190
peculiar
our peculiarities are like the fact that

3358
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
our peculiarities are like the fact that
 

3359
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:20,789
our peculiarities are like the fact that
we like a particular kind of sex

3360
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:20,799
we like a particular kind of sex
 

3361
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:22,710
we like a particular kind of sex
and the fact that we eat food through

3362
00:58:22,710 --> 00:58:22,720
and the fact that we eat food through
 

3363
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,390
and the fact that we eat food through
one hole

3364
00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:24,400
one hole
 

3365
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,789
one hole
and poop through another hole

3366
00:58:26,789 --> 00:58:26,799
and poop through another hole
 

3367
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,390
and poop through another hole
and that seems to be a fundamental

3368
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
and that seems to be a fundamental
 

3369
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,069
and that seems to be a fundamental
aspect of life

3370
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
aspect of life
 

3371
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,950
aspect of life
is very important to us

3372
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:32,960
is very important to us
 

3373
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,150
is very important to us
uh and that life is finite in a certain

3374
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,160
uh and that life is finite in a certain
 

3375
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,710
uh and that life is finite in a certain
kind of way we have a meat vehicle

3376
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:38,720
kind of way we have a meat vehicle
 

3377
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,950
kind of way we have a meat vehicle
so death is very important to us i

3378
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
so death is very important to us i
 

3379
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,430
so death is very important to us i
wonder which aspects are fundamental or

3380
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
wonder which aspects are fundamental or
 

3381
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,030
wonder which aspects are fundamental or
would be common

3382
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
would be common
 

3383
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,710
would be common
throughout human history and also

3384
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:46,720
throughout human history and also
 

3385
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:49,109
throughout human history and also

life on earth
 

3389
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,589
life on earth
and

3390
00:58:51,589 --> 00:58:51,599
and
 

3391
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:53,190
and
throughout other kinds of lives like

3392
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:53,200
throughout other kinds of lives like
 

3393
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,309
throughout other kinds of lives like
what is

3394
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
what is
 

3395
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,069
what is
really useful you mentioned competition

3396
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
really useful you mentioned competition
 

3397
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,309
really useful you mentioned competition
seems to be a one fundamental i've tried

3398
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:58,319
seems to be a one fundamental i've tried
 

3399
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,630
seems to be a one fundamental i've tried
to do analysis of

3400
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:00,640
to do analysis of
 

3401
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,390
to do analysis of
where our distant descendants might go

3402
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:02,400
where our distant descendants might go
 

3403
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,150
where our distant descendants might go
in terms of what are robust features we

3404
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:04,160
in terms of what are robust features we
 

3405
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,750
in terms of what are robust features we
could predict about our descendants is

3406
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:05,760
could predict about our descendants is
 

3407
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,829
could predict about our descendants is
that so again i have this analysis of

3408
00:59:07,829 --> 00:59:07,839
that so again i have this analysis of
 

3409
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:09,829
that so again i have this analysis of
sort of the next generation af so the

3410
00:59:09,829 --> 00:59:09,839
sort of the next generation af so the
 

3411
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:11,670
sort of the next generation af so the
next era after ours that if you think of

3412
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:11,680
next era after ours that if you think of
 

3413
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,829
next era after ours that if you think of
human history as having three eras so

3414
00:59:13,829 --> 00:59:13,839
human history as having three eras so
 

3415
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:15,829
human history as having three eras so
far right there was the forager error

3416
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:15,839
far right there was the forager error
 

3417
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,390
far right there was the forager error
the farmer and the industry are then my

3418
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:18,400
the farmer and the industry are then my
 

3419
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,150
the farmer and the industry are then my
attempt and age of m is to analyze the

3420
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
attempt and age of m is to analyze the
 

3421
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,829
attempt and age of m is to analyze the
next error after that and it's very

3422
00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
next error after that and it's very
 

3423
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,510
next error after that and it's very
different but of course there could be

3424
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:23,520
different but of course there could be
 

3425
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,069
different but of course there could be
more and more errors after that so

3426
00:59:26,069 --> 00:59:26,079
more and more errors after that so
 

3427
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:27,750
more and more errors after that so
you know analyzing a particular scenario

3428
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:27,760
you know analyzing a particular scenario
 

3429
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,270
you know analyzing a particular scenario
and thinking it through is one way to

3430
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:29,280
and thinking it through is one way to
 

3431
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,190
and thinking it through is one way to
try to see how different the future

3432
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:31,200
try to see how different the future
 

3433
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,109
try to see how different the future
could be but that doesn't give you some

3434
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
could be but that doesn't give you some
 

3435
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,150
could be but that doesn't give you some
sort of like sense of what's typical

3436
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:36,160
sort of like sense of what's typical
 

3437
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,990
sort of like sense of what's typical
but i have tried to analyze what's

3438
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
but i have tried to analyze what's
 

3439
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,030
but i have tried to analyze what's
typical

3440
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
typical
 

3441
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,349
typical
and so i have two predictions i think i

3442
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
and so i have two predictions i think i
 

3443
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,990
and so i have two predictions i think i
can make pretty solidly

3444
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:44,000
can make pretty solidly
 

3445
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,670
can make pretty solidly
one thing is that we know at the moment

3446
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:45,680
one thing is that we know at the moment
 

3447
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:49,030
one thing is that we know at the moment
that humans discount the future rapidly

3448
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:49,040
that humans discount the future rapidly
 

3449
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,910
that humans discount the future rapidly
so uh we discount the future in terms of

3450
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
so uh we discount the future in terms of
 

3451
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,510
so uh we discount the future in terms of
caring about consequences roughly a

3452
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
caring about consequences roughly a
 

3453
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,430
caring about consequences roughly a
factor of two per generation and there's

3454
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
factor of two per generation and there's
 

3455
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,470
factor of two per generation and there's
a solid evolutionary analysis why sexual

3456
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:58,480
a solid evolutionary analysis why sexual
 

3457
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,910
a solid evolutionary analysis why sexual
creatures would do that because

3458
00:59:59,910 --> 00:59:59,920
creatures would do that because
 

3459
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,910
creatures would do that because
basically your descendants only share

3460
01:00:01,910 --> 01:00:01,920
basically your descendants only share
 

3461
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,750
basically your descendants only share
half of your genes and your descendants

3462
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:03,760
half of your genes and your descendants
 

3463
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:06,069
half of your genes and your descendants
your generation away so we only care of

3464
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
your generation away so we only care of
 

3465
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,990
your generation away so we only care of
our grandchildren

3466
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,000
our grandchildren
 

3467
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,470
our grandchildren
you know basically that a factor of four

3468
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:10,480
you know basically that a factor of four
 

3469
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,950
you know basically that a factor of four
later yeah uh because you know it's

3470
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,960
later yeah uh because you know it's
 

3471
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,270
later yeah uh because you know it's
later so this actually explains typical

3472
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:15,280
later so this actually explains typical
 

3473
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,030
later so this actually explains typical
interest rates in the economy that is

3474
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
interest rates in the economy that is
 

3475
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,349
interest rates in the economy that is
interest rates are greatly influenced by

3476
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
interest rates are greatly influenced by
 

3477
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:21,750
interest rates are greatly influenced by
our discount rates and uh we basically

3478
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:21,760
our discount rates and uh we basically
 

3479
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,349
our discount rates and uh we basically
discount the future by a factor of two

3480
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:23,359
discount the future by a factor of two
 

3481
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:24,950
discount the future by a factor of two
per generation

3482
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
per generation
 

3483
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:25,910
per generation
um

3484
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
um
 

3485
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:29,270
um
but that's a side effect of the way

3486
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
but that's a side effect of the way
 

3487
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,910
but that's a side effect of the way
our preferences evolved as sexually

3488
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
our preferences evolved as sexually
 

3489
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,510
our preferences evolved as sexually
selected creatures

3490
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:33,520
selected creatures
 

3491
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,750
selected creatures
we should expect that in the longer run

3492
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:35,760
we should expect that in the longer run
 

3493
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,829
we should expect that in the longer run
creatures will evolve who don't discount

3494
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
creatures will evolve who don't discount

01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,109
creatures will evolve who don't discount
the future

3496
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:39,119
the future
 

3497
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:41,589
the future
they will care about the long run and

3498
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:41,599
they will care about the long run and
 

3499
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:43,109
they will care about the long run and
they will therefore not neglect the

3500
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:43,119
they will therefore not neglect the
 

3501
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:44,390
they will therefore not neglect the
wrong so for example for things like

3502
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,400
wrong so for example for things like
 

3503
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,069
wrong so for example for things like
global warming or things like you know

3504
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
global warming or things like you know
 

3505
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:49,030
global warming or things like you know
that at the moment many commenters are

3506
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:49,040
that at the moment many commenters are
 

3507
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:50,549
that at the moment many commenters are
sad that basically ordinary people don't

3508
01:00:50,549 --> 01:00:50,559
sad that basically ordinary people don't
 

3509
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,230
sad that basically ordinary people don't
seem to care much market prices don't

3510
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
seem to care much market prices don't
 

3511
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,150
seem to care much market prices don't
seem to care a bunch in ordinary people

3512
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:54,160
seem to care a bunch in ordinary people
 

3513
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,510
seem to care a bunch in ordinary people
it doesn't really impact them much

3514
01:00:55,510 --> 01:00:55,520
it doesn't really impact them much
 

3515
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:56,390
it doesn't really impact them much
because

3516
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:56,400
because
 

3517
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,430
because
humans don't care much about the

3518
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:57,440
humans don't care much about the
 

3519
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,270
humans don't care much about the
long-term future

3520
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,280
long-term future
 

3521
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,390
long-term future
but

3522
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
but
 

3523
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,270
but
and

3524
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
and
 

3525
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,870
and
futurists find it hard to motivate

3526
01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:02,880
futurists find it hard to motivate
 

3527
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,309
futurists find it hard to motivate
people and to engage people about the

3528
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:04,319
people and to engage people about the
 

3529
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,150
people and to engage people about the
long-term future because they just don't

3530
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:06,160
long-term future because they just don't
 

3531
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,390
long-term future because they just don't
care that much but that's a side effect

3532
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:08,400
care that much but that's a side effect
 

3533
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:10,390
care that much but that's a side effect
of this particular way that our

3534
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:10,400
of this particular way that our
 

3535
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,390
of this particular way that our
you know preferences evolved about the

3536
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
you know preferences evolved about the
 

3537
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,230
you know preferences evolved about the
future and so in the future they will

3538
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:14,240
future and so in the future they will
 

3539
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,230
future and so in the future they will
neglect the future less and that's an

3540
01:01:16,230 --> 01:01:16,240
neglect the future less and that's an
 

3541
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,750
neglect the future less and that's an
interesting thing that will that we can

3542
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:17,760
interesting thing that will that we can
 

3543
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,069
interesting thing that will that we can
predict robustly eventually you know

3544
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
predict robustly eventually you know
 

3545
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,309
predict robustly eventually you know
maybe a few centuries maybe longer

3546
01:01:22,309 --> 01:01:22,319
maybe a few centuries maybe longer
 

3547
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,710
maybe a few centuries maybe longer
eventually our descendants will

3548
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:24,720
eventually our descendants will
 

3549
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,630
eventually our descendants will
care about the future can you speak to

3550
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:26,640
care about the future can you speak to
 

3551
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,030
care about the future can you speak to
the intuition behind that is it

3552
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:29,040
the intuition behind that is it
 

3553
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,190
the intuition behind that is it
is it useful to think more about the

3554
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
is it useful to think more about the
 

3555
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,150
is it useful to think more about the
future

3556
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
future
 

3557
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,030
future
right if evolution rewards creatures for

3558
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:35,040
right if evolution rewards creatures for
 

3559
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:36,950
right if evolution rewards creatures for
having many descendants

3560
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:36,960
having many descendants
 

3561
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,109
having many descendants
then uh if you have decisions that

3562
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
then uh if you have decisions that
 

3563
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,430
then uh if you have decisions that
influence how many descendants you have

3564
01:01:41,430 --> 01:01:41,440
influence how many descendants you have
 

3565
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,870
influence how many descendants you have
then that would be good if you made

3566
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:42,880
then that would be good if you made
 

3567
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,390
then that would be good if you made
those decisions but in order to do that

3568
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:44,400
those decisions but in order to do that
 

3569
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,829
those decisions but in order to do that
you'll have to care about them you'll

3570
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
you'll have to care about them you'll
 

3571
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,750
you'll have to care about them you'll
have to care about that future so to

3572
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:47,760
have to care about that future so to
 

3573
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,349
have to care about that future so to
push back

3574
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:49,359
push back
 

3575
01:01:49,359 --> 01:01:50,870
push back
if that's if you're trying to maximize

3576
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
if that's if you're trying to maximize
 

3577
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,789
if that's if you're trying to maximize
the number of descendants but

3578
01:01:52,789 --> 01:01:52,799
the number of descendants but
 

3579
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:54,549
the number of descendants but
the nice thing about not caring too much

3580
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:54,559
the nice thing about not caring too much
 

3581
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,710
the nice thing about not caring too much
about the long-term future is you're

3582
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
about the long-term future is you're
 

3583
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,190
about the long-term future is you're
more likely to take big risks or you're

3584
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
more likely to take big risks or you're
 

3585
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,270
more likely to take big risks or you're
you're less risk-averse and it's

3586
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
you're less risk-averse and it's
 

3587
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:02,789
you're less risk-averse and it's
possible that

3588
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
possible that
 

3589
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:03,589
possible that
the

3590
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
the
 

3591
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,230
the
both evolution and just life in this in

3592
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
both evolution and just life in this in
 

3593
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:09,270
both evolution and just life in this in
in the universe is rewarded

3594
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
in the universe is rewarded
 

3595
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,349
in the universe is rewarded
rewards the risk takers

3596
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
rewards the risk takers
 

3597
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,349
rewards the risk takers
well we actually have analysis of the

3598
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:13,359
well we actually have analysis of the
 

3599
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:15,510
well we actually have analysis of the
ideal risk preferences

3600
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
ideal risk preferences
 

3601
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,630
ideal risk preferences
too so there's a literature on ideal

3602
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
too so there's a literature on ideal
 

3603
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,390
too so there's a literature on ideal
preferences that evolution should

3604
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:20,400
preferences that evolution should
 

3605
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,349
preferences that evolution should
promote

3606
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:21,359
promote
 

3607
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:23,109
promote
and for example there's a literature on

3608
01:02:23,109 --> 01:02:23,119
and for example there's a literature on
 

3609
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:25,029
and for example there's a literature on
competing investment funds and what the

3610
01:02:25,029 --> 01:02:25,039
competing investment funds and what the
 

3611
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:26,950
competing investment funds and what the
managers of those funds should care

3612
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:26,960
managers of those funds should care
 

3613
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,549
managers of those funds should care
about in terms of risk various kinds of

3614
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
about in terms of risk various kinds of
 

3615
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:29,510
about in terms of risk various kinds of
risks

3616
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
risks
 

3617
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,069
risks
and in terms of discounting and so

3618
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:32,079
and in terms of discounting and so
 

3619
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:33,430
and in terms of discounting and so
managers of investment funds should

3620
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:33,440
managers of investment funds should
 

3621
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,109
managers of investment funds should
basically have

3622
01:02:35,109 --> 01:02:35,119
basically have
 

3623
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:36,630
basically have

uncorrelated risk so um

3634
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:47,599
uncorrelated risk so um
 

3635
01:02:47,599 --> 01:02:49,990
uncorrelated risk so um
that's a feature that's predicted to

3636
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:50,000
that's a feature that's predicted to
 

3637
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,990
that's a feature that's predicted to
happen about individual

3638
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000

personal choices in biology
 

3641
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,510
personal choices in biology
and also for investment funds so that's

3642
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
and also for investment funds so that's
 

3643
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,789
and also for investment funds so that's
other things that's also something we

3644
01:02:56,789 --> 01:02:56,799
other things that's also something we
 

3645
01:02:56,799 --> 01:02:58,390
other things that's also something we
can say about the long run what

3646
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400
can say about the long run what
 

3647
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,829
can say about the long run what
correlated and uncorrelated

correlated and uncorrelated
 

3649

correlated and uncorrelated
risk if there's something that would

3650
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:03,039
risk if there's something that would
 

3651
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,470
risk if there's something that would
affect all of your descendants

3652
01:03:06,470 --> 01:03:06,480
affect all of your descendants
 

3653
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,270
affect all of your descendants
then

3654
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
then
 

3655
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,109
then
if you take that risk you might have

3656
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:09,119
if you take that risk you might have
 

3657
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:11,430
if you take that risk you might have
more descendants but you might have zero

3658
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:11,440
more descendants but you might have zero
 

3659
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,309
more descendants but you might have zero
and that's just really bad to have zero

3660
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
and that's just really bad to have zero
 

3661
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,069
and that's just really bad to have zero
descendants but an uncorrelated risk

3662
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
descendants but an uncorrelated risk
 

3663
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,510
descendants but an uncorrelated risk
would be a risk that some of your

3664
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
would be a risk that some of your
 

3665
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,870
would be a risk that some of your
descendants would suffer but others

3666
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
descendants would suffer but others
 

3667
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,270
descendants would suffer but others
wouldn't and then you have a portfolio

3668
01:03:21,270 --> 01:03:21,280
wouldn't and then you have a portfolio
 

3669
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:22,870
wouldn't and then you have a portfolio
of descendants and so

3670
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:22,880
of descendants and so
 

3671
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,349
of descendants and so
that portfolio insures you against

3672
01:03:25,349 --> 01:03:25,359
that portfolio insures you against
 

3673
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:26,789
that portfolio insures you against
problems with any one of them i like the

3674
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
problems with any one of them i like the
 

3675
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,870
problems with any one of them i like the
idea of portfolio descendants and we'll

3676
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
idea of portfolio descendants and we'll
 

3677
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,950
idea of portfolio descendants and we'll
talk about portfolios with with your

3678
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:30,960
talk about portfolios with with your
 

3679
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,870
talk about portfolios with with your
idea of you briefly mentioned will

3680
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:32,880
idea of you briefly mentioned will
 

3681
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:36,549
idea of you briefly mentioned will
return there with m e m the age of em

3693
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,069
i'm short for emulations and it's kind
of an idea of how we might

3694
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
of an idea of how we might
 

3695
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:52,150
of an idea of how we might
create artificial minds artificial

3696
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:52,160
create artificial minds artificial
 

3697
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,150
create artificial minds artificial

3705
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:03,430
prediction i can make about long-term
preschools yes which is at the moment we

3706
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:03,440
preschools yes which is at the moment we
 

3707
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:06,069
preschools yes which is at the moment we
reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge

3708
01:04:06,069 --> 01:04:06,079
reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge
 

3709
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:07,990
reproduce as the result of a hodgepodge
of preferences that aren't very well

3710
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
of preferences that aren't very well
 

3711
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,390
of preferences that aren't very well
integrated but sort of in our ancestral

3712
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
integrated but sort of in our ancestral
 

3713
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,390
integrated but sort of in our ancestral
environment induced us to reproduce so

3714
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400
environment induced us to reproduce so
 

3715
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,230
environment induced us to reproduce so
we have preferences over being you know

3716
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
we have preferences over being you know
 

3717
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,470
we have preferences over being you know
sleepy and hungry and thirsty and

3718
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:16,480
sleepy and hungry and thirsty and
 

3719
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:18,630
sleepy and hungry and thirsty and
wanting to have sex and wanting to you

3720
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:18,640
wanting to have sex and wanting to you
 

3721
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,029
wanting to have sex and wanting to you
know be excitement et cetera right yeah

3722
01:04:21,029 --> 01:04:21,039
know be excitement et cetera right yeah
 

3723
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:23,109
know be excitement et cetera right yeah
and so in our ancestral environment the

3724
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:23,119
and so in our ancestral environment the
 

3725
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,789
and so in our ancestral environment the
packages of preferences that we evolved

3726
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:24,799
packages of preferences that we evolved
 

3727
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,990
packages of preferences that we evolved
to have did induce us to have

3728
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
to have did induce us to have
 

3729
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,029
to have did induce us to have
more descendants that's why we're here

3730
01:04:31,029 --> 01:04:31,039
more descendants that's why we're here
 

3731
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:31,910
more descendants that's why we're here
but

3732
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
but
 

3733
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,990
but
those packages of preferences are not a

3734
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:34,000
those packages of preferences are not a
 

3735
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,829
those packages of preferences are not a
robust way to promote having more

3736
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
robust way to promote having more
 

3737
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:38,309
robust way to promote having more
descendants they they were tied to our

3738
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
descendants they they were tied to our
 

3739
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,750
descendants they they were tied to our
ancestral environment which is no longer

3740
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
ancestral environment which is no longer
 

3741
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,029
ancestral environment which is no longer
true so that's one of the reasons we are

3742
01:04:41,029 --> 01:04:41,039
true so that's one of the reasons we are
 

3743
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,589
true so that's one of the reasons we are
now having a big fertility decline

3744
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:43,599
now having a big fertility decline
 

3745
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,510
now having a big fertility decline
because in our current environment our

3746
01:04:45,510 --> 01:04:45,520
because in our current environment our
 

3747
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,430
because in our current environment our
ancestral preferences are not inducing

3748
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
ancestral preferences are not inducing
 

3749
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:49,510
ancestral preferences are not inducing
us to have a lot of kids which is from

3750
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
us to have a lot of kids which is from
 

3751
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:52,309
us to have a lot of kids which is from
evolution's point of view a big mistake

3752
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
evolution's point of view a big mistake
 

3753
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:54,870
evolution's point of view a big mistake
we can predict that in the longer run

3754
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
we can predict that in the longer run
 

3755
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,190
we can predict that in the longer run
there will arise creatures who just

3756
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
there will arise creatures who just
 

3757
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,270
there will arise creatures who just
abstractly know that what they want is

3758
01:04:59,270 --> 01:04:59,280
abstractly know that what they want is
 

3759
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:00,789
abstractly know that what they want is
more descendants

3760
01:05:00,789 --> 01:05:00,799
more descendants
 

3761
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,270
more descendants
that's that's a very robust way to have

3762
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:03,280
that's that's a very robust way to have
 

3763
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:05,029
that's that's a very robust way to have
more descendants is to have that as your

3764
01:05:05,029 --> 01:05:05,039
more descendants is to have that as your
 

3765
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,710
more descendants is to have that as your
direct preference first of all your

3766
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
direct preference first of all your
 

3767
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,589
direct preference first of all your
thicket is so clear i love it so

3768
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
thicket is so clear i love it so
 

3769
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:12,549
thicket is so clear i love it so
mathematical and thank you

3770
01:05:12,549 --> 01:05:12,559
mathematical and thank you
 

3771
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:13,430
mathematical and thank you
for

3772
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:13,440
for
 

3773
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,029
for
for thinking so clearly with me and

3774
01:05:15,029 --> 01:05:15,039
for thinking so clearly with me and
 

3775
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,510
for thinking so clearly with me and
bearing with my interruptions and

3776
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
bearing with my interruptions and
 

3777
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,270
bearing with my interruptions and
and going on the tangents when we go

3778
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
and going on the tangents when we go
 

3779
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,549
and going on the tangents when we go
there

3780
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
there
 

3781
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:23,029
there
so you're just clearly saying that

3782
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:23,039
so you're just clearly saying that
 

3783
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:25,190
so you're just clearly saying that
successful long-term

3785
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,829
successful long-term

more descendants not just prefer

01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
more descendants not just prefer
 

3791
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,589
more descendants not just prefer
consciously and abstractly prefer that

is it won't be indirect consequence of
 

3795
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,150
is it won't be indirect consequence of
other preferences it will just be the

3796
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:38,160
other preferences it will just be the
 

3797
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,270
other preferences it will just be the
thing they

3798
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:39,280
thing they
 

3799
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,190
thing they
know they want there will be a president

3800
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:41,200
know they want there will be a president
 

3801
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,270
know they want there will be a president
in the future that says we must have

3802
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:43,280
in the future that says we must have
 

3803
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,630
in the future that says we must have
more sex

3804
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:44,640
more sex
 

3805
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,150
more sex
we must have more descendants than do

3806
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:46,160
we must have more descendants than do
 

3807
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,789
we must have more descendants than do
whatever it takes to do that whatever

whatever it takes to do that whatever
 

3809
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:50,710
whatever it takes to do that whatever
we must go to the moon and do the other

3810
01:05:50,710 --> 01:05:50,720
we must go to the moon and do the other
 

3811
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,630
we must go to the moon and do the other
things right not because they're easy

3812
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
things right not because they're easy
 

3813
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,069
things right not because they're easy
but because they're hard but instead of

3814
01:05:54,069 --> 01:05:54,079
but because they're hard but instead of
 

3815
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:56,150
but because they're hard but instead of
the moon let's have lots of sex okay but

3816
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:56,160
the moon let's have lots of sex okay but
 

3817
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,349
the moon let's have lots of sex okay but
there's a lot of ways to have

3818
01:05:57,349 --> 01:05:57,359
there's a lot of ways to have
 

3819
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,870
there's a lot of ways to have
descendants right

3820
01:05:58,870 --> 01:05:58,880
descendants right
 

3821
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:00,630
descendants right
right but so that's the whole point when

3822
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:00,640
right but so that's the whole point when
 

3823
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:02,069
right but so that's the whole point when
the world gets more complicated and

3824
01:06:02,069 --> 01:06:02,079
the world gets more complicated and
 

3825
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,910
the world gets more complicated and
there are many possible strategies it's

3826
01:06:03,910 --> 01:06:03,920
there are many possible strategies it's
 

3827
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,589
there are many possible strategies it's
having that as your abstract preference

3828
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
having that as your abstract preference
 

3829
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,510
having that as your abstract preference
that will enforce you to think through

3830
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
that will enforce you to think through
 

3831
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:08,870
that will enforce you to think through
those possibilities and pick the one

3832
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
those possibilities and pick the one
 

3833
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,109
those possibilities and pick the one
that's most effective so just to clarify

3834
01:06:11,109 --> 01:06:11,119
that's most effective so just to clarify
 

3835
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:12,470
that's most effective so just to clarify

descendants
 

3837
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,230
descendants
doesn't necessarily mean

3838
01:06:14,230 --> 01:06:14,240
doesn't necessarily mean
 

3839
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:16,069
doesn't necessarily mean
the narrow definition of descendants

3840
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
the narrow definition of descendants
 

3841
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:17,750
the narrow definition of descendants
meaning humans having sex and then

3842
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:17,760
meaning humans having sex and then
 

3843
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,349
meaning humans having sex and then
having babies exactly you can have

3844
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:19,359
having babies exactly you can have
 

3845
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,230
having babies exactly you can have
artificial intelligence systems yes that

3846
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,240
artificial intelligence systems yes that
 

3847
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:25,430
artificial intelligence systems yes that
uh would in whom you instill

3848
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:25,440
uh would in whom you instill
 

3849
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,750
uh would in whom you instill
some capability of cognition and perhaps

3850
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:27,760
some capability of cognition and perhaps
 

3851
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,990
some capability of cognition and perhaps
even consciousness you can also create

3852
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:30,000
even consciousness you can also create
 

3853
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,069
even consciousness you can also create
their genetics and biology clones of

01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
their genetics and biology clones of
 

3855
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,589
their genetics and biology clones of
yourself or um slightly modified clones

3856
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:35,599
yourself or um slightly modified clones
 

3857
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:38,870
yourself or um slightly modified clones
thousands of them right um so so all

3858
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:38,880
thousands of them right um so so all
 

3859
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,870
thousands of them right um so so all
kinds of descendants it could be exactly

3860
01:06:40,870 --> 01:06:40,880
kinds of descendants it could be exactly
 

3861
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,190
kinds of descendants it could be exactly
descendants in the space of ideas too

3862
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:43,200
descendants in the space of ideas too
 

3863
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,510
descendants in the space of ideas too
for somehow we no longer exist in this

3864
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
for somehow we no longer exist in this
 

3865
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:48,230
for somehow we no longer exist in this
meat vehicle it's now just like

3866
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:48,240
meat vehicle it's now just like
 

3867
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,710
meat vehicle it's now just like
uh whatever the definition of a life

3868
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:50,720
uh whatever the definition of a life
 

3869
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:53,029
uh whatever the definition of a life
form is you have descendants of those

3870
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:53,039
form is you have descendants of those
 

3871
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:54,309
form is you have descendants of those
life forms

3872
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:54,319
life forms
 

3873
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:56,309
life forms
yes and they will be thoughtful about

3874
01:06:56,309 --> 01:06:56,319
yes and they will be thoughtful about
 

3875
01:06:56,319 --> 01:06:58,230
yes and they will be thoughtful about
that they will have thought about what

3876
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:58,240
that they will have thought about what
 

3877
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,390
that they will have thought about what
counts as a descendant and that'll be

3878
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:00,400
counts as a descendant and that'll be
 

3879
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:01,750
counts as a descendant and that'll be
important to them to have the right

3880
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:01,760
important to them to have the right
 

3881
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,309
important to them to have the right
concept so the they there is very is

3882
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:04,319
concept so the they there is very is
 

3883
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:06,069
concept so the they there is very is
very interesting who this they are but

3884
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
very interesting who this they are but
 

3885
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,510
very interesting who this they are but
the key thing is we're making

3886
01:07:07,510 --> 01:07:07,520
the key thing is we're making
 

3887
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,029
the key thing is we're making
predictions that i think are somewhat

3888
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039

3889
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,630
predictions that i think are somewhat
robust about what our distant

3890
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:10,640
robust about what our distant

01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,230
robust about what our distant
descendants will be like another thing i

3892
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240

think you would automatically accept is

3894
01:07:13,990 --> 01:07:14,000
think you would automatically accept is

they will almost entirely be artificial

3896
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
they will almost entirely be artificial
 

3897
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,510
they will almost entirely be artificial
and i think that would be the obvious

3898
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:17,520
and i think that would be the obvious
 

3899
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,029
and i think that would be the obvious
prediction about any aliens we would

3900
01:07:19,029 --> 01:07:19,039
prediction about any aliens we would
 

3901
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:20,630
prediction about any aliens we would
meet that is they would long since have

3902
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
meet that is they would long since have
 

3903
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,910
meet that is they would long since have
given up

3904
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:21,920
given up
 

3905
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,069

01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,470
you know reproducing biologically
well it's all it's like uh organic or

3908
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
well it's all it's like uh organic or
 

3909
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,950
well it's all it's like uh organic or
something it's all right it might be

3910
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:28,960
something it's all right it might be
 

3911
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,349
something it's all right it might be
squishy and made out of hydrocarbons but

3912
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,359
squishy and made out of hydrocarbons but
 

3913
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:32,789
squishy and made out of hydrocarbons but
it would be artificial in the sense of

3914
01:07:32,789 --> 01:07:32,799
it would be artificial in the sense of
 

3915
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:35,190
it would be artificial in the sense of

01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:35,200
made in factories with designs on cad
 

3917
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,710
made in factories with designs on cad
things right factories with scale

3918
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
things right factories with scale
 

3919
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,390
things right factories with scale
economy so the factories we have made on

3920
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:38,400
economy so the factories we have made on
 

3921
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:40,390
economy so the factories we have made on
earth today have much larger scale

3922
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
earth today have much larger scale
 

3923
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,670
earth today have much larger scale
economies than the factories in our

3924
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
economies than the factories in our
 

3925
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,670
economies than the factories in our
cells so the factories in our cells are

3926
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:43,680
cells so the factories in our cells are
 

3927
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,589
cells so the factories in our cells are
there are marvels but they don't achieve

3928
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:45,599
there are marvels but they don't achieve
 

3929
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,190
there are marvels but they don't achieve
very many scaly times they're tiny

3930
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
very many scaly times they're tiny
 

3931
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,390
very many scaly times they're tiny
little factories but they're all

3932
01:07:48,390 --> 01:07:48,400
little factories but they're all
 

3933
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,230
little factories but they're all
factories yes factors on top of

3934
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240
factories yes factors on top of
 

3935
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:52,630
factories yes factors on top of
factories so everything uh the the

3936
01:07:52,630 --> 01:07:52,640
factories so everything uh the the
 

3937
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,829
factories so everything uh the the
factors and the factories that are

3938
01:07:53,829 --> 01:07:53,839
factors and the factories that are
 

3939
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:55,430
factors and the factories that are
designed is different than sort of the

3940
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
designed is different than sort of the
 

3941
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,910

i think the nature of the word design is

3944
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:00,240
i think the nature of the word design is
 

3945
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,470
i think the nature of the word design is
very interesting uh to uncover there but

01:08:02,470 --> 01:08:02,480
very interesting uh to uncover there but

01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,069
very interesting uh to uncover there but

those
aliens would be

3980
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
aliens would be
 

3981
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,709
aliens would be
like certain particular qualities so uh

3982
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:44,719
like certain particular qualities so uh

aliens evolved from biological species

3986
01:08:49,510 --> 01:08:49,520
aliens evolved from biological species
 

3987
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,189
aliens evolved from biological species
with two main genders and uh

3988
01:08:53,189 --> 01:08:53,199
with two main genders and uh
 

3989
01:08:53,199 --> 01:08:55,749
with two main genders and uh
you know the the popular vote is above

3990
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
you know the the popular vote is above
 

3991
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,990
you know the the popular vote is above
80 percent so most of them have two

3992
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
80 percent so most of them have two
 

3993
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,510
80 percent so most of them have two
genders what do you think about that

3994
01:08:59,510 --> 01:08:59,520
genders what do you think about that
 

3995
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,789
genders what do you think about that
i'll ask you about some of these because

3996
01:09:00,789 --> 01:09:00,799
i'll ask you about some of these because
 

3997
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,749
i'll ask you about some of these because
it's so interesting it's such an

3998
01:09:01,749 --> 01:09:01,759
it's so interesting it's such an
 

3999
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:03,189
it's so interesting it's such an
interesting question it is a fun set of

4000
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
interesting question it is a fun set of
 

4001
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:04,789
interesting question it is a fun set of
questions yes like one set of questions

4002
01:09:04,789 --> 01:09:04,799
questions yes like one set of questions
 

4003
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:06,470
questions yes like one set of questions
so the genders as we look through

4004
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
so the genders as we look through
 

4005
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,470
so the genders as we look through
evolutionary history uh what's the

4006
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:08,480
evolutionary history uh what's the
 

4007
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,229
evolutionary history uh what's the
usefulness of that as opposed to having

4008
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
usefulness of that as opposed to having
 

4009
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,990
usefulness of that as opposed to having
just one or

4010
01:09:11,990 --> 01:09:12,000
just one or
 

4011
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,510
just one or
like millions

4012
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:13,520
like millions
 

4013
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,749
like millions
so there's a question in evolution of

4014
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:15,759
so there's a question in evolution of
 

4015
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,990
so there's a question in evolution of
life on earth there are very few species

4016
01:09:17,990 --> 01:09:18,000
life on earth there are very few species
 

4017
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,749
life on earth there are very few species
that have more than two genders there

4018
01:09:19,749 --> 01:09:19,759
that have more than two genders there
 

4019
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:21,269
that have more than two genders there
are some but there are they aren't very

4020
01:09:21,269 --> 01:09:21,279
are some but there are they aren't very
 

4021
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,149
are some but there are they aren't very
many

4022
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:22,159
many
 

4023
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,590
many
but there's an enormous number of

4024
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:23,600
but there's an enormous number of
 

4025
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,510
but there's an enormous number of
species that do have two genders much

4026
01:09:25,510 --> 01:09:25,520
species that do have two genders much
 

4027
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,870
species that do have two genders much
more than one

4028
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
more than one
 

4029
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,110
more than one
and so there's a literature on

4030
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
and so there's a literature on
 

4031
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,990
and so there's a literature on
why did multiple genders evolve and

4032
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:32,000
why did multiple genders evolve and
 

4033
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,749
why did multiple genders evolve and
that's sort of what's the point of

4034
01:09:33,749 --> 01:09:33,759
that's sort of what's the point of
 

4035
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:35,349
that's sort of what's the point of
having males and females versus

4036
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:35,359
having males and females versus
 

4037
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:38,309
having males and females versus
hermaphrodites um so most plants are

4038
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
hermaphrodites um so most plants are
 

4039
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,910
hermaphrodites um so most plants are
mapredice that is they have

4040
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:39,920
mapredice that is they have
 

4041
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,709
mapredice that is they have
there they they would mate male female

4042
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
there they they would mate male female
 

4043
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,749
there they they would mate male female
but each plant can be either role

4044
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
but each plant can be either role
 

4045
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,149
but each plant can be either role
and then most animals have chosen to

4046
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
and then most animals have chosen to
 

4047
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,470
and then most animals have chosen to
split into males and females

4048
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
split into males and females
 

4049
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,229
split into males and females
and then they're differentiating the two

4050
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
and then they're differentiating the two
 

4051
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,070
and then they're differentiating the two
genders and you know there's an

4052
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
genders and you know there's an
 

4053
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,830
genders and you know there's an
interesting set of questions about why

4054
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:55,840
interesting set of questions about why
 

4055
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:56,870
interesting set of questions about why
that happens because you can do

4056
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:56,880
that happens because you can do
 

4057
01:09:56,880 --> 01:09:58,630
that happens because you can do
selection

4058
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
selection
 

4059
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,870
selection
you basically have um

4060
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
you basically have um
 

4061
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:03,430
you basically have um
like one gender competes for for the

4062
01:10:03,430 --> 01:10:03,440
like one gender competes for for the
 

4063
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,750
like one gender competes for for the
affection of other and there's sexual

4064
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
affection of other and there's sexual
 

4065
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,510
affection of other and there's sexual
partnership that creates the offspring

4066
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:07,520
partnership that creates the offspring
 

4067
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,270
partnership that creates the offspring
so there's sexual selection it's nice to

4068
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:09,280
so there's sexual selection it's nice to
 

4069
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:10,070
so there's sexual selection it's nice to
have

4070
01:10:10,070 --> 01:10:10,080
have
 

4071
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:11,669
have
a like a

4072
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:11,679
a like a
 

4073
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:13,189
a like a
to a party it's nice to have dance

4074
01:10:13,189 --> 01:10:13,199
to a party it's nice to have dance
 

4075
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:15,350
to a party it's nice to have dance
partners and then you get each one get

4076
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
partners and then you get each one get
 

4077
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,310
partners and then you get each one get
to choose based on certain

4078
01:10:16,310 --> 01:10:16,320
to choose based on certain
 

4079
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,870
to choose based on certain
characteristics and that's an efficient

4080
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:18,880
characteristics and that's an efficient
 

4081
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,790
characteristics and that's an efficient
mechanism for adapting to the

4082
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:20,800
mechanism for adapting to the
 

4083
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,470
mechanism for adapting to the
environment being successfully adapted

4084
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:22,480
environment being successfully adapted
 

4085
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,390
environment being successfully adapted
to the environment

4086
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
to the environment
 

4087
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,470
to the environment
it does look like there's an advantage

4088
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,480
it does look like there's an advantage
 

4089
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,110
it does look like there's an advantage
in if you have males then the males can

4090
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:29,120
in if you have males then the males can
 

4091
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,189
in if you have males then the males can
take higher variance and so there can be

4092
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:31,199
take higher variance and so there can be
 

4093
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:32,790
take higher variance and so there can be
stronger selection among the males in

4094
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:32,800
stronger selection among the males in
 

4095
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:34,870
stronger selection among the males in
terms of weeding out genetic mutations

4096
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:34,880
terms of weeding out genetic mutations
 

4097
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:37,270
terms of weeding out genetic mutations
because the males have higher variance

4098
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:37,280
because the males have higher variance
 

4099
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,110
because the males have higher variance
in their mating success

4100
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:39,120
in their mating success
 

4101
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,550
in their mating success
sure okay

01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,390
hello aliens evolved from land animals
as opposed to plants or ocean

4110
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
slash air organisms
 

4111
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:53,669

by the way i did um recently

4112
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:53,679
by the way i did um recently
 

4113
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,270
by the way i did um recently
see that

4114
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
see that
 

4115
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:59,910
see that
there's uh only 10 of species on earth

4116
01:10:59,910 --> 01:10:59,920
there's uh only 10 of species on earth
 

4117
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:01,350
there's uh only 10 of species on earth
are in the ocean

4118
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
are in the ocean
 

4119
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,390
are in the ocean
so there's a lot more variety on land

4120
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
so there's a lot more variety on land
 

4121
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,030
so there's a lot more variety on land
there is it's it's interesting so why is

4122
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:07,040
there is it's it's interesting so why is
 

4123
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,510
there is it's it's interesting so why is
that i don't even i can't even intuit

4124
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:09,520
that i don't even i can't even intuit
 

4125
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:12,470
that i don't even i can't even intuit
exactly why that would be maybe survival

4126
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
exactly why that would be maybe survival
 

4127
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,709
exactly why that would be maybe survival
on land is harder and so you get a lot

4128
01:11:14,709 --> 01:11:14,719
on land is harder and so you get a lot
 

4129
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:16,709
on land is harder and so you get a lot
of story that i understand is it's about

4130
01:11:16,709 --> 01:11:16,719
of story that i understand is it's about
 

4131
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:20,149
of story that i understand is it's about
small niches so speciation

4132
01:11:20,149 --> 01:11:20,159
small niches so speciation
 

4133
01:11:20,159 --> 01:11:22,229
small niches so speciation
uh can be promoted by having multiple

4134
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,239
uh can be promoted by having multiple
 

4135
01:11:22,239 --> 01:11:24,470
uh can be promoted by having multiple
different species so in the ocean

4136
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:24,480
different species so in the ocean
 

4137
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,470
different species so in the ocean
species are larger that is there are

4138
01:11:26,470 --> 01:11:26,480
species are larger that is there are
 

4139
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:29,189
species are larger that is there are
more creatures in each species because

4140
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
more creatures in each species because
 

4141
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,950
more creatures in each species because
the ocean environments don't vary as

4142
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
the ocean environments don't vary as
 

4143
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,310
the ocean environments don't vary as
much so if you're good in one place

4144
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
much so if you're good in one place
 

4145
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,310
much so if you're good in one place
you're good in many other places

4146
01:11:34,310 --> 01:11:34,320
you're good in many other places
 

4147
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,990
you're good in many other places
but you know on land and especially in

4148
01:11:35,990 --> 01:11:36,000
but you know on land and especially in
 

4149
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,750
but you know on land and especially in
rivers rivers contain an enormous

4150
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760
rivers rivers contain an enormous
 

4151
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:39,510
rivers rivers contain an enormous
percentage of the

4152
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:39,520
percentage of the
 

4153
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,149
percentage of the
kinds of species on land

4154
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
kinds of species on land
 

4155
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:45,510
kinds of species on land
you see because they vary so much

4156
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:45,520
you see because they vary so much
 

4157
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:47,430
you see because they vary so much
from place to place and so a species can

4158
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
from place to place and so a species can
 

4159
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,870
from place to place and so a species can
be good in one place and then other

4160
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:48,880
be good in one place and then other
 

4161
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,110
be good in one place and then other
species can't really compete because

4162
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:51,120
species can't really compete because
 

4163
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,470
species can't really compete because
they came from a different place where

4164
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:52,480
they came from a different place where
 

4165
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,950
they came from a different place where
things are different so um

4166
01:11:54,950 --> 01:11:54,960
things are different so um
 

4167
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,830
things are different so um
it's a remarkable fact actually that

4168
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:57,840
it's a remarkable fact actually that
 

4169
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,830
it's a remarkable fact actually that
speciation promotes evolution in the

4170
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
speciation promotes evolution in the
 

4171
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,430
speciation promotes evolution in the
long run that is more evolution has

4172
01:12:01,430 --> 01:12:01,440
long run that is more evolution has
 

4173
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:03,590
long run that is more evolution has
happened on land because there have been

4174
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:03,600
happened on land because there have been
 

4175
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,750
happened on land because there have been
more species on land because each

4176
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:05,760
more species on land because each
 

4177
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,590
more species on land because each
species has been smaller

4178
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:07,600
species has been smaller
 

4179
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:09,189
species has been smaller
and that's actually a warning about

4180
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
and that's actually a warning about
 

4181
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,950
and that's actually a warning about
something or something called rot that

4182
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
something or something called rot that
 

4183
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,550
something or something called rot that
i've thought a lot about which is one of

01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
i've thought a lot about which is one of
 

4185
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,910
i've thought a lot about which is one of

and
it seems like large species actually

01:12:31,510 --> 01:12:31,520
it seems like large species actually
 

4205
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,350
it seems like large species actually
don't evolve as effectively as small

4206
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:33,360

4210
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
and that's an important thing to notice
 

4211
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,350
and that's an important thing to notice
about that so and that's actually in dif

4212
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,360
about that so and that's actually in dif
 

4213
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,510
about that so and that's actually in dif
that's different from ordinary sort of

4214
01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:41,520
that's different from ordinary sort of
 

4215
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:42,630
that's different from ordinary sort of
um

4216
01:12:42,630 --> 01:12:42,640
um
 

4217
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,790
um
evolution in economies on earth in the

4218
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:44,800
evolution in economies on earth in the
 

4219
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,430
evolution in economies on earth in the
last few centuries say um

4220
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:47,440
last few centuries say um
 

4221
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,430
last few centuries say um
you know on earth the more technical

4222
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:49,440
you know on earth the more technical
 

4223
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,270
you know on earth the more technical
evolution and economic growth happens in

4224
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:51,280
evolution and economic growth happens in
 

4225
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:54,310
evolution and economic growth happens in
larger integrated cities and nations

4226
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:54,320
larger integrated cities and nations
 

4227
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,149
larger integrated cities and nations
but in biology it's the other way around

4228
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
but in biology it's the other way around
 

4229
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,510
but in biology it's the other way around
more evolution happened in the

4230
01:12:57,510 --> 01:12:57,520
more evolution happened in the
 

4231
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,430
more evolution happened in the
fragmented species

4232
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
fragmented species
 

4233
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,669
fragmented species
yeah it's such a nuanced discussion

4234
01:13:01,669 --> 01:13:01,679
yeah it's such a nuanced discussion
 

4235
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,590
yeah it's such a nuanced discussion
because you can also push back in terms

4236
01:13:03,590 --> 01:13:03,600
because you can also push back in terms
 

4237
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,390
because you can also push back in terms
of nations and at least companies it's

4238
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:06,400
of nations and at least companies it's
 

4239
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,630
of nations and at least companies it's
like large companies seems to evolve

4240
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:08,640
like large companies seems to evolve
 

4241
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,390
like large companies seems to evolve
less effectively

4242
01:13:10,390 --> 01:13:10,400
less effectively
 

4243
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:11,750
less effectively
there is something

4244
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:11,760
there is something
 

4245
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,189
there is something
that you know

4246
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:13,199
that you know
 

4247
01:13:13,199 --> 01:13:16,709
that you know
they have more resources more um

4248
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:16,719
they have more resources more um
 

4249
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:18,790
they have more resources more um
they don't even have better resilience

4250
01:13:18,790 --> 01:13:18,800
they don't even have better resilience
 

4251
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,790
they don't even have better resilience
when you look at the scale of

4252
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:20,800
when you look at the scale of
 

4253
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,110
when you look at the scale of
decades and centuries it seems like a

4254
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,120
decades and centuries it seems like a
 

4255
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:25,270
decades and centuries it seems like a
lot of large companies die

4256
01:13:25,270 --> 01:13:25,280
lot of large companies die
 

4257
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:27,510
lot of large companies die
but still large economies do better like

4258
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
but still large economies do better like
 

4259
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,350
but still large economies do better like
large cities grow better than small

4260
01:13:29,350 --> 01:13:29,360
large cities grow better than small
 

4261
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,590
large cities grow better than small
cities large integrated economies like

4262
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
cities large integrated economies like
 

4263
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,270
cities large integrated economies like
the united states or the european union

4264
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,280
the united states or the european union
 

4265
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:35,669
the united states or the european union
do better than small fragmented ones so

4266
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
do better than small fragmented ones so
 

4267
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,630
do better than small fragmented ones so
yeah

4268
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
yeah
 

4269
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,870
yeah
sure it's it's that that's a very

4270
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
sure it's it's that that's a very
 

4271
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,870
sure it's it's that that's a very
interesting long discussion but so most

4272
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
interesting long discussion but so most
 

4273
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,030
interesting long discussion but so most
the people and obviously votes on

4274
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
the people and obviously votes on
 

4275
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,630
the people and obviously votes on
twitter um

4276
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:44,640
twitter um
 

4277
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:46,950
twitter um
represent the absolute uh objective

4278
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
represent the absolute uh objective
 

4279
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,189
represent the absolute uh objective
truth of things so most but an

4280
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
truth of things so most but an
 

4281
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:50,630
truth of things so most but an
interesting question about oceans is

4282
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
interesting question about oceans is
 

4283
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,550
interesting question about oceans is
that okay remember i told you about how

4284
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
that okay remember i told you about how
 

4285
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,390
that okay remember i told you about how
most planets would last for trillions of

4286
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:54,400
most planets would last for trillions of
 

4287
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,870
most planets would last for trillions of
years yes and then be later right so

4288
01:13:56,870 --> 01:13:56,880
years yes and then be later right so
 

4289
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,790
years yes and then be later right so
people have tried to explain why life

4290
01:13:58,790 --> 01:13:58,800
people have tried to explain why life
 

4291
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,550
people have tried to explain why life
appeared on earth by saying oh all those

4292
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:00,560
appeared on earth by saying oh all those
 

4293
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,470
appeared on earth by saying oh all those
planets are going to be unqualified for

4294
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:02,480
planets are going to be unqualified for
 

4295
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,149
planets are going to be unqualified for
life because of various problems that is

4296
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
life because of various problems that is
 

4297
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,910
life because of various problems that is
they're around smaller stars which last

4298
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:05,920
they're around smaller stars which last
 

4299
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:07,430
they're around smaller stars which last
longer and smaller stars have some

4300
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
longer and smaller stars have some
 

4301
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:09,590
longer and smaller stars have some
things like more solar flares maybe more

4302
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:09,600
things like more solar flares maybe more
 

4303
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,430
things like more solar flares maybe more
tidal locking

4304
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:11,440
tidal locking
 

4305
01:14:11,440 --> 01:14:13,350
tidal locking
but almost all these problems with

4306
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:13,360
but almost all these problems with
 

4307
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:15,350
but almost all these problems with
longer-lived planets aren't problems for

4308
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,360
longer-lived planets aren't problems for
 

4309
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:16,630
longer-lived planets aren't problems for
ocean worlds

4310
01:14:16,630 --> 01:14:16,640
ocean worlds
 

4311
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:17,350
ocean worlds
and

4312
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
and
 

4313
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,870
and
a large fraction of planets out there

4314
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
a large fraction of planets out there
 

4315
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,350
a large fraction of planets out there
are ocean worlds so if life can appear

4316
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:21,360
are ocean worlds so if life can appear
 

4317
01:14:21,360 --> 01:14:24,229
are ocean worlds so if life can appear
on an ocean world then uh that pretty

4318
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
on an ocean world then uh that pretty
 

4319
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:26,390
on an ocean world then uh that pretty
much ensures that these

4320
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
much ensures that these
 

4321
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,110
much ensures that these
these planets that last a very long time

4322
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
these planets that last a very long time
 

4323
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,430
these planets that last a very long time
could have advanced life because most

4324
01:14:31,430 --> 01:14:31,440
could have advanced life because most
 

4325
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:32,470
could have advanced life because most
you know there's a huge fraction of

4326
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,480
you know there's a huge fraction of
 

4327
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:33,910
you know there's a huge fraction of
ocean worlds so that's actually an open

4328
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920
ocean worlds so that's actually an open
 

4329
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,149
ocean worlds so that's actually an open
question so when you say

4330
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
question so when you say
 

4331
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,630
question so when you say
sorry when you say life appear

4332
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
sorry when you say life appear
 

4333
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,550
sorry when you say life appear
you're kind of saying life and

4334
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
you're kind of saying life and
 

4335
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,790
you're kind of saying life and
intelligent life so like

4336
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
intelligent life so like
 

4337
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:43,830
intelligent life so like
uh

4338
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:43,840
uh
 

4339
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,229
uh
so that's that's an open question

4340
01:14:46,229 --> 01:14:46,239
so that's that's an open question
 

4341
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:48,870
so that's that's an open question
is land and as i suppose the question

4342
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:48,880
is land and as i suppose the question
 

4343
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,310
is land and as i suppose the question
behind

4344
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
behind
 

4345
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,750
behind
the the twitter

4346
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:51,760
the the twitter
 

4347
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,270
the the twitter
poll which is

4348
01:14:53,270 --> 01:14:53,280
poll which is
 

4349
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,510
poll which is
a grabby alien civilization that comes

4350
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
a grabby alien civilization that comes
 

4351
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,350
a grabby alien civilization that comes
to say hello

4352
01:14:57,350 --> 01:14:57,360
to say hello
 

4353
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,910
to say hello
what's the chance that they

4354
01:14:59,910 --> 01:14:59,920
what's the chance that they
 

4355
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:02,070
what's the chance that they
first began their early steps the

4356
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
first began their early steps the
 

4357
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:06,790
first began their early steps the
difficult steps they took on on land

4358
01:15:06,790 --> 01:15:06,800

 

4359
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,470

what do you think

4360
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:08,480
what do you think
 

4361
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:11,270
what do you think
most 80 percent

4362
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280
most 80 percent
 

4363
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,350
most 80 percent
uh most people on twitter think it's

4364
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:13,360
uh most people on twitter think it's
 

4365
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,950
uh most people on twitter think it's
very likely right what do you think i

4366
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:14,960
very likely right what do you think i
 

4367
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,189
very likely right what do you think i
think people are discounting ocean

4368
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
think people are discounting ocean
 

4369
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:19,350
think people are discounting ocean
worlds too much that as i think people

4370
01:15:19,350 --> 01:15:19,360
worlds too much that as i think people
 

4371
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,430
worlds too much that as i think people
tend to assume that whatever we did must

4372
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:21,440

once had a nuclear war

4388
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
once had a nuclear war
 

4389
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,310
once had a nuclear war
with greater than 10 nukes fired in

01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,350
accident
intentional firing of nukes and

4396
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
intentional firing of nukes and
 

4397
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,189
intentional firing of nukes and
less than 20 percent was the most

4398
01:15:53,189 --> 01:15:53,199
less than 20 percent was the most
 

4399
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,310
less than 20 percent was the most
popular vote it just seems wrong to me

4400
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
popular vote it just seems wrong to me
 

4401
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,189
popular vote it just seems wrong to me
so like

4402
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,199
so like
 

4403
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,750
so like
i i wonder what so most people think uh

4404
01:15:59,750 --> 01:15:59,760
i i wonder what so most people think uh
 

4405
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,990
i i wonder what so most people think uh
once you get nukes we're not gonna fire

4406
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
once you get nukes we're not gonna fire
 

4407
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,669
once you get nukes we're not gonna fire
them they believe

4408
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
them they believe
 

4409
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,990
them they believe
in the power i think they're assuming

4410
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
in the power i think they're assuming
 

4411
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,750
in the power i think they're assuming
that if you had a nuclear war then that

4412
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
that if you had a nuclear war then that
 

4413
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,510
that if you had a nuclear war then that
would just end civilization for good i

4414
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:09,520
would just end civilization for good i
 

4415
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:11,270
would just end civilization for good i
think that's the thinking that's the

4416
01:16:11,270 --> 01:16:11,280
think that's the thinking that's the
 

4417
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,550
think that's the thinking that's the
main thing right and i think that's just

4418
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:12,560
main thing right and i think that's just
 

4419
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,310
main thing right and i think that's just
wrong i think you could rise again after

4420
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:14,320
wrong i think you could rise again after
 

4421
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,470
wrong i think you could rise again after
a nuclear war it might take ten thousand

4422
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:16,480
a nuclear war it might take ten thousand
 

4423
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:18,070
a nuclear war it might take ten thousand
years or a hundred thousand years but it

4424
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:18,080
years or a hundred thousand years but it
 

4425
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,430
years or a hundred thousand years but it
could rise again so what do you think

4426
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
could rise again so what do you think
 

4427
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,510
could rise again so what do you think
about mutually sure destruction

4428
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
about mutually sure destruction
 

4429
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,630
about mutually sure destruction
as a force to prevent people from firing

4430
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
as a force to prevent people from firing
 

4431
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:27,350
as a force to prevent people from firing
nuclear weapons that's a question that's

4432
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
nuclear weapons that's a question that's
 

4433
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,470
nuclear weapons that's a question that's
a new

4434
01:16:28,470 --> 01:16:28,480
a new
 

4435
01:16:28,480 --> 01:16:30,470
a new
to a terrifying degree has been raised

4436
01:16:30,470 --> 01:16:30,480
to a terrifying degree has been raised
 

4437
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,630
to a terrifying degree has been raised
now and what's going on well i mean

4438
01:16:32,630 --> 01:16:32,640
now and what's going on well i mean
 

4439
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,709
now and what's going on well i mean
clearly it has had an effect the

4440
01:16:34,709 --> 01:16:34,719
clearly it has had an effect the
 

4441
01:16:34,719 --> 01:16:36,630
clearly it has had an effect the
question is just how strong affect for

4442
01:16:36,630 --> 01:16:36,640
question is just how strong affect for
 

4443
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:37,669
question is just how strong affect for
how long

4444
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
how long
 

4445
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:38,950
how long
i mean clearly

4446
01:16:38,950 --> 01:16:38,960
i mean clearly
 

4447
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,510
i mean clearly
we have not gone wild with nuclear war

4448
01:16:41,510 --> 01:16:41,520
we have not gone wild with nuclear war
 

4449
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:43,669
we have not gone wild with nuclear war
and clearly the the devastation that you

4450
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679
and clearly the the devastation that you
 

4451
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,510
and clearly the the devastation that you
would get if you initiated nuclear war

4452
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:45,520
would get if you initiated nuclear war
 

4453
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:46,870
would get if you initiated nuclear war
is part of the reasons people have been

4454
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:46,880
is part of the reasons people have been
 

4455
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,110
is part of the reasons people have been
reluctant to start a war the question is

4456
01:16:49,110 --> 01:16:49,120
reluctant to start a war the question is
 

4457
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,510
reluctant to start a war the question is
just how reliably will that ensure the

4458
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:51,520
just how reliably will that ensure the
 

4459
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:52,870
just how reliably will that ensure the
absence of a war

4460
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
absence of a war
 

4461
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,870
absence of a war
yeah the night is still young exactly

4462
01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:54,880
yeah the night is still young exactly
 

4463
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,189
yeah the night is still young exactly
this has been 70 years or whatever it's

4464
01:16:57,189 --> 01:16:57,199
this has been 70 years or whatever it's
 

4465
01:16:57,199 --> 01:16:58,950
this has been 70 years or whatever it's
been

4466
01:16:58,950 --> 01:16:58,960
been
 

4467
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,390
been
uh

4468
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:00,400
uh
 

4469
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,310
uh
i mean but what do you think do you

4470
01:17:02,310 --> 01:17:02,320
i mean but what do you think do you
 

4471
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,270
i mean but what do you think do you
think we'll see nuclear war in the

4472
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:05,280
think we'll see nuclear war in the
 

4473
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,870
think we'll see nuclear war in the
yeah in this century

4474
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:06,880
yeah in this century
 

4475
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,149
yeah in this century
i don't know in this century but that

4476
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
i don't know in this century but that
 

4477
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:09,750
i don't know in this century but that
like it

4478
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
like it
 

4479
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,950
like it
it's the sort of thing that's likely to

4480
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:10,960
it's the sort of thing that's likely to
 

4481
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,950
it's the sort of thing that's likely to
happen eventually

4482
01:17:12,950 --> 01:17:12,960
happen eventually
 

4483
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,550
happen eventually
it's a very loose statement okay i

4484
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:14,560
it's a very loose statement okay i
 

4485
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,790
it's a very loose statement okay i
understand now this is where i pull you

4486
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
understand now this is where i pull you
 

4487
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,950
understand now this is where i pull you
out of your mathematical model and ask a

4488
01:17:18,950 --> 01:17:18,960
out of your mathematical model and ask a
 

4489
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,470
out of your mathematical model and ask a
human question

4490
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:20,480
human question
 

4491
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,790
human question
do you think this this particular thing

4492
01:17:22,790 --> 01:17:22,800
do you think this this particular thing
 

4493
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,229
do you think this this particular thing
we've been lucky that it hasn't happened

4494
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
we've been lucky that it hasn't happened
 

4495
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,350
we've been lucky that it hasn't happened
so far

4496
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:25,360
so far
 

4497
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:27,030
so far
but what is the nature of nuclear war

4498
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
but what is the nature of nuclear war
 

4499
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,030
but what is the nature of nuclear war
let's think about this

4500
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:29,040
let's think about this
 

4501
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,189
let's think about this
there is uh dictators

4502
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:31,199
there is uh dictators
 

4503
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:33,990
there is uh dictators
there's democracies

4504
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
there's democracies
 

4505
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,270
there's democracies
uh

4506
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280

 

4507
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:39,350

miscommunication how do wars start world

4508
01:17:39,350 --> 01:17:39,360
miscommunication how do wars start world
 

4509
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,149
miscommunication how do wars start world
war one world war ii so so the biggest

4510
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
war one world war ii so so the biggest
 

4511
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,229
war one world war ii so so the biggest
datum here is that we've had an enormous

4512
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
datum here is that we've had an enormous
 

4513
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,470
datum here is that we've had an enormous
decline in major war over the last

4514
01:17:46,470 --> 01:17:46,480
decline in major war over the last
 

4515
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,229
decline in major war over the last
century so that has to be taken into

4516
01:17:48,229 --> 01:17:48,239
century so that has to be taken into
 

4517
01:17:48,239 --> 01:17:50,070
century so that has to be taken into
account now

4518
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
account now
 

4519
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,790
account now
so the problem is is war is a process

4520
01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:52,800
so the problem is is war is a process
 

4521
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,630
so the problem is is war is a process
that has a very long tail

4522
01:17:54,630 --> 01:17:54,640
that has a very long tail
 

4523
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:55,590
that has a very long tail
that is

4524
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
that is
 

4525
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:58,870
that is
there are rare very large wars so the

4526
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
there are rare very large wars so the
 

4527
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,870
there are rare very large wars so the
average war is much worse than the

4528
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:00,880
average war is much worse than the
 

4529
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,149
average war is much worse than the
median war

4530
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:02,159
median war
 

4531
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:04,470
median war
yes because of this long tail

4532
01:18:04,470 --> 01:18:04,480
yes because of this long tail
 

4533
01:18:04,480 --> 01:18:06,550
yes because of this long tail
and that makes it hard to identify

4534
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:06,560
and that makes it hard to identify
 

4535
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:09,110
and that makes it hard to identify
trends over time so the median war has

4536
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:09,120
trends over time so the median war has
 

4537
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,709
trends over time so the median war has
clearly gone way down in the last

4538
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
clearly gone way down in the last
 

4539
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,310
clearly gone way down in the last
century that a medium rate of war but it

4540
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
century that a medium rate of war but it
 

4541
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,830
century that a medium rate of war but it
could be that's because

4542
01:18:13,830 --> 01:18:13,840
could be that's because
 

4543
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:15,750
could be that's because
the tail has gotten thicker and in fact

4544
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:15,760
the tail has gotten thicker and in fact
 

4545
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,669
the tail has gotten thicker and in fact
the average war is just as bad but you

4546
01:18:17,669 --> 01:18:17,679
the average war is just as bad but you
 

4547
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,270
the average war is just as bad but you
know most wars are going to be big force

4548
01:18:19,270 --> 01:18:19,280
know most wars are going to be big force
 

4549
01:18:19,280 --> 01:18:21,110
know most wars are going to be big force
we so that's the thing we're not so sure

4550
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
we so that's the thing we're not so sure
 

4551
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,550
we so that's the thing we're not so sure
about there's no

4552
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:22,560
about there's no
 

4553
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,149
about there's no
strong data

4554
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
strong data
 

4555
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,229
strong data
on on um wars with one

4556
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
on on um wars with one
 

4557
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:30,229
on on um wars with one
because of the destructive nature of the

4558
01:18:30,229 --> 01:18:30,239
because of the destructive nature of the
 

4559
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:31,590
because of the destructive nature of the
weapons

4560
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:31,600
weapons
 

4561
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,669
weapons
kill hundreds of millions of people

4562
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
kill hundreds of millions of people
 

4563
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,350
kill hundreds of millions of people
there's no data on this

4564
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,360
there's no data on this
 

4565
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,590
there's no data on this
right so but we can start intuiting but

4566
01:18:37,590 --> 01:18:37,600
right so but we can start intuiting but
 

4567
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:39,510
right so but we can start intuiting but
we can see the power law we can do a

4568
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,520
we can see the power law we can do a
 

4569
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,189
we can see the power law we can do a
power law fit to the rate of wars and

4570
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
power law fit to the rate of wars and
 

4571
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,070
power law fit to the rate of wars and
it's a

4572
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
it's a
 

4573
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,070
it's a
power law with a thick tail so it's one

4574
01:18:44,070 --> 01:18:44,080
power law with a thick tail so it's one
 

4575
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,910
power law with a thick tail so it's one
of those things that you should expect

4576
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:45,920
of those things that you should expect
 

4577
01:18:45,920 --> 01:18:47,110
of those things that you should expect
most of the damage to be in the few

4578
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:47,120
most of the damage to be in the few
 

4579
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:49,189
most of the damage to be in the few
biggest ones so that's also true for

4580
01:18:49,189 --> 01:18:49,199
biggest ones so that's also true for
 

4581
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:51,030
biggest ones so that's also true for
pandemics and some a few other things

4582
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:51,040
pandemics and some a few other things
 

4583
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,550
pandemics and some a few other things
for pandemics most of the damages and

4584
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
for pandemics most of the damages and
 

4585
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:54,550
for pandemics most of the damages and
the few biggest ones so the median

4586
01:18:54,550 --> 01:18:54,560
the few biggest ones so the median
 

4587
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,310
the few biggest ones so the median
pandemic so far is less than the average

4588
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:56,320
pandemic so far is less than the average
 

4589
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,990
pandemic so far is less than the average
that you should expect in the future but

4590
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
that you should expect in the future but
 

4591
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,149
that you should expect in the future but
those that fitting of data is very

4592
01:19:02,149 --> 01:19:02,159
those that fitting of data is very
 

4593
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:04,390
those that fitting of data is very
questionable because uh

4594
01:19:04,390 --> 01:19:04,400
questionable because uh
 

4595
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,390
questionable because uh
yeah well everything you said is correct

4596
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,400
yeah well everything you said is correct
 

4597
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,709
yeah well everything you said is correct
the question is like what can we infer

4598
01:19:08,709 --> 01:19:08,719
the question is like what can we infer
 

4599
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:10,070
the question is like what can we infer
about the future

4600
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:10,080
about the future
 

4601
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:12,070
about the future
of civilization

4602
01:19:12,070 --> 01:19:12,080
of civilization
 

4603
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:15,110
of civilization
threatening pandemics or

4604
01:19:15,110 --> 01:19:15,120
threatening pandemics or
 

4605
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:17,270
threatening pandemics or
nuclear war

4606
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:17,280
nuclear war
 

4607
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:18,229
nuclear war
from

4608
01:19:18,229 --> 01:19:18,239
from
 

4609
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:21,110
from
studying the history of the 20th century

4610
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:21,120
studying the history of the 20th century
 

4611
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,270
studying the history of the 20th century
so like you can't just fit it to the

4612
01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:23,280
so like you can't just fit it to the
 

4613
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:24,630
so like you can't just fit it to the
data the rate of wars and the

4614
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:24,640
data the rate of wars and the
 

4615
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,790
data the rate of wars and the
destructive nature like that's not

4616
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
destructive nature like that's not
 

4617
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,709
destructive nature like that's not
that's not how nuclear war will happen

4618
01:19:28,709 --> 01:19:28,719
that's not how nuclear war will happen
 

4619
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:32,310
that's not how nuclear war will happen
nuclear war happens with two or

4620
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:32,320
nuclear war happens with two or
 

4621
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,590
nuclear war happens with two or
idiots

4622
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
idiots
 

4623
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,669
idiots
that have access to a button small wars

4624
01:19:35,669 --> 01:19:35,679
that have access to a button small wars
 

4625
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,830
that have access to a button small wars
happen that way too no i understand that

4626
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
happen that way too no i understand that
 

4627
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,510
happen that way too no i understand that
but that's it's very important small

4628
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
but that's it's very important small
 

4629
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,669
but that's it's very important small
wars aside it's very important to

4630
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:41,679
wars aside it's very important to
 

4631
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,189
wars aside it's very important to
understand the dynamics the human

4632
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:43,199
understand the dynamics the human
 

4633
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,590
understand the dynamics the human
dynamics and the geopolitics of the way

4634
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
dynamics and the geopolitics of the way
 

4635
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:47,590
dynamics and the geopolitics of the way
nuclear war happens

4636
01:19:47,590 --> 01:19:47,600
nuclear war happens
 

4637
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:50,229
nuclear war happens
in order to predict how we can minimize

4638
01:19:50,229 --> 01:19:50,239
in order to predict how we can minimize
 

4639
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:52,229
in order to predict how we can minimize
the chance of uh

4640
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
the chance of uh
 

4641
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:53,830
the chance of uh
but it is a common and useful

4642
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
but it is a common and useful
 

4643
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,350
but it is a common and useful
intellectual strategy

4644
01:19:55,350 --> 01:19:55,360
intellectual strategy
 

4645
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:57,430
intellectual strategy
to take something that could be really

4646
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
to take something that could be really
 

4647
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,070
to take something that could be really
big or but is often very small and fit

4648
01:20:00,070 --> 01:20:00,080
big or but is often very small and fit
 

4649
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,510
big or but is often very small and fit
the distribution of the data small

4650
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:01,520
the distribution of the data small
 

4651
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,630
the distribution of the data small
things which you have a lot of them and

4652
01:20:02,630 --> 01:20:02,640
things which you have a lot of them and
 

4653
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,870
things which you have a lot of them and
then ask do i believe the big things are

4654
01:20:04,870 --> 01:20:04,880
then ask do i believe the big things are
 

4655
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:07,030
then ask do i believe the big things are
really that different right i see so

4656
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,040
really that different right i see so
 

4657
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:08,390
really that different right i see so
sometimes it's reasonable to say like

4658
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
sometimes it's reasonable to say like
 

4659
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,629
sometimes it's reasonable to say like
say with tornadoes or even pandemics or

4660
01:20:10,629 --> 01:20:10,639
say with tornadoes or even pandemics or
 

4661
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,189
say with tornadoes or even pandemics or
something the underlying process

4662
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
something the underlying process
 

4663
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,790
something the underlying process
might not be that different but that's

4664
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
might not be that different but that's
 

4665
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,189
might not be that different but that's
not possible it might not be

4666
01:20:17,189 --> 01:20:17,199
not possible it might not be
 

4667
01:20:17,199 --> 01:20:19,110
not possible it might not be
there there is

4668
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
there there is
 

4669
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,510
there there is
the fact that mutual short destruction

4670
01:20:21,510 --> 01:20:21,520
the fact that mutual short destruction
 

4671
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,669
the fact that mutual short destruction
seems to work to some degree

4672
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
seems to work to some degree
 

4673
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,510
seems to work to some degree
shows you that to some degree it's

4674
01:20:25,510 --> 01:20:25,520
shows you that to some degree it's
 

4675
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,590
shows you that to some degree it's
different than the small wars

4676
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:27,600
different than the small wars
 

4677
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,629
different than the small wars
uh

4678
01:20:28,629 --> 01:20:28,639
uh
 

4679
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,030
uh
that that

4680
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:31,040
that that
 

4681
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:32,950
that that
so it's

4682
01:20:32,950 --> 01:20:32,960
so it's
 

4683
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:35,110
so it's
it's a really important question to

4684
01:20:35,110 --> 01:20:35,120
it's a really important question to
 

4685
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,470
it's a really important question to
understand

4686
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:36,480
understand
 

4687
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:39,110
understand
is are humans capable

4688
01:20:39,110 --> 01:20:39,120
is are humans capable
 

4689
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:40,310
is are humans capable
one human

4690
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:40,320
one human
 

4691
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,629
one human
like how many humans on earth

4692
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:42,639
like how many humans on earth
 

4693
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:45,110
like how many humans on earth

press that button

4702
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:51,760
press that button
 

4703
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,590
press that button
i want to know those numbers

4704
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:53,600
i want to know those numbers
 

4705
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,750
i want to know those numbers
like day to day minute to minute

4706
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
like day to day minute to minute
 

4707

01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:57,600
how many people have that much

how many people have that much
irresponsibility evil uh

4710
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
irresponsibility evil uh
 

4711
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:02,390
irresponsibility evil uh
incompetence

4712
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:02,400
incompetence
 

4713
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,070

01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,080
ignorance whatever word you want to
 

4715
01:21:04,080 --> 01:21:06,229

assign there's a lot of dynamics to the

01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
assign there's a lot of dynamics to the
 

4717
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,750
assign there's a lot of dynamics to the
psychology that leads you to press that

4718
01:21:07,750 --> 01:21:07,760
psychology that leads you to press that
 

4719
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,229
psychology that leads you to press that
button but how many my intuition is the

4720
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
button but how many my intuition is the
 

4721
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,910
button but how many my intuition is the
number

4722
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:11,920
number
 

4723
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:14,070
number
the more destructive the that press of a

4724
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:14,080
the more destructive the that press of a
 

4725
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,310
the more destructive the that press of a
button the fewer humans you find and

4726
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:16,320
button the fewer humans you find and
 

4727
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,310
button the fewer humans you find and
that number gets very close to zero very

4728
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:18,320
that number gets very close to zero very
 

4729
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:19,270
that number gets very close to zero very
quickly

4730
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
quickly
 

4731
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,709
quickly
especially

4732
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:20,719
especially
 

4733
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:22,950
especially
people have access to such a button but

4734
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:22,960
people have access to such a button but
 

4735
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:24,229
people have access to such a button but
that's perhaps

4736
01:21:24,229 --> 01:21:24,239
that's perhaps
 

4737
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:26,470
that's perhaps
uh a hope than a reality and

4738
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:26,480
uh a hope than a reality and
 

4739
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:27,990
uh a hope than a reality and
unfortunately we don't have good data on

4740
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
unfortunately we don't have good data on
 

4741
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:29,030
unfortunately we don't have good data on
this

4742
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
this
 

4743
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,950
this
um

4744
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
um
 

4745
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,070
um
which is like

4746
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
which is like
 

4747
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,510
which is like
how destructive are humans willing to be

4748
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:35,520
how destructive are humans willing to be
 

4749
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,830
how destructive are humans willing to be
so i think part of this just has to

4750
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
so i think part of this just has to
 

4751
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:39,350
so i think part of this just has to
think about asking what your time scales

4752
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
think about asking what your time scales
 

4753
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,270
think about asking what your time scales
you're looking at right right so if you

4754
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,280
you're looking at right right so if you
 

4755
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,030
you're looking at right right so if you
say if you look at the history of war

4756
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
say if you look at the history of war
 

4757
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:44,870
say if you look at the history of war
you know we've had a lot of wars pretty

4758
01:21:44,870 --> 01:21:44,880
you know we've had a lot of wars pretty
 

4759
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,270
you know we've had a lot of wars pretty
consistently over many centuries

4760
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
consistently over many centuries
 

4761
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,350
consistently over many centuries
so if i ask if you ask will we have a

4762
01:21:49,350 --> 01:21:49,360
so if i ask if you ask will we have a
 

4763
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,270
so if i ask if you ask will we have a
nuclear war in the next 50 years i might

4764
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:51,280
nuclear war in the next 50 years i might
 

4765
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,310
nuclear war in the next 50 years i might
say well probably not if i say 500 or 5

4766
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:54,320
say well probably not if i say 500 or 5
 

4767
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,870
say well probably not if i say 500 or 5
000 years like if the same sort of risks

4768
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
000 years like if the same sort of risks
 

4769
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:58,390
000 years like if the same sort of risks
are underlying and they just continue

4770
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
are underlying and they just continue
 

4771
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,149
are underlying and they just continue
then you have to add that up over time

4772
01:22:00,149 --> 01:22:00,159
then you have to add that up over time
 

4773
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:01,990
then you have to add that up over time
and think the risk is getting a lot

4774
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:02,000
and think the risk is getting a lot
 

4775
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,669
and think the risk is getting a lot
larger the longer a time scale we're

4776
01:22:03,669 --> 01:22:03,679
larger the longer a time scale we're
 

4777
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:06,229
larger the longer a time scale we're
looking at but okay let's generalize

4778
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
looking at but okay let's generalize
 

4779
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:08,149
looking at but okay let's generalize
nuclear war because what i was more

4780
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:08,159
nuclear war because what i was more
 

4781
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,030
nuclear war because what i was more
referring to is something that kills

or makes um

makes the other 80 percent suffer

uh survive but suffer that's what i was

referring to so when you look at 500

4800
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
referring to so when you look at 500
 

4801
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:33,590
referring to so when you look at 500
years from now that might not be nuclear

4802
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:33,600
years from now that might not be nuclear
 

4803
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,590
years from now that might not be nuclear
war there might be something else right

war there might be something else right

that's that kind of has that destructive

these feel like novel

these feel like novel
 

4813
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:44,629

questions
 

4815
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:46,790
questions
in the history of humanity i just don't

01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:46,800
in the history of humanity i just don't

01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,550
know
i think since nuclear weapons

here's how i it seems like a real new

4832
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
here's how i it seems like a real new
 

4833
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,550
here's how i it seems like a real new
possibility that we have to contend with

4834
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:04,560
possibility that we have to contend with
 

4835
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,110
possibility that we have to contend with
it we don't have good models or

4836
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:07,120
it we don't have good models or
 

4837
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,030
it we don't have good models or
from from my perspective so if you look

4838
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:09,040
from from my perspective so if you look
 

4839
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:11,110
from from my perspective so if you look
on say the last thousand years or ten

4840
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:11,120
on say the last thousand years or ten
 

4841
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,950
on say the last thousand years or ten
thousand years we could say we've seen a

4842
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:12,960
thousand years we could say we've seen a
 

4843
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,629
thousand years we could say we've seen a
certain rate at which people are willing

4844
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
certain rate at which people are willing
 

4845
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,270
certain rate at which people are willing
to make big destruction in terms of war

4846
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:17,280
to make big destruction in terms of war
 

4847
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,030
to make big destruction in terms of war
yes okay

4848
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:19,040
yes okay
 

4849
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,550
yes okay
and if you're willing to project that

4850
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:20,560
and if you're willing to project that
 

4851
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:22,709
and if you're willing to project that
data forward that i think like if you

4852
01:23:22,709 --> 01:23:22,719
data forward that i think like if you
 

4853
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:24,390
data forward that i think like if you
want to ask over periods of thousands or

4854
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400
want to ask over periods of thousands or
 

4855
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,070
want to ask over periods of thousands or
tens of thousands of years you would

4856
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
tens of thousands of years you would
 

4857
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,990
tens of thousands of years you would
have a reasonable data set so the key

4858
01:23:27,990 --> 01:23:28,000
have a reasonable data set so the key
 

4859
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,149
have a reasonable data set so the key
question is what's changed lately

4860
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:30,159
question is what's changed lately
 

4861
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:32,470
question is what's changed lately
yes okay and so

4862
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
yes okay and so
 

4863
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,550
yes okay and so
a big question of which i've given a lot

4864
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
a big question of which i've given a lot
 

4865
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:36,709
a big question of which i've given a lot
of thought to what are the major changes

4866
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
of thought to what are the major changes
 

4867
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:38,550
of thought to what are the major changes
that seem to have happened in culture

4868
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:38,560
that seem to have happened in culture
 

4869
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,310
that seem to have happened in culture
and human attitudes over the last few

4870
01:23:40,310 --> 01:23:40,320
and human attitudes over the last few
 

4871
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,510
and human attitudes over the last few
centuries and what's our best

4872
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
centuries and what's our best
 

4873
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,110
centuries and what's our best
explanation for those so that we can

4874
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:43,120
explanation for those so that we can
 

4875
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,590
explanation for those so that we can
project them forward into the future

4876
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
project them forward into the future
 

4877
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,550
project them forward into the future
and i have a story about that

4878
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
and i have a story about that
 

4879
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,229
and i have a story about that
which is the story that we have been

4880
01:23:50,229 --> 01:23:50,239
which is the story that we have been
 

4881
01:23:50,239 --> 01:23:53,750
which is the story that we have been
drifting back toward forager attitudes

4882
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:53,760
drifting back toward forager attitudes
 

4883
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,750
drifting back toward forager attitudes
in the last few centuries as we get rich

4884
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:55,760
in the last few centuries as we get rich
 

4885
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,830
in the last few centuries as we get rich
so the idea is we spent a million years

4886
01:23:57,830 --> 01:23:57,840
so the idea is we spent a million years
 

4887
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,350
so the idea is we spent a million years
being a forager

4888
01:23:59,350 --> 01:23:59,360
being a forager
 

4889
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,590
being a forager
and that was a very sort of

4890
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:01,600
and that was a very sort of
 

4891
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,350
and that was a very sort of
standard lifestyle that we know a lot

4892
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
standard lifestyle that we know a lot
 

4893
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:04,470
standard lifestyle that we know a lot
about

4894
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,480
about
 

4895
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,470
about
foragers sort of live in small bands

4896
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
foragers sort of live in small bands
 

4897
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,270
foragers sort of live in small bands
they

4898
01:24:07,270 --> 01:24:07,280
they
 

4899
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,110
they
make decisions cooperatively they share

4900
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:09,120
make decisions cooperatively they share
 

4901
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:11,830
make decisions cooperatively they share
food they you know um they don't have

4902
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:11,840
food they you know um they don't have
 

4903
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,830
food they you know um they don't have
much property et cetera

4904
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:13,840
much property et cetera
 

4905
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:16,390
much property et cetera
and humans like that and then 10 000

4906
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
and humans like that and then 10 000
 

4907
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,229
and humans like that and then 10 000
years ago farming became possible but it

4908
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
years ago farming became possible but it
 

4909
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:19,750
years ago farming became possible but it
was only possible because we were

4910
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:19,760
was only possible because we were
 

4911
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,430
was only possible because we were
plastic enough to really change our

4912
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
plastic enough to really change our
 

4913
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,910
plastic enough to really change our
culture farming styles and cultures are

4914
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920
culture farming styles and cultures are
 

4915
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,270
culture farming styles and cultures are
very different they have slavery they

01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
very different they have slavery they
 

4917
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:26,950
very different they have slavery they

01:24:29,189 --> 01:24:29,199
inequality they have kings
 

4921
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:30,870
inequality they have kings
they they stay in one place instead of

01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:30,880
they they stay in one place instead of

they they stay in one place instead of
wandering they they don't have as much

wandering they they don't have as much
diversity of of experience or food they

4926
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:34,800
diversity of of experience or food they
 

4927
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,030
diversity of of experience or food they
have more disease this farming life is

4928
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
have more disease this farming life is
 

4929
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,750
have more disease this farming life is
just very different but humans were able

4930
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760
just very different but humans were able
 

4931
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,669
just very different but humans were able
to sort of introduce conformity and

4932
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:41,679
to sort of introduce conformity and
 

4933
01:24:41,679 --> 01:24:42,950
to sort of introduce conformity and
religion and all sorts of things to

4934
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
religion and all sorts of things to
 

4935
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,390
religion and all sorts of things to
become just a very different kind of

4936
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:44,400
become just a very different kind of
 

4937
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,910
become just a very different kind of
creature as farmers farmers are just

4938
01:24:45,910 --> 01:24:45,920
creature as farmers farmers are just
 

4939
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:47,350
creature as farmers farmers are just
really different than foragers in terms

4940
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
really different than foragers in terms
 

4941
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,910
really different than foragers in terms
of their values and their lives

4942
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
of their values and their lives
 

4943
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,750
of their values and their lives
but the pressures that made foragers

4944
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
but the pressures that made foragers
 

4945
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,669
but the pressures that made foragers
into farmers were part mediated by

4946
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:53,679
into farmers were part mediated by
 

4947
01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:55,110
into farmers were part mediated by
poverty

4948
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
poverty
 

4949
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,189
poverty
farmers are poor and if they deviated

4950
01:24:57,189 --> 01:24:57,199
farmers are poor and if they deviated
 

4951
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:58,950
farmers are poor and if they deviated
from the farming norms that every people

4952
01:24:58,950 --> 01:24:58,960
from the farming norms that every people
 

4953
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,790
from the farming norms that every people
around them supported they were quite at

4954
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:00,800
around them supported they were quite at
 

4955
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,790
around them supported they were quite at
risk of starving to death

4956
01:25:02,790 --> 01:25:02,800
risk of starving to death
 

4957
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:03,590
risk of starving to death
um

4958
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:03,600
um
 

4959
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,669
um
and then in the last few centuries we've

4960
01:25:05,669 --> 01:25:05,679
and then in the last few centuries we've
 

4961
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:07,350
and then in the last few centuries we've
gotten rich

4962
01:25:07,350 --> 01:25:07,360
gotten rich
 

4963
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:09,430
gotten rich
and as we've gotten rich the social

4964
01:25:09,430 --> 01:25:09,440
and as we've gotten rich the social
 

4965
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:11,430
and as we've gotten rich the social
pressures that turned foragers and

4966
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:11,440
pressures that turned foragers and
 

4967
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:13,990
pressures that turned foragers and
farmers have become less

4968
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:14,000
farmers have become less
 

4969
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:15,590
farmers have become less
less persuasive to us

4970
01:25:15,590 --> 01:25:15,600
less persuasive to us
 

4971
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,590
less persuasive to us
so for example a farming young woman who

4972
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:17,600
so for example a farming young woman who
 

4973
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:19,110
so for example a farming young woman who
was told if you have a child out of

4974
01:25:19,110 --> 01:25:19,120
was told if you have a child out of
 

4975
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,270
was told if you have a child out of
wedlock you and your child may starve

4976
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,280
wedlock you and your child may starve
 

4977
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,590
wedlock you and your child may starve
that was a credible threat she would see

4978
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
that was a credible threat she would see
 

4979
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,830
that was a credible threat she would see
actual examples around her to make that

4980
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:25,840
actual examples around her to make that
 

4981
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:27,510
actual examples around her to make that
a believable threat

4982
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
a believable threat
 

4983
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,350
a believable threat
today if you say to a young woman you

4984
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
today if you say to a young woman you
 

4985
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:30,790
today if you say to a young woman you
shouldn't have a child out of wedlock

4986
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
shouldn't have a child out of wedlock
 

4987
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,229
shouldn't have a child out of wedlock
she will see other young women around

4988
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
she will see other young women around
 

4989
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:34,470
she will see other young women around
her doing okay that way we're all rich

4990
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
her doing okay that way we're all rich
 

4991
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:36,310
her doing okay that way we're all rich
enough to be able to afford that sort of

4992
01:25:36,310 --> 01:25:36,320
enough to be able to afford that sort of
 

4993
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,189
enough to be able to afford that sort of
thing and therefore she's more inclined

4994
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
thing and therefore she's more inclined
 

4995
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:41,830
thing and therefore she's more inclined
often to go with her inclinations or

4996
01:25:41,830 --> 01:25:41,840
often to go with her inclinations or
 

4997
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:43,510
often to go with her inclinations or
sort of more natural inclinations about

4998
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:43,520
sort of more natural inclinations about
 

4999
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,350
sort of more natural inclinations about
such things rather than to be

5000
01:25:45,350 --> 01:25:45,360
such things rather than to be
 

5001
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,030
such things rather than to be
pressured to follow the

5002
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
pressured to follow the
 

5003
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,629
pressured to follow the
official farming norms of that you

5004
01:25:48,629 --> 01:25:48,639
official farming norms of that you
 

5005
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:50,149
official farming norms of that you
shouldn't do that sort of thing and all

5006
01:25:50,149 --> 01:25:50,159
shouldn't do that sort of thing and all
 

5007
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:51,910
shouldn't do that sort of thing and all
through our lives we have been drifting

5008
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
through our lives we have been drifting
 

5009
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,470
through our lives we have been drifting
back toward forager attitudes

5010
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:54,480
back toward forager attitudes
 

5011
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:57,110
back toward forager attitudes
because we've been getting rich and so

5012
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
because we've been getting rich and so
 

5013
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,110
because we've been getting rich and so
aside from at work which is an exception

5014
01:25:59,110 --> 01:25:59,120
aside from at work which is an exception
 

5015
01:25:59,120 --> 01:26:02,070
aside from at work which is an exception
but elsewhere i think this explains

5016
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,080
but elsewhere i think this explains
 

5017
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,229
but elsewhere i think this explains

all these trends are basically explained
 

5029
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,830
all these trends are basically explained
by becoming more forager-like and much

as you mentioned we sometimes don't do a

as you mentioned we sometimes don't do a
 

5061
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:52,070
as you mentioned we sometimes don't do a
good job of telling accurately what life

5062
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:52,080
good job of telling accurately what life
 

5063
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,470
good job of telling accurately what life
was like back then but you're saying if

5064
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
was like back then but you're saying if
 

5065
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,470
was like back then but you're saying if
it's not exactly like forge as it rhymes

it's not exactly like forge as it rhymes
 

5067
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,950
it's not exactly like forge as it rhymes
in some fundamental way right you also

nuclear weapon
 

5075
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:06,629

uh would

01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:06,639
uh would
 

5077
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:09,030
uh would
be peaceful i don't know if that's 100

5078
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
be peaceful i don't know if that's 100

bit about what foragers lives were like

01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,350
bit about what foragers lives were like
the main sort of violence they had would

5084
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
the main sort of violence they had would
 

5085
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,590
the main sort of violence they had would
be sexual jealousy they were relatively

5086
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
be sexual jealousy they were relatively
 

5087
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,189
be sexual jealousy they were relatively
promiscuous and so there'd be a lot of

5088
01:27:19,189 --> 01:27:19,199
promiscuous and so there'd be a lot of
 

5089
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:21,910
promiscuous and so there'd be a lot of
jealousy but they did not have organized

5090
01:27:21,910 --> 01:27:21,920
jealousy but they did not have organized
 

5091
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:23,750
jealousy but they did not have organized
wars with each other that is they were

5092
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:23,760
wars with each other that is they were
 

5093
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:25,270
wars with each other that is they were
at peace with their neighboring forager

5094
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:25,280
at peace with their neighboring forager
 

5095
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,590
at peace with their neighboring forager
bands they didn't have property in land

5096

bands they didn't have property in land
 

5097
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:28,950
bands they didn't have property in land
or even in people they didn't really

5098
01:27:28,950 --> 01:27:28,960
or even in people they didn't really

um

5102
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
um
 

5103
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,750
um
and so they were in fact

5104
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:33,760
and so they were in fact
 

5105
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:34,870
and so they were in fact
peaceful

5106
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:34,880
peaceful
 

5107
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,470
peaceful
and that's when you think about

5108
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480
and that's when you think about
 

5109
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:37,910
and that's when you think about
large-scale wars they don't start

5110
01:27:37,910 --> 01:27:37,920
large-scale wars they don't start
 

5111

large-scale wars in the ways chimpanzees

5114
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:41,360
large-scale wars in the ways chimpanzees
 

5115
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:43,990
large-scale wars in the ways chimpanzees
do chimpanzees do have wars between one

5116
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,000
do chimpanzees do have wars between one

do chimpanzees do have wars between one
tribe of chimpanzees and others but

human foragers did not farmers return to

5120
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
human foragers did not farmers return to
 

5121
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,510
human foragers did not farmers return to
that of course the more chimpanzee-like

5122
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
that of course the more chimpanzee-like
 

5123
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,709
that of course the more chimpanzee-like
styles well that's a hopeful message if

5124
01:27:52,709 --> 01:27:52,719
styles well that's a hopeful message if
 

5125
01:27:52,719 --> 01:27:55,910
styles well that's a hopeful message if
we could return real quick to uh

5126
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
we could return real quick to uh
 

5127
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,030
we could return real quick to uh
to the hello aliens uh twitter thread

5128
01:27:59,030 --> 01:27:59,040
to the hello aliens uh twitter thread
 

5129
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,390
to the hello aliens uh twitter thread
one of them is really interesting about

5130
01:28:00,390 --> 01:28:00,400
one of them is really interesting about
 

5131
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,310
one of them is really interesting about
language what percent of hello aliens

5132
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:02,320
language what percent of hello aliens
 

5133
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,470
language what percent of hello aliens
would be able to talk to us in our

5134
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
would be able to talk to us in our
 

5135
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,229
would be able to talk to us in our
language this is the question of

5136
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
language this is the question of
 

5137
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,910
language this is the question of
communication

5138
01:28:07,910 --> 01:28:07,920
communication
 

5139
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:11,669
communication
it actually gets the nature of language

5140
01:28:11,669 --> 01:28:11,679
it actually gets the nature of language
 

5141
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:13,750
it actually gets the nature of language
it also gets to the nature of how

5142
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:13,760
it also gets to the nature of how
 

5143
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:16,229
it also gets to the nature of how
advanced you expect them to be

5144
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
advanced you expect them to be
 

5145
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,110
advanced you expect them to be
so

5146
01:28:17,110 --> 01:28:17,120
so
 

5147
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,790
so
i think some people

5148
01:28:18,790 --> 01:28:18,800
i think some people
 

5149
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,270
i think some people
see that like we have advanced over the

5150
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:21,280
see that like we have advanced over the
 

5151
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:23,750
see that like we have advanced over the
last thousands of years and we aren't

5152
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
last thousands of years and we aren't
 

5153
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:25,910
last thousands of years and we aren't
reaching any sort of limit and so they

5154
01:28:25,910 --> 01:28:25,920
reaching any sort of limit and so they
 

5155
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:28,229
reaching any sort of limit and so they
tend to assume it could go on forever

5156
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:28,239
tend to assume it could go on forever
 

5157
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:30,629
tend to assume it could go on forever
and i actually tend to think that within

5158
01:28:30,629 --> 01:28:30,639
and i actually tend to think that within
 

5159
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,870
and i actually tend to think that within
say 10 million years we will sort of

5160
01:28:32,870 --> 01:28:32,880
say 10 million years we will sort of
 

5161
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,229
say 10 million years we will sort of
max out

5162
01:28:34,229 --> 01:28:34,239
max out
 

5163
01:28:34,239 --> 01:28:35,990
max out
on technology we'll sort of learn

5164
01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,000
on technology we'll sort of learn
 

5165
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,550
on technology we'll sort of learn
everything that's feasible to know

5166
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:38,560
everything that's feasible to know
 

5167
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:40,950
everything that's feasible to know
for the most part and then you know

5168
01:28:40,950 --> 01:28:40,960
for the most part and then you know
 

5169
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,709
for the most part and then you know
obstacles to understanding would more be

5170
01:28:42,709 --> 01:28:42,719
obstacles to understanding would more be
 

5171
01:28:42,719 --> 01:28:44,629
obstacles to understanding would more be
about like sort of cultural differences

5172
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
about like sort of cultural differences
 

5173
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,470
about like sort of cultural differences
like ways in which different places had

5174
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
like ways in which different places had
 

5175
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:49,030
like ways in which different places had
just chosen to do things differently

5176
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:49,040
just chosen to do things differently
 

5177
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:50,709
just chosen to do things differently
and so

5178
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:50,719
and so
 

5179
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:52,790
and so
then the question is is it even possible

5180
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
then the question is is it even possible
 

5181
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,390
then the question is is it even possible
to communicate

5182
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
to communicate
 

5183
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:56,070
to communicate
across some cultural difference

5184
01:28:56,070 --> 01:28:56,080
across some cultural difference
 

5185
01:28:56,080 --> 01:28:58,470
across some cultural difference
distances and i might think yeah i could

5186
01:28:58,470 --> 01:28:58,480
distances and i might think yeah i could
 

5187
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,310
distances and i might think yeah i could
imagine some maybe advanced aliens who

5188
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,320
imagine some maybe advanced aliens who
 

5189
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:01,990
imagine some maybe advanced aliens who
just become so weird and different from

5190
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,000
just become so weird and different from
 

5191
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,270
just become so weird and different from
each other they can't communicate with

5192
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:03,280
each other they can't communicate with
 

5193
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:04,470
each other they can't communicate with
each other but

5194
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:04,480
each other but
 

5195
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,550
each other but
we're probably pretty simple compared to

5196
01:29:06,550 --> 01:29:06,560
we're probably pretty simple compared to
 

5197
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:07,430
we're probably pretty simple compared to
them

5198
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
them
 

5199
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,870
them
so i would think

5200
01:29:08,870 --> 01:29:08,880
so i would think
 

5201
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:09,830
so i would think
sure

5202
01:29:09,830 --> 01:29:09,840
sure
 

5203
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:11,510
sure
if they wanted to they could communicate

5204
01:29:11,510 --> 01:29:11,520
if they wanted to they could communicate
 

5205
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:12,550
if they wanted to they could communicate
with us

5206
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:12,560
with us
 

5207
01:29:12,560 --> 01:29:15,430
with us
so it's the simplicity of the recipient

5208
01:29:15,430 --> 01:29:15,440
so it's the simplicity of the recipient
 

5209
01:29:15,440 --> 01:29:18,070
so it's the simplicity of the recipient
see i i tend to uh just to push back

5210
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:18,080
see i i tend to uh just to push back
 

5211
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:19,910
see i i tend to uh just to push back
let's let's explore the possibility

5212
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:19,920
let's let's explore the possibility
 

5213
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:22,390
let's let's explore the possibility
where that's not the case

5214
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
where that's not the case
 

5215
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:26,070
where that's not the case
can we communicate with ants

5216
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,080
can we communicate with ants
 

5217
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,790
can we communicate with ants
i find that um

5218
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:28,800
i find that um
 

5219
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,910
i find that um
like this idea that we're not very good

5220
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:31,920
like this idea that we're not very good
 

5221
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,669
like this idea that we're not very good
at communicating in general oh you're

5222
01:29:33,669 --> 01:29:33,679
at communicating in general oh you're
 

5223
01:29:33,679 --> 01:29:34,629
at communicating in general oh you're
saying

5224
01:29:34,629 --> 01:29:34,639
saying
 

5225
01:29:34,639 --> 01:29:36,070
saying
all right i see

5226
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,080
all right i see
 

5227
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:37,590
all right i see
you're saying once you get orders of

5228
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
you're saying once you get orders of
 

5229
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,830
you're saying once you get orders of
magnitude better at communicating

5230
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:39,840
magnitude better at communicating
 

5231
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,830
magnitude better at communicating
once they had maxed out on all you know

5232
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:41,840
once they had maxed out on all you know
 

5233
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:43,510
once they had maxed out on all you know
communication technology in general and

5234
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:43,520
communication technology in general and
 

5235
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,350
communication technology in general and
they just understood in general how to

5236
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
they just understood in general how to
 

5237
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,189
they just understood in general how to
communicate with lots of things and had

5238
01:29:47,189 --> 01:29:47,199
communicate with lots of things and had
 

5239
01:29:47,199 --> 01:29:48,709
communicate with lots of things and had
done that for millions of years but you

5240
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:48,719
done that for millions of years but you
 

5241
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,709
done that for millions of years but you
have to be able to this is so

5242
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:50,719
have to be able to this is so
 

5243
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:51,990
have to be able to this is so
interesting it's somebody who cares a

5244
01:29:51,990 --> 01:29:52,000
interesting it's somebody who cares a
 

5245
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,070
interesting it's somebody who cares a
lot about empathy and imagining how

5246
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:54,080
lot about empathy and imagining how
 

5247
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:56,390
lot about empathy and imagining how
other people feel

5248
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:56,400
other people feel
 

5249
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:59,350
other people feel
um it's communication requires

5250
01:29:59,350 --> 01:29:59,360
um it's communication requires
 

5251
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:01,430
um it's communication requires
empathy meaning

5252
01:30:01,430 --> 01:30:01,440
empathy meaning
 

5253
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:03,590
empathy meaning
you have to truly understand

5254
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,600
you have to truly understand
 

5255
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:06,470
you have to truly understand
how the other person the other

5256
01:30:06,470 --> 01:30:06,480
how the other person the other
 

5257
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,790
how the other person the other
organism sees the world

5258
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:08,800
organism sees the world
 

5259
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,070
organism sees the world
it's like a

5260
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,080
it's like a
 

5261
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:12,149
it's like a
a four-dimensional species talking a

5262
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:12,159
a four-dimensional species talking a
 

5263
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,070
a four-dimensional species talking a
two-dimensional species it's not as

5264
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:14,080
two-dimensional species it's not as
 

5265
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,470
two-dimensional species it's not as
trivial as to me at least

5266
01:30:16,470 --> 01:30:16,480
trivial as to me at least
 

5267
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:19,110
trivial as to me at least
as it might at first seem so let me

5268
01:30:19,110 --> 01:30:19,120
as it might at first seem so let me
 

5269
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:21,189
as it might at first seem so let me
reverse my position a little because

5270
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
reverse my position a little because
 

5271
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:23,110
reverse my position a little because
i'll say well the whole

5272
01:30:23,110 --> 01:30:23,120
i'll say well the whole
 

5273
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:25,510
i'll say well the whole
hello aliens question really

5274
01:30:25,510 --> 01:30:25,520
hello aliens question really
 

5275
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,550
hello aliens question really
uh combines two different scenarios that

5276
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
uh combines two different scenarios that
 

5277
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:31,750
uh combines two different scenarios that
uh we're slipping over so

5278
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:31,760
uh we're slipping over so
 

5279
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,270
uh we're slipping over so
one scenario would be that the hello

5280
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:33,280
one scenario would be that the hello
 

5281
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:35,270
one scenario would be that the hello
aliens would be like grabby aliens they

5282
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
aliens would be like grabby aliens they
 

5283
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:36,950
aliens would be like grabby aliens they
would be just fully advanced they would

5284
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:36,960
would be just fully advanced they would
 

5285
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:38,149
would be just fully advanced they would
have been expanding for millions of

5286
01:30:38,149 --> 01:30:38,159
have been expanding for millions of
 

5287
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:39,350
have been expanding for millions of
years they would have a very advanced

5288
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:39,360
years they would have a very advanced
 

5289
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:40,790
years they would have a very advanced
civilization

5290
01:30:40,790 --> 01:30:40,800
civilization
 

5291
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,470
civilization
and then they would finally be arriving

5292
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:42,480
and then they would finally be arriving
 

5293
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,390
and then they would finally be arriving
here you know after a billion years

5294
01:30:44,390 --> 01:30:44,400
here you know after a billion years
 

5295
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,070
here you know after a billion years
perhaps of expanding in which case

5296
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
perhaps of expanding in which case
 

5297
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,830
perhaps of expanding in which case
they're going to be crazy advanced at

5298
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:47,840
they're going to be crazy advanced at
 

5299
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:50,149
they're going to be crazy advanced at
some at maximal level but

5300
01:30:50,149 --> 01:30:50,159
some at maximal level but
 

5301
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:52,470
some at maximal level but
the holo aliens about aliens we might

5302
01:30:52,470 --> 01:30:52,480
the holo aliens about aliens we might
 

5303
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,990
the holo aliens about aliens we might
meet soon

5304
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:54,000
meet soon
 

5305
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,950
meet soon
which might be sort of ufo aliens and

5306
01:30:56,950 --> 01:30:56,960
which might be sort of ufo aliens and
 

5307
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,669
which might be sort of ufo aliens and
ufo aliens probably are not grabby

5308
01:30:59,669 --> 01:30:59,679
ufo aliens probably are not grabby
 

5309
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:01,430
ufo aliens probably are not grabby
aliens

5310
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:01,440
aliens
 

5311
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,030
aliens
how do you get here if you're not a grab

5312
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,040
how do you get here if you're not a grab
 

5313
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:04,229
how do you get here if you're not a grab
alien

5314
01:31:04,229 --> 01:31:04,239
alien
 

5315
01:31:04,239 --> 01:31:05,830
alien
well they would have to be able to

5316
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
well they would have to be able to
 

5317
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,430
well they would have to be able to
travel

5318
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
travel
 

5319
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:08,229
travel
oh

5320
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:08,239
oh
 

5321
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:11,510
oh
but so they would not be expansive

5322
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
but so they would not be expansive
 

5323
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,070
but so they would not be expansive
so for the road it doesn't count as

5324
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
so for the road it doesn't count as
 

5325
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:16,550
so for the road it doesn't count as
grabby so we're talking about expanding

5326
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:16,560
grabby so we're talking about expanding
 

5327
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:19,030
grabby so we're talking about expanding
the colony the comfortable colony

5328
01:31:19,030 --> 01:31:19,040
the colony the comfortable colony
 

5329
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:21,110
the colony the comfortable colony
so the question is

5330
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
so the question is
 

5331
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:24,470
so the question is
if ufos some of them are aliens what

5332
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
if ufos some of them are aliens what
 

5333
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,470
if ufos some of them are aliens what
kind of aliens would they be

5334
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:26,480
kind of aliens would they be
 

5335
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:27,990
kind of aliens would they be
this is sort of the key question you

5336
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:28,000
this is sort of the key question you
 

5337
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,830
this is sort of the key question you
have to ask in order to try to interpret

5338
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
have to ask in order to try to interpret
 

5339
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,229
have to ask in order to try to interpret
that scenario

5340
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:32,239
that scenario
 

5341
01:31:32,239 --> 01:31:34,709
that scenario
the key fact we would know is that they

5342
01:31:34,709 --> 01:31:34,719
the key fact we would know is that they
 

5343
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:37,110
the key fact we would know is that they
are here right now but the universe

5344
01:31:37,110 --> 01:31:37,120
are here right now but the universe
 

5345
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,510
are here right now but the universe
around us is not full of an alien

5346
01:31:39,510 --> 01:31:39,520
around us is not full of an alien
 

5347
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:41,189
around us is not full of an alien
civilization

5348
01:31:41,189 --> 01:31:41,199
civilization
 

5349
01:31:41,199 --> 01:31:44,629
civilization
so that says right off the bat that they

5350
01:31:44,629 --> 01:31:44,639
so that says right off the bat that they
 

5351
01:31:44,639 --> 01:31:46,629
so that says right off the bat that they
chose not to

5352
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
chose not to
 

5353
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:47,830
chose not to
allow

5354
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:47,840
allow
 

5355
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,590
allow
massive expansion of a gravity

5356
01:31:49,590 --> 01:31:49,600
massive expansion of a gravity
 

5357
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,830
massive expansion of a gravity
civilization is it possible that they're

5358
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
civilization is it possible that they're
 

5359
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,390
civilization is it possible that they're
they chose it but we just don't see them

5360
01:31:54,390 --> 01:31:54,400
they chose it but we just don't see them
 

5361
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,550
they chose it but we just don't see them
yet these are the stragglers the

5362
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:56,560
yet these are the stragglers the
 

5363
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:58,070
yet these are the stragglers the
journeymen

5364
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
journeymen
 

5365
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,030
journeymen
so the timing coincidence is it's almost

5366
01:32:01,030 --> 01:32:01,040
so the timing coincidence is it's almost
 

5367
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:03,110
so the timing coincidence is it's almost
surely if they are here now they are

5368
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:03,120
surely if they are here now they are
 

5369
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:04,709
surely if they are here now they are
much older than us they are many

5370
01:32:04,709 --> 01:32:04,719
much older than us they are many
 

5371
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,189
much older than us they are many
millions of years older than us

5372
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
millions of years older than us
 

5373
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,229
millions of years older than us
and so

5374
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
and so
 

5375
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,750
and so
they could have filled the galaxy in

5376
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:09,760
they could have filled the galaxy in
 

5377
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:11,510
they could have filled the galaxy in
that last millions of years if they had

5378
01:32:11,510 --> 01:32:11,520
that last millions of years if they had
 

5379
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:13,350
that last millions of years if they had
wanted to

5380
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:13,360
wanted to
 

5381
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:14,950
wanted to
that is isn't it they couldn't just be

5382
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:14,960
that is isn't it they couldn't just be
 

5383
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:17,030
that is isn't it they couldn't just be
right at the edge very unlikely that

5384
01:32:17,030 --> 01:32:17,040
right at the edge very unlikely that
 

5385
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,550
right at the edge very unlikely that
most likely they would have been around

5386
01:32:18,550 --> 01:32:18,560
most likely they would have been around
 

5387
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,149
most likely they would have been around
waiting for us for a long time they

5388
01:32:20,149 --> 01:32:20,159
waiting for us for a long time they
 

5389
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:21,830
waiting for us for a long time they
could have come here anytime in the last

5390
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
could have come here anytime in the last
 

5391
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,669
could have come here anytime in the last
millions of years and they just chosen

5392
01:32:23,669 --> 01:32:23,679
millions of years and they just chosen
 

5393
01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:24,870
millions of years and they just chosen
they've been waiting around for this or

5394
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:24,880
they've been waiting around for this or
 

5395
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:27,590
they've been waiting around for this or
they just chose to come recently but the

5396
01:32:27,590 --> 01:32:27,600
they just chose to come recently but the
 

5397
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:29,510
they just chose to come recently but the
the timing coins it would be crazy

5398
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:29,520
the timing coins it would be crazy
 

5399
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:31,189
the timing coins it would be crazy
unlikely that they just happened to be

5400
01:32:31,189 --> 01:32:31,199
unlikely that they just happened to be
 

5401
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:32,950
unlikely that they just happened to be
able to get here say in the last hundred

5402
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:32,960
able to get here say in the last hundred
 

5403
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:33,830
able to get here say in the last hundred
years

5404
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
years
 

5405
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,990
years
uh they would no doubt have been able to

5406
01:32:35,990 --> 01:32:36,000
uh they would no doubt have been able to
 

5407
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,149
uh they would no doubt have been able to
get here far earlier than that again we

5408
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:38,159
get here far earlier than that again we
 

5409
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,310
get here far earlier than that again we
don't know so this is reference like ufo

5410
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
don't know so this is reference like ufo
 

5411
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,550
don't know so this is reference like ufo
sightings on earth we don't know

5412
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:42,560
sightings on earth we don't know
 

5413
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:44,470
sightings on earth we don't know
if this kind of increase in sightings

5414
01:32:44,470 --> 01:32:44,480
if this kind of increase in sightings
 

5415
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,470
if this kind of increase in sightings
have anything to do with action

5416
01:32:46,470 --> 01:32:46,480
have anything to do with action
 

5417
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,910
have anything to do with action
i'm just talking about like the timing

5418
01:32:47,910 --> 01:32:47,920
i'm just talking about like the timing
 

5419
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:49,830
i'm just talking about like the timing
like they're they're they arose at some

5420
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:49,840
like they're they're they arose at some
 

5421
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:52,070
like they're they're they arose at some
point in space time yes right

5422
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:52,080
point in space time yes right
 

5423
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:54,470
point in space time yes right
and it's very unlikely that that was

5424
01:32:54,470 --> 01:32:54,480
and it's very unlikely that that was
 

5425
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:55,830
and it's very unlikely that that was
just to the point that they could just

5426
01:32:55,830 --> 01:32:55,840
just to the point that they could just
 

5427
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,390
just to the point that they could just
barely get here recently almost surely

5428
01:32:58,390 --> 01:32:58,400
barely get here recently almost surely
 

5429
01:32:58,400 --> 01:32:59,990
barely get here recently almost surely
yeah they would they might they could

5430
01:32:59,990 --> 01:33:00,000
yeah they would they might they could
 

5431
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,830
yeah they would they might they could
have gotten here much earlier

5432
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:01,840
have gotten here much earlier
 

5433
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:03,430
have gotten here much earlier
and well throughout the stretch of

5434
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:03,440
and well throughout the stretch of
 

5435
01:33:03,440 --> 01:33:05,189
and well throughout the stretch of
several billion years that earth existed

5436
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
several billion years that earth existed
 

5437
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:06,790
several billion years that earth existed
they could have been here often exactly

5438
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
they could have been here often exactly
 

5439
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:07,510
they could have been here often exactly
so

5440
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
so
 

5441
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:09,350
so
they could have therefore filled the

5442
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
they could have therefore filled the
 

5443
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,830
they could have therefore filled the
galaxy long time ago

5444
01:33:11,830 --> 01:33:11,840
galaxy long time ago
 

5445
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,990
galaxy long time ago
let's push back on that that's what the

5446
01:33:13,990 --> 01:33:14,000
let's push back on that that's what the
 

5447
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,470
let's push back on that that's what the
question to me is isn't it possible

5448
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:16,480
question to me is isn't it possible
 

5449
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,590
question to me is isn't it possible
that the expansion of a civilization

5450
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
that the expansion of a civilization
 

5451
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:25,110
that the expansion of a civilization
is much harder than the the travel

5452
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:25,120

 

5453
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,629

the sphere of the reachable is different

5454
01:33:28,629 --> 01:33:28,639
the sphere of the reachable is different
 

5455
01:33:28,639 --> 01:33:31,430
the sphere of the reachable is different
than the sphere of the colonized

5456
01:33:31,430 --> 01:33:31,440
than the sphere of the colonized
 

5457
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,950
than the sphere of the colonized
so

5458
01:33:32,950 --> 01:33:32,960
so
 

5459
01:33:32,960 --> 01:33:35,669
so
isn't it possible that the sphere of

5460
01:33:35,669 --> 01:33:35,679
isn't it possible that the sphere of
 

5461
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,229
isn't it possible that the sphere of
places where like the stragglers go the

5462
01:33:38,229 --> 01:33:38,239
places where like the stragglers go the
 

5463
01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:39,750
places where like the stragglers go the
different people that journey out the

5464
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
different people that journey out the
 

5465
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:42,709
different people that journey out the
explorers is much much larger and grows

5466
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
explorers is much much larger and grows
 

5467
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,229
explorers is much much larger and grows
much faster

5468
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:44,239
much faster
 

5469
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,390
much faster
than the civilization

5470
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400
than the civilization
 

5471
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,709
than the civilization
so in which case like they would visit

5472
01:33:48,709 --> 01:33:48,719
so in which case like they would visit
 

5473
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:51,030
so in which case like they would visit
us there's a lot of visitors the grad

5474
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,040
us there's a lot of visitors the grad
 

5475
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:53,110
us there's a lot of visitors the grad
students of the civilization they're

5476
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:53,120
students of the civilization they're
 

5477
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,189
students of the civilization they're
like exploring they're collecting the

5478
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:55,199
like exploring they're collecting the
 

5479
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:56,550
like exploring they're collecting the
data but they're

5480
01:33:56,550 --> 01:33:56,560
data but they're
 

5481
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,950
data but they're
we're not yet going to see them and by

5482
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:58,960
we're not yet going to see them and by
 

5483
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:03,590
we're not yet going to see them and by
yet i mean across millions of years

5484
01:34:03,590 --> 01:34:03,600

 

5485
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:05,750

the the time delay between when the

5486
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
the the time delay between when the
 

5487
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,709
the the time delay between when the
first thing might arrive and then when

5488
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
first thing might arrive and then when
 

5489
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:11,590
first thing might arrive and then when
colonists could arrive in mass and do a

5490
01:34:11,590 --> 01:34:11,600
colonists could arrive in mass and do a
 

5491
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:13,750
colonists could arrive in mass and do a
mass amount of work is cosmologically

5492
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:13,760
mass amount of work is cosmologically
 

5493
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,669
mass amount of work is cosmologically
short you know in human history of

5494
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:15,679
short you know in human history of
 

5495
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:17,430
short you know in human history of
course sure there might be a century

5496
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:17,440
course sure there might be a century
 

5497
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,669
course sure there might be a century

optimization it's true for ants so it's
 

5507
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:30,470
optimization it's true for ants so it's
like when the first ant shows up it's

01:34:30,470 --> 01:34:30,480
like when the first ant shows up it's
 

5509
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:33,189
like when the first ant shows up it's

01:34:38,229 --> 01:34:38,239
yeah relatively short it's also true

01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:46,239
that feasible is that you land somewhere

01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:48,229
that feasible is that you land somewhere
you colonize a bit you create new

5526
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:48,239
you colonize a bit you create new
 

5527
01:34:48,239 --> 01:34:50,070
you colonize a bit you create new
resources and then allow you to go

5528
01:34:50,070 --> 01:34:50,080
resources and then allow you to go
 

5529
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,629
resources and then allow you to go
farther many short hops as opposed to

5530
01:34:52,629 --> 01:34:52,639
farther many short hops as opposed to
 

5531
01:34:52,639 --> 01:34:54,310

5533
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,149

those hops require that you are able to

5534
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
those hops require that you are able to
 

5535
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,550
those hops require that you are able to
start a colonization of sorts along

5536
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560
start a colonization of sorts along
 

5537
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,310
start a colonization of sorts along
those hops right you have to be able to

5538
01:35:00,310 --> 01:35:00,320
those hops right you have to be able to
 

5539
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:01,910
those hops right you have to be able to
stop somewhere make it into a way

5540
01:35:01,910 --> 01:35:01,920
stop somewhere make it into a way
 

5541
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:04,629

you moving farther so what do you think

5544
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:06,719
you moving farther so what do you think
 

5545
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:10,390
you moving farther so what do you think
of there's been a lot of ufo sightings

5546
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
of there's been a lot of ufo sightings
 

5547
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:11,990
of there's been a lot of ufo sightings
uh what do you think about those ufo

5548
01:35:11,990 --> 01:35:12,000
uh what do you think about those ufo
 

5549
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,149
uh what do you think about those ufo
sightings and what do you think if any

5550
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:14,159
sightings and what do you think if any
 

5551
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:15,750
sightings and what do you think if any
of them

5552
01:35:15,750 --> 01:35:15,760
of them
 

5553
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:18,390
of them
are

5554
01:35:18,390 --> 01:35:18,400

giant civilizations out in the sky

5560
01:35:25,030 --> 01:35:25,040
giant civilizations out in the sky
 

5561
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:27,350
giant civilizations out in the sky
how do you make sense of that then

5562
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:27,360
how do you make sense of that then
 

5563
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:29,669
how do you make sense of that then
i want to do some clearing of throats

5564
01:35:29,669 --> 01:35:29,679
i want to do some clearing of throats
 

5565
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:31,830
i want to do some clearing of throats
which people like to do on this topic

5566
01:35:31,830 --> 01:35:31,840
which people like to do on this topic
 

5567
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,790
which people like to do on this topic
right

5568
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:32,800
right
 

5569
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:34,070
right
they want to make sure you understand

5570
01:35:34,070 --> 01:35:34,080
they want to make sure you understand
 

5571
01:35:34,080 --> 01:35:35,990
they want to make sure you understand
they're saying this and not that right

5572
01:35:35,990 --> 01:35:36,000
they're saying this and not that right
 

5573
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:36,870
they're saying this and not that right
so

5574
01:35:36,870 --> 01:35:36,880
so
 

5575
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:40,229
so
i would say the analysis needs both a

5576
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:40,239
i would say the analysis needs both a
 

5577
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,709
i would say the analysis needs both a
prior and a likelihood

5578
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
prior and a likelihood
 

5579
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:43,510
prior and a likelihood
so

5580
01:35:43,510 --> 01:35:43,520
so
 

5581
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,990
so
the prior is what are the scenarios that

5582
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
the prior is what are the scenarios that
 

5583
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,830
the prior is what are the scenarios that
are at all plausible

5584
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:47,840
are at all plausible
 

5585
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,870
are at all plausible
in terms of what we know about the

5586
01:35:48,870 --> 01:35:48,880
in terms of what we know about the
 

5587
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,510
in terms of what we know about the
universe and then the likelihood is the

5588
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
universe and then the likelihood is the
 

5589
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,070
universe and then the likelihood is the
particular actual sightings like how

5590
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:54,080
particular actual sightings like how
 

5591
01:35:54,080 --> 01:35:55,669
particular actual sightings like how
hard are those to explain through

5592
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:55,679
hard are those to explain through
 

5593
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,590
hard are those to explain through

damn puzzling

these are pretty puzzling weird stuff
that deserve an expert's attention so

5677
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,830

much higher than the usual murder trial

5678
01:37:19,830 --> 01:37:19,840
much higher than the usual murder trial
 

5679
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,109
much higher than the usual murder trial
plenty high enough that strong physical

5680
01:37:23,109 --> 01:37:23,119
plenty high enough that strong physical
 

5681
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:25,109
plenty high enough that strong physical
evidence could put you over the top to

5682
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
evidence could put you over the top to
 

5683
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:27,030
evidence could put you over the top to
think it's more likely than not

5684
01:37:27,030 --> 01:37:27,040
think it's more likely than not
 

5685
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,790
think it's more likely than not
but i'm not an expert on that physical

5686
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:28,800
but i'm not an expert on that physical
 

5687
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:30,390
but i'm not an expert on that physical
evidence i'm going to leave that part to

5688
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
evidence i'm going to leave that part to
 

5689
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,390
evidence i'm going to leave that part to
someone else i'm going to say the prior

5690
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:32,400
someone else i'm going to say the prior
 

5691
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:34,390
someone else i'm going to say the prior
is pretty high this isn't a crazy

5692
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
is pretty high this isn't a crazy
 

5693
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,390
is pretty high this isn't a crazy
scenario so then i can elaborate on

5694
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
scenario so then i can elaborate on
 

5695
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,709
scenario so then i can elaborate on
where my prior comes from what scenario

5696
01:37:38,709 --> 01:37:38,719
where my prior comes from what scenario
 

5697
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:42,149
where my prior comes from what scenario
could make most sense of this data

5698
01:37:42,149 --> 01:37:42,159
could make most sense of this data
 

5699
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:44,870
could make most sense of this data
my scenario to make sense has

5700
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
my scenario to make sense has
 

5701
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:46,470
my scenario to make sense has
two main parts

5702
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480
two main parts
 

5703
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,070
two main parts
first is panspermia siblings

5704
01:37:50,070 --> 01:37:50,080
first is panspermia siblings
 

5705
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,629
first is panspermia siblings
so panspermia is the pros hypothesis

5706
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
so panspermia is the pros hypothesis
 

5707
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,870
so panspermia is the pros hypothesis
process by which life might have arrived

5708
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:54,880
process by which life might have arrived
 

5709
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:57,910
process by which life might have arrived
on earth from elsewhere

5710
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
on earth from elsewhere
 

5711
01:37:57,920 --> 01:37:59,669
on earth from elsewhere
and a plausible time for that i mean it

5712
01:37:59,669 --> 01:37:59,679
and a plausible time for that i mean it
 

5713
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,350
and a plausible time for that i mean it
would have to happen very early in earth

5714
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
would have to happen very early in earth
 

5715
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:02,950
would have to happen very early in earth
history because we see life early in his

5716
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:02,960
history because we see life early in his
 

5717
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,030
history because we see life early in his
history and a plausible time could have

5718
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
history and a plausible time could have
 

5719
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,109
history and a plausible time could have
been during this stellar nursery where

5720
01:38:07,109 --> 01:38:07,119
been during this stellar nursery where
 

5721
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:10,070
been during this stellar nursery where
the sun was born with many other

5722
01:38:10,070 --> 01:38:10,080
the sun was born with many other
 

5723
01:38:10,080 --> 01:38:12,629
the sun was born with many other
stars in the same close proximity with

5724
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
stars in the same close proximity with
 

5725
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:15,350
stars in the same close proximity with
lots of rocks flying around able to move

5726
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
lots of rocks flying around able to move
 

5727
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,669
lots of rocks flying around able to move
things from one place to another

5728
01:38:17,669 --> 01:38:17,679
things from one place to another
 

5729
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:20,709
things from one place to another
pans if a you know rock with life on it

5730
01:38:20,709 --> 01:38:20,719
pans if a you know rock with life on it
 

5731
01:38:20,719 --> 01:38:22,950
pans if a you know rock with life on it
from some rock with planet with life

5732
01:38:22,950 --> 01:38:22,960
from some rock with planet with life
 

5733
01:38:22,960 --> 01:38:24,790
from some rock with planet with life
came into that stellar nursery it

5734
01:38:24,790 --> 01:38:24,800
came into that stellar nursery it
 

5735
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:27,830
came into that stellar nursery it
plausibly could have seeded many planets

5736
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:27,840
plausibly could have seeded many planets
 

5737
01:38:27,840 --> 01:38:29,750
plausibly could have seeded many planets
in that stellar nursery all at the same

5738
01:38:29,750 --> 01:38:29,760
in that stellar nursery all at the same
 

5739
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,870
in that stellar nursery all at the same
time they're all born at the same time

5740
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
time they're all born at the same time
 

5741
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,149
time they're all born at the same time
in the same place pretty close to each

5742
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
in the same place pretty close to each
 

5743
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:35,030
in the same place pretty close to each
other lots of rocks flying around okay

5744
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,040
other lots of rocks flying around okay
 

5745
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:37,350
other lots of rocks flying around okay
so a panspermia scenario would then

5746
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:37,360
so a panspermia scenario would then
 

5747
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:39,350
so a panspermia scenario would then
create siblings i.e

5748
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:39,360
create siblings i.e
 

5749
01:38:39,360 --> 01:38:42,070
create siblings i.e
there would be say a few thousand

5750
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,080
there would be say a few thousand
 

5751
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:43,030
there would be say a few thousand
other

5752
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:43,040
other
 

5753
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,669
other
planets out there so after the nursery

5754
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:45,679
planets out there so after the nursery
 

5755
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,830
planets out there so after the nursery
forms it drifts it separates they drift

5756
01:38:47,830 --> 01:38:47,840
forms it drifts it separates they drift
 

5757
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,830
forms it drifts it separates they drift
apart and so out there in the galaxy

5758
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
apart and so out there in the galaxy
 

5759
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:51,189
apart and so out there in the galaxy
there would now be a bunch of other

5760
01:38:51,189 --> 01:38:51,199
there would now be a bunch of other
 

5761
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,109
there would now be a bunch of other
stars all formed at the same time and we

5762
01:38:53,109 --> 01:38:53,119
stars all formed at the same time and we
 

5763
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:54,470
stars all formed at the same time and we
can actually spot them in terms of their

5764
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:54,480
can actually spot them in terms of their
 

5765
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:55,669
can actually spot them in terms of their
spectrum

5766
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
spectrum
 

5767
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,669
spectrum
and they would have um

5768
01:38:57,669 --> 01:38:57,679
and they would have um
 

5769
01:38:57,679 --> 01:38:59,910
and they would have um
then started on the same path of life as

5770
01:38:59,910 --> 01:38:59,920
then started on the same path of life as
 

5771
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:02,390
then started on the same path of life as
we did with that life being seeded but

5772
01:39:02,390 --> 01:39:02,400
we did with that life being seeded but
 

5773
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:05,109
we did with that life being seeded but
they would move at different rates

5774
01:39:05,109 --> 01:39:05,119
they would move at different rates
 

5775
01:39:05,119 --> 01:39:05,990
they would move at different rates
and

5776
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,000
and
 

5777
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,310
and
most likely most of them would never you

5778
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:08,320
most likely most of them would never you
 

5779
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,990
most likely most of them would never you
know reach an advanced level before the

5780
01:39:09,990 --> 01:39:10,000
know reach an advanced level before the
 

5781
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,270
know reach an advanced level before the
deadline but maybe one other did

5782
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
deadline but maybe one other did
 

5783
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,229
deadline but maybe one other did
and maybe it did before us

5784
01:39:16,229 --> 01:39:16,239
and maybe it did before us
 

5785
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:17,189
and maybe it did before us
so

5786
01:39:17,189 --> 01:39:17,199
so
 

5787
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:18,950
so
if they did they could know all this and

5788
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:18,960
if they did they could know all this and
 

5789
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,070
if they did they could know all this and
they could go searching for their

01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
they could go searching for their
 

5791
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,590
they could go searching for their
siblings that is they could look in the

5792
01:39:21,590 --> 01:39:21,600
siblings that is they could look in the
 

5793
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:23,590
siblings that is they could look in the
sky for the other stars with the mass

5794
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:23,600

01:39:25,109 --> 01:39:25,119
the spectrum that matches this the
 

5797
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,870
the spectrum that matches this the

01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:26,880
spectrum that came from this nursery
 

5799
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,350
spectrum that came from this nursery
they could identify their sibling stars

5800
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:29,360
they could identify their sibling stars
 

5801
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,830
they could identify their sibling stars
in the galaxy the thousand of them

5802
01:39:31,830 --> 01:39:31,840
in the galaxy the thousand of them
 

5803
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,350

01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,030
panspermia siblings because we all kind
of started a similar time

5820
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:55,040
of started a similar time
 

5821
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,030
of started a similar time
in this local pocket

5822
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,040
in this local pocket
 

5823
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,030
in this local pocket
right of the universe

5824
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
right of the universe
 

5825
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,229
right of the universe
and so

5826
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:00,239
and so
 

5827
01:40:00,239 --> 01:40:02,950
and so
that changes a lot of the math and so

5828
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:02,960
that changes a lot of the math and so
 

5829
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:04,470
that changes a lot of the math and so
that would create this correlation

5830
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:04,480
that would create this correlation
 

5831
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:06,070
that would create this correlation
between when advanced life might appear

5832
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:06,080
between when advanced life might appear
 

5833
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,390
between when advanced life might appear
no longer just random independent spaces

5834
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:08,400
no longer just random independent spaces
 

5835
01:40:08,400 --> 01:40:09,669
no longer just random independent spaces
in space time there would be this

5836
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:09,679
in space time there would be this
 

5837
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:11,750
in space time there would be this
cluster perhaps and that allows

5838
01:40:11,750 --> 01:40:11,760
cluster perhaps and that allows
 

5839
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:13,430
cluster perhaps and that allows
interaction between

5840
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
interaction between
 

5841
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,950
interaction between
the elements of the cluster yes

5842
01:40:14,950 --> 01:40:14,960
the elements of the cluster yes
 

5843
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:18,629
the elements of the cluster yes
non-grabby alien civilizations like

5844
01:40:18,629 --> 01:40:18,639
non-grabby alien civilizations like
 

5845
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:19,910
non-grabby alien civilizations like
kind of

5846
01:40:19,910 --> 01:40:19,920
kind of
 

5847
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,870
kind of
primitive alien civilizations like us

5848
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:22,880
primitive alien civilizations like us
 

5849
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,390
primitive alien civilizations like us
with others and they might be a little

5850
01:40:24,390 --> 01:40:24,400
with others and they might be a little
 

5851
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,030
with others and they might be a little
bit ahead that's so fascinating they

5852
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:27,040
bit ahead that's so fascinating they
 

5853
01:40:27,040 --> 01:40:29,109
bit ahead that's so fascinating they
would probably be a lot ahead so the

5854
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
would probably be a lot ahead so the
 

5855
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:32,470
would probably be a lot ahead so the
puzzle is sure sure if if if they you

5856
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:32,480
puzzle is sure sure if if if they you
 

5857
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,229
puzzle is sure sure if if if they you
know they happen before us they probably

5858
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:34,239
know they happen before us they probably
 

5859
01:40:34,239 --> 01:40:35,990
know they happen before us they probably
happen hundreds of millions of years

5860
01:40:35,990 --> 01:40:36,000
happen hundreds of millions of years
 

5861
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,030
happen hundreds of millions of years
before us

5862
01:40:37,030 --> 01:40:37,040
before us
 

5863
01:40:37,040 --> 01:40:38,870
before us
but less than a billion less than a

5864
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:38,880
but less than a billion less than a
 

5865
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:41,350
but less than a billion less than a
billion but still plenty of time that

5866
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
billion but still plenty of time that
 

5867
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:43,510
billion but still plenty of time that
they could have become grabby and filled

5868
01:40:43,510 --> 01:40:43,520
they could have become grabby and filled
 

5869
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:45,590
they could have become grabby and filled
filled the galaxy and gone and beyond so

5870
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:45,600
filled the galaxy and gone and beyond so
 

5871
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:47,510
filled the galaxy and gone and beyond so
there'd be plenty so the the fact is

5872
01:40:47,510 --> 01:40:47,520
there'd be plenty so the the fact is
 

5873
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:49,109
there'd be plenty so the the fact is
they chose not to become grabby that

5874
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
they chose not to become grabby that
 

5875
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,109
they chose not to become grabby that
would have to be the interpretation

5876
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119
would have to be the interpretation
 

5877
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:52,950
would have to be the interpretation
if we have pants permanently in time to

5878
01:40:52,950 --> 01:40:52,960
if we have pants permanently in time to
 

5879
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:54,790
if we have pants permanently in time to
become grabby you said so yes they

5880
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:54,800
become grabby you said so yes they
 

5881
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:58,149
become grabby you said so yes they
should be playing and they chose not to

5882
01:40:58,149 --> 01:40:58,159
should be playing and they chose not to
 

5883
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,910
should be playing and they chose not to
are we sure about this so

5884
01:40:59,910 --> 01:40:59,920
are we sure about this so
 

5885
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,830
are we sure about this so
again a hundred million years is enough

5886
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:01,840
again a hundred million years is enough
 

5887
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,229
again a hundred million years is enough
100 million so i told you before that i

5888
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:04,239
100 million so i told you before that i
 

5889
01:41:04,239 --> 01:41:06,470
100 million so i told you before that i
said within 10 million years our

5890
01:41:06,470 --> 01:41:06,480
said within 10 million years our
 

5891
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,870
said within 10 million years our
descendants will become grabby or not

5892
01:41:08,870 --> 01:41:08,880
descendants will become grabby or not
 

5893
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,950
descendants will become grabby or not
and they'll have that choice okay right

5894
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:10,960
and they'll have that choice okay right
 

5895
01:41:10,960 --> 01:41:13,109
and they'll have that choice okay right
and so they clearly more than 10 million

5896
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:13,119
and so they clearly more than 10 million
 

5897
01:41:13,119 --> 01:41:15,910
and so they clearly more than 10 million
years earlier than us so they chose not

5898
01:41:15,910 --> 01:41:15,920
years earlier than us so they chose not
 

5899
01:41:15,920 --> 01:41:19,350
years earlier than us so they chose not
to but still go on vacation look around

5900
01:41:19,350 --> 01:41:19,360
to but still go on vacation look around
 

5901
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:21,430
to but still go on vacation look around
so it's not grabby if they chose not to

5902
01:41:21,430 --> 01:41:21,440
so it's not grabby if they chose not to
 

5903
01:41:21,440 --> 01:41:23,430
so it's not grabby if they chose not to
expand that part that's going to have to

5904
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:23,440
expand that part that's going to have to
 

5905
01:41:23,440 --> 01:41:25,430
expand that part that's going to have to
be a rule they set to not allow any part

5906
01:41:25,430 --> 01:41:25,440
be a rule they set to not allow any part
 

5907
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,430
be a rule they set to not allow any part
of themselves to do it like

5908
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
of themselves to do it like
 

5909
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,709
of themselves to do it like
if they let any little ship fly away

5910
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:30,719
if they let any little ship fly away
 

5911
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,950
if they let any little ship fly away
with the ability to create a colony

5912
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:32,960
with the ability to create a colony
 

5913
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:35,189
with the ability to create a colony
the game's over then they have prevented

5914
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
the game's over then they have prevented
 

5915
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:36,950
the game's over then they have prevented
then the world the universe becomes

5916
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:36,960
then the world the universe becomes
 

5917
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,550
then the world the universe becomes
grabby from their origin with this one

5918
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,560
grabby from their origin with this one
 

5919
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,870
grabby from their origin with this one
colony right so in order to prevent

5920
01:41:40,870 --> 01:41:40,880
colony right so in order to prevent
 

5921
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:42,390
colony right so in order to prevent
their civilization being grabby they

5922
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
their civilization being grabby they
 

5923
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:43,990
their civilization being grabby they
have to have a rule they enforce pretty

5924
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
have to have a rule they enforce pretty
 

5925
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,470
have to have a rule they enforce pretty
strongly that no part of them can ever

5926
01:41:46,470 --> 01:41:46,480
strongly that no part of them can ever
 

5927
01:41:46,480 --> 01:41:47,830
strongly that no part of them can ever
try to do that through

5928
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:47,840
try to do that through
 

5929
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:51,030
try to do that through
a global authoritarian regime or

5930
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:51,040
a global authoritarian regime or
 

5931
01:41:51,040 --> 01:41:52,550
a global authoritarian regime or
through something that's internal to

5932
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:52,560
through something that's internal to
 

5933
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,229
through something that's internal to
that meaning it's part of the

5934
01:41:54,229 --> 01:41:54,239
that meaning it's part of the
 

5935
01:41:54,239 --> 01:41:55,830
that meaning it's part of the
nature of life

5936
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
nature of life
 

5937
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:58,070
nature of life
that it doesn't want as like an advanced

5938
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
that it doesn't want as like an advanced
 

5939
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,590
that it doesn't want as like an advanced
political officer in the brain or

5940
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
political officer in the brain or
 

5941
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,470
political officer in the brain or
whatever

5942
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
whatever
 

5943
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:02,790
whatever
yes there's something in

5944
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
yes there's something in
 

5945
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,550
yes there's something in
human nature

5946
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:04,560
human nature
 

5947
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:07,189
human nature
that prevents you from what or like like

5948
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,199
that prevents you from what or like like
 

5949
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,669
that prevents you from what or like like
alien nature right that as you get more

5950
01:42:09,669 --> 01:42:09,679
alien nature right that as you get more
 

5951
01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,310
alien nature right that as you get more
advanced you become lazier and lazier in

5952
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
advanced you become lazier and lazier in
 

5953
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,550
advanced you become lazier and lazier in
terms of exploration and expansion

5954
01:42:14,550 --> 01:42:14,560
terms of exploration and expansion
 

5955
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,030
terms of exploration and expansion
so i would say they would have to have

5956
01:42:17,030 --> 01:42:17,040
so i would say they would have to have
 

5957
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,430
so i would say they would have to have
enforced a rule against expanding and

5958
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,440
enforced a rule against expanding and
 

5959
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,270
enforced a rule against expanding and
that rule would probably make them

5960
01:42:21,270 --> 01:42:21,280
that rule would probably make them
 

5961
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,510
that rule would probably make them
reluctant to let people leave very far

5962
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:23,520
reluctant to let people leave very far
 

5963
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:26,229
reluctant to let people leave very far
that you know any one vacation trip far

5964
01:42:26,229 --> 01:42:26,239
that you know any one vacation trip far
 

5965
01:42:26,239 --> 01:42:28,149
that you know any one vacation trip far
away could risk an expansion from the

5966
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:28,159
away could risk an expansion from the
 

5967
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:29,750
away could risk an expansion from the
six vacation trip so they would probably

5968
01:42:29,750 --> 01:42:29,760
six vacation trip so they would probably
 

5969
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:31,830
six vacation trip so they would probably
have a pretty tight lid on just allowing

5970
01:42:31,830 --> 01:42:31,840
have a pretty tight lid on just allowing
 

5971
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:34,149
have a pretty tight lid on just allowing
any travel out from their origin in

5972
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:34,159
any travel out from their origin in
 

5973
01:42:34,159 --> 01:42:36,950
any travel out from their origin in
order to enforce this rule

5974
01:42:36,950 --> 01:42:36,960
order to enforce this rule
 

5975
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:39,590
order to enforce this rule
but then we also know well they would

5976
01:42:39,590 --> 01:42:39,600
but then we also know well they would
 

5977
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,270
but then we also know well they would

then they couldn't maintain this over

01:42:55,669 --> 01:42:55,679
then they couldn't maintain this over
 

5991
01:42:55,679 --> 01:42:57,830
then they couldn't maintain this over
100 million years this policy of not

100 million years this policy of not

01:42:57,840 --> 01:42:59,910
100 million years this policy of not
allowing any expansion so we have to see

allowing any expansion so we have to see
 

5995
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,750
allowing any expansion so we have to see
they have successfully they not just had

they have successfully they not just had
 

5997
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,550

that's a substantial competence let me

01:43:10,149 --> 01:43:10,159
that's a substantial competence let me
 

6005
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,990
that's a substantial competence let me
think about this so you don't think

6006
01:43:11,990 --> 01:43:12,000
think about this so you don't think
 

6007
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,149
think about this so you don't think
there could be a barrier in 100 million

01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:14,159
there could be a barrier in 100 million
 

6009
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,430
there could be a barrier in 100 million
years you don't think there could be a

expansionary
imagine the europeans that tried to

6022
01:43:27,350 --> 01:43:27,360
imagine the europeans that tried to
 

6023
01:43:27,360 --> 01:43:29,109
imagine the europeans that tried to
prevent anybody from leaving europe to

prevent anybody from leaving europe to
 

6025
01:43:29,119 --> 01:43:32,229
prevent anybody from leaving europe to
go to the new world and imagine how what

6026
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
go to the new world and imagine how what
 

6027
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,990
go to the new world and imagine how what
it would have taken to make that happen

6028
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:34,000
it would have taken to make that happen
 

6029
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,149
it would have taken to make that happen
over 100 million years

6030
01:43:36,149 --> 01:43:36,159
over 100 million years
 

6031
01:43:36,159 --> 01:43:38,709
over 100 million years
yeah it's impossible they would had to

6032
01:43:38,709 --> 01:43:38,719
yeah it's impossible they would had to
 

6033
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,350
yeah it's impossible they would had to
have very strict you know guards at the

01:43:41,350 --> 01:43:41,360
have very strict you know guards at the

saying no you can't go well but just

6038
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:44,800
saying no you can't go well but just
 

6039
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,390
saying no you can't go well but just
just to clarify

6040
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:46,400
just to clarify
 

6041
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,830
just to clarify
you're not suggesting that's actually

6042
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
you're not suggesting that's actually
 

6043
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:48,870
you're not suggesting that's actually
possible

6044
01:43:48,870 --> 01:43:48,880
possible
 

6045
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:52,149
possible
i am suggesting it's possible i i don't

6046
01:43:52,149 --> 01:43:52,159
i am suggesting it's possible i i don't
 

6047

i am suggesting it's possible i i don't
know how you keep my silly human brain

6048
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:55,840
know how you keep my silly human brain
 

6049
01:43:55,840 --> 01:43:57,590
know how you keep my silly human brain
maybe it's a brain that values freedom

6050
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:57,600
maybe it's a brain that values freedom
 

6051
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,510
maybe it's a brain that values freedom
but i don't know how you can keep

6052
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520
but i don't know how you can keep
 

6053
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,669
but i don't know how you can keep
no matter how much force

6054
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:01,679
no matter how much force
 

6055
01:44:01,679 --> 01:44:04,390
no matter how much force
no matter how much censorship or control

no matter how much censorship or control
 

6057
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:07,270
no matter how much censorship or control
or so on i just don't uh know how you

6058
01:44:07,270 --> 01:44:07,280
or so on i just don't uh know how you
 

6059
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,350
or so on i just don't uh know how you
can keep people from

6060
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,360
can keep people from
 

6061
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,350
can keep people from
exploring into the mysterious into the

exploring into the mysterious into the
 

6063
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,470
exploring into the mysterious into the
end you're thinking of people we're

6064
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:12,480
end you're thinking of people we're
 

6065
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:14,149
end you're thinking of people we're
talking aliens so remember there's a

6066
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
talking aliens so remember there's a
 

6067
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:15,830
talking aliens so remember there's a
vast space of different possible social

vast space of different possible social
 

6069
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:17,350
vast space of different possible social
creatures they could have evolved from

different kinds of threats i mean there

01:44:21,669 --> 01:44:21,679
different kinds of threats i mean there
 

6075
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:23,030
different kinds of threats i mean there
are many things as you talked about that

6076
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:23,040
are many things as you talked about that
 

6077
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,870
are many things as you talked about that
most of us would feel very reluctant to

6078
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:24,880
most of us would feel very reluctant to
 

6079
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:27,189
most of us would feel very reluctant to
do yes this isn't one of those but okay

6080
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:27,199
do yes this isn't one of those but okay
 

6081
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:30,550
do yes this isn't one of those but okay
so how if the ufo sightings represent

6082
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
so how if the ufo sightings represent
 

6083
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,030
so how if the ufo sightings represent
alien visitors how the heck are they

6084
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:33,040
alien visitors how the heck are they
 

6085
01:44:33,040 --> 01:44:35,750
alien visitors how the heck are they
getting here under the transparent

6086
01:44:35,750 --> 01:44:35,760
getting here under the transparent
 

6087
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:38,229
getting here under the transparent
siblings so panspermia siblings is one

6088
01:44:38,229 --> 01:44:38,239
siblings so panspermia siblings is one
 

6089
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:40,149
siblings so panspermia siblings is one
part of the scenario which is that's

6090
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:40,159
part of the scenario which is that's
 

6091
01:44:40,159 --> 01:44:42,149
part of the scenario which is that's
where they came from and from that we

6092
01:44:42,149 --> 01:44:42,159
where they came from and from that we
 

6093
01:44:42,159 --> 01:44:43,750
where they came from and from that we
can conclude they had this rule against

6094
01:44:43,750 --> 01:44:43,760
can conclude they had this rule against
 

6095
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:45,350
can conclude they had this rule against
expansion and they've successfully

6096
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
expansion and they've successfully
 

6097
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,790
expansion and they've successfully
enforced that

6098
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
enforced that
 

6099
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:49,430
enforced that
that also creates a plausible agenda for

6100
01:44:49,430 --> 01:44:49,440
that also creates a plausible agenda for
 

6101
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:51,189
that also creates a plausible agenda for
why they would be here that is to

6102
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:51,199
why they would be here that is to
 

6103
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:53,990
why they would be here that is to
enforce that rule on us that is if we go

6104
01:44:53,990 --> 01:44:54,000
enforce that rule on us that is if we go
 

6105
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:55,990
enforce that rule on us that is if we go
out and expanding then we have defeated

6106
01:44:55,990 --> 01:44:56,000
out and expanding then we have defeated
 

6107
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,990
out and expanding then we have defeated
the purpose of this rule they set up

6108
01:44:57,990 --> 01:44:58,000
the purpose of this rule they set up
 

6109
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,030
the purpose of this rule they set up
interesting right so they would be here

6110
01:45:01,030 --> 01:45:01,040
interesting right so they would be here
 

6111
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,310
interesting right so they would be here
to convince us to not expand convincing

6112
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,320
to convince us to not expand convincing
 

6113
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:06,709
to convince us to not expand convincing
quotes right through various mechanisms

6114
01:45:06,709 --> 01:45:06,719
quotes right through various mechanisms
 

6115
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,629
quotes right through various mechanisms
so obviously one thing we conclude is

6116
01:45:08,629 --> 01:45:08,639
so obviously one thing we conclude is
 

6117
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:10,149
so obviously one thing we conclude is
they didn't just destroy us that would

6118
01:45:10,149 --> 01:45:10,159
they didn't just destroy us that would
 

6119
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,310
they didn't just destroy us that would
have been completely possible right so

6120
01:45:12,310 --> 01:45:12,320
have been completely possible right so
 

6121
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:13,669
have been completely possible right so
the fact that they're here and we are

6122
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
the fact that they're here and we are
 

6123
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,189
the fact that they're here and we are
not destroyed means that they chose not

6124
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
not destroyed means that they chose not
 

6125
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,870
not destroyed means that they chose not
to destroy us they have some degree of

6126
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
to destroy us they have some degree of
 

6127
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,270
to destroy us they have some degree of
empathy or you know whatever their

6128
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,280
empathy or you know whatever their
 

6129
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:22,950
empathy or you know whatever their
morals are that would make them

6130
01:45:22,950 --> 01:45:22,960
morals are that would make them
 

6131
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:24,709
morals are that would make them
reluctant to just destroy us they would

6132
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
reluctant to just destroy us they would
 

6133
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,470
reluctant to just destroy us they would
rather persuade us

6134
01:45:26,470 --> 01:45:26,480
rather persuade us
 

6135
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:28,709
rather persuade us
for their brethren and so they may have

6136
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:28,719
for their brethren and so they may have
 

6137
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,149
for their brethren and so they may have
been there's a difference between

6138
01:45:30,149 --> 01:45:30,159
been there's a difference between
 

6139
01:45:30,159 --> 01:45:32,709
been there's a difference between
arrival and observation they may have

6140
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:32,719
arrival and observation they may have
 

6141
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:34,550
arrival and observation they may have
been observing for a very long time

6142
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:34,560
been observing for a very long time
 

6143
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,629
been observing for a very long time
exactly and they arrive to try to

6144
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
exactly and they arrive to try to
 

6145
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,470
exactly and they arrive to try to
not to try

6146
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
not to try
 

6147
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:44,070
not to try
i don't think to ensure try to ensure

6148
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
i don't think to ensure try to ensure
 

6149
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,709
i don't think to ensure try to ensure
that we don't become grabby

6150
01:45:46,709 --> 01:45:46,719
that we don't become grabby
 

6151
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:48,470
that we don't become grabby
which is because that's we can see they

6152
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
which is because that's we can see they
 

6153
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,830
which is because that's we can see they
they did not they must have been forced

6154
01:45:49,830 --> 01:45:49,840
they did not they must have been forced
 

6155
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,669
they did not they must have been forced
to rule against that and they are

6156
01:45:51,669 --> 01:45:51,679
to rule against that and they are
 

6157
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:53,030
to rule against that and they are
therefore

6158
01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
therefore
 

6159
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,550
therefore
here to that's a plausible

6160
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:54,560
here to that's a plausible
 

6161
01:45:54,560 --> 01:45:56,229
here to that's a plausible
interpretation why they would risk this

6162
01:45:56,229 --> 01:45:56,239
interpretation why they would risk this
 

6163
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:57,830
interpretation why they would risk this
expedition when they clearly don't risk

6164
01:45:57,830 --> 01:45:57,840
expedition when they clearly don't risk
 

6165
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,510
expedition when they clearly don't risk
very many expeditions over this long

6166
01:45:59,510 --> 01:45:59,520
very many expeditions over this long
 

6167
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:01,270
very many expeditions over this long
period to allow this one exception

6168
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:01,280
period to allow this one exception
 

6169
01:46:01,280 --> 01:46:03,590
period to allow this one exception
because otherwise if they don't we may

6170
01:46:03,590 --> 01:46:03,600
because otherwise if they don't we may
 

6171
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:05,350
because otherwise if they don't we may
become grabby and they could have just

6172
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:05,360
become grabby and they could have just
 

6173
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,629
become grabby and they could have just
destroyed us but they didn't and they're

6174
01:46:06,629 --> 01:46:06,639
destroyed us but they didn't and they're
 

6175
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,030
destroyed us but they didn't and they're
closely monitoring the technological

nuclear weapons is one thing's like all

01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
nuclear weapons is one thing's like all
 

6181
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,990

right cool

that might have less to do with nuclear

6184
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,840
that might have less to do with nuclear
 

6185
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,070
that might have less to do with nuclear
weapons and more with nuclear energy

that we don't expand but they'd rather

that would be
 

6241
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,950
that would be
well within their abilities that's one

6242
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
well within their abilities that's one
 

6243
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,910
well within their abilities that's one
thing they could have done the other

thing they could have done the other
 

6245
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:10,229
thing they could have done the other
thing they could do is just show up and

01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:10,239
thing they could do is just show up and
 

6247

and they didn't do either of those
that's the next thing you need to

that's the next thing you need to
 

6259
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,669
that's the next thing you need to
explain about ufos azaleas why would

there so one so one do you think it's
obvious where the white house is

it's the most interesting thing

01:47:45,109 --> 01:47:45,119
it's the most interesting thing
 

6285
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:46,790
it's the most interesting thing
yeah about earth yeah

are you sure about this because

expansion then it would be worried about
 

6293
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:53,830
expansion then it would be worried about

of can pension obviously humans are the

6296
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
of can pension obviously humans are the
 

6297
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,510
of can pension obviously humans are the
civilization on earth that's

6298
01:47:57,510 --> 01:47:57,520
civilization on earth that's
 

6299
01:47:57,520 --> 01:47:58,950
civilization on earth that's
by far the closest to being able to

6300
01:47:58,950 --> 01:47:58,960
by far the closest to being able to
 

6301
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:02,149
by far the closest to being able to
expand i just don't know if aliens

6302
01:48:02,149 --> 01:48:02,159
expand i just don't know if aliens
 

6303
01:48:02,159 --> 01:48:07,750
expand i just don't know if aliens
obviously see

6304
01:48:07,750 --> 01:48:07,760

 

6305
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,790

obviously see humans like the individual

6306
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
obviously see humans like the individual
 

6307
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:13,030
obviously see humans like the individual
humans like the organ of the the meat

6308
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,040
humans like the organ of the the meat
 

6309
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:16,550
humans like the organ of the the meat
vehicles as the center of focus for

6310
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:16,560
vehicles as the center of focus for
 

6311
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,750
vehicles as the center of focus for
observing

6312
01:48:17,750 --> 01:48:17,760
observing
 

6313
01:48:17,760 --> 01:48:20,070
observing
a life on a planet they're supposed to

6314
01:48:20,070 --> 01:48:20,080
a life on a planet they're supposed to
 

6315
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:21,990
a life on a planet they're supposed to
be really smart and advanced like this

6316
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,000
be really smart and advanced like this
 

6317
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,390
be really smart and advanced like this
shouldn't be that hard for that but

6318
01:48:24,390 --> 01:48:24,400
shouldn't be that hard for that but
 

6319
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,149
shouldn't be that hard for that but
i think we're actually the dumb ones

6320
01:48:26,149 --> 01:48:26,159
i think we're actually the dumb ones
 

6321
01:48:26,159 --> 01:48:27,430
i think we're actually the dumb ones
because we think humans are the

6322
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
because we think humans are the
 

6323
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,270
because we think humans are the
important things but it could be

6324
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
important things but it could be
 

6325
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,750
important things but it could be
our ideas it could be something about

6326
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:31,760
our ideas it could be something about
 

6327
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:33,830
our ideas it could be something about
our technologies mediated with us that's

6328
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:33,840
our technologies mediated with us that's
 

6329
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:36,229
our technologies mediated with us that's
correlated with it now we make it

6330
01:48:36,229 --> 01:48:36,239
correlated with it now we make it
 

6331
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:38,390
correlated with it now we make it
seem like it's mediated

6332
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
seem like it's mediated
 

6333
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:42,470
seem like it's mediated
by us humans but the focus for alien

6334
01:48:42,470 --> 01:48:42,480
by us humans but the focus for alien
 

6335
01:48:42,480 --> 01:48:44,550
by us humans but the focus for alien
civilizations might be

6336
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,560
civilizations might be
 

6337
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,709
civilizations might be
the ai systems or the technologies

6338
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:46,719
the ai systems or the technologies
 

6339
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,870
the ai systems or the technologies
themselves that might be the organism

6340
01:48:48,870 --> 01:48:48,880
themselves that might be the organism
 

6341
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:51,830
themselves that might be the organism
like what humans are like uh

6342
01:48:51,830 --> 01:48:51,840
like what humans are like uh
 

6343
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,750
like what humans are like uh
okay human is the food

6344
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:53,760
okay human is the food
 

6345
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:56,310
okay human is the food
the the source of the organism that's

6346
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:56,320
the the source of the organism that's
 

6347
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:57,910
the the source of the organism that's
under observation

6348
01:48:57,910 --> 01:48:57,920
under observation
 

6349
01:48:57,920 --> 01:49:00,229
under observation
versus like so like the what they wanted

6350
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
versus like so like the what they wanted
 

6351
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:01,830
versus like so like the what they wanted
to have close contact with was something

6352
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:01,840
to have close contact with was something
 

6353
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:03,990
to have close contact with was something
that was closely near humans then they

6354
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
that was closely near humans then they
 

6355
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:05,830
that was closely near humans then they
would be contacting those and we would

6356
01:49:05,830 --> 01:49:05,840
would be contacting those and we would
 

6357
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:07,669
would be contacting those and we would
just incidentally see but we would still

6358
01:49:07,669 --> 01:49:07,679
just incidentally see but we would still
 

6359
01:49:07,679 --> 01:49:10,070
just incidentally see but we would still
see but don't you think they is isn't it

6360
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:10,080
see but don't you think they is isn't it
 

6361
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:11,270
see but don't you think they is isn't it
possible

6362
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
possible
 

6363
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:12,950
possible
taking their perspective

6364
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:12,960
taking their perspective
 

6365
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:14,310
taking their perspective
isn't it possible that they would want

6366
01:49:14,310 --> 01:49:14,320
isn't it possible that they would want
 

6367
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,790
isn't it possible that they would want
to interact with some fundamental aspect

6368
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
to interact with some fundamental aspect
 

6369
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:18,470
to interact with some fundamental aspect
that they're interested in

6370
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:18,480
that they're interested in
 

6371
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,950
that they're interested in
without interfering with it

6372
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
without interfering with it
 

6373
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,430
without interfering with it
and and that's actually a very no matter

6374
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
and and that's actually a very no matter
 

6375
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:25,109
and and that's actually a very no matter
how fast you are it's very difficult to

6376
01:49:25,109 --> 01:49:25,119
how fast you are it's very difficult to
 

6377
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:27,669
how fast you are it's very difficult to
do but that's puzzling so i mean the you

6378
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:27,679
do but that's puzzling so i mean the you
 

6379
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:30,790
do but that's puzzling so i mean the you
know the prototypical ufo observation

6380
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:30,800
know the prototypical ufo observation
 

6381
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,830
know the prototypical ufo observation
is a

6382
01:49:31,830 --> 01:49:31,840
is a
 

6383
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:33,109
is a
shiny

6384
01:49:33,109 --> 01:49:33,119
shiny
 

6385
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:34,070
shiny
big

6386
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,080
big
 

6387
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:37,189
big
object in the sky that has very rapid

6388
01:49:37,189 --> 01:49:37,199
object in the sky that has very rapid
 

6389
01:49:37,199 --> 01:49:39,109
object in the sky that has very rapid
acceleration and

6390
01:49:39,109 --> 01:49:39,119
acceleration and
 

6391
01:49:39,119 --> 01:49:41,830
acceleration and
no apparent you know surfaces for

6392
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:41,840
no apparent you know surfaces for
 

6393
01:49:41,840 --> 01:49:45,030
no apparent you know surfaces for
using air to to manipulate at speed

6394
01:49:45,030 --> 01:49:45,040
using air to to manipulate at speed
 

6395
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:45,830
using air to to manipulate at speed
um

6396
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:45,840
um
 

6397
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,070
um
you know and

6398
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
you know and
 

6399
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,790
you know and
the question is why that right again if

6400
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:50,800
the question is why that right again if
 

6401
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:52,149
the question is why that right again if
if they just for example if they just

6402
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
if they just for example if they just
 

6403
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,669
if they just for example if they just
wanted to talk to our computer systems

6404
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:53,679
wanted to talk to our computer systems
 

6405
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,750
wanted to talk to our computer systems
they could like move some sort of like a

6406
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:55,760
they could like move some sort of like a
 

6407
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:57,430
they could like move some sort of like a
little probe that like connects to a

6408
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:57,440
little probe that like connects to a
 

6409
01:49:57,440 --> 01:49:59,350
little probe that like connects to a
wire and like reads the

6410
01:49:59,350 --> 01:49:59,360
wire and like reads the
 

6411
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:00,790
wire and like reads the
reads and sends bits there they don't

6412
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:00,800
reads and sends bits there they don't
 

6413
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,830
reads and sends bits there they don't
need a shiny thing flying in the sky

6414
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:03,840
need a shiny thing flying in the sky
 

6415
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:05,430
need a shiny thing flying in the sky
but i don't you think they would be

6416
01:50:05,430 --> 01:50:05,440
but i don't you think they would be
 

6417
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:07,830
but i don't you think they would be
there they are would be looking for the

6418
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:07,840
there they are would be looking for the
 

6419
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,070
there they are would be looking for the
right way to communicate the right

6420
01:50:10,070 --> 01:50:10,080
right way to communicate the right
 

6421
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:11,350
right way to communicate the right
language to communicate everything you

6422
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:11,360
language to communicate everything you
 

6423
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:12,709
language to communicate everything you
just said

6424
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:12,719
just said
 

6425
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:14,470
just said
looking at the computer systems i mean

6426
01:50:14,470 --> 01:50:14,480
looking at the computer systems i mean
 

6427
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,790
looking at the computer systems i mean
that's not a trivial thing

6428
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
that's not a trivial thing
 

6429
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,830
that's not a trivial thing
coming up with a signal that us humans

6430
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:19,840
coming up with a signal that us humans
 

6431
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,790
coming up with a signal that us humans
would not freak out too much about but

6432
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:22,800
would not freak out too much about but
 

6433
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,790
would not freak out too much about but
also understand might not be that

6434
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:24,800
also understand might not be that
 

6435
01:50:24,800 --> 01:50:25,910
also understand might not be that
trivial

6436
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
trivial
 

6437
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,669
trivial
freak out apart is an another

6438
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:27,679
freak out apart is an another
 

6439
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:29,270
freak out apart is an another
interesting constraint so again i said

6440
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
interesting constraint so again i said
 

6441
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:30,950
interesting constraint so again i said
like the two obvious strategies are just

6442
01:50:30,950 --> 01:50:30,960
like the two obvious strategies are just
 

6443
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:32,950
like the two obvious strategies are just
to remain completely invisible and watch

6444
01:50:32,950 --> 01:50:32,960
to remain completely invisible and watch
 

6445
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:35,669
to remain completely invisible and watch
which would be quite feasible or to just

6446
01:50:35,669 --> 01:50:35,679
which would be quite feasible or to just
 

6447
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:37,510
which would be quite feasible or to just
directly interact let's come out and be

6448
01:50:37,510 --> 01:50:37,520
directly interact let's come out and be
 

6449
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,149
directly interact let's come out and be
really very direct right i mean there's

6450
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
really very direct right i mean there's
 

6451
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:41,430
really very direct right i mean there's
big things that you can see around

6452
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:41,440
big things that you can see around
 

6453
01:50:41,440 --> 01:50:42,950
big things that you can see around
there's big cities there's aircraft

6454
01:50:42,950 --> 01:50:42,960
there's big cities there's aircraft
 

6455
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:44,950
there's big cities there's aircraft
carriers there's there's lots of if you

6456
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
carriers there's there's lots of if you
 

6457
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,470
carriers there's there's lots of if you
want to just find a big thing and come

6458
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
want to just find a big thing and come
 

6459
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,470
want to just find a big thing and come
right up to it and like tap it on the

6460
01:50:48,470 --> 01:50:48,480
right up to it and like tap it on the
 

6461
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:49,910
right up to it and like tap it on the
shoulder or whatever that would be quite

6462
01:50:49,910 --> 01:50:49,920
shoulder or whatever that would be quite
 

6463
01:50:49,920 --> 01:50:53,510
shoulder or whatever that would be quite
feasible and they're not doing that so

6464
01:50:53,510 --> 01:50:53,520
feasible and they're not doing that so
 

6465
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:57,030
feasible and they're not doing that so
my hypothesis is that

6466
01:50:57,030 --> 01:50:57,040
my hypothesis is that
 

6467
01:50:57,040 --> 01:50:58,390
my hypothesis is that
one of the other questions there was do

6468
01:50:58,390 --> 01:50:58,400
one of the other questions there was do
 

6469
01:50:58,400 --> 01:50:59,830
one of the other questions there was do
they have a status hierarchy and might i

6470
01:50:59,830 --> 01:50:59,840
they have a status hierarchy and might i
 

6471
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:02,470
they have a status hierarchy and might i
think most animals on earth who are

6472
01:51:02,470 --> 01:51:02,480
think most animals on earth who are
 

6473
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:04,950
think most animals on earth who are
social animals have status hierarchy

6474
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:04,960
social animals have status hierarchy
 

6475
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,709
social animals have status hierarchy
and they would reasonably presume that

6476
01:51:06,709 --> 01:51:06,719
and they would reasonably presume that
 

6477
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,510
and they would reasonably presume that
we have a status hierarchy

6478
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:09,520
we have a status hierarchy
 

6479
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,070
we have a status hierarchy
and take me to your leader well i would

6480
01:51:12,070 --> 01:51:12,080
and take me to your leader well i would
 

6481
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:15,270
and take me to your leader well i would
say their strategy is to be impressive

6482
01:51:15,270 --> 01:51:15,280
say their strategy is to be impressive
 

6483
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:17,510
say their strategy is to be impressive
and sort of get us to see them at the

6484
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:17,520
and sort of get us to see them at the
 

6485
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:20,870
and sort of get us to see them at the
top of our status hierarchy just to just

6486
01:51:20,870 --> 01:51:20,880
top of our status hierarchy just to just
 

6487
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:21,750
top of our status hierarchy just to just
to

6488
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:21,760
to
 

6489
01:51:21,760 --> 01:51:22,629
to
you know

6490
01:51:22,629 --> 01:51:22,639
you know
 

6491
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:24,550
you know
that's how for example we domesticate

6492
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:24,560
that's how for example we domesticate
 

6493
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:26,709
that's how for example we domesticate
dogs right we convince dogs we're the

6494
01:51:26,709 --> 01:51:26,719
dogs right we convince dogs we're the
 

6495
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:28,550
dogs right we convince dogs we're the
leader of their pack

6496
01:51:28,550 --> 01:51:28,560
leader of their pack
 

6497
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:30,310
leader of their pack
right and we domesticate many animals

6498
01:51:30,310 --> 01:51:30,320
right and we domesticate many animals
 

6499
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:32,870
right and we domesticate many animals
that way but as we we just swap into the

6500
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
that way but as we we just swap into the
 

6501
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,790
that way but as we we just swap into the
top of their status hierarchy and we say

6502
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
top of their status hierarchy and we say
 

6503
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,950
top of their status hierarchy and we say
we're your top status animals so you

6504
01:51:36,950 --> 01:51:36,960
we're your top status animals so you
 

6505
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,310
we're your top status animals so you
should do what we say you should follow

6506
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:38,320
should do what we say you should follow
 

6507
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:39,589
should do what we say you should follow
our lead

6508
01:51:39,589 --> 01:51:39,599
our lead
 

6509
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:40,310
our lead
so

6510
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
so
 

6511
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,070
so
the idea that would be

6512
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:42,080
the idea that would be
 

6513
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,830
the idea that would be
they are going to get us to do what they

6514
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:43,840
they are going to get us to do what they
 

6515
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:45,910
they are going to get us to do what they
want by

6516
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:45,920
want by
 

6517
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:46,790
want by
being

6518
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:46,800
being
 

6519
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:48,470
being
top status

6520
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480
top status
 

6521
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,149
top status
you know all through history kings and

6522
01:51:50,149 --> 01:51:50,159
you know all through history kings and
 

6523
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:51,990
you know all through history kings and
emperors etcetera have tried to impress

6524
01:51:51,990 --> 01:51:52,000
emperors etcetera have tried to impress
 

6525
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:53,350
emperors etcetera have tried to impress
their citizens and other people by

6526
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:53,360
their citizens and other people by
 

6527
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:54,790
their citizens and other people by
having the bigger palace the bigger

6528
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:54,800
having the bigger palace the bigger
 

6529
01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:57,189
having the bigger palace the bigger
parade the bigger crown and diamonds

6530
01:51:57,189 --> 01:51:57,199
parade the bigger crown and diamonds
 

6531
01:51:57,199 --> 01:51:59,189
parade the bigger crown and diamonds
right whatever maybe building a bigger

6532
01:51:59,189 --> 01:51:59,199
right whatever maybe building a bigger
 

6533
01:51:59,199 --> 01:52:00,870
right whatever maybe building a bigger
pyramid et cetera just it's a very well

6534
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
pyramid et cetera just it's a very well
 

6535
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,910
pyramid et cetera just it's a very well
established trend to just be high status

6536
01:52:03,910 --> 01:52:03,920
established trend to just be high status
 

6537
01:52:03,920 --> 01:52:05,669
established trend to just be high status
by being more impressive than the rest

6538
01:52:05,669 --> 01:52:05,679
by being more impressive than the rest
 

6539
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,470
by being more impressive than the rest
to push back when there's an order of uh

6540
01:52:08,470 --> 01:52:08,480
to push back when there's an order of uh
 

6541
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:10,629
to push back when there's an order of uh
several orders of magnitude of power

6542
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
several orders of magnitude of power
 

6543
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,430
several orders of magnitude of power
differential asymmetry of power i feel

6544
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:13,440
differential asymmetry of power i feel
 

6545
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:15,350
differential asymmetry of power i feel
like that status hierarchy no longer

6546
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,360
like that status hierarchy no longer
 

6547
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,510
like that status hierarchy no longer
applies it's like memetic theory it's

6548
01:52:17,510 --> 01:52:17,520
applies it's like memetic theory it's
 

6549
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:19,669
applies it's like memetic theory it's
like most emperors are several orders of

6550
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
like most emperors are several orders of
 

6551
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,510
like most emperors are several orders of
magnitude more powerful than anyone okay

6552
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:21,520
magnitude more powerful than anyone okay
 

6553
01:52:21,520 --> 01:52:23,189
magnitude more powerful than anyone okay
a member of their empire uh let's

6554
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:23,199
a member of their empire uh let's
 

6555
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:24,229
a member of their empire uh let's
increase

6556
01:52:24,229 --> 01:52:24,239
increase
 

6557
01:52:24,239 --> 01:52:26,629
increase
that by even more so like if i'm

6558
01:52:26,629 --> 01:52:26,639
that by even more so like if i'm
 

6559
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:28,390
that by even more so like if i'm
interacting with ants

6560
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:28,400
interacting with ants
 

6561
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,589
interacting with ants
right

6562
01:52:29,589 --> 01:52:29,599
right
 

6563
01:52:29,599 --> 01:52:31,910
right
i no longer feel like i need to

6564
01:52:31,910 --> 01:52:31,920
i no longer feel like i need to
 

6565
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,550
i no longer feel like i need to
establish my power with ants i actually

6566
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:34,560
establish my power with ants i actually
 

6567
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,470
establish my power with ants i actually
want to lessen

6568
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:36,480
want to lessen
 

6569
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:39,669
want to lessen
i i want to lower myself to the ants i

6570
01:52:39,669 --> 01:52:39,679
i i want to lower myself to the ants i
 

6571
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:42,310
i i want to lower myself to the ants i
want to become the lowest possible and

6572
01:52:42,310 --> 01:52:42,320
want to become the lowest possible and
 

6573
01:52:42,320 --> 01:52:44,390
want to become the lowest possible and
so that they would welcome me

6574
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:44,400
so that they would welcome me
 

6575
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:46,070
so that they would welcome me
so i'm less concerned about them

6576
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:46,080
so i'm less concerned about them
 

6577
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:47,830
so i'm less concerned about them
worshipping me i'm more concerned about

6578
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
worshipping me i'm more concerned about
 

6579
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,910
worshipping me i'm more concerned about
them welcoming me into it it is

6580
01:52:49,910 --> 01:52:49,920
them welcoming me into it it is
 

6581
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:51,589
them welcoming me into it it is
important that you be non-threatening

6582
01:52:51,589 --> 01:52:51,599
important that you be non-threatening
 

6583
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,030
important that you be non-threatening
and that you be local so i think for

6584
01:52:53,030 --> 01:52:53,040
and that you be local so i think for
 

6585
01:52:53,040 --> 01:52:54,470
and that you be local so i think for
example if the aliens had done something

6586
01:52:54,470 --> 01:52:54,480
example if the aliens had done something
 

6587
01:52:54,480 --> 01:52:56,470
example if the aliens had done something
really big in the sky you know 100 light

6588
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
really big in the sky you know 100 light
 

6589
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:57,589
really big in the sky you know 100 light
years away

6590
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:57,599
years away
 

6591
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,990
years away
that would be there not here yes and

6592
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
that would be there not here yes and
 

6593
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,070
that would be there not here yes and
that could seem threatening so i think

6594
01:53:02,070 --> 01:53:02,080
that could seem threatening so i think
 

6595
01:53:02,080 --> 01:53:03,589
that could seem threatening so i think
their strategy to be the high status

6596
01:53:03,589 --> 01:53:03,599
their strategy to be the high status
 

6597
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:05,430
their strategy to be the high status
would have to be to be visible but be

6598
01:53:05,430 --> 01:53:05,440
would have to be to be visible but be
 

6599
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:06,950
would have to be to be visible but be
here and non-threatening i just don't

6600
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
here and non-threatening i just don't
 

6601
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:09,270
here and non-threatening i just don't
know if it's obvious how to do that

6602
01:53:09,270 --> 01:53:09,280
know if it's obvious how to do that
 

6603
01:53:09,280 --> 01:53:10,950
know if it's obvious how to do that
like take your own perspective if you

6604
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:10,960
like take your own perspective if you
 

6605
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:12,790
like take your own perspective if you
see a planet

6606
01:53:12,790 --> 01:53:12,800
see a planet
 

6607
01:53:12,800 --> 01:53:14,310
see a planet
with

6608
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,320
with
 

6609
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:16,709
with
with relatively intelligent like complex

6610
01:53:16,709 --> 01:53:16,719
with relatively intelligent like complex
 

6611
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:19,270
with relatively intelligent like complex
structures being formed like uh

6612
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:19,280
structures being formed like uh
 

6613
01:53:19,280 --> 01:53:21,270
structures being formed like uh
yeah life forms you could see this

6614
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
yeah life forms you could see this
 

6615
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:23,589
yeah life forms you could see this
under in titan or something like that

6616
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:23,599
under in titan or something like that
 

6617
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:27,189
under in titan or something like that
the moon you know right europa

6618
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
the moon you know right europa
 

6619
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:29,030
the moon you know right europa
you start to see not just primitive

6620
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:29,040
you start to see not just primitive
 

6621
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:31,109
you start to see not just primitive
bacterial life but multicellular life

6622
01:53:31,109 --> 01:53:31,119
bacterial life but multicellular life
 

6623
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:32,790
bacterial life but multicellular life
and it seems to form some very

6624
01:53:32,790 --> 01:53:32,800
and it seems to form some very
 

6625
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,310
and it seems to form some very
complicated cellular uh colonies

6626
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:36,320
complicated cellular uh colonies
 

6627
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,550
complicated cellular uh colonies
structures that they're they're dynamic

6628
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:38,560
structures that they're they're dynamic
 

6629
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:40,709
structures that they're they're dynamic
there's a lot of stuff going on some

6630
01:53:40,709 --> 01:53:40,719
there's a lot of stuff going on some
 

6631
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:43,270
there's a lot of stuff going on some
some giant gigantic cellular automata

6632
01:53:43,270 --> 01:53:43,280
some giant gigantic cellular automata
 

6633
01:53:43,280 --> 01:53:45,270
some giant gigantic cellular automata
type of construct

6634
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,280
type of construct
 

6635
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:48,310
type of construct
how do you make yourself

6636
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
how do you make yourself
 

6637
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,990
how do you make yourself
known to them

6638
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,000
known to them
 

6639
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,990
known to them
in an impressive fashion

6640
01:53:51,990 --> 01:53:52,000
in an impressive fashion
 

6641
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,470
in an impressive fashion
without destroying it

6642
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:54,480
without destroying it
 

6643
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:56,870
without destroying it
like we know how to destroy potentially

6644
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:56,880
like we know how to destroy potentially
 

6645
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,070
like we know how to destroy potentially
right so

6646
01:53:58,070 --> 01:53:58,080
right so
 

6647
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:00,149
right so
so if you go touch stuff you're likely

6648
01:54:00,149 --> 01:54:00,159
so if you go touch stuff you're likely
 

6649
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:01,910
so if you go touch stuff you're likely
to hurt it right there's a good risk of

6650
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:01,920
to hurt it right there's a good risk of
 

6651
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,350
to hurt it right there's a good risk of
hurting something by touch getting too

6652
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:03,360
hurting something by touch getting too
 

6653
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:04,709
hurting something by touch getting too
close and touching it and interacting

6654
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
close and touching it and interacting
 

6655
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,390
close and touching it and interacting
right yeah like landing on a white house

6656
01:54:06,390 --> 01:54:06,400
right yeah like landing on a white house
 

6657
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:09,430
right yeah like landing on a white house
lawn right so the claim is

6658
01:54:09,430 --> 01:54:09,440
lawn right so the claim is
 

6659
01:54:09,440 --> 01:54:11,990
lawn right so the claim is
that their current strategy of hanging

6660
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,000
that their current strategy of hanging
 

6661
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,750
that their current strategy of hanging
out at the periphery of our vision and

6662
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760
out at the periphery of our vision and
 

6663
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:15,669
out at the periphery of our vision and
just being very clearly physically

6664
01:54:15,669 --> 01:54:15,679
just being very clearly physically
 

6665
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,189
just being very clearly physically
impressive with very clear physically

6666
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
impressive with very clear physically
 

6667
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,270
impressive with very clear physically
impressive abilities

6668
01:54:19,270 --> 01:54:19,280
impressive abilities
 

6669
01:54:19,280 --> 01:54:20,390
impressive abilities
is

6670
01:54:20,390 --> 01:54:20,400
is
 

6671
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:22,310
is
at least a plausible strategy they might

6672
01:54:22,310 --> 01:54:22,320
at least a plausible strategy they might
 

6673
01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:25,270
at least a plausible strategy they might
use to impress us and convince us sort

6674
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
use to impress us and convince us sort
 

6675
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:26,470
use to impress us and convince us sort
of we're at the top of their status

6676
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:26,480
of we're at the top of their status
 

6677
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:28,070
of we're at the top of their status
hierarchy

6678
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
hierarchy
 

6679
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,070
hierarchy
and i would say if they if they came

6680
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,080
and i would say if they if they came
 

6681
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,589
and i would say if they if they came
closer not only would they risk hurting

6682
01:54:31,589 --> 01:54:31,599
closer not only would they risk hurting
 

6683
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,109
closer not only would they risk hurting
us in ways that they couldn't really

6684
01:54:33,109 --> 01:54:33,119
us in ways that they couldn't really
 

6685
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:35,589
us in ways that they couldn't really
understand but more plausibly they would

6686
01:54:35,589 --> 01:54:35,599
understand but more plausibly they would
 

6687
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:37,109
understand but more plausibly they would
reveal things about themselves we would

6688
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
reveal things about themselves we would
 

6689
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,870
reveal things about themselves we would
hate so if you look at

6690
01:54:38,870 --> 01:54:38,880
hate so if you look at
 

6691
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,109
hate so if you look at
how we treat other civilizations on

6692
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:41,119
how we treat other civilizations on
 

6693
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:42,870
how we treat other civilizations on
earth and other people

6694
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:42,880
earth and other people
 

6695
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:44,790
earth and other people
we are generally you know

6696
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:44,800
we are generally you know
 

6697
01:54:44,800 --> 01:54:46,709
we are generally you know
interested in foreigners and people from

6698
01:54:46,709 --> 01:54:46,719
interested in foreigners and people from
 

6699
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:48,709
interested in foreigners and people from
other plant lands and we were generally

6700
01:54:48,709 --> 01:54:48,719
other plant lands and we were generally
 

6701
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:50,709
other plant lands and we were generally
interested in their varying cult customs

6702
01:54:50,709 --> 01:54:50,719
interested in their varying cult customs
 

6703
01:54:50,719 --> 01:54:52,709
interested in their varying cult customs
et cetera until we find out that they do

6704
01:54:52,709 --> 01:54:52,719
et cetera until we find out that they do
 

6705
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,310
et cetera until we find out that they do
something that violates our moral norms

6706
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:54,320
something that violates our moral norms
 

6707
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:56,709
something that violates our moral norms
and then we hate them

6708
01:54:56,709 --> 01:54:56,719
and then we hate them
 

6709
01:54:56,719 --> 01:54:58,390
and then we hate them
and these are aliens for god's sakes

6710
01:54:58,390 --> 01:54:58,400
and these are aliens for god's sakes
 

6711
01:54:58,400 --> 01:54:59,510
and these are aliens for god's sakes
right

6712
01:54:59,510 --> 01:54:59,520
right
 

6713
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:00,870
right
there's just going to be something about

6714
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
there's just going to be something about
 

6715
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,550
there's just going to be something about
them that we hate they eat babies who

6716
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:02,560
them that we hate they eat babies who
 

6717
01:55:02,560 --> 01:55:04,950
them that we hate they eat babies who
knows what it is but something they

6718
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
knows what it is but something they
 

6719
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:06,709
knows what it is but something they
don't think is offensive but that they

6720
01:55:06,709 --> 01:55:06,719
don't think is offensive but that they
 

6721
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:08,870
don't think is offensive but that they
think we might find and so they they

6722
01:55:08,870 --> 01:55:08,880
think we might find and so they they
 

6723
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:10,709
think we might find and so they they
would be risking a lot by revealing a

6724
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719
would be risking a lot by revealing a
 

6725
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:12,149
would be risking a lot by revealing a
lot about themselves we would find

6726
01:55:12,149 --> 01:55:12,159
lot about themselves we would find
 

6727
01:55:12,159 --> 01:55:13,589
lot about themselves we would find
something we hated

6728
01:55:13,589 --> 01:55:13,599
something we hated
 

6729
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:15,910
something we hated
interesting but do you uh resonate at

6730
01:55:15,910 --> 01:55:15,920
interesting but do you uh resonate at
 

6731
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:16,870
interesting but do you uh resonate at
all with

6732
01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:16,880
all with
 

6733
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,510
all with
memetic theory where like we only feel

6734
01:55:19,510 --> 01:55:19,520
memetic theory where like we only feel
 

6735
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:20,870
memetic theory where like we only feel
this way about things that are very

6736
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:20,880
this way about things that are very
 

6737
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,870
this way about things that are very
close to us so aliens are sufficiently

6738
01:55:22,870 --> 01:55:22,880
close to us so aliens are sufficiently
 

6739
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,870
close to us so aliens are sufficiently
different to where we'll be like

6740
01:55:24,870 --> 01:55:24,880
different to where we'll be like
 

6741
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,109
different to where we'll be like
fascinated terrified or fascinated but

6742
01:55:27,109 --> 01:55:27,119
fascinated terrified or fascinated but
 

6743
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,629
fascinated terrified or fascinated but
not like right but if they want to be at

6744
01:55:28,629 --> 01:55:28,639
not like right but if they want to be at
 

6745
01:55:28,639 --> 01:55:30,470
not like right but if they want to be at
the top of our status hierarchy to get

6746
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
the top of our status hierarchy to get
 

6747
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,070
the top of our status hierarchy to get
us to follow them they can't be too

6748
01:55:32,070 --> 01:55:32,080
us to follow them they can't be too
 

6749
01:55:32,080 --> 01:55:34,310
us to follow them they can't be too
distant they have to be close enough

6750
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:34,320
distant they have to be close enough
 

6751
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:36,229
distant they have to be close enough
that we would see them that way but

6752
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:36,239
that we would see them that way but
 

6753
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,070
that we would see them that way but
pretend to be close enough right right

6754
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:38,080
pretend to be close enough right right
 

6755
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:40,390
pretend to be close enough right right
and not reveal much that mystery that

6756
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:40,400
and not reveal much that mystery that
 

6757
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:42,950
and not reveal much that mystery that
old clintus would right cowboy

6758
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:42,960
old clintus would right cowboy
 

6759
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:44,470
old clintus would right cowboy
let me see

6760
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
let me see
 

6761
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,990
let me see
we're clever enough that we can figure

6762
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
we're clever enough that we can figure
 

6763
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,589
we're clever enough that we can figure
out their agenda that is just from the

6764
01:55:47,589 --> 01:55:47,599
out their agenda that is just from the
 

6765
01:55:47,599 --> 01:55:48,709
out their agenda that is just from the
fact that we're here if we see that

6766
01:55:48,709 --> 01:55:48,719
fact that we're here if we see that
 

6767
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:50,149
fact that we're here if we see that
they're here we can figure out oh they

6768
01:55:50,149 --> 01:55:50,159
they're here we can figure out oh they
 

6769
01:55:50,159 --> 01:55:52,870
they're here we can figure out oh they
want us not to expand and look they are

6770
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:52,880
want us not to expand and look they are
 

6771
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:54,070
want us not to expand and look they are
this huge power and they're very

6772
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:54,080
this huge power and they're very
 

6773
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:55,990
this huge power and they're very
impressive so and a lot of us don't want

6774
01:55:55,990 --> 01:55:56,000
impressive so and a lot of us don't want
 

6775
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,990
impressive so and a lot of us don't want
to expand so that could easily tip us

there's some graphs that i've been

6842
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
there's some graphs that i've been
 

6843
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:10,229
there's some graphs that i've been
impressed by that show sort of the level

01:57:10,229 --> 01:57:10,239
impressed by that show sort of the level
 

6845
01:57:10,239 --> 01:57:13,030
impressed by that show sort of the level
of genetic information in various kinds

of life on the history of earth

of life on the history of earth
 

6849
01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:16,229
of life on the history of earth
and basically

6850
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:16,239
and basically
 

6851
01:57:16,239 --> 01:57:18,470
and basically
we are now more complex than the earlier

6852
01:57:18,470 --> 01:57:18,480
we are now more complex than the earlier
 

6853
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,910
we are now more complex than the earlier
life but the earlier life was still

6854
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:19,920
life but the earlier life was still
 

6855
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,510
life but the earlier life was still
pretty damn complex

6856
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:21,520
pretty damn complex
 

6857
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,350
pretty damn complex
and so if you actually you know project

6858
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
and so if you actually you know project
 

6859
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:25,350
and so if you actually you know project
this log graph in history it looks like

this log graph in history it looks like
 

6861
01:57:25,360 --> 01:57:27,430
this log graph in history it looks like
it was many billions of years ago when

6862
01:57:27,430 --> 01:57:27,440
it was many billions of years ago when
 

6863
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,510
it was many billions of years ago when
you get down to zero so like plausibly

6864
01:57:29,510 --> 01:57:29,520
you get down to zero so like plausibly
 

6865
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:30,870
you get down to zero so like plausibly
you could say there was just a lot of

01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:30,880
you could say there was just a lot of
 

6867
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,709
you could say there was just a lot of
evolution that had to happen before you

01:57:32,709 --> 01:57:32,719
evolution that had to happen before you
 

6869
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:34,390
evolution that had to happen before you
to get to the simplest life we've ever

6870
01:57:34,390 --> 01:57:34,400
to get to the simplest life we've ever
 

6871
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:35,669
to get to the simplest life we've ever
seen in history of life on earth was

6872
01:57:35,669 --> 01:57:35,679
seen in history of life on earth was
 

6873
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,430
seen in history of life on earth was
still pretty damn complicated

6874
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:37,440
still pretty damn complicated
 

6875
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:40,070
still pretty damn complicated
okay and so that race that's always been

6876
01:57:40,070 --> 01:57:40,080
okay and so that race that's always been
 

6877
01:57:40,080 --> 01:57:42,149
okay and so that race that's always been
this puzzle how could life get to this

6878
01:57:42,149 --> 01:57:42,159
this puzzle how could life get to this
 

6879
01:57:42,159 --> 01:57:44,070
this puzzle how could life get to this
enormously complicated level in the

6880
01:57:44,070 --> 01:57:44,080
enormously complicated level in the
 

6881
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:46,229
enormously complicated level in the
short period it seems to

6882
01:57:46,229 --> 01:57:46,239
short period it seems to
 

6883
01:57:46,239 --> 01:57:48,790
short period it seems to
at the beginning of earth history so

6884
01:57:48,790 --> 01:57:48,800
at the beginning of earth history so
 

6885
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:50,870
at the beginning of earth history so
where you know it's only 300 million

6886
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
where you know it's only 300 million
 

6887
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:53,589
where you know it's only 300 million
years at most it appeared and then it

6888
01:57:53,589 --> 01:57:53,599
years at most it appeared and then it
 

6889
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:56,390
years at most it appeared and then it
was really complicated at that point so

6890
01:57:56,390 --> 01:57:56,400
was really complicated at that point so
 

6891
01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:58,310
was really complicated at that point so
panspermia allows you to explain that

6892
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
panspermia allows you to explain that
 

6893
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,310
panspermia allows you to explain that
complexity by saying well it spent

6894
01:58:00,310 --> 01:58:00,320
complexity by saying well it spent
 

6895
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,149
complexity by saying well it spent
another five billion years on another

etc that that's a plausible set of
 

6973
01:59:15,599 --> 01:59:16,950
etc that that's a plausible set of
explanations for

6974
01:59:16,950 --> 01:59:16,960
explanations for
 

6975
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,790

organization somewhere that has much
more advanced capabilities than

01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:27,199
more advanced capabilities than
 

6987
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:29,350
more advanced capabilities than
anybody's given it credit for for some

anybody's given it credit for for some
reason it's been keeping secret i mean

01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:34,080
they all sound somewhat implausible but
 

6993
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:35,350
they all sound somewhat implausible but
again we're looking for maybe you know

6994
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:35,360
again we're looking for maybe you know
 

6995
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,589
again we're looking for maybe you know
one in a thousand sort of priors

6996
01:59:37,589 --> 01:59:37,599
one in a thousand sort of priors
 

6997
01:59:37,599 --> 01:59:39,109
one in a thousand sort of priors
the question is you know

6998
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:39,119
the question is you know
 

6999
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:41,589
the question is you know
could could they be in that level of

7000
01:59:41,589 --> 01:59:41,599
could could they be in that level of
 

7001
01:59:41,599 --> 01:59:43,910
could could they be in that level of
plausibility can we just linger on this

7002
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:43,920
plausibility can we just linger on this
 

7003
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:47,350
plausibility can we just linger on this

we explore but let me on this topic

7018
02:00:01,589 --> 02:00:01,599
we explore but let me on this topic
 

7019
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:03,669
we explore but let me on this topic
ask about conspiracy theories because

7020
02:00:03,669 --> 02:00:03,679
ask about conspiracy theories because
 

7021
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:06,709
ask about conspiracy theories because
you've written about institutions on

7022
02:00:06,709 --> 02:00:06,719
you've written about institutions on
 

7023
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:11,109

authorities

7024
02:00:11,109 --> 02:00:11,119

 

7025
02:00:11,119 --> 02:00:13,589

what um this is a bit of a therapy

7026
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:13,599
what um this is a bit of a therapy
 

7027
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:16,629
what um this is a bit of a therapy
session but uh

7028
02:00:16,629 --> 02:00:16,639
session but uh
 

7029
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:19,350
session but uh
what do we make of conspiracy theories

7030
02:00:19,350 --> 02:00:19,360
what do we make of conspiracy theories
 

7031
02:00:19,360 --> 02:00:21,109
what do we make of conspiracy theories
the phrase itself is

7032
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
the phrase itself is
 

7033
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:23,430
the phrase itself is
pushing you in a direction right so so

7034
02:00:23,430 --> 02:00:23,440
pushing you in a direction right so so
 

7035
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,629
pushing you in a direction right so so
clearly in history there we've had many

7036
02:00:26,629 --> 02:00:26,639
clearly in history there we've had many
 

7037
02:00:26,639 --> 02:00:28,709
clearly in history there we've had many
large coordinated keepings of secrets

7038
02:00:28,709 --> 02:00:28,719
large coordinated keepings of secrets
 

7039
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:30,390
large coordinated keepings of secrets
right say the manhattan project right

7040
02:00:30,390 --> 02:00:30,400
right say the manhattan project right
 

7041
02:00:30,400 --> 02:00:31,510
right say the manhattan project right
and there was a lot of hundreds of

7042
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:31,520
and there was a lot of hundreds of
 

7043
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:33,350
and there was a lot of hundreds of
thousands of people working on that

7044
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:33,360
thousands of people working on that
 

7045
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:35,270
thousands of people working on that
over many years but they they kept it a

7046
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
over many years but they they kept it a
 

7047
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:37,830
over many years but they they kept it a
secret right clearly many large military

7048
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:37,840
secret right clearly many large military
 

7049
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:41,430
secret right clearly many large military
operations have kept things secrets over

7050
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:41,440
operations have kept things secrets over
 

7051
02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:43,189
operations have kept things secrets over
you know even decades

7052
02:00:43,189 --> 02:00:43,199
you know even decades
 

7053
02:00:43,199 --> 02:00:45,270
you know even decades
with many thousands of people involved

7054
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:45,280
with many thousands of people involved
 

7055
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:47,510
with many thousands of people involved
so clearly it's possible to keep

7056
02:00:47,510 --> 02:00:47,520
so clearly it's possible to keep
 

7057
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:50,470
so clearly it's possible to keep
something secret over time periods

7058
02:00:50,470 --> 02:00:50,480
something secret over time periods
 

7059
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:51,350
something secret over time periods
um

7060
02:00:51,350 --> 02:00:51,360
um
 

7061
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:53,270
um
you know but the more people you involve

7062
02:00:53,270 --> 02:00:53,280
you know but the more people you involve
 

7063
02:00:53,280 --> 02:00:55,589
you know but the more people you involve
and the more time you're assuming and

7064
02:00:55,589 --> 02:00:55,599
and the more time you're assuming and
 

7065
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:58,070
and the more time you're assuming and
the more the less centralized an

7066
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
the more the less centralized an
 

7067
02:00:58,080 --> 02:00:59,589
the more the less centralized an
organization or the less discipline they

7068
02:00:59,589 --> 02:00:59,599
organization or the less discipline they
 

7069
02:00:59,599 --> 02:01:01,510
organization or the less discipline they
have the harder it gets to believe but

7070
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
have the harder it gets to believe but
 

7071
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,350
have the harder it gets to believe but
we're just trying to calibrate basically

7072
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
we're just trying to calibrate basically
 

7073
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:04,470
we're just trying to calibrate basically
in our minds

7074
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:04,480
in our minds
 

7075
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:06,149
in our minds
which kind of secrets can be kept by

7076
02:01:06,149 --> 02:01:06,159
which kind of secrets can be kept by
 

7077
02:01:06,159 --> 02:01:07,669
which kind of secrets can be kept by
which groups over what time periods for

7078
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
which groups over what time periods for
 

7079
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,229
which groups over what time periods for
what purposes right but let me uh i

7080
02:01:10,229 --> 02:01:10,239
what purposes right but let me uh i
 

7081
02:01:10,239 --> 02:01:11,830
what purposes right but let me uh i
don't have enough data

7082
02:01:11,830 --> 02:01:11,840
don't have enough data
 

7083
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,990
don't have enough data
so i'm somebody

7084
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:14,000
so i'm somebody
 

7085
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:16,790
so i'm somebody
i you know i hang out with people and i

7086
02:01:16,790 --> 02:01:16,800
i you know i hang out with people and i
 

7087
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:19,669
i you know i hang out with people and i
love people i love all things really and

7088
02:01:19,669 --> 02:01:19,679
love people i love all things really and
 

7089
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:21,030
love people i love all things really and
i just

7090
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:21,040
i just
 

7091
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,189
i just
i think that most people even the

7092
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
i think that most people even the
 

7093
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:25,830
i think that most people even the
 have the capacity to be good

7094
02:01:25,830 --> 02:01:25,840
have the capacity to be good
 

7095
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:28,390
have the capacity to be good
and they're beautiful and i enjoy them

7096
02:01:28,390 --> 02:01:28,400
and they're beautiful and i enjoy them
 

7097
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,950
and they're beautiful and i enjoy them
so the kind of data my brain whatever

uh suffer at scale but of course say

7262
02:04:39,669 --> 02:04:39,679
uh suffer at scale but of course say
 

7263
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,589
uh suffer at scale but of course say
during wartime the people who are

7264
02:04:41,589 --> 02:04:41,599
during wartime the people who are
 

7265
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,430
during wartime the people who are
managing the various conspiracies like

7266
02:04:43,430 --> 02:04:43,440
managing the various conspiracies like
 

7267
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:45,830
managing the various conspiracies like
d-day or manhattan projects they thought

7268
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
d-day or manhattan projects they thought
 

7269
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:48,310
d-day or manhattan projects they thought
that their conspiracy was

7270
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
that their conspiracy was
 

7271
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,870
that their conspiracy was
avoiding harm rather than causing harm

7272
02:04:50,870 --> 02:04:50,880
avoiding harm rather than causing harm
 

7273
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:52,229
avoiding harm rather than causing harm
so if you can get a lot of people to

7274
02:04:52,229 --> 02:04:52,239
so if you can get a lot of people to
 

7275
02:04:52,239 --> 02:04:53,910
so if you can get a lot of people to
think that supporting the comparison

7276
02:04:53,910 --> 02:04:53,920
think that supporting the comparison
 

7277
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:55,589
think that supporting the comparison
conspiracy is

7278
02:04:55,589 --> 02:04:55,599
conspiracy is
 

7279
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:58,629
conspiracy is
helpful then a lot more might do that

7280
02:04:58,629 --> 02:04:58,639
helpful then a lot more might do that
 

7281
02:04:58,639 --> 02:05:00,550
helpful then a lot more might do that
and there's just a lot of things that

7282
02:05:00,550 --> 02:05:00,560
and there's just a lot of things that
 

7283
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:02,870
and there's just a lot of things that
people just don't want to see

7284
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:02,880
people just don't want to see
 

7285
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:04,390
people just don't want to see
so if you can make your conspiracy the

7286
02:05:04,390 --> 02:05:04,400
so if you can make your conspiracy the
 

7287
02:05:04,400 --> 02:05:05,830
so if you can make your conspiracy the
sort of thing that people wouldn't want

7288
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
sort of thing that people wouldn't want
 

7289
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:07,350
sort of thing that people wouldn't want
to talk about anyway even if they knew

7290
02:05:07,350 --> 02:05:07,360
to talk about anyway even if they knew
 

7291
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,470
to talk about anyway even if they knew
about it

7292
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:08,480
about it
 

7293
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:11,350
about it
you're you know most of the way there so

7294
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
you're you know most of the way there so
 

7295
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,270
you're you know most of the way there so
i have learned many over the years many

7296
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:13,280
i have learned many over the years many
 

7297
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,430
i have learned many over the years many
things that most ordinary people should

7298
02:05:15,430 --> 02:05:15,440
things that most ordinary people should
 

7299
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,189
things that most ordinary people should
be interested in but somehow don't know

7300
02:05:17,189 --> 02:05:17,199
be interested in but somehow don't know
 

7301
02:05:17,199 --> 02:05:18,390
be interested in but somehow don't know
even though the data has been very

7302
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:18,400
even though the data has been very
 

7303
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:20,709
even though the data has been very
widespread so you know i have this book

7304
02:05:20,709 --> 02:05:20,719
widespread so you know i have this book
 

7305
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:21,990
widespread so you know i have this book
the elephant in the brain and one of the

7306
02:05:21,990 --> 02:05:22,000
the elephant in the brain and one of the
 

7307
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,990
the elephant in the brain and one of the
chapters is there on medicine and

7308
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:24,000
chapters is there on medicine and
 

7309
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,430
chapters is there on medicine and
basically

7310
02:05:25,430 --> 02:05:25,440
basically
 

7311
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,430
basically
most people seem ignorant of the very

7312
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:27,440
most people seem ignorant of the very
 

7313
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,270
most people seem ignorant of the very
basic fact that when we do randomized

7314
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,280
basic fact that when we do randomized
 

7315
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:30,870
basic fact that when we do randomized
trials where we give some people more

7316
02:05:30,870 --> 02:05:30,880
trials where we give some people more
 

7317
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:32,470
trials where we give some people more
medicine than others

7318
02:05:32,470 --> 02:05:32,480
medicine than others
 

7319
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,910
medicine than others
the people who get more medicine are not

7320
02:05:33,910 --> 02:05:33,920
the people who get more medicine are not
 

7321
02:05:33,920 --> 02:05:35,830
the people who get more medicine are not
healthier

7322
02:05:35,830 --> 02:05:35,840
healthier
 

7323
02:05:35,840 --> 02:05:38,149
healthier
just overall in general just like

7324
02:05:38,149 --> 02:05:38,159
just overall in general just like
 

7325
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:39,510
just overall in general just like
induce somebody to get more medicine

7326
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:39,520
induce somebody to get more medicine
 

7327
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:41,030
induce somebody to get more medicine
because you just give them more budget

7328
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:41,040
because you just give them more budget
 

7329
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,790
because you just give them more budget
to buy medicine say

7330
02:05:42,790 --> 02:05:42,800
to buy medicine say
 

7331
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,390
to buy medicine say
not not a specific medicine just the

7332
02:05:44,390 --> 02:05:44,400
not not a specific medicine just the
 

7333
02:05:44,400 --> 02:05:45,669
not not a specific medicine just the
whole category

7334
02:05:45,669 --> 02:05:45,679
whole category
 

7335
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:46,950
whole category
and you would think that would be

7336
02:05:46,950 --> 02:05:46,960
and you would think that would be
 

7337
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:48,550
and you would think that would be
something most people should know about

7338
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
something most people should know about
 

7339
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:49,990
something most people should know about
medicine you might even think that would

7340
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:50,000
medicine you might even think that would
 

7341
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,830
medicine you might even think that would
be a conspiracy theory

7342
02:05:51,830 --> 02:05:51,840
be a conspiracy theory
 

7343
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:53,270
be a conspiracy theory
to think that would be hidden but in

7344
02:05:53,270 --> 02:05:53,280
to think that would be hidden but in
 

7345
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:55,669
to think that would be hidden but in
fact most people never learn that fact

7346
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
fact most people never learn that fact
 

7347
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:57,750
fact most people never learn that fact
so just to clarify

7348
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:57,760
so just to clarify
 

7349
02:05:57,760 --> 02:06:00,870
so just to clarify
just a general high level statement the

7350
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
just a general high level statement the
 

7351
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,870
just a general high level statement the
more medicine you take the less healthy

7352
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:02,880
more medicine you take the less healthy
 

7353
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,470
more medicine you take the less healthy
you are

7354
02:06:04,470 --> 02:06:04,480
you are
 

7355
02:06:04,480 --> 02:06:06,390
you are
randomized experiments don't find that

7356
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:06,400
randomized experiments don't find that
 

7357
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:07,510
randomized experiments don't find that
fact

7358
02:06:07,510 --> 02:06:07,520
fact
 

7359
02:06:07,520 --> 02:06:09,270
fact
do not find that more medicine makes you

7360
02:06:09,270 --> 02:06:09,280
do not find that more medicine makes you
 

7361
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,709
do not find that more medicine makes you
more healthy yeah they're just no

7362
02:06:10,709 --> 02:06:10,719
more healthy yeah they're just no
 

7363
02:06:10,719 --> 02:06:12,149
more healthy yeah they're just no
connection

7364
02:06:12,149 --> 02:06:12,159
connection
 

7365
02:06:12,159 --> 02:06:13,990
connection
oh in randomized experiments there's no

7366
02:06:13,990 --> 02:06:14,000
oh in randomized experiments there's no
 

7367
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,550
oh in randomized experiments there's no
relationship between more medicine so

7368
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
relationship between more medicine so
 

7369
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:18,310
relationship between more medicine so
it's not a negative relationship but

7370
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
it's not a negative relationship but
 

7371
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:20,950
it's not a negative relationship but
it's just no relationship right

7372
02:06:20,950 --> 02:06:20,960
it's just no relationship right
 

7373
02:06:20,960 --> 02:06:22,629
it's just no relationship right
and uh so the the

7374
02:06:22,629 --> 02:06:22,639
and uh so the the
 

7375
02:06:22,639 --> 02:06:24,950
and uh so the the
the conspiracy theory is b would say

7376
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:24,960
the conspiracy theory is b would say
 

7377
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,470
the conspiracy theory is b would say
that the businesses that sell you

7378
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
that the businesses that sell you
 

7379
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:27,990
that the businesses that sell you
medicine don't want you to know that

7380
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,000
medicine don't want you to know that
 

7381
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,310
medicine don't want you to know that
fact and then you're saying that there's

7382
02:06:30,310 --> 02:06:30,320
fact and then you're saying that there's
 

7383
02:06:30,320 --> 02:06:31,910
fact and then you're saying that there's
also part of this

7384
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:31,920
also part of this
 

7385
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,669
also part of this
is that people just don't want to know

7386
02:06:33,669 --> 02:06:33,679
is that people just don't want to know
 

7387
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:35,510
is that people just don't want to know
they just don't want to know and so they

7388
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:35,520
they just don't want to know and so they
 

7389
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:37,510
they just don't want to know and so they
don't learn this so you know i've lived

7390
02:06:37,510 --> 02:06:37,520
don't learn this so you know i've lived
 

7391
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:39,030
don't learn this so you know i've lived
in the washington area for several

7392
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:39,040
in the washington area for several
 

7393
02:06:39,040 --> 02:06:40,950

you know
 

7399
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,310
you know
section on health and medicine it never

7400
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
section on health and medicine it never
 

7401
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:47,830
section on health and medicine it never
was mentioned in that section of the

7402
02:06:47,830 --> 02:06:47,840
was mentioned in that section of the
 

7403
02:06:47,840 --> 02:06:50,550
was mentioned in that section of the
paper in all the 20 years i read that

7404
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,560
paper in all the 20 years i read that
 

7405
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,069
paper in all the 20 years i read that
so do you think there is some truth to

02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,950
kinds of truths
yeah that is bad looking truths truths

7418
02:07:04,950 --> 02:07:04,960
yeah that is bad looking truths truths
 

7419

7581
02:09:52,239 --> 02:09:54,950
i need to be able to explain why it was
an accident and not on purpose

7582
02:09:54,950 --> 02:09:54,960
an accident and not on purpose
 

7583
02:09:54,960 --> 02:09:57,270
an accident and not on purpose
so where's that need come from for your

7584
02:09:57,270 --> 02:09:57,280
so where's that need come from for your
 

7585
02:09:57,280 --> 02:09:59,910
so where's that need come from for your
own self-preservation right so humans

7586
02:09:59,910 --> 02:09:59,920
own self-preservation right so humans
 

7587
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,589
own self-preservation right so humans
have norms and we have the norm that if

7588
02:10:01,589 --> 02:10:01,599
have norms and we have the norm that if
 

7589
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:03,350
have norms and we have the norm that if
we see anybody violating a norm we need

7590
02:10:03,350 --> 02:10:03,360
we see anybody violating a norm we need
 

7591
02:10:03,360 --> 02:10:05,189
we see anybody violating a norm we need
to tell other people and then coordinate

7592
02:10:05,189 --> 02:10:05,199
to tell other people and then coordinate
 

7593
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:07,589
to tell other people and then coordinate
to to just make them stop and punish

7594
02:10:07,589 --> 02:10:07,599
to to just make them stop and punish
 

7595
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:09,910
to to just make them stop and punish
them for for violating so

7596
02:10:09,910 --> 02:10:09,920
them for for violating so
 

7597
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:11,510
them for for violating so
such benefits are strong enough and

7598
02:10:11,510 --> 02:10:11,520
such benefits are strong enough and
 

7599
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,390
such benefits are strong enough and
severe enough that we each want to avoid

7600
02:10:14,390 --> 02:10:14,400
severe enough that we each want to avoid
 

7601
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,229
severe enough that we each want to avoid
being successfully accused of violating

7602
02:10:16,229 --> 02:10:16,239
being successfully accused of violating
 

7603
02:10:16,239 --> 02:10:17,830
being successfully accused of violating
norms

7604
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:17,840
norms
 

7605
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:19,910
norms
so for example hitting someone on

7606
02:10:19,910 --> 02:10:19,920
so for example hitting someone on
 

7607
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:22,229
so for example hitting someone on
purpose is a big clear norm violation if

7608
02:10:22,229 --> 02:10:22,239
purpose is a big clear norm violation if
 

7609
02:10:22,239 --> 02:10:24,149
purpose is a big clear norm violation if
we do it consistently we may be thrown

7610
02:10:24,149 --> 02:10:24,159
we do it consistently we may be thrown
 

7611
02:10:24,159 --> 02:10:25,510
we do it consistently we may be thrown
out of the group and that would mean we

7612
02:10:25,510 --> 02:10:25,520
out of the group and that would mean we
 

7613
02:10:25,520 --> 02:10:27,910
out of the group and that would mean we
would die that's right okay so we need

7614
02:10:27,910 --> 02:10:27,920
would die that's right okay so we need
 

7615
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:29,830
would die that's right okay so we need
to be able to convince people we are not

7616
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:29,840
to be able to convince people we are not
 

7617
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:32,390
to be able to convince people we are not
going around hitting people on purpose

7618
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
going around hitting people on purpose
 

7619
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,390
going around hitting people on purpose
if somebody happens to be at the other

7620
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
if somebody happens to be at the other
 

7621
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:36,950
if somebody happens to be at the other
end of our fist and their face connects

7622
02:10:36,950 --> 02:10:36,960
end of our fist and their face connects
 

7623
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:38,790
end of our fist and their face connects
that was an accident and we need to be

7624
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:38,800
that was an accident and we need to be
 

7625
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:41,669
that was an accident and we need to be
able to explain that

7626
02:10:41,669 --> 02:10:41,679
able to explain that
 

7627
02:10:41,679 --> 02:10:43,270
able to explain that
and similarly for many other norms

7628
02:10:43,270 --> 02:10:43,280
and similarly for many other norms
 

7629
02:10:43,280 --> 02:10:45,589
and similarly for many other norms
humans have uh we are serious about

7630
02:10:45,589 --> 02:10:45,599
humans have uh we are serious about
 

7631
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:47,589
humans have uh we are serious about
these norms and we don't want people to

7632
02:10:47,589 --> 02:10:47,599
these norms and we don't want people to
 

7633
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:48,950
these norms and we don't want people to
violate them we find them violating

7634
02:10:48,950 --> 02:10:48,960
violate them we find them violating
 

7635
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,470
violate them we find them violating
we're going to accuse them but many

7636
02:10:50,470 --> 02:10:50,480
we're going to accuse them but many
 

7637
02:10:50,480 --> 02:10:53,109
we're going to accuse them but many
norms have a motive component and so we

7638
02:10:53,109 --> 02:10:53,119
norms have a motive component and so we
 

7639
02:10:53,119 --> 02:10:55,750
norms have a motive component and so we
are trying to explain ourselves and make

7640
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,760
are trying to explain ourselves and make
 

7641
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,510
are trying to explain ourselves and make
sure we have a good motive story about

7642
02:10:57,510 --> 02:10:57,520
sure we have a good motive story about
 

7643
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:58,950
sure we have a good motive story about
everything we do

7644
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:58,960
everything we do
 

7645
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,950
everything we do
which is why we're constantly

7646
02:11:00,950 --> 02:11:00,960
which is why we're constantly
 

7647
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:02,310
which is why we're constantly
trying to explain what we're doing and

7648
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:02,320
trying to explain what we're doing and
 

7649
02:11:02,320 --> 02:11:04,149
trying to explain what we're doing and
that's what your conscious mind is doing

7650
02:11:04,149 --> 02:11:04,159
that's what your conscious mind is doing
 

7651
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:06,470
that's what your conscious mind is doing
it is trying to make sure you've got a

7652
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
it is trying to make sure you've got a
 

7653
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:07,990
it is trying to make sure you've got a
good motive story for everything you're

7654
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,000
good motive story for everything you're
 

7655
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:09,830
good motive story for everything you're
doing and that's why you don't know why

7656
02:11:09,830 --> 02:11:09,840
doing and that's why you don't know why
 

7657
02:11:09,840 --> 02:11:12,069
doing and that's why you don't know why
you really do things what you know is

7658
02:11:12,069 --> 02:11:12,079
you really do things what you know is
 

7659
02:11:12,079 --> 02:11:14,790
you really do things what you know is
what the good story is about why you've

7660
02:11:14,790 --> 02:11:14,800
what the good story is about why you've
 

7661
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:15,910
what the good story is about why you've
been doing things and that's the

7662
02:11:15,910 --> 02:11:15,920
been doing things and that's the
 

7663
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:17,910
been doing things and that's the
self-deception and you're saying that

7664
02:11:17,910 --> 02:11:17,920
self-deception and you're saying that
 

7665
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:21,430
self-deception and you're saying that
there's a machine the actual dictator is

7666
02:11:21,430 --> 02:11:21,440
there's a machine the actual dictator is
 

7667
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:22,709
there's a machine the actual dictator is
selfish

7668
02:11:22,709 --> 02:11:22,719
selfish
 

7669
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:24,390
selfish
and then you're just the press secretary

7670
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:24,400
and then you're just the press secretary
 

7671
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:25,669
and then you're just the press secretary
who's desperately doesn't want to get

7672
02:11:25,669 --> 02:11:25,679
who's desperately doesn't want to get
 

7673
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:28,550
who's desperately doesn't want to get
fired and it's justifying all of all the

7674
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:28,560
fired and it's justifying all of all the
 

7675
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,629
fired and it's justifying all of all the
decisions of the dictator and that's the

7676
02:11:30,629 --> 02:11:30,639
decisions of the dictator and that's the
 

7677
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:32,149
decisions of the dictator and that's the
self-deception

7678
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
self-deception
 

7679
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:34,310
self-deception
right now most people actually are

7680
02:11:34,310 --> 02:11:34,320
right now most people actually are
 

7681
02:11:34,320 --> 02:11:35,990
right now most people actually are
willing to believe that this is true in

7682
02:11:35,990 --> 02:11:36,000
willing to believe that this is true in
 

7683
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:37,669
willing to believe that this is true in
the abstract so our book has been

7684
02:11:37,669 --> 02:11:37,679
the abstract so our book has been
 

7685
02:11:37,679 --> 02:11:39,669
the abstract so our book has been
classified as psychology and it was

7686
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
classified as psychology and it was
 

7687
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,669
classified as psychology and it was
reviewed by psychologists and the basic

7688
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
reviewed by psychologists and the basic
 

7689
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:43,750
reviewed by psychologists and the basic
way that psychology referees and

7690
02:11:43,750 --> 02:11:43,760
way that psychology referees and
 

7691
02:11:43,760 --> 02:11:45,830
way that psychology referees and
reviewers responded to say this is well

7692
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:45,840
reviewers responded to say this is well
 

7693
02:11:45,840 --> 02:11:47,030
reviewers responded to say this is well

known
 

7695
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:48,550

most people accept that there's a fair

7696
02:11:48,550 --> 02:11:48,560
most people accept that there's a fair
 

7697
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,990
most people accept that there's a fair
bit of self-deception but they don't

7698
02:11:49,990 --> 02:11:50,000
bit of self-deception but they don't
 

7699
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,589
bit of self-deception but they don't
want to accept it about themselves

02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
want to accept it about themselves
 

7701
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:52,709
want to accept it about themselves
directly they don't want to accept it

directly they don't want to accept it
 

7703
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:54,709
directly they don't want to accept it
about the particular topics that we talk

7704
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
about the particular topics that we talk
 

7705
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,950
about the particular topics that we talk
about so people accept the idea in the

about so people accept the idea in the

abstract that they might be
 

7709
02:11:58,320 --> 02:11:59,910
abstract that they might be
self-deceived or that they might not be

honest about various things
 

7713
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:03,510
honest about various things
but that hasn't penetrated into the

7714
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:03,520
but that hasn't penetrated into the
 

7715
02:12:03,520 --> 02:12:05,109
but that hasn't penetrated into the
literatures where people are explaining

7716
02:12:05,109 --> 02:12:05,119
literatures where people are explaining
 

7717
02:12:05,119 --> 02:12:06,790
literatures where people are explaining
particular things like why we go to

7718
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:06,800
particular things like why we go to
 

7719
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,629
particular things like why we go to
school why we go to the doctor why we

7720
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:08,639
school why we go to the doctor why we
 

7721
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:12,229
school why we go to the doctor why we
vote etc so our book is mainly about ten

7722
02:12:12,229 --> 02:12:12,239
vote etc so our book is mainly about ten
 

7723
02:12:12,239 --> 02:12:14,550
vote etc so our book is mainly about ten
areas of life and explaining about in

7724
02:12:14,550 --> 02:12:14,560
areas of life and explaining about in
 

7725
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:16,790
areas of life and explaining about in
each area what our actual motives there

7726
02:12:16,790 --> 02:12:16,800
each area what our actual motives there
 

7727
02:12:16,800 --> 02:12:17,589
each area what our actual motives there
are

7728
02:12:17,589 --> 02:12:17,599
are
 

7729
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:19,510
are
and you know people who study those

7730
02:12:19,510 --> 02:12:19,520
and you know people who study those
 

7731
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,470
and you know people who study those
things have not admitted that hidden

7732
02:12:22,470 --> 02:12:22,480
things have not admitted that hidden
 

7733
02:12:22,480 --> 02:12:25,030
things have not admitted that hidden
motives are explaining those particular

7734
02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,040
motives are explaining those particular
 

7735
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:26,470
motives are explaining those particular
areas they haven't taken the leap from

7736
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
areas they haven't taken the leap from
 

7737
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:29,270
areas they haven't taken the leap from

definition i can't tell you what i'm
 

7899
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:19,510
definition i can't tell you what i'm
deceiving myself about

7900
02:15:19,510 --> 02:15:19,520
deceiving myself about
 

7901
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:21,589
deceiving myself about
but the more practical strategy that's

7902
02:15:21,589 --> 02:15:21,599
but the more practical strategy that's
 

7903
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:23,910
but the more practical strategy that's
quite feasible is to ask about what are

7904
02:15:23,910 --> 02:15:23,920
quite feasible is to ask about what are
 

7905
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:25,830
quite feasible is to ask about what are
typical things that most people decease

7906
02:15:25,830 --> 02:15:25,840
typical things that most people decease
 

7907
02:15:25,840 --> 02:15:27,669
typical things that most people decease
themselves about and then to own up to

7908
02:15:27,669 --> 02:15:27,679
themselves about and then to own up to
 

7909
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,950
themselves about and then to own up to
those particular things sure what's what

7910
02:15:30,950 --> 02:15:30,960
those particular things sure what's what
 

7911
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,270
those particular things sure what's what
what's a good one so for example

7912
02:15:33,270 --> 02:15:33,280
what's a good one so for example
 

7913
02:15:33,280 --> 02:15:36,310
what's a good one so for example
i can very much acknowledge that i would

7914
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,320
i can very much acknowledge that i would
 

7915
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:38,069
i can very much acknowledge that i would
like to be well thought of

7916
02:15:38,069 --> 02:15:38,079
like to be well thought of
 

7917
02:15:38,079 --> 02:15:42,229
like to be well thought of
yes that i would be seeking uh attention

7918
02:15:42,229 --> 02:15:42,239
yes that i would be seeking uh attention
 

7919
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:46,310
yes that i would be seeking uh attention
and glory and uh praise yes from my

7920
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
and glory and uh praise yes from my
 

7921
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,149
and glory and uh praise yes from my
intellectual work and that that would be

7922
02:15:48,149 --> 02:15:48,159
intellectual work and that that would be
 

7923
02:15:48,159 --> 02:15:50,709
intellectual work and that that would be
a major agenda driving my

7924
02:15:50,709 --> 02:15:50,719
a major agenda driving my
 

7925
02:15:50,719 --> 02:15:53,510
a major agenda driving my
intellectual attempts

7926
02:15:53,510 --> 02:15:53,520
intellectual attempts
 

7927
02:15:53,520 --> 02:15:55,350
intellectual attempts
so you know if there were topics that

7928
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,360
so you know if there were topics that
 

7929
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,270
so you know if there were topics that
other people would find less interesting

7930
02:15:57,270 --> 02:15:57,280
other people would find less interesting
 

7931
02:15:57,280 --> 02:15:59,189
other people would find less interesting
i might be less interested in those for

7932
02:15:59,189 --> 02:15:59,199
i might be less interested in those for
 

7933
02:15:59,199 --> 02:16:01,510
i might be less interested in those for
that reason for example i might want to

7934
02:16:01,510 --> 02:16:01,520
that reason for example i might want to
 

7935
02:16:01,520 --> 02:16:02,470
that reason for example i might want to
find topics whether people are

7936
02:16:02,470 --> 02:16:02,480
find topics whether people are
 

7937
02:16:02,480 --> 02:16:05,589
find topics whether people are
interested and i might want to

7938
02:16:05,589 --> 02:16:05,599
interested and i might want to
 

7939
02:16:05,599 --> 02:16:08,870
interested and i might want to
go for the glory of finding a big

7940
02:16:08,870 --> 02:16:08,880
go for the glory of finding a big
 

7941
02:16:08,880 --> 02:16:11,830
go for the glory of finding a big
insight rather than a small one

7942
02:16:11,830 --> 02:16:11,840
insight rather than a small one
 

7943
02:16:11,840 --> 02:16:14,069
insight rather than a small one
and maybe one that was especially

7944
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
and maybe one that was especially
 

7945
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:15,350
and maybe one that was especially
surprising

7946
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
surprising
 

7947
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,030
surprising
that's also of course consistent with

7948
02:16:17,030 --> 02:16:17,040
that's also of course consistent with
 

7949
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,109
that's also of course consistent with
some more ideal concept of what an

some more ideal concept of what an
 

7951
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:21,669
some more ideal concept of what an
intellectual should be

02:16:21,669 --> 02:16:21,679
intellectual should be
 

7953
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:24,149
intellectual should be
but most intellectuals are relatively

but most intellectuals are relatively
 

7955
02:16:24,159 --> 02:16:26,149
but most intellectuals are relatively
risk-averse they are

02:16:26,149 --> 02:16:26,159
risk-averse they are
 

7957
02:16:26,159 --> 02:16:28,550
risk-averse they are
in some local intellectual tradition and

7958

in some local intellectual tradition and
 

7959
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,629
in some local intellectual tradition and
they are adding to that and they are

they are adding to that and they are

02:16:30,639 --> 02:16:33,110
they are adding to that and they are

um
but you might think

02:16:46,469 --> 02:16:46,479
but you might think
 

7977
02:16:46,479 --> 02:16:47,990

people should be less eager to just add
 

7985
02:16:53,679 --> 02:16:55,589
people should be less eager to just add
a little bit to some tradition and they

a little bit to some tradition and they
 

7987
02:16:55,599 --> 02:16:57,110
a little bit to some tradition and they

that once you are convinced of it you

02:17:11,679 --> 02:17:14,549
that once you are convinced of it you
find that to be very important and

find that to be very important and

um
 

8011
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,790
um
you could say that um

8012
02:17:20,790 --> 02:17:20,800
you could say that um
 

8013
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:23,429
you could say that um

breaking out of the cage of the small
 

8049
02:18:02,319 --> 02:18:05,190
breaking out of the cage of the small
conformity into a larger cage

8050
02:18:05,190 --> 02:18:05,200
conformity into a larger cage
 

8051
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:06,629
conformity into a larger cage
it's always a bigger there's always a

8052
02:18:06,629 --> 02:18:06,639
it's always a bigger there's always a

it's always a bigger there's always a
bigger page and then you'll be

8054
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:08,160
bigger page and then you'll be
 

8055
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:12,070
bigger page and then you'll be
remembered by more yeah um also that

02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:56,230
broadly as all humans might that it
becomes a drug

8100

becomes a drug
 

8101
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:58,709
becomes a drug
this uh

8102
02:18:58,709 --> 02:18:58,719
this uh
 

8103
02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:01,349
this uh
being a martyr

8104
02:19:01,349 --> 02:19:01,359
being a martyr
 

8105
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:03,429
being a martyr
point being the person who points out

8106
02:19:03,429 --> 02:19:03,439
point being the person who points out
 

8107
02:19:03,439 --> 02:19:06,629
point being the person who points out
that the emperor wears no clothes

8108
02:19:06,629 --> 02:19:06,639
that the emperor wears no clothes
 

8109
02:19:06,639 --> 02:19:08,549
that the emperor wears no clothes
even when the emperor is obviously

8110
02:19:08,549 --> 02:19:08,559
even when the emperor is obviously
 

8111
02:19:08,559 --> 02:19:10,150
even when the emperor is obviously
dressed

8112
02:19:10,150 --> 02:19:10,160
dressed
 

8113
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:12,150
dressed
just to be the person who points out

8114
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:12,160
just to be the person who points out
 

8115
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,549
just to be the person who points out
that the emperor is wearing no clothes

8116
02:19:14,549 --> 02:19:14,559
that the emperor is wearing no clothes
 

8117
02:19:14,559 --> 02:19:17,669
that the emperor is wearing no clothes
do you think about that

8118
02:19:17,669 --> 02:19:17,679

 

8119
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:18,549

so

8120
02:19:18,549 --> 02:19:18,559
so
 

8121
02:19:18,559 --> 02:19:21,589
so
i think the standards you hold yourself

8122
02:19:21,589 --> 02:19:21,599
i think the standards you hold yourself
 

8123
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:22,790
i think the standards you hold yourself
to

8124
02:19:22,790 --> 02:19:22,800
to
 

8125
02:19:22,800 --> 02:19:24,549
to
are dependent on the audience you have

8126
02:19:24,549 --> 02:19:24,559
are dependent on the audience you have
 

8127
02:19:24,559 --> 02:19:26,230
are dependent on the audience you have
in mind

8128
02:19:26,230 --> 02:19:26,240
in mind
 

8129
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:28,230
in mind
so if you think of your audience as

8130
02:19:28,230 --> 02:19:28,240
so if you think of your audience as
 

8131
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:30,309
so if you think of your audience as
relatively easily fooled

8132
02:19:30,309 --> 02:19:30,319
relatively easily fooled
 

8133
02:19:30,319 --> 02:19:32,309
relatively easily fooled
or relatively gullible

8134
02:19:32,309 --> 02:19:32,319
or relatively gullible
 

8135
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:34,389
or relatively gullible
then you won't bother to generate more

8136
02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:34,399
then you won't bother to generate more
 

8137
02:19:34,399 --> 02:19:36,469
then you won't bother to generate more
complicated deep

8138
02:19:36,469 --> 02:19:36,479
complicated deep
 

8139
02:19:36,479 --> 02:19:37,429
complicated deep
you know

8140
02:19:37,429 --> 02:19:37,439
you know
 

8141
02:19:37,439 --> 02:19:39,429
you know
arguments and structures and evidence to

8142
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:39,439
arguments and structures and evidence to
 

8143
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:41,669
arguments and structures and evidence to
persuade somebody who has higher

8144
02:19:41,669 --> 02:19:41,679
persuade somebody who has higher
 

8145
02:19:41,679 --> 02:19:44,150
persuade somebody who has higher
standards because why bother

8146
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,160
standards because why bother
 

8147
02:19:44,160 --> 02:19:45,910
standards because why bother
you you can get away with something much

8148
02:19:45,910 --> 02:19:45,920
you you can get away with something much
 

8149
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:47,270
you you can get away with something much
easier and of course if you are say a

8150
02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:47,280
easier and of course if you are say a

02:19:51,040 --> 02:19:52,950
on sales then

8156
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:52,960
you don't need to convince the top few
 

8157

02:20:58,710 --> 02:20:58,720
small sample and they can't do that much
 

8225
02:20:58,720 --> 02:21:01,590
small sample and they can't do that much
for you anyway yeah so i might well have

8226
02:21:01,590 --> 02:21:01,600
for you anyway yeah so i might well have
 

8227
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:04,070
for you anyway yeah so i might well have

02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:27,750
yeah i mean you you pick your set of
motivations uh you know convincing and

all right uh
 

8261
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:37,270
all right uh
what are some notable

8262
02:21:37,270 --> 02:21:37,280
what are some notable
 

8263
02:21:37,280 --> 02:21:38,309
what are some notable
um

8264
02:21:38,309 --> 02:21:38,319
um
 

8265
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:41,429
um
sort of effects of the elephant in the

8266
02:21:41,429 --> 02:21:41,439
sort of effects of the elephant in the
 

8267
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:45,429
sort of effects of the elephant in the
brain in everyday life so you mentioned

8268
02:21:45,429 --> 02:21:45,439
brain in everyday life so you mentioned
 

8269
02:21:45,439 --> 02:21:47,429
brain in everyday life so you mentioned
when we try to apply that to economics

8270
02:21:47,429 --> 02:21:47,439
when we try to apply that to economics
 

8271
02:21:47,439 --> 02:21:49,910
when we try to apply that to economics
to public policy so when we think about

8272
02:21:49,910 --> 02:21:49,920
to public policy so when we think about
 

8273
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,590
to public policy so when we think about
medicine education all those kinds of

8274
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:51,600
medicine education all those kinds of
 

8275
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:53,270
medicine education all those kinds of
things so what are some things that well

8276
02:21:53,270 --> 02:21:53,280
things so what are some things that well
 

8277
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:55,110
things so what are some things that well
the key thing is medicine is much less

8278
02:21:55,110 --> 02:21:55,120
the key thing is medicine is much less
 

8279
02:21:55,120 --> 02:21:58,230
the key thing is medicine is much less
useful health-wise than you think

8280
02:21:58,230 --> 02:21:58,240
useful health-wise than you think
 

8281
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:00,790
useful health-wise than you think
so you know if you're focused on your

8282
02:22:00,790 --> 02:22:00,800
so you know if you're focused on your
 

8283
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,070
so you know if you're focused on your
health you would

8284
02:22:02,070 --> 02:22:02,080
health you would
 

8285
02:22:02,080 --> 02:22:03,750
health you would
care a lot less about it and if you were

8286
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,760
care a lot less about it and if you were
 

8287
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,110
care a lot less about it and if you were
focused on other people's health you

8288
02:22:05,110 --> 02:22:05,120
focused on other people's health you
 

8289
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:07,429
focused on other people's health you
would also care a lot less about it but

8290
02:22:07,429 --> 02:22:07,439
would also care a lot less about it but
 

8291
02:22:07,439 --> 02:22:09,670
would also care a lot less about it but
if medicine is as we suggest more about

8292
02:22:09,670 --> 02:22:09,680
if medicine is as we suggest more about
 

8293
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:10,870
if medicine is as we suggest more about
showing that you care and let other

8294
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:10,880
showing that you care and let other
 

8295
02:22:10,880 --> 02:22:13,110
showing that you care and let other
people showing that they care about you

8296
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:13,120
people showing that they care about you
 

8297
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,150
people showing that they care about you
then

8298
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:14,160
then
 

8299
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:15,750
then
a lot of priority on medicine can make

8300
02:22:15,750 --> 02:22:15,760
a lot of priority on medicine can make
 

8301
02:22:15,760 --> 02:22:17,510
a lot of priority on medicine can make
sense so that was our very earliest

8302
02:22:17,510 --> 02:22:17,520
sense so that was our very earliest
 

8303
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:19,270
sense so that was our very earliest
discussion in the podcast you were

8304
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:19,280
discussion in the podcast you were
 

8305
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:21,030
discussion in the podcast you were
talking about what do you know should

8306
02:22:21,030 --> 02:22:21,040
talking about what do you know should
 

8307
02:22:21,040 --> 02:22:22,790
talking about what do you know should
you give people a lot of medicine when

8308
02:22:22,790 --> 02:22:22,800
you give people a lot of medicine when
 

8309
02:22:22,800 --> 02:22:24,469
you give people a lot of medicine when
it's not very effective and then the

8310
02:22:24,469 --> 02:22:24,479
it's not very effective and then the
 

8311
02:22:24,479 --> 02:22:26,870
it's not very effective and then the
answer then is well if that's the way

8312
02:22:26,870 --> 02:22:26,880
answer then is well if that's the way
 

8313
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:28,309
answer then is well if that's the way
that you show that you care about them

8314
02:22:28,309 --> 02:22:28,319
that you show that you care about them
 

8315
02:22:28,319 --> 02:22:29,910
that you show that you care about them
and you really want them to know you

8316
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:29,920
and you really want them to know you
 

8317
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:30,950
and you really want them to know you
care

8318
02:22:30,950 --> 02:22:30,960
care
 

8319
02:22:30,960 --> 02:22:33,110
care
then maybe that's what you need to do if

8320
02:22:33,110 --> 02:22:33,120
then maybe that's what you need to do if
 

8321
02:22:33,120 --> 02:22:34,950
then maybe that's what you need to do if
you can't find a cheaper more effective

8322
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:34,960
you can't find a cheaper more effective
 

8323
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:37,270
you can't find a cheaper more effective
substitute so if we actually just pause

8324
02:22:37,270 --> 02:22:37,280
substitute so if we actually just pause
 

8325
02:22:37,280 --> 02:22:39,349
substitute so if we actually just pause
on that for a little bit

8326
02:22:39,349 --> 02:22:39,359
on that for a little bit
 

8327
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:41,030
on that for a little bit
how do we start

8328
02:22:41,030 --> 02:22:41,040
how do we start
 

8329
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:43,429
how do we start
to untangle the full set of

8330
02:22:43,429 --> 02:22:43,439
to untangle the full set of
 

8331
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:45,349
to untangle the full set of
self-deception happening in the space of

8332
02:22:45,349 --> 02:22:45,359
self-deception happening in the space of
 

8333
02:22:45,359 --> 02:22:46,550
self-deception happening in the space of
medicine

8334
02:22:46,550 --> 02:22:46,560
medicine
 

8335
02:22:46,560 --> 02:22:48,389
medicine
so we have a method that we use in our

8336
02:22:48,389 --> 02:22:48,399
so we have a method that we use in our
 

8337
02:22:48,399 --> 02:22:50,469
so we have a method that we use in our
book that is what i recommend for people

8338
02:22:50,469 --> 02:22:50,479
book that is what i recommend for people
 

8339
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:52,230
book that is what i recommend for people
to use and all these sorts of topics the

8340
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:52,240
to use and all these sorts of topics the
 

8341
02:22:52,240 --> 02:22:54,230
to use and all these sorts of topics the
straightforward method is first don't

8342
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:54,240
straightforward method is first don't
 

8343
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,670
straightforward method is first don't
look at yourself

8344
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:55,680
look at yourself
 

8345
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,349
look at yourself
look at other people

8346
02:22:57,349 --> 02:22:57,359
look at other people
 

8347
02:22:57,359 --> 02:22:59,590
look at other people
look at broad patterns of behavior in

8348
02:22:59,590 --> 02:22:59,600
look at broad patterns of behavior in
 

8349
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:01,590
look at broad patterns of behavior in
other people and then ask

8350
02:23:01,590 --> 02:23:01,600
other people and then ask
 

8351
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:03,190
other people and then ask
what are the various theories we could

8352
02:23:03,190 --> 02:23:03,200
what are the various theories we could
 

8353
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:04,870
what are the various theories we could
have to explain these patterns of

8354
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
have to explain these patterns of
 

8355
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,710
have to explain these patterns of
behavior and then just do the simple

8356
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:06,720
behavior and then just do the simple
 

8357
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:09,349
behavior and then just do the simple
matching which theory better matches the

8358
02:23:09,349 --> 02:23:09,359
matching which theory better matches the
 

8359
02:23:09,359 --> 02:23:10,790
matching which theory better matches the
behavior they have

8360
02:23:10,790 --> 02:23:10,800
behavior they have
 

8361
02:23:10,800 --> 02:23:12,550
behavior they have
and the last step is to assume that's

8362
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:12,560
and the last step is to assume that's
 

8363
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,790
and the last step is to assume that's
true of youtube

8364
02:23:14,790 --> 02:23:14,800
true of youtube
 

8365
02:23:14,800 --> 02:23:17,030
true of youtube
don't assume you're an exception it may

8366
02:23:17,030 --> 02:23:17,040
don't assume you're an exception it may
 

8367
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:18,150
don't assume you're an exception it may
if you happen to be an exception that

8368
02:23:18,150 --> 02:23:18,160
if you happen to be an exception that
 

8369
02:23:18,160 --> 02:23:19,830
if you happen to be an exception that
won't go so well but nevertheless on

8370
02:23:19,830 --> 02:23:19,840
won't go so well but nevertheless on
 

8371
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:21,990
won't go so well but nevertheless on
average you aren't very well positioned

8372
02:23:21,990 --> 02:23:22,000
average you aren't very well positioned
 

8373
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,150
average you aren't very well positioned
to judge if you're an exception so

8374
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:24,160
to judge if you're an exception so
 

8375
02:23:24,160 --> 02:23:26,469
to judge if you're an exception so
look at what other people do explain

8376
02:23:26,469 --> 02:23:26,479
look at what other people do explain
 

8377
02:23:26,479 --> 02:23:28,309
look at what other people do explain
what other people do and assume that's

8378
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:28,319
what other people do and assume that's
 

8379
02:23:28,319 --> 02:23:31,030
what other people do and assume that's
youtube but also in the case of medicine

8380
02:23:31,030 --> 02:23:31,040
youtube but also in the case of medicine
 

8381
02:23:31,040 --> 02:23:33,190
youtube but also in the case of medicine
there's several

8382
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:33,200
there's several
 

8383
02:23:33,200 --> 02:23:34,870
there's several
parties to consider so there's the

8384
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:34,880
parties to consider so there's the
 

8385
02:23:34,880 --> 02:23:36,550
parties to consider so there's the
individual person that's receiving the

8386
02:23:36,550 --> 02:23:36,560
individual person that's receiving the
 

8387
02:23:36,560 --> 02:23:38,389
individual person that's receiving the
medicine there's the doctors that are

8388
02:23:38,389 --> 02:23:38,399
medicine there's the doctors that are
 

8389
02:23:38,399 --> 02:23:39,990
medicine there's the doctors that are
prescribing the medicine

8390
02:23:39,990 --> 02:23:40,000
prescribing the medicine
 

8391
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,230
prescribing the medicine
there's

8392
02:23:42,230 --> 02:23:42,240
there's
 

8393
02:23:42,240 --> 02:23:44,230
there's
drug companies that are selling drugs

8394
02:23:44,230 --> 02:23:44,240
drug companies that are selling drugs
 

8395
02:23:44,240 --> 02:23:45,270
drug companies that are selling drugs
there are governments that have

8396
02:23:45,270 --> 02:23:45,280
there are governments that have
 

8397
02:23:45,280 --> 02:23:47,349
there are governments that have
regulations that are lobbyists so you

8398
02:23:47,349 --> 02:23:47,359
regulations that are lobbyists so you
 

8399
02:23:47,359 --> 02:23:49,750
regulations that are lobbyists so you
can build up a network of

8400
02:23:49,750 --> 02:23:49,760
can build up a network of
 

8401
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,750
can build up a network of
categories of humans in this

8402
02:23:51,750 --> 02:23:51,760
categories of humans in this
 

8403
02:23:51,760 --> 02:23:53,830
categories of humans in this
and they each play their role

8404
02:23:53,830 --> 02:23:53,840
and they each play their role
 

8405
02:23:53,840 --> 02:23:55,030
and they each play their role
so how do you

8406
02:23:55,030 --> 02:23:55,040
so how do you
 

8407
02:23:55,040 --> 02:23:57,429
so how do you
introspect

8408
02:23:57,429 --> 02:23:57,439
introspect
 

8409
02:23:57,439 --> 02:23:58,230
introspect
the

8410
02:23:58,230 --> 02:23:58,240
the
 

8411
02:23:58,240 --> 02:24:00,790
the
sort of analyze the system at a system

8412
02:24:00,790 --> 02:24:00,800
sort of analyze the system at a system
 

8413
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:03,750
sort of analyze the system at a system
scale versus at the individual scale

8414
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:03,760
scale versus at the individual scale
 

8415
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:06,230
scale versus at the individual scale
so it turns out that in general it's

8416
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:06,240
so it turns out that in general it's
 

8417
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:08,870
so it turns out that in general it's
usually much easier to explain producer

8418
02:24:08,870 --> 02:24:08,880
usually much easier to explain producer
 

8419
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:11,990
usually much easier to explain producer
behavior than consumer behavior that is

8420
02:24:11,990 --> 02:24:12,000
behavior than consumer behavior that is
 

8421
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,550
behavior than consumer behavior that is
the drug companies or the doctors have

8422
02:24:14,550 --> 02:24:14,560
the drug companies or the doctors have
 

8423
02:24:14,560 --> 02:24:16,790
the drug companies or the doctors have
relatively clear incentives to give the

8424
02:24:16,790 --> 02:24:16,800
relatively clear incentives to give the
 

8425
02:24:16,800 --> 02:24:19,270
relatively clear incentives to give the
customers whatever they want yeah and

8426
02:24:19,270 --> 02:24:19,280
customers whatever they want yeah and
 

8427
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:21,429
customers whatever they want yeah and
similarly say governments and democratic

8428
02:24:21,429 --> 02:24:21,439
similarly say governments and democratic
 

8429
02:24:21,439 --> 02:24:23,429
similarly say governments and democratic
countries have the incentive to give the

8430
02:24:23,429 --> 02:24:23,439
countries have the incentive to give the
 

8431
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:25,910
countries have the incentive to give the
voters what they want so

8432
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
voters what they want so
 

8433
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:28,309
voters what they want so
that focuses your attention on the

8434
02:24:28,309 --> 02:24:28,319
that focuses your attention on the
 

8435
02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:30,230
that focuses your attention on the
patient and the voter

8436
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
patient and the voter
 

8437
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,230
patient and the voter
in this equation and saying what do they

8438
02:24:32,230 --> 02:24:32,240
in this equation and saying what do they
 

8439
02:24:32,240 --> 02:24:34,389
in this equation and saying what do they
want they would be driving the rest of

8440
02:24:34,389 --> 02:24:34,399
want they would be driving the rest of
 

8441
02:24:34,399 --> 02:24:35,910
want they would be driving the rest of
the system

8442
02:24:35,910 --> 02:24:35,920
the system
 

8443
02:24:35,920 --> 02:24:37,830
the system
whatever they want the other parties are

8444
02:24:37,830 --> 02:24:37,840
whatever they want the other parties are
 

8445
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:39,349
whatever they want the other parties are
willing to give them

8446
02:24:39,349 --> 02:24:39,359
willing to give them
 

8447
02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:41,510
willing to give them
in order to get paid

8448
02:24:41,510 --> 02:24:41,520
in order to get paid
 

8449
02:24:41,520 --> 02:24:43,830
in order to get paid
so now we're looking for puzzles in

8450
02:24:43,830 --> 02:24:43,840
so now we're looking for puzzles in
 

8451
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:46,710
so now we're looking for puzzles in
patient and voter behavior what are they

8452
02:24:46,710 --> 02:24:46,720
patient and voter behavior what are they
 

8453
02:24:46,720 --> 02:24:51,110
patient and voter behavior what are they
choosing and why do they choose that

8454
02:24:51,110 --> 02:24:51,120

 

8455
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,110

and how much exactly and then we can

8456
02:24:53,110 --> 02:24:53,120
and how much exactly and then we can
 

8457
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,030
and how much exactly and then we can
explain that potentially again returning

8458
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:55,040
explain that potentially again returning
 

8459
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,030
explain that potentially again returning
to the producer by the producer being

8460
02:24:57,030 --> 02:24:57,040
to the producer by the producer being
 

8461
02:24:57,040 --> 02:24:59,110
to the producer by the producer being
incentivized to manipulate the

8462
02:24:59,110 --> 02:24:59,120
incentivized to manipulate the
 

8463
02:24:59,120 --> 02:25:01,190
incentivized to manipulate the
decision-making processes of the voter

8464
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
decision-making processes of the voter
 

8465
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:03,270
decision-making processes of the voter
and the consumer now in almost every

8466
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
and the consumer now in almost every
 

8467
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:06,070
and the consumer now in almost every
industry producers are in general happy

8468
02:25:06,070 --> 02:25:06,080
industry producers are in general happy
 

8469
02:25:06,080 --> 02:25:07,190
industry producers are in general happy
to lie

8470
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:07,200
to lie
 

8471
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,710
to lie
and exaggerate in order to get more

8472
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
and exaggerate in order to get more
 

8473
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:10,309
and exaggerate in order to get more
customers yeah this is true of auto

8474
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:10,319
customers yeah this is true of auto
 

8475
02:25:10,319 --> 02:25:12,389
customers yeah this is true of auto
repair as much as human body repair and

8476
02:25:12,389 --> 02:25:12,399
repair as much as human body repair and
 

8477
02:25:12,399 --> 02:25:13,429
repair as much as human body repair and
medicine

8478
02:25:13,429 --> 02:25:13,439
medicine
 

8479
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:14,790
medicine
so the differences between these

8480
02:25:14,790 --> 02:25:14,800
so the differences between these
 

8481
02:25:14,800 --> 02:25:17,030
so the differences between these
industries can't be explained by the

8482
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:17,040
industries can't be explained by the
 

8483
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:19,030
industries can't be explained by the
willingness of the producers to give

8484
02:25:19,030 --> 02:25:19,040
willingness of the producers to give
 

8485
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:20,469
willingness of the producers to give
customers what they want or to do

8486
02:25:20,469 --> 02:25:20,479
customers what they want or to do
 

8487
02:25:20,479 --> 02:25:22,389
customers what they want or to do
various things that we have to again

8488
02:25:22,389 --> 02:25:22,399
various things that we have to again
 

8489
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:24,469
various things that we have to again
go to the customers why are customers

8490
02:25:24,469 --> 02:25:24,479
go to the customers why are customers
 

8491
02:25:24,479 --> 02:25:27,110
go to the customers why are customers
treating body repair different than auto

8492
02:25:27,110 --> 02:25:27,120
treating body repair different than auto
 

8493
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:31,030
treating body repair different than auto
repair

8494
02:25:31,030 --> 02:25:31,040

 

8495
02:25:31,040 --> 02:25:33,429

yeah and that potentially requires a lot

8496
02:25:33,429 --> 02:25:33,439
yeah and that potentially requires a lot
 

8497
02:25:33,439 --> 02:25:35,110
yeah and that potentially requires a lot
a lot of thinking a lot of data

8498
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:35,120
a lot of thinking a lot of data
 

8499
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:36,790
a lot of thinking a lot of data
collection and potentially looking at

collection and potentially looking at
 

8501
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,950

just happen overnight that over time
there's principle it does but actually

02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:42,560
there's principle it does but actually
 

8507
02:25:42,560 --> 02:25:44,309
there's principle it does but actually
it's a lot actually easier than you

8508
02:25:44,309 --> 02:25:44,319
it's a lot actually easier than you
 

8509
02:25:44,319 --> 02:25:45,349
it's a lot actually easier than you
might think

8510
02:25:45,349 --> 02:25:45,359
might think
 

8511
02:25:45,359 --> 02:25:47,110
might think
i think the biggest limitation is just

8512
02:25:47,110 --> 02:25:47,120
i think the biggest limitation is just
 

8513
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:48,950
i think the biggest limitation is just
the willingness to consider alternative

8514
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:48,960
the willingness to consider alternative
 

8515
02:25:48,960 --> 02:25:51,190
the willingness to consider alternative
hypotheses so many of the patterns that

8516
02:25:51,190 --> 02:25:51,200
hypotheses so many of the patterns that
 

8517
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:53,429
hypotheses so many of the patterns that
you need to rely on are actually pretty

8518
02:25:53,429 --> 02:25:53,439
you need to rely on are actually pretty
 

8519
02:25:53,439 --> 02:25:55,270
you need to rely on are actually pretty
obvious simple patterns you just have to

8520
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:55,280
obvious simple patterns you just have to
 

8521
02:25:55,280 --> 02:25:57,750
obvious simple patterns you just have to
notice them and ask yourself how can i

8522
02:25:57,750 --> 02:25:57,760
notice them and ask yourself how can i
 

8523
02:25:57,760 --> 02:25:59,190
notice them and ask yourself how can i
explain those

8524
02:25:59,190 --> 02:25:59,200
explain those
 

8525
02:25:59,200 --> 02:26:00,710
explain those
often you don't need to look at the most

8526
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:00,720
often you don't need to look at the most
 

8527
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:03,349
often you don't need to look at the most
subtle most you know difficult

8531
02:26:04,880 --> 02:26:07,429

there the simplest patterns are often

8532
02:26:07,429 --> 02:26:07,439
there the simplest patterns are often
 

8533
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:08,469
there the simplest patterns are often
enough

8534
02:26:08,469 --> 02:26:08,479
enough
 

8535
02:26:08,479 --> 02:26:10,230
enough
all right so there there's a fundamental

02:26:10,230 --> 02:26:10,240
all right so there there's a fundamental
 

8537
02:26:10,240 --> 02:26:12,230
all right so there there's a fundamental
statement about self-deception in the

02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:12,240
statement about self-deception in the
 

8539
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,910
statement about self-deception in the

02:26:13,910 --> 02:26:13,920
book there's the application of that
 

8541
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:15,750

02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:17,760
can you steal man

the argument that uh many of the

02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:25,190
the argument that uh many of the
foundational ideas in the book are wrong

8548
02:26:25,190 --> 02:26:25,200

 

8549
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:26,550

meaning

8550
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:26,560
meaning
 

8551
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,429
meaning
uh

8552
02:26:27,429 --> 02:26:27,439
uh
 

8553
02:26:27,439 --> 02:26:29,990
uh
there's two that you just made which is

8554
02:26:29,990 --> 02:26:30,000
there's two that you just made which is
 

8555
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,950
there's two that you just made which is
it can be a lot simpler than it looks

8556
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:32,960
it can be a lot simpler than it looks
 

8557
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:35,670
it can be a lot simpler than it looks
can you steal man in the case that it's

8558
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:35,680
can you steal man in the case that it's
 

8559
02:26:35,680 --> 02:26:37,910
can you steal man in the case that it's
case by case it's going it's always

8560
02:26:37,910 --> 02:26:37,920
case by case it's going it's always
 

8561
02:26:37,920 --> 02:26:39,510
case by case it's going it's always
super complicated like it's a complex

8562
02:26:39,510 --> 02:26:39,520
super complicated like it's a complex
 

8563
02:26:39,520 --> 02:26:41,750
super complicated like it's a complex
system it's very difficult to have a

8564
02:26:41,750 --> 02:26:41,760
system it's very difficult to have a
 

8565
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:43,270
system it's very difficult to have a
simple model about it's very difficult

8566
02:26:43,270 --> 02:26:43,280
simple model about it's very difficult
 

8567
02:26:43,280 --> 02:26:45,590
simple model about it's very difficult
to disrespect and the other one is that

8568
02:26:45,590 --> 02:26:45,600
to disrespect and the other one is that
 

8569
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:47,590
to disrespect and the other one is that
the human brain isn't

8570
02:26:47,590 --> 02:26:47,600
the human brain isn't
 

8571
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,469
the human brain isn't
not just about self-deception

8572
02:26:50,469 --> 02:26:50,479
not just about self-deception
 

8573
02:26:50,479 --> 02:26:54,309
not just about self-deception
um that that there's a lot of

8574
02:26:54,309 --> 02:26:54,319
um that that there's a lot of
 

8575
02:26:54,319 --> 02:26:56,389
um that that there's a lot of
there's a lot of motivation to play and

8576
02:26:56,389 --> 02:26:56,399
there's a lot of motivation to play and
 

8577
02:26:56,399 --> 02:26:58,710
there's a lot of motivation to play and
we are able to really introspect our own

8578
02:26:58,710 --> 02:26:58,720
we are able to really introspect our own
 

8579
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,429
we are able to really introspect our own
mind and like what what's on the surface

8580
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:01,439
mind and like what what's on the surface
 

8581
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,590
mind and like what what's on the surface
of the conscious is actually quite a

8582
02:27:03,590 --> 02:27:03,600
of the conscious is actually quite a
 

8583
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:05,429
of the conscious is actually quite a
good representation of what's going on

8584
02:27:05,429 --> 02:27:05,439
good representation of what's going on
 

8585
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:07,429
good representation of what's going on
in the brain and you're not deceiving

8586
02:27:07,429 --> 02:27:07,439
in the brain and you're not deceiving
 

8587
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:09,990
in the brain and you're not deceiving
yourself you're able to actually arrive

8588
02:27:09,990 --> 02:27:10,000
yourself you're able to actually arrive
 

8589
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,990
yourself you're able to actually arrive
to deeply think about where your mind

8590
02:27:11,990 --> 02:27:12,000
to deeply think about where your mind
 

8591
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:13,429
to deeply think about where your mind
stands and what you think about the

8592
02:27:13,429 --> 02:27:13,439
stands and what you think about the
 

8593
02:27:13,439 --> 02:27:15,510
stands and what you think about the
world and it's less about impressing

8594
02:27:15,510 --> 02:27:15,520
world and it's less about impressing
 

8595
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:17,190
world and it's less about impressing
people and more about being a

8596
02:27:17,190 --> 02:27:17,200
people and more about being a
 

8597
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,510
people and more about being a
free-thinking individual

8598
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:19,520
free-thinking individual
 

8599
02:27:19,520 --> 02:27:20,309
free-thinking individual
so

8600
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:20,319
so
 

8601
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:22,790
so
when a child

8602
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:22,800
when a child
 

8603
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:24,309
when a child
tries to explain why they don't have

8604
02:27:24,309 --> 02:27:24,319
tries to explain why they don't have
 

8605
02:27:24,319 --> 02:27:26,710
tries to explain why they don't have
their homework assignment yes they are

8606
02:27:26,710 --> 02:27:26,720
their homework assignment yes they are
 

8607
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:29,349
their homework assignment yes they are
sometimes inclined to say the dog ate my

8608
02:27:29,349 --> 02:27:29,359
sometimes inclined to say the dog ate my
 

8609
02:27:29,359 --> 02:27:31,590
sometimes inclined to say the dog ate my
homework they almost never say the

8610
02:27:31,590 --> 02:27:31,600
homework they almost never say the
 

8611
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:34,070
homework they almost never say the
dragon ate my homework

8612
02:27:34,070 --> 02:27:34,080
dragon ate my homework
 

8613
02:27:34,080 --> 02:27:36,469
dragon ate my homework
the reason is the dragon is a completely

8614
02:27:36,469 --> 02:27:36,479
the reason is the dragon is a completely
 

8615
02:27:36,479 --> 02:27:38,950
the reason is the dragon is a completely
implausible explanation

8616
02:27:38,950 --> 02:27:38,960
implausible explanation
 

8617
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:40,870
implausible explanation
almost always when we make excuses for

8618
02:27:40,870 --> 02:27:40,880
almost always when we make excuses for
 

8619
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,349
almost always when we make excuses for
things we choose things that are at

8620
02:27:43,349 --> 02:27:43,359
things we choose things that are at
 

8621
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:45,590
things we choose things that are at
least in some degree plausible it could

8622
02:27:45,590 --> 02:27:45,600
least in some degree plausible it could
 

8623
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:47,830
least in some degree plausible it could
perhaps have happened

8624
02:27:47,830 --> 02:27:47,840
perhaps have happened
 

8625
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,349
perhaps have happened
that's an obstacle

8626
02:27:49,349 --> 02:27:49,359
that's an obstacle
 

8627
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:52,070
that's an obstacle
for any explanation of a hidden motive

8628
02:27:52,070 --> 02:27:52,080
for any explanation of a hidden motive
 

8629
02:27:52,080 --> 02:27:54,790
for any explanation of a hidden motive
or a hidden feature of human behavior if

8630
02:27:54,790 --> 02:27:54,800
or a hidden feature of human behavior if
 

8631
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:57,270
or a hidden feature of human behavior if
people are pretending one thing while

8632
02:27:57,270 --> 02:27:57,280
people are pretending one thing while
 

8633
02:27:57,280 --> 02:27:58,710
people are pretending one thing while
really doing another they're usually

8634
02:27:58,710 --> 02:27:58,720
really doing another they're usually
 

8635
02:27:58,720 --> 02:28:00,630
really doing another they're usually
going to pick as a pretense something

8636
02:28:00,630 --> 02:28:00,640
going to pick as a pretense something
 

8637
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:02,950
going to pick as a pretense something
that's somewhat plausible

8638
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:02,960
that's somewhat plausible
 

8639
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:05,190
that's somewhat plausible
that's going to be an obstacle to

8640
02:28:05,190 --> 02:28:05,200
that's going to be an obstacle to
 

8641
02:28:05,200 --> 02:28:07,830
that's going to be an obstacle to
proving that hypothesis

8642
02:28:07,830 --> 02:28:07,840
proving that hypothesis
 

8643
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:09,830
proving that hypothesis
if you are focused on sort of the local

8644
02:28:09,830 --> 02:28:09,840
if you are focused on sort of the local
 

8645
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:12,230
if you are focused on sort of the local
data that a person would typically have

8646
02:28:12,230 --> 02:28:12,240
data that a person would typically have
 

8647
02:28:12,240 --> 02:28:13,190
data that a person would typically have
if they were challenged so if you're

8648
02:28:13,190 --> 02:28:13,200
if they were challenged so if you're
 

8649
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,870
if they were challenged so if you're
just looking at one kid and his lack of

8650
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
just looking at one kid and his lack of
 

8651
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:16,870
just looking at one kid and his lack of
homework yeah

8652
02:28:16,870 --> 02:28:16,880
homework yeah
 

8653
02:28:16,880 --> 02:28:18,950
homework yeah
maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate

8654
02:28:18,950 --> 02:28:18,960
maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate
 

8655
02:28:18,960 --> 02:28:20,230
maybe you can't tell whether his dog ate
his homework or not if you happen to

8656
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:20,240
his homework or not if you happen to
 

8657
02:28:20,240 --> 02:28:22,790
his homework or not if you happen to
know he doesn't have a dog

8658
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:22,800
know he doesn't have a dog
 

8659
02:28:22,800 --> 02:28:24,630
know he doesn't have a dog
you might have more confidence right you

8660
02:28:24,630 --> 02:28:24,640
you might have more confidence right you
 

8661
02:28:24,640 --> 02:28:26,230
you might have more confidence right you
will need to have a wider range of

8662
02:28:26,230 --> 02:28:26,240
will need to have a wider range of
 

8663
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:28,150
will need to have a wider range of
evidence than a typical person would

8664
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:28,160
evidence than a typical person would
 

8665
02:28:28,160 --> 02:28:29,670
evidence than a typical person would
when they're encountering that actual

8666
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:29,680
when they're encountering that actual
 

8667
02:28:29,680 --> 02:28:33,349
when they're encountering that actual
excuse in order to see past the excuse

8668
02:28:33,349 --> 02:28:33,359
excuse in order to see past the excuse
 

8669
02:28:33,359 --> 02:28:35,190
excuse in order to see past the excuse
that will just be a general feature of

8670
02:28:35,190 --> 02:28:35,200
that will just be a general feature of
 

8671
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,830
that will just be a general feature of
this so in order if i say you know

8672
02:28:37,830 --> 02:28:37,840
this so in order if i say you know
 

8673
02:28:37,840 --> 02:28:39,270
this so in order if i say you know
there's a usual story about where we go

8674
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:39,280
there's a usual story about where we go
 

8675
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,110
there's a usual story about where we go
to the doctor and then there's this

8676
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:41,120
to the doctor and then there's this
 

8677
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:43,110
to the doctor and then there's this
other explanation you know it'll be true

8678
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:43,120
other explanation you know it'll be true
 

8679
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:44,790
other explanation you know it'll be true
that you'll have to look at wider data

8680
02:28:44,790 --> 02:28:44,800
that you'll have to look at wider data
 

8681
02:28:44,800 --> 02:28:47,510
that you'll have to look at wider data
in order to see that because

8682
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:47,520
in order to see that because
 

8683
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:49,110
in order to see that because
you know people don't usually offer

8684
02:28:49,110 --> 02:28:49,120
you know people don't usually offer
 

8685
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:51,429
you know people don't usually offer
excuses unless in the local context of

8686
02:28:51,429 --> 02:28:51,439
excuses unless in the local context of
 

8687
02:28:51,439 --> 02:28:53,910
excuses unless in the local context of
their excuse they can get away with it

8688
02:28:53,910 --> 02:28:53,920
their excuse they can get away with it
 

8689
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:56,630
their excuse they can get away with it
that is it's hard to tell right

8690
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:56,640
that is it's hard to tell right
 

8691
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:58,630
that is it's hard to tell right
so in the case of medicine i have to

8692
02:28:58,630 --> 02:28:58,640
so in the case of medicine i have to
 

8693
02:28:58,640 --> 02:29:01,750
so in the case of medicine i have to
point you to sort of larger sets of data

8694
02:29:01,750 --> 02:29:01,760
point you to sort of larger sets of data
 

8695
02:29:01,760 --> 02:29:05,190
point you to sort of larger sets of data
but in many areas of academia including

8696
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:05,200
but in many areas of academia including
 

8697
02:29:05,200 --> 02:29:06,790
but in many areas of academia including
health economics

8698
02:29:06,790 --> 02:29:06,800
health economics
 

8699
02:29:06,800 --> 02:29:09,030
health economics
the researchers there also

8700
02:29:09,030 --> 02:29:09,040
the researchers there also
 

8701
02:29:09,040 --> 02:29:11,670
the researchers there also
want to support the usual points of view

8702
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:11,680
want to support the usual points of view
 

8703
02:29:11,680 --> 02:29:13,110
want to support the usual points of view
and so they will

8704
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:13,120
and so they will
 

8705
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:14,309
and so they will
have selection effects in their

they
if they're getting a result too much

if they're getting a result too much
 

8713

if they're getting a result too much
contrary to the usual point of view

8714
02:29:20,150 --> 02:29:20,160
contrary to the usual point of view
 

8715
02:29:20,160 --> 02:29:22,389
contrary to the usual point of view
everybody wants to have they will file

8716
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,399
everybody wants to have they will file
 

8717
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:23,910
everybody wants to have they will file
draw that paper

8718
02:29:23,910 --> 02:29:23,920
draw that paper
 

8719
02:29:23,920 --> 02:29:26,070
draw that paper
or redo the analysis until they get an

8720
02:29:26,070 --> 02:29:26,080
or redo the analysis until they get an
 

8721
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:29,110
or redo the analysis until they get an
answer that's more to people's liking

02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:29,120
answer that's more to people's liking
 

8723
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:30,950
answer that's more to people's liking
so that means in the health economics

8724
02:29:30,950 --> 02:29:30,960
so that means in the health economics
 

8725
02:29:30,960 --> 02:29:32,630
so that means in the health economics
literature there are plenty of people

02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:32,640
literature there are plenty of people
 

8727
02:29:32,640 --> 02:29:34,710
literature there are plenty of people
who will claim that in fact we have

02:29:34,710 --> 02:29:34,720
who will claim that in fact we have
 

8729
02:29:34,720 --> 02:29:37,830
who will claim that in fact we have

and when i respond i will have to point
 

8733
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:43,750

02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:45,760
and ask you to consider the possibility
 

8737
02:29:45,760 --> 02:29:47,750
and ask you to consider the possibility
that the literature is biased in that

that the literature is biased in that
 

8739

when we get to the kind of evidence

8750
02:29:57,270 --> 02:29:57,280
when we get to the kind of evidence
 

8751
02:29:57,280 --> 02:29:59,429
when we get to the kind of evidence
that's much harder to mess with

that's much harder to mess with
 

8753
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:01,030
that's much harder to mess with
that's where the that's where we will

that's where the that's where we will
 

8755
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:03,750
that's where the that's where we will
see the truth be more revealed so with

respect to medicine
 

8759
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:07,910

few half dozen or so papers
where it would be the hardest to hide it

where it would be the hardest to hide it
 

8777
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:28,630
where it would be the hardest to hide it
because it's such a straightforward

because it's such a straightforward

that um
 

8783
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:36,070
that um
you know it's hard to manipulate and

02:30:36,070 --> 02:30:36,080
you know it's hard to manipulate and
 

8785
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:38,070
you know it's hard to manipulate and
that's where i will point you to to show

8786
02:30:38,070 --> 02:30:38,080
that's where i will point you to to show
 

8787
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:39,429
that's where i will point you to to show
you that there's relatively little

you that there's relatively little

02:30:42,309 --> 02:30:42,319
but even then
 

8793
02:30:42,319 --> 02:30:44,309
but even then
people could try to save the phenomenon

8794
02:30:44,309 --> 02:30:44,319
people could try to save the phenomenon
 

8795
02:30:44,319 --> 02:30:45,590
people could try to save the phenomenon
and say well it's not hidden motives

8796
02:30:45,590 --> 02:30:45,600
and say well it's not hidden motives
 

8797
02:30:45,600 --> 02:30:47,190
and say well it's not hidden motives
it's just ignorance they could say for

8798
02:30:47,190 --> 02:30:47,200
it's just ignorance they could say for
 

8799
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:48,870
it's just ignorance they could say for
example

8800
02:30:48,870 --> 02:30:48,880
example
 

8801
02:30:48,880 --> 02:30:50,790
example
you know medicine's complicated most

8802
02:30:50,790 --> 02:30:50,800
you know medicine's complicated most
 

8803
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:53,190
you know medicine's complicated most
people don't know the literature

8804
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:53,200
people don't know the literature
 

8805
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:54,630
people don't know the literature
therefore

8806
02:30:54,630 --> 02:30:54,640
therefore
 

8807
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:56,710
therefore
they can be excused for for ignorance

8808
02:30:56,710 --> 02:30:56,720
they can be excused for for ignorance
 

8809
02:30:56,720 --> 02:30:58,630
they can be excused for for ignorance
they are just ignorantly assuming that

8810
02:30:58,630 --> 02:30:58,640
they are just ignorantly assuming that
 

8811
02:30:58,640 --> 02:31:00,230
they are just ignorantly assuming that
medicine is effective it's not that they

8812
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:00,240
medicine is effective it's not that they
 

8813
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:01,590
medicine is effective it's not that they
have some other motive that they're

8814
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:01,600
have some other motive that they're
 

8815
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:04,150
have some other motive that they're
trying to achieve

8816
02:31:04,150 --> 02:31:04,160
trying to achieve
 

8817
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,150
trying to achieve
and then i will have to do you know as

8818
02:31:06,150 --> 02:31:06,160
and then i will have to do you know as
 

8819
02:31:06,160 --> 02:31:08,070
and then i will have to do you know as
with a conspiracy theory analysis and

8820
02:31:08,070 --> 02:31:08,080
with a conspiracy theory analysis and
 

8821
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:10,950
with a conspiracy theory analysis and
i'm saying well like how long has this

8822
02:31:10,950 --> 02:31:10,960
i'm saying well like how long has this
 

8823
02:31:10,960 --> 02:31:12,710
i'm saying well like how long has this
misperception be going on how

8824
02:31:12,710 --> 02:31:12,720
misperception be going on how
 

8825
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:14,710
misperception be going on how
consistently has it happened around the

8826
02:31:14,710 --> 02:31:14,720
consistently has it happened around the
 

8827
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,349
consistently has it happened around the
world and across time

8828
02:31:17,349 --> 02:31:17,359
world and across time
 

8829
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:19,510
world and across time
and i would have to say look uh you know

8830
02:31:19,510 --> 02:31:19,520
and i would have to say look uh you know
 

8831
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,429
and i would have to say look uh you know
if we're talking about say a recent new

8832
02:31:21,429 --> 02:31:21,439
if we're talking about say a recent new
 

8833
02:31:21,439 --> 02:31:24,230
if we're talking about say a recent new
product like segway scooters or

8834
02:31:24,230 --> 02:31:24,240
product like segway scooters or
 

8835
02:31:24,240 --> 02:31:25,270
product like segway scooters or
something

8836
02:31:25,270 --> 02:31:25,280
something
 

8837
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:26,870
something
i could say not so many people have seen

8838
02:31:26,870 --> 02:31:26,880
i could say not so many people have seen
 

8839
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:28,389
i could say not so many people have seen
them or use them maybe they could be

8840
02:31:28,389 --> 02:31:28,399
them or use them maybe they could be
 

8841
02:31:28,399 --> 02:31:29,990
them or use them maybe they could be
confused about their value if we're

8842
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:30,000
confused about their value if we're
 

8843
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:31,270
confused about their value if we're
talking about a product that's been

8844
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,280
talking about a product that's been
 

8845
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,110
talking about a product that's been
around for thousands of years used in

8846
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
around for thousands of years used in
 

8847
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,790
around for thousands of years used in
roughly the same way all across the

8848
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:34,800
roughly the same way all across the
 

8849
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:36,790
roughly the same way all across the
world and we see the same pattern over

8850
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:36,800
world and we see the same pattern over
 

8851
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:38,150
world and we see the same pattern over
and over again

8852
02:31:38,150 --> 02:31:38,160
and over again
 

8853
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:39,270
and over again
this sort of

8854
02:31:39,270 --> 02:31:39,280
this sort of
 

8855
02:31:39,280 --> 02:31:41,030
this sort of
ignorance mistake just doesn't work so

8856
02:31:41,030 --> 02:31:41,040
ignorance mistake just doesn't work so
 

8857
02:31:41,040 --> 02:31:44,630
ignorance mistake just doesn't work so
well it also is a question of

8858
02:31:44,630 --> 02:31:44,640
well it also is a question of
 

8859
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:47,349
well it also is a question of
how much of the self-deception

8860
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:47,359
how much of the self-deception
 

8861
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:50,389
how much of the self-deception
is prevalent versus foundational

8862
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:50,399
is prevalent versus foundational
 

8863
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:52,309
is prevalent versus foundational
because there's a kind of implied thing

8864
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319
because there's a kind of implied thing
 

8865
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,830
because there's a kind of implied thing
where it's foundational to human

8866
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:54,840
where it's foundational to human
 

8867
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:59,590
where it's foundational to human
nature versus just a common pitfall

8868
02:31:59,590 --> 02:31:59,600
nature versus just a common pitfall
 

8869
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:01,830
nature versus just a common pitfall
this is this is a question i have so

8870
02:32:01,830 --> 02:32:01,840
this is this is a question i have so
 

8871
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,150
this is this is a question i have so
like maybe maybe human progress is made

8872
02:32:04,150 --> 02:32:04,160
like maybe maybe human progress is made
 

8873
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:05,590
like maybe maybe human progress is made
by people

8874
02:32:05,590 --> 02:32:05,600
by people
 

8875
02:32:05,600 --> 02:32:09,110
by people
who don't fall into the self-deception

8876
02:32:09,110 --> 02:32:09,120
who don't fall into the self-deception
 

8877
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:11,030
who don't fall into the self-deception
it's it's like it's a baser aspect of

8878
02:32:11,030 --> 02:32:11,040
it's it's like it's a baser aspect of
 

8879
02:32:11,040 --> 02:32:12,710
it's it's like it's a baser aspect of
human nature but then you escape it

8880
02:32:12,710 --> 02:32:12,720
human nature but then you escape it
 

8881
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:15,750
human nature but then you escape it
easily if you if you're motivated

8882
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:15,760
easily if you if you're motivated
 

8883
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:18,150
easily if you if you're motivated
the motivational hypotheses about these

8884
02:32:18,150 --> 02:32:18,160
the motivational hypotheses about these
 

8885
02:32:18,160 --> 02:32:20,550
the motivational hypotheses about these
self-deceptions are in terms of how it

8886
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:20,560
self-deceptions are in terms of how it
 

8887
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,910
self-deceptions are in terms of how it
makes you look to the people around you

8888
02:32:21,910 --> 02:32:21,920
makes you look to the people around you
 

8889
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:24,309
makes you look to the people around you
again the press secretary yes so the

8890
02:32:24,309 --> 02:32:24,319
again the press secretary yes so the
 

8891
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:25,670
again the press secretary yes so the
story would be

8892
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
story would be
 

8893
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,349
story would be
most people want to look good to the

8894
02:32:27,349 --> 02:32:27,359
most people want to look good to the
 

8895
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:29,510
most people want to look good to the
people around them

8896
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:29,520
people around them
 

8897
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:31,190
people around them
therefore most people present themselves

8898
02:32:31,190 --> 02:32:31,200
therefore most people present themselves
 

8899
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,870
therefore most people present themselves
in ways that

8900
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:32,880
in ways that
 

8901
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,309
in ways that
help them look good to the people around

8902
02:32:34,309 --> 02:32:34,319
help them look good to the people around
 

8903
02:32:34,319 --> 02:32:36,389
help them look good to the people around
them

8904
02:32:36,389 --> 02:32:36,399
them
 

8905
02:32:36,399 --> 02:32:37,990
them
that's sufficient to say there would be

8906
02:32:37,990 --> 02:32:38,000
that's sufficient to say there would be
 

8907
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,790
that's sufficient to say there would be
a lot of it it doesn't need to be 100

8908
02:32:40,790 --> 02:32:40,800
a lot of it it doesn't need to be 100
 

8909
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:42,950
a lot of it it doesn't need to be 100
right there's enough variety in people

8910
02:32:42,950 --> 02:32:42,960
right there's enough variety in people
 

8911
02:32:42,960 --> 02:32:44,469
right there's enough variety in people
and in circumstances that sometimes

8912
02:32:44,469 --> 02:32:44,479
and in circumstances that sometimes
 

8913
02:32:44,479 --> 02:32:46,469
and in circumstances that sometimes
taking a contrary in strategy can be in

8914
02:32:46,469 --> 02:32:46,479
taking a contrary in strategy can be in
 

8915
02:32:46,479 --> 02:32:48,150
taking a contrary in strategy can be in
the interest of some minority of the

8916
02:32:48,150 --> 02:32:48,160
the interest of some minority of the
 

8917
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:49,510
the interest of some minority of the
people

8918
02:32:49,510 --> 02:32:49,520
people
 

8919
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:51,670
people
so i might for example say that that's a

8920
02:32:51,670 --> 02:32:51,680
so i might for example say that that's a
 

8921
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:53,510
so i might for example say that that's a
strategy i've taken

8922
02:32:53,510 --> 02:32:53,520
strategy i've taken
 

8923
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:55,429
strategy i've taken
i've decided that uh

8924
02:32:55,429 --> 02:32:55,439
i've decided that uh
 

8925
02:32:55,439 --> 02:32:57,990
i've decided that uh
being contrarian on these things could

8926
02:32:57,990 --> 02:32:58,000
being contrarian on these things could
 

8927
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,750
being contrarian on these things could
be winning for me

8928
02:32:59,750 --> 02:32:59,760
be winning for me
 

8929
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:01,590
be winning for me
in that there's a room for a small

8930
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:01,600
in that there's a room for a small
 

8931
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:04,309
in that there's a room for a small
number of people like me who have

8932
02:33:04,309 --> 02:33:04,319
number of people like me who have
 

8933
02:33:04,319 --> 02:33:06,230
number of people like me who have
these sort of messages who can then get

8934
02:33:06,230 --> 02:33:06,240
these sort of messages who can then get
 

8935
02:33:06,240 --> 02:33:08,070
these sort of messages who can then get
more attention even if there's not room

8936
02:33:08,070 --> 02:33:08,080
more attention even if there's not room
 

8937
02:33:08,080 --> 02:33:10,469
more attention even if there's not room
for most people to do that

8938
02:33:10,469 --> 02:33:10,479
for most people to do that
 

8939
02:33:10,479 --> 02:33:13,030
for most people to do that
and uh that can be explaining sort of

8940
02:33:13,030 --> 02:33:13,040
and uh that can be explaining sort of
 

8941
02:33:13,040 --> 02:33:14,790
and uh that can be explaining sort of
the variety right so similarly you might

8942
02:33:14,790 --> 02:33:14,800
the variety right so similarly you might
 

8943
02:33:14,800 --> 02:33:16,070
the variety right so similarly you might
say look

8944
02:33:16,070 --> 02:33:16,080
say look
 

8945
02:33:16,080 --> 02:33:17,429
say look
just look at the most obvious things

8946
02:33:17,429 --> 02:33:17,439
just look at the most obvious things
 

8947
02:33:17,439 --> 02:33:18,870
just look at the most obvious things
most people would like to look good

8948
02:33:18,870 --> 02:33:18,880
most people would like to look good
 

8949
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:20,309
most people would like to look good
right in the sense of physically just

8950
02:33:20,309 --> 02:33:20,319
right in the sense of physically just
 

8951
02:33:20,319 --> 02:33:21,670
right in the sense of physically just
you look good right now you're wearing a

8952
02:33:21,670 --> 02:33:21,680
you look good right now you're wearing a
 

8953
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:23,429
you look good right now you're wearing a
nice suit you have a haircut you shaved

8954
02:33:23,429 --> 02:33:23,439
nice suit you have a haircut you shaved
 

8955
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:24,309
nice suit you have a haircut you shaved
right

8956
02:33:24,309 --> 02:33:24,319
right
 

8957
02:33:24,319 --> 02:33:26,630
right
so and we accept my own hair but okay

8958
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
so and we accept my own hair but okay
 

8959
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,230
so and we accept my own hair but okay
well that's all more impressive that's

8960
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:28,240
well that's all more impressive that's
 

8961
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,790
well that's all more impressive that's
the counter uh that's the counter

8962
02:33:30,790 --> 02:33:30,800
the counter uh that's the counter
 

8963
02:33:30,800 --> 02:33:32,710
the counter uh that's the counter
argument for your claim right

8964
02:33:32,710 --> 02:33:32,720
argument for your claim right
 

8965
02:33:32,720 --> 02:33:34,230
argument for your claim right
so clearly if we look at most people in

8966
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:34,240
so clearly if we look at most people in
 

8967
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:35,670
so clearly if we look at most people in
their physical appearance clearly most

8968
02:33:35,670 --> 02:33:35,680
their physical appearance clearly most
 

8969
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:37,510
their physical appearance clearly most
people are trying to look somewhat nice

8970
02:33:37,510 --> 02:33:37,520
people are trying to look somewhat nice
 

8971
02:33:37,520 --> 02:33:39,910
people are trying to look somewhat nice
right they shower they they shave they

8972
02:33:39,910 --> 02:33:39,920
right they shower they they shave they
 

8973
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:41,670
right they shower they they shave they
comb their hair but we certainly see

8974
02:33:41,670 --> 02:33:41,680
comb their hair but we certainly see
 

8975
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:43,510
comb their hair but we certainly see
some people around who are not trying to

8976
02:33:43,510 --> 02:33:43,520
some people around who are not trying to
 

8977
02:33:43,520 --> 02:33:45,270
some people around who are not trying to
look so nice right is that a

8978
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:45,280
look so nice right is that a
 

8979
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:47,110
look so nice right is that a
big challenge the hypothesis that people

8980
02:33:47,110 --> 02:33:47,120
big challenge the hypothesis that people
 

8981
02:33:47,120 --> 02:33:49,830
big challenge the hypothesis that people
want to look nice not that much right we

8982
02:33:49,830 --> 02:33:49,840
want to look nice not that much right we
 

8983
02:33:49,840 --> 02:33:50,870
want to look nice not that much right we
can see

8984
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:50,880
can see
 

8985
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:53,750
can see
in the those particular people's context

8986
02:33:53,750 --> 02:33:53,760
in the those particular people's context
 

8987
02:33:53,760 --> 02:33:55,349
in the those particular people's context
more particular reasons why they've

8988
02:33:55,349 --> 02:33:55,359
more particular reasons why they've
 

8989
02:33:55,359 --> 02:33:56,870
more particular reasons why they've
chosen to be an exception to the more

8990
02:33:56,870 --> 02:33:56,880
chosen to be an exception to the more
 

8991
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,550
chosen to be an exception to the more
general rule

8992
02:33:58,550 --> 02:33:58,560
general rule
 

8993
02:33:58,560 --> 02:34:00,070
general rule
so the general rule does reveal

8994
02:34:00,070 --> 02:34:00,080
so the general rule does reveal
 

8995
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:03,750
so the general rule does reveal
something foundational generally

8996
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:03,760
something foundational generally
 

8997
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:05,670
something foundational generally
right that's that's the way things work

8998
02:34:05,670 --> 02:34:05,680
right that's that's the way things work
 

8999
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:07,429
right that's that's the way things work
let me let me ask you you wrote a blog

9000
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
let me let me ask you you wrote a blog
 

9001
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:09,349
let me let me ask you you wrote a blog
post about the accuracy of authorities

uh
just looking around us

9010
02:34:16,630 --> 02:34:16,640
just looking around us
 

9011
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:17,830
just looking around us
especially during this time of the

9012
02:34:17,830 --> 02:34:17,840
especially during this time of the
 

9013
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:20,870
especially during this time of the
pandemic there's been a growing distrust

9014
02:34:20,870 --> 02:34:20,880
pandemic there's been a growing distrust
 

9015
02:34:20,880 --> 02:34:23,910
pandemic there's been a growing distrust
of authorities of institutions

9016
02:34:23,910 --> 02:34:23,920
of authorities of institutions
 

9017
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:27,750
of authorities of institutions
even an institution of science itself

9018
02:34:27,750 --> 02:34:27,760
even an institution of science itself
 

9019
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:30,150
even an institution of science itself
what are the pros and cons of

9020
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
what are the pros and cons of
 

9021
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,389
what are the pros and cons of
authorities would you say

9022
02:34:32,389 --> 02:34:32,399
authorities would you say
 

9023
02:34:32,399 --> 02:34:35,750
authorities would you say
so what's nice about authorities

9024
02:34:35,750 --> 02:34:35,760

that is uh
 

9043
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:59,349
that is uh
you know when you're asking what should

something too contrarian too weird too

9052

something too contrarian too weird too
 

9053
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:09,510
something too contrarian too weird too
speculative that

9054
02:35:09,510 --> 02:35:09,520
speculative that
 

9055
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:11,349
speculative that
that would look make me look bad so i

9056
02:35:11,349 --> 02:35:11,359
that would look make me look bad so i
 

9057
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:12,630
that would look make me look bad so i
would just choose something very

9058
02:35:12,630 --> 02:35:12,640
would just choose something very
 

9059
02:35:12,640 --> 02:35:14,230
would just choose something very
conservative

9060
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:14,240
conservative
 

9061
02:35:14,240 --> 02:35:16,550
conservative
so maybe an authority lets you choose

9062
02:35:16,550 --> 02:35:16,560
so maybe an authority lets you choose
 

9063
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:18,070
so maybe an authority lets you choose
something a little less conservative

9064
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:18,080
something a little less conservative
 

9065
02:35:18,080 --> 02:35:20,070
something a little less conservative
because the authority is your

9066
02:35:20,070 --> 02:35:20,080
because the authority is your
 

9067
02:35:20,080 --> 02:35:22,550
because the authority is your
authorization the authority will let you

9068
02:35:22,550 --> 02:35:22,560
authorization the authority will let you
 

9069
02:35:22,560 --> 02:35:24,389
authorization the authority will let you
do it and you can say and somebody says

9070
02:35:24,389 --> 02:35:24,399
do it and you can say and somebody says
 

9071
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:26,070
do it and you can say and somebody says
why did you do that thing and they say

9072
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:26,080
why did you do that thing and they say
 

9073
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,670
why did you do that thing and they say
the authority authorized it the

9074
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:27,680
the authority authorized it the
 

9075
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:29,910
the authority authorized it the
authority tells me i should do this why

9076
02:35:29,910 --> 02:35:29,920
authority tells me i should do this why
 

9077
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,670
authority tells me i should do this why
aren't you doing it right so the

9078
02:35:31,670 --> 02:35:31,680
aren't you doing it right so the
 

9079
02:35:31,680 --> 02:35:33,429
aren't you doing it right so the
authority's often pushing for the

9080
02:35:33,429 --> 02:35:33,439
authority's often pushing for the
 

9081
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:35,910
authority's often pushing for the
conservative well no the authority can

9082
02:35:35,910 --> 02:35:35,920
conservative well no the authority can
 

9083
02:35:35,920 --> 02:35:37,750
conservative well no the authority can
do more i mean so for example we just

9084
02:35:37,750 --> 02:35:37,760
do more i mean so for example we just
 

9085
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:38,870
do more i mean so for example we just
think about

9086
02:35:38,870 --> 02:35:38,880
think about
 

9087
02:35:38,880 --> 02:35:41,270
think about
i don't know in a pandemic even right

9088
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
i don't know in a pandemic even right
 

9089
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:42,870
i don't know in a pandemic even right
you could just think i'll just stay home

9090
02:35:42,870 --> 02:35:42,880
you could just think i'll just stay home
 

9091
02:35:42,880 --> 02:35:43,990
you could just think i'll just stay home
and close all the doors or i'll just

9092
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:44,000
and close all the doors or i'll just
 

9093
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:45,349
and close all the doors or i'll just
ignore it right you could just think of

9094
02:35:45,349 --> 02:35:45,359
ignore it right you could just think of
 

9095
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:47,030
ignore it right you could just think of
just some very simple strategy that

9096
02:35:47,030 --> 02:35:47,040
just some very simple strategy that
 

9097
02:35:47,040 --> 02:35:49,030
just some very simple strategy that
might be defensible if there were no

9098
02:35:49,030 --> 02:35:49,040
might be defensible if there were no
 

9099
02:35:49,040 --> 02:35:50,309
might be defensible if there were no
authorities

9100
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
authorities
 

9101
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:53,190
authorities
right but authorities might be able to

9102
02:35:53,190 --> 02:35:53,200
right but authorities might be able to
 

9103
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:54,469
right but authorities might be able to
know more than that they might be able

9104
02:35:54,469 --> 02:35:54,479
know more than that they might be able
 

9105
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:56,469
know more than that they might be able
to like look at some evidence draw a

9106
02:35:56,469 --> 02:35:56,479
to like look at some evidence draw a
 

9107
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:58,150
to like look at some evidence draw a
more context-dependent conclusion

9108
02:35:58,150 --> 02:35:58,160
more context-dependent conclusion
 

9109
02:35:58,160 --> 02:36:00,389
more context-dependent conclusion
declare it as the authority's opinion

9110
02:36:00,389 --> 02:36:00,399
declare it as the authority's opinion
 

9111
02:36:00,399 --> 02:36:01,590
declare it as the authority's opinion
and then other people might follow that

9112
02:36:01,590 --> 02:36:01,600
and then other people might follow that
 

9113
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:02,630
and then other people might follow that
and that could be better than doing

9114
02:36:02,630 --> 02:36:02,640
and that could be better than doing
 

9115
02:36:02,640 --> 02:36:05,990
and that could be better than doing
nothing so what you mentioned who

other and then they'd be fighting each
 

9169
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:00,469
other and then they'd be fighting each

action that you would always do without
 

9175
02:37:04,560 --> 02:37:06,950

02:37:06,950 --> 02:37:06,960
responding to context so the potential
 

9177
02:37:06,960 --> 02:37:09,110
responding to context so the potential
gain of an authority is that they could

9178
02:37:09,110 --> 02:37:09,120
gain of an authority is that they could
 

9179
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:12,469
gain of an authority is that they could
no more than just basic ignorance and if

9180
02:37:12,469 --> 02:37:12,479
no more than just basic ignorance and if
 

9181
02:37:12,479 --> 02:37:14,870
no more than just basic ignorance and if
people followed them they could both be

9182
02:37:14,870 --> 02:37:14,880
people followed them they could both be
 

9183
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:16,870
people followed them they could both be
more informed than ignorance and all

9184
02:37:16,870 --> 02:37:16,880
more informed than ignorance and all
 

9185
02:37:16,880 --> 02:37:18,309
more informed than ignorance and all
doing the same thing so they're each

9186
02:37:18,309 --> 02:37:18,319
doing the same thing so they're each
 

9187
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:20,230
doing the same thing so they're each
protected from being accused or

okay so what's the negative how does
that go wrong the con is that if you

you become an authority that just wants

02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:05,840
uh sitting on a throne of power so this
 

9459
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:07,990
uh sitting on a throne of power so this
is core to sort of what it is to be an

there you go for the authority again no

9466
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:13,760
there you go for the authority again no
 

9467
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,469
there you go for the authority again no
so it's about saying just joking yes we

9468
02:42:16,469 --> 02:42:16,479
so it's about saying just joking yes we
 

9469
02:42:16,479 --> 02:42:18,870
so it's about saying just joking yes we
often have a situation where we see a

9470
02:42:18,870 --> 02:42:18,880
often have a situation where we see a
 

9471
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,710
often have a situation where we see a
world of behavior

9472
02:42:20,710 --> 02:42:20,720
world of behavior
 

9473
02:42:20,720 --> 02:42:22,790
world of behavior
and then we see ways in which particular

9474
02:42:22,790 --> 02:42:22,800
and then we see ways in which particular
 

9475
02:42:22,800 --> 02:42:25,429
and then we see ways in which particular
behaviors are not sort of maximally

9476
02:42:25,429 --> 02:42:25,439
behaviors are not sort of maximally
 

9477
02:42:25,439 --> 02:42:27,030
behaviors are not sort of maximally
socially useful

9478
02:42:27,030 --> 02:42:27,040
socially useful
 

9479
02:42:27,040 --> 02:42:28,070
socially useful
yes

9480
02:42:28,070 --> 02:42:28,080
yes
 

9481
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:29,510
yes
and

9482
02:42:29,510 --> 02:42:29,520
and
 

9483
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:31,590
and
we have a variety of reactions to that

9484
02:42:31,590 --> 02:42:31,600
we have a variety of reactions to that
 

9485
02:42:31,600 --> 02:42:33,670
we have a variety of reactions to that
so one kind of reaction is to sort of

9486
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:33,680
so one kind of reaction is to sort of
 

9487
02:42:33,680 --> 02:42:35,910
so one kind of reaction is to sort of
morally blame each individual

9488
02:42:35,910 --> 02:42:35,920
morally blame each individual
 

9489
02:42:35,920 --> 02:42:37,750
morally blame each individual
for not doing the maxillary socially

9490
02:42:37,750 --> 02:42:37,760
for not doing the maxillary socially
 

9491
02:42:37,760 --> 02:42:40,710
for not doing the maxillary socially
useful thing

9492
02:42:40,710 --> 02:42:40,720
useful thing
 

9493
02:42:40,720 --> 02:42:42,550
useful thing
under perhaps the idea that people could

9494
02:42:42,550 --> 02:42:42,560
under perhaps the idea that people could
 

9495
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:44,550
under perhaps the idea that people could
be identified and shamed for that and

9496
02:42:44,550 --> 02:42:44,560
be identified and shamed for that and
 

9497
02:42:44,560 --> 02:42:46,309
be identified and shamed for that and
may be induced into doing the better

9498
02:42:46,309 --> 02:42:46,319
may be induced into doing the better
 

9499
02:42:46,319 --> 02:42:48,710
may be induced into doing the better
thing if only enough people were calling

9500
02:42:48,710 --> 02:42:48,720
thing if only enough people were calling
 

9501
02:42:48,720 --> 02:42:51,030
thing if only enough people were calling
them out on it right

9502
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,040
them out on it right
 

9503
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,550
them out on it right
but another way to think about it is to

9504
02:42:52,550 --> 02:42:52,560
but another way to think about it is to
 

9505
02:42:52,560 --> 02:42:55,030
but another way to think about it is to
think that people sit in institutions

9506
02:42:55,030 --> 02:42:55,040
think that people sit in institutions
 

9507
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,150
think that people sit in institutions
with certain

9508
02:42:56,150 --> 02:42:56,160
with certain
 

9509
02:42:56,160 --> 02:42:57,990
with certain
you know stable institutional structures

and then you know perhaps to less blame

02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:12,560
and then you know perhaps to less blame

individuals for winning their local
 

9527

individuals for winning their local
institutional game and more blaming the

institutional game and more blaming the
 

9529
02:43:17,359 --> 02:43:19,190
institutional game and more blaming the

so economists are often like wondering

so economists are often like wondering

02:43:21,279 --> 02:43:22,870
so economists are often like wondering
what other institutions we could have

9534
02:43:22,870 --> 02:43:22,880
what other institutions we could have
 

9535
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:24,630
what other institutions we could have
instead of the ones we have and which of

instead of the ones we have and which of
 

9537
02:43:24,640 --> 02:43:26,150
instead of the ones we have and which of
them might promote better behavior and

9538
02:43:26,150 --> 02:43:26,160
them might promote better behavior and
 

9539
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:27,429
them might promote better behavior and
this is a common

02:43:27,429 --> 02:43:27,439
this is a common
 

9541
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:29,670
this is a common
thing we do all across human behavior is

9542
02:43:29,670 --> 02:43:29,680
thing we do all across human behavior is
 

9543
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:31,670
thing we do all across human behavior is
to think of what are the institutions

9544
02:43:31,670 --> 02:43:31,680
to think of what are the institutions
 

9545
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:33,030
to think of what are the institutions
we're in and what are the alternative

9546
02:43:33,030 --> 02:43:33,040
we're in and what are the alternative
 

9547
02:43:33,040 --> 02:43:34,710
we're in and what are the alternative
variations we could imagine and then to

9548
02:43:34,710 --> 02:43:34,720
variations we could imagine and then to
 

9549
02:43:34,720 --> 02:43:36,469
variations we could imagine and then to
say which institutions would be most

9550
02:43:36,469 --> 02:43:36,479
say which institutions would be most
 

9551
02:43:36,479 --> 02:43:38,309
say which institutions would be most
productive

9552

i would agree with you that our

information institutions by which we

information institutions by which we
collect information and aggregate it and

collect information and aggregate it and
 

9561
02:43:45,840 --> 02:43:48,550
collect information and aggregate it and
share with people are especially broken

share with people are especially broken
 

9563
02:43:48,560 --> 02:43:52,070
share with people are especially broken
in the sense of far from the ideal of

in the sense of far from the ideal of

02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:54,230
in the sense of far from the ideal of
what would be the most cost-effective

what would be the most cost-effective

02:43:54,240 --> 02:43:56,550
what would be the most cost-effective
way to collect and share information

way to collect and share information

better institutions
 

9575
02:44:00,880 --> 02:44:02,870
better institutions
and you know as an academic i'm aware

9576
02:44:02,870 --> 02:44:02,880
and you know as an academic i'm aware
 

9577
02:44:02,880 --> 02:44:06,230
and you know as an academic i'm aware
that academia is particularly broken

that academia is particularly broken
 

9579
02:44:06,240 --> 02:44:07,510
that academia is particularly broken
in the sense that we give people

in the sense that we give people
 

9581
02:44:07,520 --> 02:44:09,590
in the sense that we give people
incentives to you know do research

9582

incentives to you know do research
 

9583

that's not very interesting or important
 

9585
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:13,670
that's not very interesting or important

02:48:34,950 --> 02:48:34,960
that radical thought that happens when
 

9843
02:48:34,960 --> 02:48:36,469
that radical thought that happens when
you're an undergraduate student and you

9844
02:48:36,469 --> 02:48:36,479
you're an undergraduate student and you
 

9845
02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:37,830
you're an undergraduate student and you
can do all kinds of wild things when

9846
02:48:37,830 --> 02:48:37,840
can do all kinds of wild things when
 

9847
02:48:37,840 --> 02:48:39,670
can do all kinds of wild things when
you're a graduate student anyway all

9848
02:48:39,670 --> 02:48:39,680
you're a graduate student anyway all
 

9849
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:41,510
you're a graduate student anyway all
that to say you've thought about this

9850
02:48:41,510 --> 02:48:41,520
that to say you've thought about this
 

9851
02:48:41,520 --> 02:48:43,510
that to say you've thought about this
aspect too is there something

9852
02:48:43,510 --> 02:48:43,520
aspect too is there something
 

9853
02:48:43,520 --> 02:48:45,190
aspect too is there something
uh positive

9854
02:48:45,190 --> 02:48:45,200
uh positive
 

9855
02:48:45,200 --> 02:48:46,950
uh positive
insightful you could say about how we

9856
02:48:46,950 --> 02:48:46,960
insightful you could say about how we
 

9857
02:48:46,960 --> 02:48:48,630
insightful you could say about how we
can

9858
02:48:48,630 --> 02:48:48,640
can
 

9859
02:48:48,640 --> 02:48:50,389
can
make for better universities in the

9860
02:48:50,389 --> 02:48:50,399
make for better universities in the
 

9861
02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:51,910
make for better universities in the
decades to come this particular

9862
02:48:51,910 --> 02:48:51,920
decades to come this particular
 

9863
02:48:51,920 --> 02:48:53,269
decades to come this particular
institution

9864
02:48:53,269 --> 02:48:53,279
institution
 

9865
02:48:53,279 --> 02:48:55,349
institution
how can we improve them

9866
02:48:55,349 --> 02:48:55,359
how can we improve them
 

9867
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:58,389
how can we improve them
i hear that centuries ago many

9868
02:48:58,389 --> 02:48:58,399
i hear that centuries ago many
 

9869
02:48:58,399 --> 02:49:00,070
i hear that centuries ago many
scientists and intellectuals were

9870
02:49:00,070 --> 02:49:00,080
scientists and intellectuals were
 

9871
02:49:00,080 --> 02:49:01,429
scientists and intellectuals were
aristocrats

9872
02:49:01,429 --> 02:49:01,439
aristocrats
 

9873
02:49:01,439 --> 02:49:03,429
aristocrats
they had time

9874
02:49:03,429 --> 02:49:03,439
they had time
 

9875
02:49:03,439 --> 02:49:04,630
they had time
and

9876
02:49:04,630 --> 02:49:04,640
and
 

9877
02:49:04,640 --> 02:49:06,870
and
could if they chose choose to be

9878
02:49:06,870 --> 02:49:06,880
could if they chose choose to be
 

9879
02:49:06,880 --> 02:49:09,990
could if they chose choose to be
intellectuals

9880
02:49:09,990 --> 02:49:10,000

 

9881
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,309

that's a feature of the combination that

9882
02:49:12,309 --> 02:49:12,319
that's a feature of the combination that
 

9883
02:49:12,319 --> 02:49:14,469
that's a feature of the combination that
they had some source of resources that

9884
02:49:14,469 --> 02:49:14,479
they had some source of resources that
 

9885
02:49:14,479 --> 02:49:17,510
they had some source of resources that
allowed them leisure and that the kind

9886
02:49:17,510 --> 02:49:17,520
allowed them leisure and that the kind
 

9887
02:49:17,520 --> 02:49:19,590
allowed them leisure and that the kind
of competition they were faced in among

9888
02:49:19,590 --> 02:49:19,600
of competition they were faced in among
 

9889
02:49:19,600 --> 02:49:21,750
of competition they were faced in among
aristocrats allowed

9890
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:21,760
aristocrats allowed
 

9891
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:24,150
aristocrats allowed
that sort of a self-indulgence or

9892
02:49:24,150 --> 02:49:24,160
that sort of a self-indulgence or
 

9893
02:49:24,160 --> 02:49:26,070
that sort of a self-indulgence or
self-pursuit at least at some point in

9894
02:49:26,070 --> 02:49:26,080
self-pursuit at least at some point in
 

9895
02:49:26,080 --> 02:49:28,870
self-pursuit at least at some point in
their lives

9896
02:49:28,870 --> 02:49:28,880

 

9897
02:49:28,880 --> 02:49:30,630

so the analogous

9898
02:49:30,630 --> 02:49:30,640
so the analogous
 

9899
02:49:30,640 --> 02:49:32,230
so the analogous
observation is that

9900
02:49:32,230 --> 02:49:32,240
observation is that
 

9901
02:49:32,240 --> 02:49:33,910
observation is that
university professors

9902
02:49:33,910 --> 02:49:33,920
university professors
 

9903
02:49:33,920 --> 02:49:35,510
university professors
often have

9904
02:49:35,510 --> 02:49:35,520
often have
 

9905
02:49:35,520 --> 02:49:37,990
often have
sort of the freedom and space to do a

9906
02:49:37,990 --> 02:49:38,000
sort of the freedom and space to do a
 

9907
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:39,990
sort of the freedom and space to do a
wide range of things and i am certainly

9908
02:49:39,990 --> 02:49:40,000
wide range of things and i am certainly
 

9909
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,870
wide range of things and i am certainly
enjoying that as a tenured professor

9910
02:49:42,870 --> 02:49:42,880
enjoying that as a tenured professor
 

9911
02:49:42,880 --> 02:49:44,790
enjoying that as a tenured professor
you're really sorry to interrupt a

9912
02:49:44,790 --> 02:49:44,800
you're really sorry to interrupt a
 

9913
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:47,190
you're really sorry to interrupt a
really good representative of that just

9914
02:49:47,190 --> 02:49:47,200
really good representative of that just
 

9915
02:49:47,200 --> 02:49:48,870
really good representative of that just
the exploration you're doing the depth

9916
02:49:48,870 --> 02:49:48,880
the exploration you're doing the depth
 

9917
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:50,870
the exploration you're doing the depth
of thought the like

9918
02:49:50,870 --> 02:49:50,880
of thought the like
 

9919
02:49:50,880 --> 02:49:53,830
of thought the like
most people are afraid to do the kind of

9920
02:49:53,830 --> 02:49:53,840
most people are afraid to do the kind of
 

9921
02:49:53,840 --> 02:49:55,590
most people are afraid to do the kind of
broad thinking that you're doing which

9922
02:49:55,590 --> 02:49:55,600
broad thinking that you're doing which
 

9923
02:49:55,600 --> 02:49:56,950
broad thinking that you're doing which
is good the fact that

9924
02:49:56,950 --> 02:49:56,960
is good the fact that
 

9925
02:49:56,960 --> 02:49:58,469
is good the fact that
that can happen is the combination of

9926
02:49:58,469 --> 02:49:58,479
that can happen is the combination of
 

9927
02:49:58,479 --> 02:50:01,110
that can happen is the combination of
these two things analogously one is that

9928
02:50:01,110 --> 02:50:01,120
these two things analogously one is that
 

9929
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,870
these two things analogously one is that
we have fierce competition to become a

9930
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:02,880
we have fierce competition to become a
 

9931
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:04,309
we have fierce competition to become a
tenured professor but then once you

9932
02:50:04,309 --> 02:50:04,319
tenured professor but then once you
 

9933
02:50:04,319 --> 02:50:06,230
tenured professor but then once you
become tenured we give you the freedom

9934
02:50:06,230 --> 02:50:06,240
become tenured we give you the freedom
 

9935
02:50:06,240 --> 02:50:08,469
become tenured we give you the freedom
to do what you like

9936
02:50:08,469 --> 02:50:08,479
to do what you like
 

9937
02:50:08,479 --> 02:50:11,030
to do what you like
and that's a happenstance that didn't

9938
02:50:11,030 --> 02:50:11,040
and that's a happenstance that didn't
 

9939
02:50:11,040 --> 02:50:13,590
and that's a happenstance that didn't
have to be that way and in many other

9940
02:50:13,590 --> 02:50:13,600
have to be that way and in many other
 

9941
02:50:13,600 --> 02:50:15,190
have to be that way and in many other
walks of life even though people have a

9942
02:50:15,190 --> 02:50:15,200
walks of life even though people have a
 

9943
02:50:15,200 --> 02:50:17,349
walks of life even though people have a
lot of you know resources etc they don't

9944
02:50:17,349 --> 02:50:17,359
lot of you know resources etc they don't
 

9945
02:50:17,359 --> 02:50:19,429
lot of you know resources etc they don't
have that kind of freedom set up so

9946
02:50:19,429 --> 02:50:19,439
have that kind of freedom set up so
 

9947
02:50:19,439 --> 02:50:21,269
have that kind of freedom set up so
i think we're kind of i'm kind of lucky

9948
02:50:21,269 --> 02:50:21,279
i think we're kind of i'm kind of lucky
 

9949
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:23,110
i think we're kind of i'm kind of lucky
that tenure exists

9950
02:50:23,110 --> 02:50:23,120
that tenure exists
 

9951
02:50:23,120 --> 02:50:26,230
that tenure exists
and that i'm enjoying it um but i can't

9952
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:26,240
and that i'm enjoying it um but i can't
 

9953
02:50:26,240 --> 02:50:26,950
and that i'm enjoying it um but i can't
be

9954
02:50:26,950 --> 02:50:26,960
be
 

9955
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:28,870
be
too enthusiastic about this unless i can

9956
02:50:28,870 --> 02:50:28,880
too enthusiastic about this unless i can
 

9957
02:50:28,880 --> 02:50:30,309
too enthusiastic about this unless i can
approve of sort of the source of the

9958
02:50:30,309 --> 02:50:30,319
approve of sort of the source of the
 

9959
02:50:30,319 --> 02:50:32,070
approve of sort of the source of the
resources that's paying for all this

9960
02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,080
resources that's paying for all this
 

9961
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,429
resources that's paying for all this
right so for the aristocrat if you

9962
02:50:33,429 --> 02:50:33,439
right so for the aristocrat if you
 

9963
02:50:33,439 --> 02:50:35,349
right so for the aristocrat if you
thought they they stole it in war or

9964
02:50:35,349 --> 02:50:35,359
thought they they stole it in war or
 

9965
02:50:35,359 --> 02:50:36,630
thought they they stole it in war or
something

9966
02:50:36,630 --> 02:50:36,640
something
 

9967
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:38,230
something
you wouldn't be so pleased whereas if

9968
02:50:38,230 --> 02:50:38,240
you wouldn't be so pleased whereas if
 

9969
02:50:38,240 --> 02:50:39,670
you wouldn't be so pleased whereas if
you thought they had earned it or their

9970
02:50:39,670 --> 02:50:39,680
you thought they had earned it or their
 

9971
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:41,830
you thought they had earned it or their
ancestors had earned this money that

9972
02:50:41,830 --> 02:50:41,840
ancestors had earned this money that
 

9973
02:50:41,840 --> 02:50:43,510
ancestors had earned this money that
they were spending as an aristocrat then

9974
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:43,520
they were spending as an aristocrat then
 

9975
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:45,269
they were spending as an aristocrat then
you could be more okay with that right

9976
02:50:45,269 --> 02:50:45,279
you could be more okay with that right
 

9977
02:50:45,279 --> 02:50:46,150
you could be more okay with that right
so

9978
02:50:46,150 --> 02:50:46,160
so
 

9979
02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:48,790
so
for universities i have to ask you know

9980
02:50:48,790 --> 02:50:48,800
for universities i have to ask you know
 

9981
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:50,469
for universities i have to ask you know
where are the main sources of resources

9982
02:50:50,469 --> 02:50:50,479
where are the main sources of resources
 

9983
02:50:50,479 --> 02:50:52,790
where are the main sources of resources
that are going to the universities and

9984
02:50:52,790 --> 02:50:52,800
that are going to the universities and
 

9985
02:50:52,800 --> 02:50:54,230
that are going to the universities and
are they getting their money's worth or

9986
02:50:54,230 --> 02:50:54,240
are they getting their money's worth or
 

9987
02:50:54,240 --> 02:50:56,150
are they getting their money's worth or
are they getting a real good value for

9988
02:50:56,150 --> 02:50:56,160
are they getting a real good value for
 

9989
02:50:56,160 --> 02:50:57,349
are they getting a real good value for
that payment

9990
02:50:57,349 --> 02:50:57,359
that payment
 

9991
02:50:57,359 --> 02:50:58,150
that payment
right

9992
02:50:58,150 --> 02:50:58,160
right
 

9993
02:50:58,160 --> 02:51:00,710
right
so first of all they're students

9994
02:51:00,710 --> 02:51:00,720
so first of all they're students
 

9995
02:51:00,720 --> 02:51:01,510
so first of all they're students
and

9996
02:51:01,510 --> 02:51:01,520
and
 

9997
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:03,190
and
the question is are students getting

9998
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:03,200
the question is are students getting
 

9999
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:05,990
the question is are students getting
good value for their education and

10000
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
good value for their education and
 

10001
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,830
good value for their education and
you know on each person is getting value

10002
02:51:07,830 --> 02:51:07,840
you know on each person is getting value
 

10003
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:09,910
you know on each person is getting value
in the sense that they are identified

10004
02:51:09,910 --> 02:51:09,920
in the sense that they are identified
 

10005
02:51:09,920 --> 02:51:12,389
in the sense that they are identified
and shown to be a more capable person

10006
02:51:12,389 --> 02:51:12,399
and shown to be a more capable person
 

10007
02:51:12,399 --> 02:51:14,389
and shown to be a more capable person
which is then worth more salary as an

10008
02:51:14,389 --> 02:51:14,399
which is then worth more salary as an
 

10009
02:51:14,399 --> 02:51:16,070
which is then worth more salary as an
employee later

10010
02:51:16,070 --> 02:51:16,080
employee later
 

10011
02:51:16,080 --> 02:51:17,670
employee later
but there is a case for saying there's a

10012
02:51:17,670 --> 02:51:17,680
but there is a case for saying there's a
 

10013
02:51:17,680 --> 02:51:20,070
but there is a case for saying there's a
big waste to the system because we

10014
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:20,080
big waste to the system because we
 

10015
02:51:20,080 --> 02:51:22,550
big waste to the system because we
aren't actually changing the students or

10016
02:51:22,550 --> 02:51:22,560
aren't actually changing the students or
 

10017
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:24,790
aren't actually changing the students or
educating them we're more sorting them

10018
02:51:24,790 --> 02:51:24,800
educating them we're more sorting them
 

10019
02:51:24,800 --> 02:51:25,429
educating them we're more sorting them
or

10020
02:51:25,429 --> 02:51:25,439
or
 

10021
02:51:25,439 --> 02:51:26,790
or
labeling them

10022
02:51:26,790 --> 02:51:26,800
labeling them
 

10023
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:29,110
labeling them
and that's a very expensive process to

10024
02:51:29,110 --> 02:51:29,120
and that's a very expensive process to
 

10025
02:51:29,120 --> 02:51:30,950
and that's a very expensive process to
produce that outcome and part of the

10026
02:51:30,950 --> 02:51:30,960
produce that outcome and part of the
 

10027
02:51:30,960 --> 02:51:32,870
produce that outcome and part of the
expense is the you know freedom of from

02:51:32,870 --> 02:51:32,880
expense is the you know freedom of from

tenure i get so

10030
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:34,560
tenure i get so
 

10031
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,550
tenure i get so
i feel like i can't be too proud of that

10032
02:51:36,550 --> 02:51:36,560
i feel like i can't be too proud of that
 

10033
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:38,309
i feel like i can't be too proud of that
because it's basically a tax on all

10034
02:51:38,309 --> 02:51:38,319
because it's basically a tax on all
 

10035
02:51:38,319 --> 02:51:40,230
because it's basically a tax on all
these young students to pay this

10036
02:51:40,230 --> 02:51:40,240
these young students to pay this
 

10037
02:51:40,240 --> 02:51:41,830
these young students to pay this
enormous amount of money in order to be

10038
02:51:41,830 --> 02:51:41,840
enormous amount of money in order to be
 

10039
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:43,990
enormous amount of money in order to be
labeled as better whereas i feel like we

10040
02:51:43,990 --> 02:51:44,000
labeled as better whereas i feel like we
 

10041
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:45,349
labeled as better whereas i feel like we
should be able to find cheaper ways of

10042
02:51:45,349 --> 02:51:45,359
should be able to find cheaper ways of
 

10043
02:51:45,359 --> 02:51:46,950
should be able to find cheaper ways of
doing that

10044
02:51:46,950 --> 02:51:46,960
doing that
 

10045
02:51:46,960 --> 02:51:49,030
doing that
the other main customer is

the other main customer is

02:51:51,429 --> 02:51:51,439
researcher patrons like the unit the
 

10049
02:51:51,439 --> 02:51:53,510
researcher patrons like the unit the
government or other foundations and then

10050
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:53,520
government or other foundations and then
 

10051
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:54,870
government or other foundations and then
the question is are they getting their

10052
02:51:54,870 --> 02:51:54,880
the question is are they getting their
 

10053
02:51:54,880 --> 02:51:56,870
the question is are they getting their
money worth out of the money they're

10054
02:51:56,870 --> 02:51:56,880
money worth out of the money they're
 

10055
02:51:56,880 --> 02:51:58,830
money worth out of the money they're
paying for research to

02:51:58,830 --> 02:51:58,840
paying for research to
 

10057
02:51:58,840 --> 02:52:00,950
paying for research to
happen and

10058
02:52:00,950 --> 02:52:00,960
happen and
 

10059
02:52:00,960 --> 02:52:03,269
happen and
my analysis is they don't actually care

10060
02:52:03,269 --> 02:52:03,279
my analysis is they don't actually care
 

10061
02:52:03,279 --> 02:52:04,790
my analysis is they don't actually care
about the research progress they are

10062
02:52:04,790 --> 02:52:04,800
about the research progress they are

02:52:04,800 --> 02:52:06,550
about the research progress they are

10079
02:52:18,880 --> 02:52:21,030

is that a cynical

is that a cynical

so that there's a deep truth to that
cynical perspective is there

cynical perspective is there
 

10085
02:52:26,640 --> 02:52:28,790

progress of science and humanity they
might personally care but they're stuck

might personally care but they're stuck
 

10095
02:52:36,160 --> 02:52:37,670
might personally care but they're stuck
in an equilibrium

in an equilibrium
 

10097
02:52:37,680 --> 02:52:39,830
in an equilibrium
sure wherein they basically most

02:52:39,830 --> 02:52:39,840
sure wherein they basically most

foundations like governments or research
 

10101
02:52:42,560 --> 02:52:45,269
foundations like governments or research
or you know like the ford foundation

10102
02:52:45,269 --> 02:52:45,279
or you know like the ford foundation
 

10103
02:52:45,279 --> 02:52:46,389
or you know like the ford foundation
they are

10104
02:52:46,389 --> 02:52:46,399
they are
 

10105
02:52:46,399 --> 02:52:48,950
they are
the individuals there are rated based on

10106
02:52:48,950 --> 02:52:48,960
the individuals there are rated based on
 

10107
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:50,230
the individuals there are rated based on
the prestige they bring to that

10108
02:52:50,230 --> 02:52:50,240
the prestige they bring to that
 

10109
02:52:50,240 --> 02:52:51,590
the prestige they bring to that
organization

10110
02:52:51,590 --> 02:52:51,600
organization
 

10111
02:52:51,600 --> 02:52:53,590
organization
yeah and even if they might personally

10112
02:52:53,590 --> 02:52:53,600
yeah and even if they might personally
 

10113
02:52:53,600 --> 02:52:54,790
yeah and even if they might personally
want to produce more intellectual

10114
02:52:54,790 --> 02:52:54,800
want to produce more intellectual
 

10115
02:52:54,800 --> 02:52:56,710
want to produce more intellectual
progress they are in a competitive game

10116
02:52:56,710 --> 02:52:56,720
progress they are in a competitive game
 

10117
02:52:56,720 --> 02:52:58,469
progress they are in a competitive game
where they don't have tenure

10118
02:52:58,469 --> 02:52:58,479
where they don't have tenure
 

10119
02:52:58,479 --> 02:52:59,269
where they don't have tenure
and

10120
02:52:59,269 --> 02:52:59,279
and
 

10121
02:52:59,279 --> 02:53:01,349
and
they need to produce this prestige and

10122
02:53:01,349 --> 02:53:01,359
they need to produce this prestige and
 

10123
02:53:01,359 --> 02:53:03,030
they need to produce this prestige and
so once they give grant money to

10124
02:53:03,030 --> 02:53:03,040
so once they give grant money to
 

10125
02:53:03,040 --> 02:53:04,630
so once they give grant money to
prestigious people that is the thing

10126
02:53:04,630 --> 02:53:04,640
prestigious people that is the thing
 

10127
02:53:04,640 --> 02:53:05,990
prestigious people that is the thing
that shows that they have achieved

10128
02:53:05,990 --> 02:53:06,000
that shows that they have achieved
 

10129
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,910
that shows that they have achieved
prestige for the organization and that's

10130
02:53:07,910 --> 02:53:07,920
prestige for the organization and that's
 

10131
02:53:07,920 --> 02:53:09,429
prestige for the organization and that's
what they need to do in order to retain

10132
02:53:09,429 --> 02:53:09,439
what they need to do in order to retain
 

10133
02:53:09,439 --> 02:53:10,950
what they need to do in order to retain
their position

10134
02:53:10,950 --> 02:53:10,960
their position
 

10135
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:12,630
their position
and you do hope that there's a

10136
02:53:12,630 --> 02:53:12,640
and you do hope that there's a
 

10137
02:53:12,640 --> 02:53:15,670
and you do hope that there's a
correlation between prestige and actual

10138
02:53:15,670 --> 02:53:15,680
correlation between prestige and actual
 

10139
02:53:15,680 --> 02:53:17,590
correlation between prestige and actual
competence of course there is a

10140
02:53:17,590 --> 02:53:17,600
competence of course there is a
 

10141
02:53:17,600 --> 02:53:19,349
competence of course there is a
correlation the question is just could

10142
02:53:19,349 --> 02:53:19,359
correlation the question is just could
 

10143
02:53:19,359 --> 02:53:21,510
correlation the question is just could
we do this better some other way yes i

10144
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:21,520
we do this better some other way yes i
 

10145
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,110
we do this better some other way yes i
think it's almost i think it's pretty

10146
02:53:23,110 --> 02:53:23,120
think it's almost i think it's pretty
 

10147
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:24,550
think it's almost i think it's pretty
clear we could

10148
02:53:24,550 --> 02:53:24,560
clear we could
 

10149
02:53:24,560 --> 02:53:27,030
clear we could
what is harder to do is move the world

10150
02:53:27,030 --> 02:53:27,040
what is harder to do is move the world
 

10151
02:53:27,040 --> 02:53:28,630
what is harder to do is move the world
to a new equilibrium where we do that

10152
02:53:28,630 --> 02:53:28,640
to a new equilibrium where we do that
 

10153
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:29,590
to a new equilibrium where we do that
instead

10154
02:53:29,590 --> 02:53:29,600
instead
 

10155
02:53:29,600 --> 02:53:32,309
instead
uh what are the components of of the

10156
02:53:32,309 --> 02:53:32,319
uh what are the components of of the
 

10157
02:53:32,319 --> 02:53:34,630
uh what are the components of of the
better ways to do it is it

10158
02:53:34,630 --> 02:53:34,640
better ways to do it is it
 

10159
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:35,830
better ways to do it is it
uh

10160
02:53:35,830 --> 02:53:35,840
uh
 

10161
02:53:35,840 --> 02:53:38,710
uh
money so how the sources of money and

10162
02:53:38,710 --> 02:53:38,720
money so how the sources of money and
 

10163
02:53:38,720 --> 02:53:41,269

freedom

10168

years ago i started studying this topic

10170
02:53:46,630 --> 02:53:46,640
years ago i started studying this topic
 

10171
02:53:46,640 --> 02:53:49,110
years ago i started studying this topic
exactly because this was my issue and

10172
02:53:49,110 --> 02:53:49,120
exactly because this was my issue and
 

10173
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:50,790
exactly because this was my issue and
this was many decades ago now and i

10174
02:53:50,790 --> 02:53:50,800
this was many decades ago now and i
 

10175
02:53:50,800 --> 02:53:52,950
this was many decades ago now and i
spent a long time and my best guess

10176
02:53:52,950 --> 02:53:52,960
spent a long time and my best guess
 

10177
02:53:52,960 --> 02:53:55,190
spent a long time and my best guess
still is prediction markets

10178
02:53:55,190 --> 02:53:55,200
still is prediction markets
 

10179
02:53:55,200 --> 02:53:57,110
still is prediction markets
betting markets so

10180
02:53:57,110 --> 02:53:57,120
betting markets so
 

10181
02:53:57,120 --> 02:53:59,429
betting markets so
if you as a research paper patron want

10182
02:53:59,429 --> 02:53:59,439
if you as a research paper patron want
 

10183
02:53:59,439 --> 02:54:01,110
if you as a research paper patron want
to know the answer to a particular

10184
02:54:01,110 --> 02:54:01,120
to know the answer to a particular
 

10185
02:54:01,120 --> 02:54:02,950
to know the answer to a particular
question like what's the mass of the

10186
02:54:02,950 --> 02:54:02,960
question like what's the mass of the
 

10187
02:54:02,960 --> 02:54:05,030
question like what's the mass of the
electron neutrino

10188
02:54:05,030 --> 02:54:05,040
electron neutrino
 

10189
02:54:05,040 --> 02:54:06,870
electron neutrino
then what you can do is just subsidize a

10190
02:54:06,870 --> 02:54:06,880
then what you can do is just subsidize a
 

10191
02:54:06,880 --> 02:54:09,510
then what you can do is just subsidize a
betting market in that question and that

10192
02:54:09,510 --> 02:54:09,520
betting market in that question and that
 

10193
02:54:09,520 --> 02:54:11,750
betting market in that question and that
will induce more research into answering

10194
02:54:11,750 --> 02:54:11,760
will induce more research into answering
 

10195
02:54:11,760 --> 02:54:13,030
will induce more research into answering
that question because the people who

10196
02:54:13,030 --> 02:54:13,040
that question because the people who
 

10197
02:54:13,040 --> 02:54:14,790
that question because the people who
then answer that question can then make

10198
02:54:14,790 --> 02:54:14,800
then answer that question can then make
 

10199
02:54:14,800 --> 02:54:16,070
then answer that question can then make
money in that betting market with the

10200
02:54:16,070 --> 02:54:16,080
money in that betting market with the
 

10201
02:54:16,080 --> 02:54:17,750
money in that betting market with the
new information they gain

10202
02:54:17,750 --> 02:54:17,760
new information they gain
 

10203
02:54:17,760 --> 02:54:20,790
new information they gain
so that's a robust way to induce more

10204
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:20,800
so that's a robust way to induce more
 

10205
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:22,389
so that's a robust way to induce more
information on a topic if you want to

10206
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
information on a topic if you want to
 

10207
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:24,150
information on a topic if you want to
induce an accomplishment you can create

10208
02:54:24,150 --> 02:54:24,160
induce an accomplishment you can create
 

10209
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:25,830
induce an accomplishment you can create
prizes and there's of course a long

10210
02:54:25,830 --> 02:54:25,840
prizes and there's of course a long
 

10211
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:28,150
prizes and there's of course a long
history of prizes to induce

10212
02:54:28,150 --> 02:54:28,160
history of prizes to induce
 

10213
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:29,510
history of prizes to induce
accomplishments

10214
02:54:29,510 --> 02:54:29,520
accomplishments
 

10215
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:32,150
accomplishments
and we moved away from prizes

10216
02:54:32,150 --> 02:54:32,160
and we moved away from prizes
 

10217
02:54:32,160 --> 02:54:34,230
and we moved away from prizes
even though we once had used them a far

10218
02:54:34,230 --> 02:54:34,240
even though we once had used them a far
 

10219
02:54:34,240 --> 02:54:36,790
even though we once had used them a far
more often than we did today

more often than we did today
 

10221
02:54:36,800 --> 02:54:38,790
more often than we did today
and there's a history to that

10222
02:54:38,790 --> 02:54:38,800
and there's a history to that
 

10223
02:54:38,800 --> 02:54:39,750

02:56:28,790 --> 02:56:28,800
novel idea that this and you would
 

10325
02:56:28,800 --> 02:56:29,750
novel idea that this and you would
actually

10326
02:56:29,750 --> 02:56:29,760
actually
 

10327
02:56:29,760 --> 02:56:31,030
actually
you would be able to rate that because

10328
02:56:31,030 --> 02:56:31,040
you would be able to rate that because
 

10329
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,030
you would be able to rate that because
you could see the path with which ideas

10330
02:56:33,030 --> 02:56:33,040
you could see the path with which ideas
 

10331
02:56:33,040 --> 02:56:34,630
you could see the path with which ideas
took which things had dead ends which

10332
02:56:34,630 --> 02:56:34,640
took which things had dead ends which
 

10333
02:56:34,640 --> 02:56:36,870
took which things had dead ends which
led to what other followings you could

10334
02:56:36,870 --> 02:56:36,880
led to what other followings you could
 

10335
02:56:36,880 --> 02:56:38,950
led to what other followings you could
looking back centuries later

10336
02:56:38,950 --> 02:56:38,960
looking back centuries later
 

10337
02:56:38,960 --> 02:56:40,710
looking back centuries later
have a much better estimate of who

10338
02:56:40,710 --> 02:56:40,720
have a much better estimate of who
 

10339
02:56:40,720 --> 02:56:43,030
have a much better estimate of who
actually had what long-term effects on

10340
02:56:43,030 --> 02:56:43,040
actually had what long-term effects on
 

10341
02:56:43,040 --> 02:56:45,670
actually had what long-term effects on
intellectual progress so my proposal is

10342
02:56:45,670 --> 02:56:45,680
intellectual progress so my proposal is
 

10343
02:56:45,680 --> 02:56:47,429
intellectual progress so my proposal is
we actually pay people in several

10344
02:56:47,429 --> 02:56:47,439
we actually pay people in several
 

10345
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:49,349
we actually pay people in several
centuries to do this historical analysis

10346
02:56:49,349 --> 02:56:49,359
centuries to do this historical analysis
 

10347
02:56:49,359 --> 02:56:50,790
centuries to do this historical analysis
and we have betting mark we have

10348
02:56:50,790 --> 02:56:50,800
and we have betting mark we have
 

10349
02:56:50,800 --> 02:56:52,710
and we have betting mark we have
prediction markets today where we buy

10350
02:56:52,710 --> 02:56:52,720
prediction markets today where we buy
 

10351
02:56:52,720 --> 02:56:54,950
prediction markets today where we buy
and sell assets which will later off pay

10352
02:56:54,950 --> 02:56:54,960
and sell assets which will later off pay
 

10353
02:56:54,960 --> 02:56:57,510
and sell assets which will later off pay
off in terms of those final evaluations

10354
02:56:57,510 --> 02:56:57,520
off in terms of those final evaluations
 

10355
02:56:57,520 --> 02:56:59,510
off in terms of those final evaluations
so now we'll be inducing people today to

10356
02:56:59,510 --> 02:56:59,520
so now we'll be inducing people today to
 

10357
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:00,950
so now we'll be inducing people today to
make their best estimate of those things

10358
02:57:00,950 --> 02:57:00,960
make their best estimate of those things
 

10359
02:57:00,960 --> 02:57:02,469
make their best estimate of those things
by actually

10360
02:57:02,469 --> 02:57:02,479
by actually
 

10361
02:57:02,479 --> 02:57:04,150
by actually
you know looking at the details of

10362
02:57:04,150 --> 02:57:04,160
you know looking at the details of
 

10363
02:57:04,160 --> 02:57:06,150
you know looking at the details of
people and setting the prices according

10364
02:57:06,150 --> 02:57:06,160
people and setting the prices according
 

10365
02:57:06,160 --> 02:57:08,309
people and setting the prices according
so my proposal would be we rate people

10366
02:57:08,309 --> 02:57:08,319
so my proposal would be we rate people
 

10367
02:57:08,319 --> 02:57:10,790
so my proposal would be we rate people
today on those prices today so instead

10368
02:57:10,790 --> 02:57:10,800
today on those prices today so instead
 

10369
02:57:10,800 --> 02:57:12,230
today on those prices today so instead
of looking at their list of publications

10370
02:57:12,230 --> 02:57:12,240
of looking at their list of publications
 

10371
02:57:12,240 --> 02:57:13,910
of looking at their list of publications
or affiliations you look at the actual

10372
02:57:13,910 --> 02:57:13,920
or affiliations you look at the actual
 

10373
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:16,790
or affiliations you look at the actual
price of assets that represent

10374
02:57:16,790 --> 02:57:16,800
price of assets that represent
 

10375
02:57:16,800 --> 02:57:18,550
price of assets that represent
people's best guess of what the future

10376
02:57:18,550 --> 02:57:18,560
people's best guess of what the future
 

10377
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:20,550
people's best guess of what the future
will say about them that's brilliant so

10378
02:57:20,550 --> 02:57:20,560
will say about them that's brilliant so
 

10379
02:57:20,560 --> 02:57:23,429
will say about them that's brilliant so
this concept of idea futures

10380
02:57:23,429 --> 02:57:23,439
this concept of idea futures
 

10381
02:57:23,439 --> 02:57:25,190
this concept of idea futures
can you elaborate

10382
02:57:25,190 --> 02:57:25,200
can you elaborate
 

10383
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:27,670
can you elaborate
what this would entail

10384
02:57:27,670 --> 02:57:27,680
what this would entail
 

10385
02:57:27,680 --> 02:57:29,670
what this would entail
i've been elaborating two versions of it

10386
02:57:29,670 --> 02:57:29,680
i've been elaborating two versions of it
 

10387
02:57:29,680 --> 02:57:32,550
i've been elaborating two versions of it
here so one is if there's a particular

10388
02:57:32,550 --> 02:57:32,560
here so one is if there's a particular
 

10389
02:57:32,560 --> 02:57:34,070
here so one is if there's a particular
question say the mass of the electron

10390
02:57:34,070 --> 02:57:34,080
question say the mass of the electron
 

10391
02:57:34,080 --> 02:57:35,429
question say the mass of the electron
neutrino

10392
02:57:35,429 --> 02:57:35,439
neutrino
 

10393
02:57:35,439 --> 02:57:37,349
neutrino
and what you as a patron want to do is

10394
02:57:37,349 --> 02:57:37,359
and what you as a patron want to do is
 

10395
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:39,670
and what you as a patron want to do is
get an answer to that question

10396
02:57:39,670 --> 02:57:39,680
get an answer to that question
 

10397
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:41,190
get an answer to that question
then what you would do is subsidize the

10398
02:57:41,190 --> 02:57:41,200
then what you would do is subsidize the
 

10399
02:57:41,200 --> 02:57:43,269
then what you would do is subsidize the
betting market in that question under

10400
02:57:43,269 --> 02:57:43,279
betting market in that question under
 

10401
02:57:43,279 --> 02:57:44,950
betting market in that question under
the assumption that eventually we'll

10402
02:57:44,950 --> 02:57:44,960
the assumption that eventually we'll
 

10403
02:57:44,960 --> 02:57:46,309
the assumption that eventually we'll
just know the answer and we can pay off

10404
02:57:46,309 --> 02:57:46,319
just know the answer and we can pay off
 

10405
02:57:46,319 --> 02:57:47,590
just know the answer and we can pay off
the bets that way

10406
02:57:47,590 --> 02:57:47,600
the bets that way
 

10407
02:57:47,600 --> 02:57:49,510
the bets that way
right and that is a plausible assumption

10408
02:57:49,510 --> 02:57:49,520
right and that is a plausible assumption
 

10409
02:57:49,520 --> 02:57:51,750
right and that is a plausible assumption
for many kinds of concrete intellectual

02:58:25,439 --> 02:58:27,349
in these financial markets
just like hedge funds today make money

just like hedge funds today make money
 

10445
02:58:27,359 --> 02:58:29,750
just like hedge funds today make money
by paying researchers to study firms and

by paying researchers to study firms and

by paying researchers to study firms and
then making their profits by trading on

those that that insight in the ordinary
financial and the market would

financial and the market would
 

10453
02:58:36,640 --> 02:58:38,469
financial and the market would
if it's efficient would be able to

if it's efficient would be able to
 

10455
02:58:38,479 --> 02:58:41,030
if it's efficient would be able to
become better and better predicting

02:58:41,030 --> 02:58:41,040
become better and better predicting
 

10457

the mass of the electron neutrino would
 

10463
02:58:46,720 --> 02:58:48,630
the mass of the electron neutrino would
decrease with time as we learned that

10464
02:58:48,630 --> 02:58:48,640
decrease with time as we learned that
 

10465
02:58:48,640 --> 02:58:50,309
decrease with time as we learned that
value of that parameter better and any

02:58:50,309 --> 02:58:50,319
value of that parameter better and any
 

10467
02:58:50,319 --> 02:58:52,070
value of that parameter better and any
other parameters that we want to

other parameters that we want to
 

10469

other parameters that we want to
decimate you don't think those markets

10470
02:58:53,590 --> 02:58:53,600
decimate you don't think those markets
 

10471
02:58:53,600 --> 02:58:56,550
decimate you don't think those markets
would also respond to recency of

02:58:56,550 --> 02:58:56,560
would also respond to recency of
 

10473
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:58,870

prestige and all those kinds of things
 

10475
02:58:58,880 --> 02:59:00,870
prestige and all those kinds of things
they would respond but the question is

10476
02:59:00,870 --> 02:59:00,880
they would respond but the question is
 

10477
02:59:00,880 --> 02:59:02,790
they would respond but the question is
if they might respond incorrectly but if

10478
02:59:02,790 --> 02:59:02,800
if they might respond incorrectly but if
 

10479
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:04,230
if they might respond incorrectly but if
you think they're doing it incorrectly

10480
02:59:04,230 --> 02:59:04,240
you think they're doing it incorrectly
 

10481
02:59:04,240 --> 02:59:06,710

yeah and that's what most of the system

10538
02:59:59,269 --> 02:59:59,279
yeah and that's what most of the system
 

10539
02:59:59,279 --> 03:00:01,269
yeah and that's what most of the system
is built on is trying to rate people and

10541
03:00:01,279 --> 03:00:03,349
is built on is trying to rate people and
rank them and so i designed this other

03:01:44,790 --> 03:01:44,800
just is beautiful i mean right from the
 

10639
03:01:44,800 --> 03:01:47,429
just is beautiful i mean right from the
beginning say special relativity was a

10640
03:01:47,429 --> 03:01:47,439
beginning say special relativity was a
 

10641
03:01:47,439 --> 03:01:48,950
beginning say special relativity was a
big surprise

10642
03:01:48,950 --> 03:01:48,960
big surprise
 

10643
03:01:48,960 --> 03:01:50,710
big surprise
uh you know most of us have a simple

10644
03:01:50,710 --> 03:01:50,720
uh you know most of us have a simple
 

10645
03:01:50,720 --> 03:01:52,710
uh you know most of us have a simple
concept of time and it seems perfectly

10646
03:01:52,710 --> 03:01:52,720
concept of time and it seems perfectly
 

10647
03:01:52,720 --> 03:01:54,870
concept of time and it seems perfectly
adequate for everything we've ever seen

10648
03:01:54,870 --> 03:01:54,880
adequate for everything we've ever seen
 

10649
03:01:54,880 --> 03:01:56,630
adequate for everything we've ever seen
and to have it explained to you that you

10650
03:01:56,630 --> 03:01:56,640
and to have it explained to you that you
 

10651
03:01:56,640 --> 03:01:58,630
and to have it explained to you that you
need to sort of have a mixture concept

10652
03:01:58,630 --> 03:01:58,640
need to sort of have a mixture concept
 

10653
03:01:58,640 --> 03:02:00,230
need to sort of have a mixture concept
of time and space where you put it into

10654
03:02:00,230 --> 03:02:00,240
of time and space where you put it into
 

10655
03:02:00,240 --> 03:02:02,870
of time and space where you put it into
the space-time construct how it looks

10656
03:02:02,870 --> 03:02:02,880
the space-time construct how it looks
 

10657
03:02:02,880 --> 03:02:05,030
the space-time construct how it looks
different from different perspectives

10658
03:02:05,030 --> 03:02:05,040
different from different perspectives
 

10659
03:02:05,040 --> 03:02:06,550
different from different perspectives
that was quite a shock

10660
03:02:06,550 --> 03:02:06,560
that was quite a shock
 

10661
03:02:06,560 --> 03:02:07,670
that was quite a shock
and that was

10662
03:02:07,670 --> 03:02:07,680
and that was
 

10663
03:02:07,680 --> 03:02:09,349
and that was
you know such a shock that it makes you

10664
03:02:09,349 --> 03:02:09,359
you know such a shock that it makes you
 

10665
03:02:09,359 --> 03:02:11,750
you know such a shock that it makes you
think what else do i know that you know

10666
03:02:11,750 --> 03:02:11,760
think what else do i know that you know
 

10667
03:02:11,760 --> 03:02:14,230
think what else do i know that you know
isn't the way it seems certainly quantum

10668
03:02:14,230 --> 03:02:14,240
isn't the way it seems certainly quantum
 

10669
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:15,990
isn't the way it seems certainly quantum
mechanics is certainly another enormous

10670
03:02:15,990 --> 03:02:16,000
mechanics is certainly another enormous
 

10671
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,070
mechanics is certainly another enormous
shock in terms of from your point you

10672
03:02:18,070 --> 03:02:18,080
shock in terms of from your point you
 

10673
03:02:18,080 --> 03:02:20,070
shock in terms of from your point you
know you have this idea that there's a

10674
03:02:20,070 --> 03:02:20,080
know you have this idea that there's a
 

10675
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:21,990
know you have this idea that there's a
space and then there's you know

10676
03:02:21,990 --> 03:02:22,000
space and then there's you know
 

10677
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:23,670
space and then there's you know
point particles at points and maybe

10678
03:02:23,670 --> 03:02:23,680
point particles at points and maybe
 

10679
03:02:23,680 --> 03:02:25,990
point particles at points and maybe
fields in between

10680
03:02:25,990 --> 03:02:26,000
fields in between
 

10681
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:28,550
fields in between
and um quantum mechanics is just a whole

10682
03:02:28,550 --> 03:02:28,560
and um quantum mechanics is just a whole
 

10683
03:02:28,560 --> 03:02:30,309
and um quantum mechanics is just a whole
different representation it looks

10684
03:02:30,309 --> 03:02:30,319
different representation it looks
 

10685
03:02:30,319 --> 03:02:31,910
different representation it looks
nothing like what you would have thought

10686
03:02:31,910 --> 03:02:31,920
nothing like what you would have thought
 

10687
03:02:31,920 --> 03:02:33,830
nothing like what you would have thought
as sort of the basic representation of

10688
03:02:33,830 --> 03:02:33,840
as sort of the basic representation of
 

10689
03:02:33,840 --> 03:02:35,830
as sort of the basic representation of
of the physical world and that was quite

10690
03:02:35,830 --> 03:02:35,840
of the physical world and that was quite
 

10691
03:02:35,840 --> 03:02:37,590
of the physical world and that was quite
a surprise what would you say is the

10692
03:02:37,590 --> 03:02:37,600
a surprise what would you say is the
 

10693
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:39,030
a surprise what would you say is the
catalyst

10694
03:02:39,030 --> 03:02:39,040
catalyst
 

10695
03:02:39,040 --> 03:02:41,110
catalyst
for the for the view quake in in in

10696
03:02:41,110 --> 03:02:41,120
for the for the view quake in in in
 

10697
03:02:41,120 --> 03:02:42,950
for the for the view quake in in in
theoretical physics in the 20th century

10698
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:42,960
theoretical physics in the 20th century
 

10699
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:44,630
theoretical physics in the 20th century
what where does that come from so the

10700
03:02:44,630 --> 03:02:44,640
what where does that come from so the
 

10701
03:02:44,640 --> 03:02:45,910
what where does that come from so the
interesting thing about einstein it

10702
03:02:45,910 --> 03:02:45,920
interesting thing about einstein it
 

10703
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:47,510
interesting thing about einstein it
seems like a lot of that came from like

10704
03:02:47,510 --> 03:02:47,520
seems like a lot of that came from like
 

10705
03:02:47,520 --> 03:02:49,670
seems like a lot of that came from like
almost thought experiments it wasn't

10706
03:02:49,670 --> 03:02:49,680
almost thought experiments it wasn't
 

10707
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:52,150
almost thought experiments it wasn't
almost experimentally driven

10708
03:02:52,150 --> 03:02:52,160
almost experimentally driven
 

10709
03:02:52,160 --> 03:02:55,269
almost experimentally driven
um and with actually i don't

10710
03:02:55,269 --> 03:02:55,279
um and with actually i don't
 

10711
03:02:55,279 --> 03:02:56,309
um and with actually i don't
know

10712
03:02:56,309 --> 03:02:56,319
know
 

10713
03:02:56,319 --> 03:02:58,309
know
the full story of quantum mechanics how

10714
03:02:58,309 --> 03:02:58,319
the full story of quantum mechanics how
 

10715
03:02:58,319 --> 03:03:01,030
the full story of quantum mechanics how
much of it is experiment like where

10716
03:03:01,030 --> 03:03:01,040
much of it is experiment like where
 

10717
03:03:01,040 --> 03:03:03,750
much of it is experiment like where
if you look at the full trace of idea

10718
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:03,760
if you look at the full trace of idea
 

10719
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:06,230
if you look at the full trace of idea
generation there uh of all the weird

10720
03:03:06,230 --> 03:03:06,240
generation there uh of all the weird
 

10721
03:03:06,240 --> 03:03:07,590
generation there uh of all the weird
stuff that falls out of quantum

10722
03:03:07,590 --> 03:03:07,600
stuff that falls out of quantum
 

10723
03:03:07,600 --> 03:03:09,750
stuff that falls out of quantum
mechanics how much of that was the

10724
03:03:09,750 --> 03:03:09,760
mechanics how much of that was the
 

10725
03:03:09,760 --> 03:03:11,349
mechanics how much of that was the
experimentalist how much was it the

10726
03:03:11,349 --> 03:03:11,359
experimentalist how much was it the
 

10727
03:03:11,359 --> 03:03:13,510
experimentalist how much was it the
theoreticians but usually in theoretical

10728
03:03:13,510 --> 03:03:13,520
theoreticians but usually in theoretical
 

10729
03:03:13,520 --> 03:03:15,750
theoreticians but usually in theoretical
physics the theories lead the way so

10730
03:03:15,750 --> 03:03:15,760
physics the theories lead the way so
 

10731
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:17,910
physics the theories lead the way so
maybe can you uh

10732
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:17,920
maybe can you uh
 

10733
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:20,630
maybe can you uh
can you elucidate like what what is the

10734
03:03:20,630 --> 03:03:20,640
can you elucidate like what what is the
 

10735
03:03:20,640 --> 03:03:22,309
can you elucidate like what what is the
catalyst for these

10736
03:03:22,309 --> 03:03:22,319
catalyst for these
 

10737
03:03:22,319 --> 03:03:24,630
catalyst for these
the remarkable thing about physics and

10738
03:03:24,630 --> 03:03:24,640
the remarkable thing about physics and
 

10739
03:03:24,640 --> 03:03:26,870
the remarkable thing about physics and
about many other areas of academic

10740
03:03:26,870 --> 03:03:26,880
about many other areas of academic
 

10741
03:03:26,880 --> 03:03:29,510
about many other areas of academic
intellectual life is that it just seems

10742
03:03:29,510 --> 03:03:29,520
intellectual life is that it just seems
 

10743
03:03:29,520 --> 03:03:32,389
intellectual life is that it just seems
way over determined that is

10744
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
way over determined that is
 

10745
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:34,309
way over determined that is
if it hadn't been for einstein or if it

10746
03:03:34,309 --> 03:03:34,319
if it hadn't been for einstein or if it
 

10747
03:03:34,319 --> 03:03:36,389
if it hadn't been for einstein or if it
hadn't been for heisenberg certainly

10748
03:03:36,389 --> 03:03:36,399
hadn't been for heisenberg certainly
 

10749
03:03:36,399 --> 03:03:38,469
hadn't been for heisenberg certainly
within a half a century somebody else

10750
03:03:38,469 --> 03:03:38,479
within a half a century somebody else
 

10751
03:03:38,479 --> 03:03:40,550
within a half a century somebody else
would have come up with essentially the

10752
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:40,560
would have come up with essentially the
 

10753
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:42,070
would have come up with essentially the
same things

10754
03:03:42,070 --> 03:03:42,080
same things
 

10755
03:03:42,080 --> 03:03:43,590
same things
is this something you believe yeah

10756
03:03:43,590 --> 03:03:43,600
is this something you believe yeah
 

10757
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:45,670
is this something you believe yeah
something yes so i think when you look

10758
03:03:45,670 --> 03:03:45,680
something yes so i think when you look
 

10759
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:47,429
something yes so i think when you look
at sort of just the history of physics

10760
03:03:47,429 --> 03:03:47,439
at sort of just the history of physics
 

10761
03:03:47,439 --> 03:03:49,349
at sort of just the history of physics
in the history of other areas you know

10762
03:03:49,349 --> 03:03:49,359
in the history of other areas you know
 

10763
03:03:49,359 --> 03:03:50,710
in the history of other areas you know
some areas like that there's just this

10764
03:03:50,710 --> 03:03:50,720
some areas like that there's just this
 

10765
03:03:50,720 --> 03:03:53,030
some areas like that there's just this
enormous convergence that the the

10766
03:03:53,030 --> 03:03:53,040
enormous convergence that the the
 

10767
03:03:53,040 --> 03:03:54,150
enormous convergence that the the
different kind of evidence that was

10768
03:03:54,150 --> 03:03:54,160
different kind of evidence that was
 

10769
03:03:54,160 --> 03:03:55,590
different kind of evidence that was
being collected

10770
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:55,600
being collected
 

10771
03:03:55,600 --> 03:03:58,230
being collected
was so redundant in the sense that so

10772
03:03:58,230 --> 03:03:58,240
was so redundant in the sense that so
 

10773
03:03:58,240 --> 03:04:00,469
was so redundant in the sense that so
many different things revealed the same

10774
03:04:00,469 --> 03:04:00,479
many different things revealed the same
 

10775
03:04:00,479 --> 03:04:02,630
many different things revealed the same
things that eventually you just kind of

10776
03:04:02,630 --> 03:04:02,640
things that eventually you just kind of
 

10777
03:04:02,640 --> 03:04:05,190
things that eventually you just kind of
have to accept it because it just gets

10778
03:04:05,190 --> 03:04:05,200
have to accept it because it just gets
 

10779
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:06,550
have to accept it because it just gets
obvious

10780
03:04:06,550 --> 03:04:06,560
obvious
 

10781
03:04:06,560 --> 03:04:08,950
obvious
so if you look at the details of course

10782
03:04:08,950 --> 03:04:08,960
so if you look at the details of course
 

10783
03:04:08,960 --> 03:04:09,910
so if you look at the details of course
you know

10784
03:04:09,910 --> 03:04:09,920
you know
 

10785
03:04:09,920 --> 03:04:11,830
you know
einstein did it for somebody else and

10786
03:04:11,830 --> 03:04:11,840
einstein did it for somebody else and
 

10787
03:04:11,840 --> 03:04:13,670
einstein did it for somebody else and
it's well worth celebrating einstein for

10788
03:04:13,670 --> 03:04:13,680
it's well worth celebrating einstein for
 

10789
03:04:13,680 --> 03:04:16,630
it's well worth celebrating einstein for
that and you know we by celebrating the

10790
03:04:16,630 --> 03:04:16,640
that and you know we by celebrating the
 

10791
03:04:16,640 --> 03:04:18,230
that and you know we by celebrating the
particular people who did something

10792
03:04:18,230 --> 03:04:18,240
particular people who did something
 

10793
03:04:18,240 --> 03:04:19,910
particular people who did something
first or came across something first we

10794
03:04:19,910 --> 03:04:19,920
first or came across something first we
 

10795
03:04:19,920 --> 03:04:22,309
first or came across something first we
are encouraging all the rest to move a

10796
03:04:22,309 --> 03:04:22,319
are encouraging all the rest to move a
 

10797
03:04:22,319 --> 03:04:23,910
are encouraging all the rest to move a
little faster

10798
03:04:23,910 --> 03:04:23,920
little faster
 

10799
03:04:23,920 --> 03:04:25,830
little faster
to try to

10800
03:04:25,830 --> 03:04:25,840
to try to
 

10801
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:27,670
to try to
to push us all a little faster which is

10802
03:04:27,670 --> 03:04:27,680
to push us all a little faster which is
 

10803
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:28,790
to push us all a little faster which is
great

10804
03:04:28,790 --> 03:04:28,800
great
 

10805
03:04:28,800 --> 03:04:29,590
great
but

10806
03:04:29,590 --> 03:04:29,600
but
 

10807
03:04:29,600 --> 03:04:31,830
but
i still think we would have gotten

10808
03:04:31,830 --> 03:04:31,840
i still think we would have gotten
 

10809
03:04:31,840 --> 03:04:33,910
i still think we would have gotten
roughly to the same place within half

10810
03:04:33,910 --> 03:04:33,920
roughly to the same place within half
 

10811
03:04:33,920 --> 03:04:35,269
roughly to the same place within half
centuries so

10812
03:04:35,269 --> 03:04:35,279
centuries so
 

10813
03:04:35,279 --> 03:04:37,910
centuries so
sometimes people are special because of

10814
03:04:37,910 --> 03:04:37,920
sometimes people are special because of
 

10815
03:04:37,920 --> 03:04:39,510
sometimes people are special because of
how much longer it would have taken so

10816
03:04:39,510 --> 03:04:39,520
how much longer it would have taken so
 

10817
03:04:39,520 --> 03:04:41,030
how much longer it would have taken so
some people say general relativity would

10818
03:04:41,030 --> 03:04:41,040
some people say general relativity would
 

10819
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:43,110
some people say general relativity would
have taken longer without einstein than

10820
03:04:43,110 --> 03:04:43,120
have taken longer without einstein than
 

10821
03:04:43,120 --> 03:04:44,710
have taken longer without einstein than
other things i mean

10822
03:04:44,710 --> 03:04:44,720
other things i mean
 

10823
03:04:44,720 --> 03:04:45,990
other things i mean
heisenberg quantum mechanics i mean

10824
03:04:45,990 --> 03:04:46,000
heisenberg quantum mechanics i mean
 

10825
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:46,630
heisenberg quantum mechanics i mean
there were several different

10826
03:04:46,630 --> 03:04:46,640
there were several different
 

10827
03:04:46,640 --> 03:04:48,230
there were several different
formulations of quantum mechanics all

10828
03:04:48,230 --> 03:04:48,240
formulations of quantum mechanics all
 

10829
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:51,349
formulations of quantum mechanics all
around the same few years means no one

10830
03:04:51,349 --> 03:04:51,359
around the same few years means no one
 

10831
03:04:51,359 --> 03:04:52,710
around the same few years means no one
of them made that much of a difference

10832
03:04:52,710 --> 03:04:52,720
of them made that much of a difference
 

10833
03:04:52,720 --> 03:04:54,150
of them made that much of a difference
we would have had pretty much the same

10834
03:04:54,150 --> 03:04:54,160
we would have had pretty much the same
 

10835
03:04:54,160 --> 03:04:56,309
we would have had pretty much the same
thing regardless of which of them did it

10836
03:04:56,309 --> 03:04:56,319
thing regardless of which of them did it
 

10837
03:04:56,319 --> 03:04:58,230
thing regardless of which of them did it
exactly when

10838
03:04:58,230 --> 03:04:58,240
exactly when
 

10839
03:04:58,240 --> 03:04:59,830
exactly when
nevertheless i'm happy to celebrate them

10840
03:04:59,830 --> 03:04:59,840
nevertheless i'm happy to celebrate them
 

10841
03:04:59,840 --> 03:05:01,910
nevertheless i'm happy to celebrate them
all but this is a choice i make in my

10842
03:05:01,910 --> 03:05:01,920
all but this is a choice i make in my
 

10843
03:05:01,920 --> 03:05:03,110
all but this is a choice i make in my
research that is when there's an area

10844
03:05:03,110 --> 03:05:03,120
research that is when there's an area
 

10845
03:05:03,120 --> 03:05:04,389
research that is when there's an area
where there's lots of people working

10846
03:05:04,389 --> 03:05:04,399
where there's lots of people working
 

10847
03:05:04,399 --> 03:05:07,030
where there's lots of people working
together you know who are sort of

10848
03:05:07,030 --> 03:05:07,040
together you know who are sort of
 

10849
03:05:07,040 --> 03:05:09,110
together you know who are sort of
scoping each other and getting getting a

10850
03:05:09,110 --> 03:05:09,120
scoping each other and getting getting a
 

10851
03:05:09,120 --> 03:05:10,550
scoping each other and getting getting a
result just before somebody else does

10852
03:05:10,550 --> 03:05:10,560
result just before somebody else does
 

10853
03:05:10,560 --> 03:05:12,070
result just before somebody else does
you ask well how much of a difference

10854
03:05:12,070 --> 03:05:12,080
you ask well how much of a difference
 

10855
03:05:12,080 --> 03:05:13,830
you ask well how much of a difference
would i make there

10856
03:05:13,830 --> 03:05:13,840
would i make there
 

10857
03:05:13,840 --> 03:05:15,590
would i make there
at most i could make something happen a

10858
03:05:15,590 --> 03:05:15,600
at most i could make something happen a
 

10859
03:05:15,600 --> 03:05:18,230
at most i could make something happen a
few months before somebody else and so

10860
03:05:18,230 --> 03:05:18,240
few months before somebody else and so
 

10861
03:05:18,240 --> 03:05:20,150
few months before somebody else and so
i'm less worried about them missing

10862
03:05:20,150 --> 03:05:20,160
i'm less worried about them missing
 

10863
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:21,830
i'm less worried about them missing
things so when i'm trying to help the

10864
03:05:21,830 --> 03:05:21,840
things so when i'm trying to help the
 

10865
03:05:21,840 --> 03:05:23,190
things so when i'm trying to help the
world like doing research i'm looking

10866
03:05:23,190 --> 03:05:23,200
world like doing research i'm looking
 

10867
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:24,469
world like doing research i'm looking
for neglected things i'm looking for

10868
03:05:24,469 --> 03:05:24,479
for neglected things i'm looking for
 

10869
03:05:24,479 --> 03:05:26,309
for neglected things i'm looking for
things that nobody's doing it if i

10870
03:05:26,309 --> 03:05:26,319
things that nobody's doing it if i
 

10871
03:05:26,319 --> 03:05:27,990
things that nobody's doing it if i
didn't do it nobody would do it

10872
03:05:27,990 --> 03:05:28,000
didn't do it nobody would do it
 

10873
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:29,510
didn't do it nobody would do it
nobody would do it or at least in the

10874
03:05:29,510 --> 03:05:29,520
nobody would do it or at least in the
 

10875
03:05:29,520 --> 03:05:31,349
nobody would do it or at least in the
next time 20 years kind of thing exactly

10876
03:05:31,349 --> 03:05:31,359
next time 20 years kind of thing exactly
 

10877
03:05:31,359 --> 03:05:33,030
next time 20 years kind of thing exactly
same with general relativity just you

10878
03:05:33,030 --> 03:05:33,040
same with general relativity just you
 

10879
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:34,950
same with general relativity just you
know who would do it

10880
03:05:34,950 --> 03:05:34,960
know who would do it
 

10881
03:05:34,960 --> 03:05:37,349
know who would do it
it might take another 10 20 30 50 years

10882
03:05:37,349 --> 03:05:37,359
it might take another 10 20 30 50 years
 

10883
03:05:37,359 --> 03:05:38,710
it might take another 10 20 30 50 years
so that's the place where you can have

10884
03:05:38,710 --> 03:05:38,720
so that's the place where you can have
 

10885
03:05:38,720 --> 03:05:40,710
so that's the place where you can have
the biggest impact is finding the things

10886
03:05:40,710 --> 03:05:40,720
the biggest impact is finding the things
 

10887
03:05:40,720 --> 03:05:43,349
the biggest impact is finding the things
that nobody would do unless you did them

10888
03:05:43,349 --> 03:05:43,359
that nobody would do unless you did them
 

10889
03:05:43,359 --> 03:05:45,030
that nobody would do unless you did them
and then that's when you get the big

10890
03:05:45,030 --> 03:05:45,040
and then that's when you get the big
 

10891
03:05:45,040 --> 03:05:47,590
and then that's when you get the big
view quake the insight so what about

10892
03:05:47,590 --> 03:05:47,600
view quake the insight so what about
 

10893
03:05:47,600 --> 03:05:51,429
view quake the insight so what about
artificial intelligence would it be uh

10894
03:05:51,429 --> 03:05:51,439
artificial intelligence would it be uh
 

10895
03:05:51,439 --> 03:05:54,469
artificial intelligence would it be uh
the ems the emulated minds

10896
03:05:54,469 --> 03:05:54,479
the ems the emulated minds
 

10897
03:05:54,479 --> 03:05:55,830
the ems the emulated minds
what idea

10898
03:05:55,830 --> 03:05:55,840
what idea
 

10899
03:05:55,840 --> 03:05:57,590
what idea
what whether

10900
03:05:57,590 --> 03:05:57,600
what whether
 

10901
03:05:57,600 --> 03:05:59,110
what whether
that struck you

10902
03:05:59,110 --> 03:05:59,120
that struck you
 

10903
03:05:59,120 --> 03:06:01,110
that struck you
in the shower one day

10904
03:06:01,110 --> 03:06:01,120
in the shower one day
 

10905
03:06:01,120 --> 03:06:01,990
in the shower one day
or

10906
03:06:01,990 --> 03:06:02,000
or
 

10907
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:03,830
or
well or are they you just clearly the

10908
03:06:03,830 --> 03:06:03,840
well or are they you just clearly the
 

10909
03:06:03,840 --> 03:06:05,670
well or are they you just clearly the
biggest view quake in artificial

10910
03:06:05,670 --> 03:06:05,680
biggest view quake in artificial
 

10911
03:06:05,680 --> 03:06:08,550
biggest view quake in artificial
intelligence is the realization of just

10912
03:06:08,550 --> 03:06:08,560
intelligence is the realization of just
 

10913
03:06:08,560 --> 03:06:11,910
intelligence is the realization of just
how complicated our human minds are so

10914
03:06:11,910 --> 03:06:11,920
how complicated our human minds are so
 

10915
03:06:11,920 --> 03:06:13,830
how complicated our human minds are so
most people who come to artificial

10916
03:06:13,830 --> 03:06:13,840
most people who come to artificial
 

10917
03:06:13,840 --> 03:06:15,990
most people who come to artificial
intelligence from other fields or from

10918
03:06:15,990 --> 03:06:16,000
intelligence from other fields or from
 

10919
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:17,590
intelligence from other fields or from
relative ignorance

10920
03:06:17,590 --> 03:06:17,600
relative ignorance
 

10921
03:06:17,600 --> 03:06:19,269
relative ignorance
a very common phenomenon which you must

10922
03:06:19,269 --> 03:06:19,279
a very common phenomenon which you must
 

10923
03:06:19,279 --> 03:06:21,110
a very common phenomenon which you must
be familiar with is that they come up

10924
03:06:21,110 --> 03:06:21,120
be familiar with is that they come up
 

10925
03:06:21,120 --> 03:06:22,950
be familiar with is that they come up
with some concept and then they think

10926
03:06:22,950 --> 03:06:22,960
with some concept and then they think
 

10927
03:06:22,960 --> 03:06:24,469
with some concept and then they think
that must be it

10928
03:06:24,469 --> 03:06:24,479
that must be it
 

10929
03:06:24,479 --> 03:06:26,550
that must be it
once we implement this new concept we

10930
03:06:26,550 --> 03:06:26,560
once we implement this new concept we
 

10931
03:06:26,560 --> 03:06:28,469
once we implement this new concept we
will have it we will have full human

10932
03:06:28,469 --> 03:06:28,479
will have it we will have full human
 

10933
03:06:28,479 --> 03:06:30,150
will have it we will have full human
level or higher artificial intelligence

10934
03:06:30,150 --> 03:06:30,160
level or higher artificial intelligence
 

10935
03:06:30,160 --> 03:06:31,750
level or higher artificial intelligence
right and they are just

10936
03:06:31,750 --> 03:06:31,760
right and they are just
 

10937
03:06:31,760 --> 03:06:33,590
right and they are just
not appreciating just how big the

10938
03:06:33,590 --> 03:06:33,600
not appreciating just how big the
 

10939
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:35,349
not appreciating just how big the
problem is how long the road is just how

10940
03:06:35,349 --> 03:06:35,359
problem is how long the road is just how
 

10941
03:06:35,359 --> 03:06:37,750
problem is how long the road is just how
much is involved because that's actually

10942
03:06:37,750 --> 03:06:37,760
much is involved because that's actually
 

10943
03:06:37,760 --> 03:06:39,910
much is involved because that's actually
hard to appreciate when we just think it

10944
03:06:39,910 --> 03:06:39,920
hard to appreciate when we just think it
 

10945
03:06:39,920 --> 03:06:41,510
hard to appreciate when we just think it
seems really simple

10946
03:06:41,510 --> 03:06:41,520
seems really simple
 

10947
03:06:41,520 --> 03:06:43,670
seems really simple

is i think uh that's a good point but i

10972
03:07:07,269 --> 03:07:07,279
is i think uh that's a good point but i
 

10973
03:07:07,279 --> 03:07:10,389
is i think uh that's a good point but i
think it's a it's a very early view

03:07:10,389 --> 03:07:10,399
think it's a it's a very early view

quake it's when the uh

10976
03:07:12,950 --> 03:07:12,960
quake it's when the uh
 

10977
03:07:12,960 --> 03:07:16,870
quake it's when the uh
uh sure done in kruger crashes

10978
03:07:16,870 --> 03:07:16,880
uh sure done in kruger crashes
 

10979
03:07:16,880 --> 03:07:18,870
uh sure done in kruger crashes
hard it's the first realization that

10980
03:07:18,870 --> 03:07:18,880
hard it's the first realization that
 

10981
03:07:18,880 --> 03:07:21,110
hard it's the first realization that
humans are actually quite incredible the

10982
03:07:21,110 --> 03:07:21,120
humans are actually quite incredible the
 

10983
03:07:21,120 --> 03:07:23,510
humans are actually quite incredible the
human mind the human body is quite a lot

10984
03:07:23,510 --> 03:07:23,520
human mind the human body is quite a lot
 

10985
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,190
human mind the human body is quite a lot
of different parts to it

10986
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:25,200
of different parts to it
 

10987
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,389
of different parts to it
but then

10988
03:07:26,389 --> 03:07:26,399
but then
 

10989
03:07:26,399 --> 03:07:29,349
but then
see i it's already been so long for me

10990
03:07:29,349 --> 03:07:29,359
see i it's already been so long for me
 

10991
03:07:29,359 --> 03:07:30,950
see i it's already been so long for me
that i've experienced that view quake

10992
03:07:30,950 --> 03:07:30,960
that i've experienced that view quake
 

10993
03:07:30,960 --> 03:07:32,150
that i've experienced that view quake
that for me

10994
03:07:32,150 --> 03:07:32,160
that for me
 

10995
03:07:32,160 --> 03:07:34,870
that for me
i now experience the view quakes of holy

10996
03:07:34,870 --> 03:07:34,880
i now experience the view quakes of holy
 

10997
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:36,469
i now experience the view quakes of holy
 this little thing is actually quite

10998
03:07:36,469 --> 03:07:36,479
this little thing is actually quite
 

10999
03:07:36,479 --> 03:07:39,750
this little thing is actually quite
powerful like neural networks i'm amazed

11000
03:07:39,750 --> 03:07:39,760
powerful like neural networks i'm amazed
 

11001
03:07:39,760 --> 03:07:40,469
powerful like neural networks i'm amazed
because

11002
03:07:40,469 --> 03:07:40,479
because
 

11003
03:07:40,479 --> 03:07:42,630
because
you've become

11004
03:07:42,630 --> 03:07:42,640
you've become
 

11005
03:07:42,640 --> 03:07:45,429
you've become
more cynical after that first view quake

11006
03:07:45,429 --> 03:07:45,439
more cynical after that first view quake
 

11007
03:07:45,439 --> 03:07:48,710
more cynical after that first view quake
of like this is so hard like evolution

11008
03:07:48,710 --> 03:07:48,720
of like this is so hard like evolution
 

11009
03:07:48,720 --> 03:07:51,190
of like this is so hard like evolution
did some incredible work to create a

11010
03:07:51,190 --> 03:07:51,200
did some incredible work to create a
 

11011
03:07:51,200 --> 03:07:54,070
did some incredible work to create a
human mind but then you realize just

11012
03:07:54,070 --> 03:07:54,080
human mind but then you realize just
 

11013
03:07:54,080 --> 03:07:55,510
human mind but then you realize just
because you have you've talked about a

11014
03:07:55,510 --> 03:07:55,520
because you have you've talked about a
 

11015
03:07:55,520 --> 03:07:57,190
because you have you've talked about a
bunch of simple models

11016
03:07:57,190 --> 03:07:57,200
bunch of simple models
 

11017
03:07:57,200 --> 03:07:59,429
bunch of simple models
that simple things can actually be

11018
03:07:59,429 --> 03:07:59,439
that simple things can actually be
 

11019
03:07:59,439 --> 03:08:02,230
that simple things can actually be
extremely powerful that maybe uh

11020
03:08:02,230 --> 03:08:02,240
extremely powerful that maybe uh
 

11021
03:08:02,240 --> 03:08:05,030
extremely powerful that maybe uh
emulating of the human mind is extremely

11022
03:08:05,030 --> 03:08:05,040
emulating of the human mind is extremely
 

11023
03:08:05,040 --> 03:08:07,349
emulating of the human mind is extremely
difficult but you can go a long way with

03:08:07,349 --> 03:08:07,359
difficult but you can go a long way with
 

11025
03:08:07,359 --> 03:08:09,670
difficult but you can go a long way with
a large neural network you can go a long

a large neural network you can go a long
 

11027
03:08:09,680 --> 03:08:11,190
a large neural network you can go a long
way with a dumb solution it's that

right holy crap you can do you can go a
 

11035
03:08:16,479 --> 03:08:18,070
right holy crap you can do you can go a
long way with us but we still have a

11036
03:08:18,070 --> 03:08:18,080
long way with us but we still have a
 

11037
03:08:18,080 --> 03:08:20,469
long way with us but we still have a
very long road to go but nonetheless

11038
03:08:20,469 --> 03:08:20,479
very long road to go but nonetheless
 

11039
03:08:20,479 --> 03:08:24,309
very long road to go but nonetheless
i can't i refuse to sort of know the the

11040
03:08:24,309 --> 03:08:24,319
i can't i refuse to sort of know the the
 

11041
03:08:24,319 --> 03:08:25,429
i can't i refuse to sort of know the the

11042
03:08:25,429 --> 03:08:25,439
road
 

11043
03:08:25,439 --> 03:08:28,309
road
on the road is full of surprises so long

11044
03:08:28,309 --> 03:08:28,319
on the road is full of surprises so long
 

11045
03:08:28,319 --> 03:08:30,389
on the road is full of surprises so long
sure is an interesting like you said

11046
03:08:30,389 --> 03:08:30,399
sure is an interesting like you said
 

11047
03:08:30,399 --> 03:08:31,910
sure is an interesting like you said
with the six

11048
03:08:31,910 --> 03:08:31,920
with the six
 

11049
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:34,070
with the six
hard steps that humans had to take to

11050
03:08:34,070 --> 03:08:34,080
hard steps that humans had to take to
 

11051
03:08:34,080 --> 03:08:35,830
hard steps that humans had to take to
arrive at where we are from the origin

11052
03:08:35,830 --> 03:08:35,840
arrive at where we are from the origin
 

11053
03:08:35,840 --> 03:08:37,510
arrive at where we are from the origin
of life on earth

11054
03:08:37,510 --> 03:08:37,520
of life on earth
 

11055
03:08:37,520 --> 03:08:39,750
of life on earth
so it's long maybe in the

11056
03:08:39,750 --> 03:08:39,760
so it's long maybe in the
 

11057
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:42,710
so it's long maybe in the
statistical improbability of the steps

11058
03:08:42,710 --> 03:08:42,720
statistical improbability of the steps
 

11059
03:08:42,720 --> 03:08:44,550
statistical improbability of the steps
that have to be taken

11060
03:08:44,550 --> 03:08:44,560
that have to be taken
 

11061
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:46,389
that have to be taken
but in terms of how quickly those steps

11062
03:08:46,389 --> 03:08:46,399
but in terms of how quickly those steps
 

11063
03:08:46,399 --> 03:08:49,670
but in terms of how quickly those steps
could be taken i don't know if my

03:09:10,309 --> 03:09:10,319
that's the new uh well we don't get any

less very often so that's that's a long
 

11089
03:09:11,920 --> 03:09:13,910

well that's an excellent question how
 

11101
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:25,670
well that's an excellent question how
does that and then how does that fit

11102
03:09:25,670 --> 03:09:25,680
does that and then how does that fit
 

11103
03:09:25,680 --> 03:09:28,070
does that and then how does that fit

alien civilization that's the question

11108
03:09:34,150 --> 03:09:34,160
alien civilization that's the question
 

11109
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:35,990
alien civilization that's the question
of how much any individual makes in the

11110
03:09:35,990 --> 03:09:36,000
of how much any individual makes in the
 

11111
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,630
of how much any individual makes in the
long path of civilization over time

11112
03:09:38,630 --> 03:09:38,640
long path of civilization over time
 

11113
03:09:38,640 --> 03:09:40,550
long path of civilization over time
yes and you know it's a favorite topic

11114
03:09:40,550 --> 03:09:40,560
yes and you know it's a favorite topic
 

11115
03:09:40,560 --> 03:09:42,710
yes and you know it's a favorite topic
of historians and people to try to like

11116
03:09:42,710 --> 03:09:42,720
of historians and people to try to like
 

11117
03:09:42,720 --> 03:09:44,550
of historians and people to try to like
focus on individuals and how much of a

11118
03:09:44,550 --> 03:09:44,560
focus on individuals and how much of a
 

11119
03:09:44,560 --> 03:09:46,070
focus on individuals and how much of a
difference they make and certainly some

11120
03:09:46,070 --> 03:09:46,080
difference they make and certainly some
 

11121
03:09:46,080 --> 03:09:47,590
difference they make and certainly some
individuals make a substantial

11122
03:09:47,590 --> 03:09:47,600
individuals make a substantial
 

11123
03:09:47,600 --> 03:09:49,750
individuals make a substantial
difference in the modest term

11124
03:09:49,750 --> 03:09:49,760
difference in the modest term
 

11125
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:50,710
difference in the modest term
right

11126
03:09:50,710 --> 03:09:50,720
right
 

11127
03:09:50,720 --> 03:09:52,550
right
uh like you know certainly without

11128
03:09:52,550 --> 03:09:52,560
uh like you know certainly without
 

11129
03:09:52,560 --> 03:09:55,269
uh like you know certainly without
hitler being hitler in the role he took

11130
03:09:55,269 --> 03:09:55,279
hitler being hitler in the role he took
 

11131
03:09:55,279 --> 03:09:56,710
hitler being hitler in the role he took
european history would have taken a

11132
03:09:56,710 --> 03:09:56,720
european history would have taken a
 

11133
03:09:56,720 --> 03:09:59,110
european history would have taken a
different path for for a while there um

11134
03:09:59,110 --> 03:09:59,120
different path for for a while there um
 

11135
03:09:59,120 --> 03:10:00,630
different path for for a while there um
but if we're looking over like many

11136
03:10:00,630 --> 03:10:00,640
but if we're looking over like many
 

11137
03:10:00,640 --> 03:10:02,870
but if we're looking over like many
centuries longer term things most

11138
03:10:02,870 --> 03:10:02,880
centuries longer term things most
 

11139
03:10:02,880 --> 03:10:05,110
centuries longer term things most
individuals do fade in their individual

11140
03:10:05,110 --> 03:10:05,120
individuals do fade in their individual
 

11141
03:10:05,120 --> 03:10:06,790
individuals do fade in their individual
influence

11142
03:10:06,790 --> 03:10:06,800
influence
 

11143
03:10:06,800 --> 03:10:07,750
influence
so

11144
03:10:07,750 --> 03:10:07,760
so
 

11145
03:10:07,760 --> 03:10:10,710
so
i mean einstein you and einstein

11146
03:10:10,710 --> 03:10:10,720
i mean einstein you and einstein
 

11147
03:10:10,720 --> 03:10:11,830
i mean einstein you and einstein
[Applause]

11148
03:10:11,830 --> 03:10:11,840
[Applause]
 

11149
03:10:11,840 --> 03:10:14,389
[Applause]
no matter how sexy your hair is you will

11150
03:10:14,389 --> 03:10:14,399
no matter how sexy your hair is you will
 

11151
03:10:14,399 --> 03:10:16,389
no matter how sexy your hair is you will
also be forgotten in the long arc of

11152
03:10:16,389 --> 03:10:16,399
also be forgotten in the long arc of
 

11153
03:10:16,399 --> 03:10:19,670
also be forgotten in the long arc of
history uh so you said at least 10 years

11154
03:10:19,670 --> 03:10:19,680
history uh so you said at least 10 years
 

11155
03:10:19,680 --> 03:10:22,309
history uh so you said at least 10 years
so let's talk a little bit about

11156
03:10:22,309 --> 03:10:22,319
so let's talk a little bit about
 

11157
03:10:22,319 --> 03:10:24,830
so let's talk a little bit about
this ai point

11158
03:10:24,830 --> 03:10:24,840
this ai point
 

11159
03:10:24,840 --> 03:10:28,870
this ai point
um of where how we achieve how hard is

11160
03:10:28,870 --> 03:10:28,880
um of where how we achieve how hard is
 

11161
03:10:28,880 --> 03:10:31,750
um of where how we achieve how hard is
the problem of solving intelligence

11162
03:10:31,750 --> 03:10:31,760
the problem of solving intelligence
 

11163
03:10:31,760 --> 03:10:34,309
the problem of solving intelligence
uh by engineering artificial

11164
03:10:34,309 --> 03:10:34,319
uh by engineering artificial
 

11165
03:10:34,319 --> 03:10:38,070
uh by engineering artificial
intelligence that achieves human level

11166
03:10:38,070 --> 03:10:38,080
intelligence that achieves human level
 

11167
03:10:38,080 --> 03:10:40,389
intelligence that achieves human level
human-like qualities that we associate

11168
03:10:40,389 --> 03:10:40,399
human-like qualities that we associate
 

11169
03:10:40,399 --> 03:10:42,150
human-like qualities that we associate
with intelligence how hard is this what

11170
03:10:42,150 --> 03:10:42,160
with intelligence how hard is this what
 

11171
03:10:42,160 --> 03:10:43,670
with intelligence how hard is this what
are the different trajectories that take

11172
03:10:43,670 --> 03:10:43,680
are the different trajectories that take
 

11173
03:10:43,680 --> 03:10:45,190
are the different trajectories that take
us there

11174
03:10:45,190 --> 03:10:45,200
us there
 

11175
03:10:45,200 --> 03:10:47,670
us there
one way to think about it is in terms of

11176
03:10:47,670 --> 03:10:47,680
one way to think about it is in terms of
 

11177
03:10:47,680 --> 03:10:50,070
one way to think about it is in terms of
the scope of the technology space you're

11178
03:10:50,070 --> 03:10:50,080
the scope of the technology space you're
 

11179
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:51,750
the scope of the technology space you're
talking about so

11180
03:10:51,750 --> 03:10:51,760
talking about so
 

11181
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:53,429
talking about so
let's take the biggest possible scope

11182
03:10:53,429 --> 03:10:53,439
let's take the biggest possible scope
 

11183
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:56,630
let's take the biggest possible scope
all of human technology right the entire

11184
03:10:56,630 --> 03:10:56,640
all of human technology right the entire
 

11185
03:10:56,640 --> 03:10:59,590
all of human technology right the entire
human economy so the entire

11186
03:10:59,590 --> 03:10:59,600
human economy so the entire
 

11187
03:10:59,600 --> 03:11:02,150
human economy so the entire
economy is composed of many industries

11188
03:11:02,150 --> 03:11:02,160
economy is composed of many industries
 

11189
03:11:02,160 --> 03:11:03,750
economy is composed of many industries
each of which have many products with

11190
03:11:03,750 --> 03:11:03,760
each of which have many products with
 

11191
03:11:03,760 --> 03:11:05,269
each of which have many products with
many different technologies supporting

11192
03:11:05,269 --> 03:11:05,279
many different technologies supporting
 

11193
03:11:05,279 --> 03:11:07,670
many different technologies supporting
each one

11194
03:11:07,670 --> 03:11:07,680
each one
 

11195
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:10,950
each one
at that scale i think we can accept that

11196
03:11:10,950 --> 03:11:10,960
at that scale i think we can accept that
 

11197
03:11:10,960 --> 03:11:11,750
at that scale i think we can accept that
um

11198
03:11:11,750 --> 03:11:11,760
um
 

11199
03:11:11,760 --> 03:11:13,910
um
most innovations are a small fraction of

11200
03:11:13,910 --> 03:11:13,920
most innovations are a small fraction of
 

11201
03:11:13,920 --> 03:11:16,469
most innovations are a small fraction of
the total that is usually has relatively

11202
03:11:16,469 --> 03:11:16,479
the total that is usually has relatively
 

11203
03:11:16,479 --> 03:11:19,429
the total that is usually has relatively
gradual overall progress

11204
03:11:19,429 --> 03:11:19,439
gradual overall progress
 

11205
03:11:19,439 --> 03:11:21,750
gradual overall progress
and that individual innovations

11206
03:11:21,750 --> 03:11:21,760
and that individual innovations
 

11207
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:23,510
and that individual innovations
that are have a substantial effect the

11208
03:11:23,510 --> 03:11:23,520
that are have a substantial effect the
 

11209
03:11:23,520 --> 03:11:25,990
that are have a substantial effect the
total are rare and their total effect is

11210
03:11:25,990 --> 03:11:26,000
total are rare and their total effect is
 

11211
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,590
total are rare and their total effect is
still a small percentage of the of the

11212
03:11:27,590 --> 03:11:27,600
still a small percentage of the of the
 

11213
03:11:27,600 --> 03:11:29,590
still a small percentage of the of the
total economy right there's very few

11214
03:11:29,590 --> 03:11:29,600
total economy right there's very few
 

11215
03:11:29,600 --> 03:11:31,510
total economy right there's very few
individual innovations that

11216
03:11:31,510 --> 03:11:31,520
individual innovations that
 

11217
03:11:31,520 --> 03:11:33,110
individual innovations that
made a substantial difference to the

11218
03:11:33,110 --> 03:11:33,120
made a substantial difference to the
 

11219
03:11:33,120 --> 03:11:34,550
made a substantial difference to the
whole economy right what are we talking

11220
03:11:34,550 --> 03:11:34,560
whole economy right what are we talking
 

11221
03:11:34,560 --> 03:11:36,229
whole economy right what are we talking
steam engine you know shipping

11222
03:11:36,229 --> 03:11:36,239
steam engine you know shipping
 

11223
03:11:36,239 --> 03:11:39,030
steam engine you know shipping
containers you know a few things

11224
03:11:39,030 --> 03:11:39,040
containers you know a few things
 

11225
03:11:39,040 --> 03:11:41,349
containers you know a few things
uh shipping shipping containers deserves

11226
03:11:41,349 --> 03:11:41,359
uh shipping shipping containers deserves
 

11227
03:11:41,359 --> 03:11:42,710
uh shipping shipping containers deserves
to be up there with steam engines

11228
03:11:42,710 --> 03:11:42,720
to be up there with steam engines
 

11229
03:11:42,720 --> 03:11:43,750
to be up there with steam engines
honestly

11230
03:11:43,750 --> 03:11:43,760
honestly
 

11231
03:11:43,760 --> 03:11:46,070
honestly
uh can you say exactly why shipping

11232
03:11:46,070 --> 03:11:46,080
uh can you say exactly why shipping
 

11233
03:11:46,080 --> 03:11:47,269
uh can you say exactly why shipping
containers

11234
03:11:47,269 --> 03:11:47,279
containers
 

11235
03:11:47,279 --> 03:11:49,510
containers
uh containers revolutionized shipping

11236
03:11:49,510 --> 03:11:49,520
uh containers revolutionized shipping
 

11237
03:11:49,520 --> 03:11:52,070
uh containers revolutionized shipping
and shipping is very important

11238
03:11:52,070 --> 03:11:52,080
and shipping is very important
 

11239
03:11:52,080 --> 03:11:55,269
and shipping is very important
but placing that as shipping containers

11240
03:11:55,269 --> 03:11:55,279
but placing that as shipping containers
 

11241
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:56,469
but placing that as shipping containers
so you're saying you wouldn't have some

11242
03:11:56,469 --> 03:11:56,479
so you're saying you wouldn't have some
 

11243
03:11:56,479 --> 03:11:58,870
so you're saying you wouldn't have some
of the magic of the supply chain and all

11244
03:11:58,870 --> 03:11:58,880
of the magic of the supply chain and all
 

11245
03:11:58,880 --> 03:12:00,710
of the magic of the supply chain and all
that without shipping containers that

11246
03:12:00,710 --> 03:12:00,720
that without shipping containers that
 

11247
03:12:00,720 --> 03:12:02,150
that without shipping containers that
made a big difference absolutely

11248
03:12:02,150 --> 03:12:02,160
made a big difference absolutely
 

11249
03:12:02,160 --> 03:12:03,510
made a big difference absolutely
interesting that's something to look

11250
03:12:03,510 --> 03:12:03,520
interesting that's something to look
 

11251
03:12:03,520 --> 03:12:05,990
interesting that's something to look
into i don't i we shouldn't we shouldn't

11252
03:12:05,990 --> 03:12:06,000
into i don't i we shouldn't we shouldn't
 

11253
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:07,510
into i don't i we shouldn't we shouldn't
take that tangent although i'm tempted

11254
03:12:07,510 --> 03:12:07,520
take that tangent although i'm tempted
 

11255
03:12:07,520 --> 03:12:09,670
take that tangent although i'm tempted
to but anyway so there's a few just a

11256
03:12:09,670 --> 03:12:09,680
to but anyway so there's a few just a
 

11257
03:12:09,680 --> 03:12:12,389
to but anyway so there's a few just a
few innovations right so at the scale of

11258
03:12:12,389 --> 03:12:12,399
few innovations right so at the scale of
 

11259
03:12:12,399 --> 03:12:13,910
few innovations right so at the scale of
the whole economy right

11260
03:12:13,910 --> 03:12:13,920
the whole economy right
 

11261
03:12:13,920 --> 03:12:15,910
the whole economy right
now as you move down to a much smaller

11262
03:12:15,910 --> 03:12:15,920
now as you move down to a much smaller
 

11263
03:12:15,920 --> 03:12:18,469
now as you move down to a much smaller
scale um you will see

11264
03:12:18,469 --> 03:12:18,479
scale um you will see
 

11265
03:12:18,479 --> 03:12:19,990
scale um you will see
individual innovations having a bigger

11266
03:12:19,990 --> 03:12:20,000
individual innovations having a bigger
 

11267
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:20,870
individual innovations having a bigger
effect

11268
03:12:20,870 --> 03:12:20,880
effect
 

11269
03:12:20,880 --> 03:12:22,710
effect
right so if you look at i don't know

11270
03:12:22,710 --> 03:12:22,720
right so if you look at i don't know
 

11271
03:12:22,720 --> 03:12:24,710
right so if you look at i don't know
lawn mowers or something

11272
03:12:24,710 --> 03:12:24,720
lawn mowers or something
 

11273
03:12:24,720 --> 03:12:25,830
lawn mowers or something
i don't know about the innovations lawn

11274
03:12:25,830 --> 03:12:25,840
i don't know about the innovations lawn
 

11275
03:12:25,840 --> 03:12:27,830
i don't know about the innovations lawn
mower but there are probably like steps

11276
03:12:27,830 --> 03:12:27,840
mower but there are probably like steps
 

11277
03:12:27,840 --> 03:12:29,429
mower but there are probably like steps
where you just had a new kind of

11278
03:12:29,429 --> 03:12:29,439
where you just had a new kind of
 

11279
03:12:29,439 --> 03:12:31,429
where you just had a new kind of
lawnmower and that made a big difference

11280
03:12:31,429 --> 03:12:31,439
lawnmower and that made a big difference
 

11281
03:12:31,439 --> 03:12:33,510
lawnmower and that made a big difference
to mowing lawns

11282
03:12:33,510 --> 03:12:33,520
to mowing lawns
 

11283
03:12:33,520 --> 03:12:34,870
to mowing lawns
because you're you're focusing on a

11284
03:12:34,870 --> 03:12:34,880
because you're you're focusing on a
 

11285
03:12:34,880 --> 03:12:37,110
because you're you're focusing on a
smaller part of the whole technology

11286
03:12:37,110 --> 03:12:37,120
smaller part of the whole technology
 

11287
03:12:37,120 --> 03:12:38,870
smaller part of the whole technology
space right so

11288
03:12:38,870 --> 03:12:38,880
space right so
 

11289
03:12:38,880 --> 03:12:39,670
space right so
um

11290
03:12:39,670 --> 03:12:39,680
um
 

11291
03:12:39,680 --> 03:12:41,830
um
and you know sometimes like military

11292
03:12:41,830 --> 03:12:41,840
and you know sometimes like military
 

11293
03:12:41,840 --> 03:12:43,190
and you know sometimes like military
technology there's a lot of military

11294
03:12:43,190 --> 03:12:43,200
technology there's a lot of military
 

11295
03:12:43,200 --> 03:12:44,389
technology there's a lot of military
technology there's a lot of small ones

11296
03:12:44,389 --> 03:12:44,399
technology there's a lot of small ones
 

11297
03:12:44,399 --> 03:12:45,910
technology there's a lot of small ones
but every once in a while a particular

11298
03:12:45,910 --> 03:12:45,920
but every once in a while a particular
 

11299
03:12:45,920 --> 03:12:47,510
but every once in a while a particular
military weapon like makes a big

11300
03:12:47,510 --> 03:12:47,520
military weapon like makes a big
 

11301
03:12:47,520 --> 03:12:48,870
military weapon like makes a big
difference

11302
03:12:48,870 --> 03:12:48,880
difference
 

11303
03:12:48,880 --> 03:12:51,429
difference
but still even so mostly overall they're

11304
03:12:51,429 --> 03:12:51,439
but still even so mostly overall they're
 

11305
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:54,309
but still even so mostly overall they're
making modest differences to a something

11306
03:12:54,309 --> 03:12:54,319
making modest differences to a something
 

11307
03:12:54,319 --> 03:12:56,229
making modest differences to a something
that's increasing relatively stable like

11308
03:12:56,229 --> 03:12:56,239
that's increasing relatively stable like
 

11309
03:12:56,239 --> 03:12:57,670
that's increasing relatively stable like
us military is the strongest in the

11310
03:12:57,670 --> 03:12:57,680
us military is the strongest in the
 

11311
03:12:57,680 --> 03:12:58,469
us military is the strongest in the
world

11312
03:12:58,469 --> 03:12:58,479
world
 

11313
03:12:58,479 --> 03:13:00,710
world
consistently for a while no one weapon

11314
03:13:00,710 --> 03:13:00,720
consistently for a while no one weapon
 

11315
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:02,950
consistently for a while no one weapon
in the last 70 years has like

11316
03:13:02,950 --> 03:13:02,960
in the last 70 years has like
 

11317
03:13:02,960 --> 03:13:04,950
in the last 70 years has like
made a big difference in terms of the

11318
03:13:04,950 --> 03:13:04,960
made a big difference in terms of the
 

11319
03:13:04,960 --> 03:13:07,030
made a big difference in terms of the
overall prominence of the us military

11320
03:13:07,030 --> 03:13:07,040
overall prominence of the us military
 

11321
03:13:07,040 --> 03:13:08,469
overall prominence of the us military
right because that's just saying even

11322
03:13:08,469 --> 03:13:08,479
right because that's just saying even
 

11323
03:13:08,479 --> 03:13:10,229
right because that's just saying even
though every once in a while even the

11324
03:13:10,229 --> 03:13:10,239
though every once in a while even the
 

11325
03:13:10,239 --> 03:13:12,469
though every once in a while even the
recent soviet hyper missiles or whatever

11326
03:13:12,469 --> 03:13:12,479
recent soviet hyper missiles or whatever
 

11327
03:13:12,479 --> 03:13:14,710
recent soviet hyper missiles or whatever
they are they aren't

11328
03:13:14,710 --> 03:13:14,720
they are they aren't
 

11329
03:13:14,720 --> 03:13:15,990
they are they aren't
changing the overall balance

11330
03:13:15,990 --> 03:13:16,000
changing the overall balance
 

11331
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:18,070
changing the overall balance
dramatically right

11332
03:13:18,070 --> 03:13:18,080
dramatically right
 

11333
03:13:18,080 --> 03:13:20,309
dramatically right
so when we get to ai now the now i can

11334
03:13:20,309 --> 03:13:20,319
so when we get to ai now the now i can
 

11335
03:13:20,319 --> 03:13:23,590
so when we get to ai now the now i can
frame the question how big is ai

11336
03:13:23,590 --> 03:13:23,600
frame the question how big is ai
 

11337
03:13:23,600 --> 03:13:26,070
frame the question how big is ai
basically if so one way of thinking

11338
03:13:26,070 --> 03:13:26,080
basically if so one way of thinking
 

11339
03:13:26,080 --> 03:13:28,790
basically if so one way of thinking
about ais is just all mental tasks and

11340
03:13:28,790 --> 03:13:28,800
about ais is just all mental tasks and
 

11341
03:13:28,800 --> 03:13:30,229
about ais is just all mental tasks and
then you ask what fraction of tasks are

11342
03:13:30,229 --> 03:13:30,239
then you ask what fraction of tasks are
 

11343
03:13:30,239 --> 03:13:33,670
then you ask what fraction of tasks are
mental tasks and then i go a lot

11344
03:13:33,670 --> 03:13:33,680
mental tasks and then i go a lot
 

11345
03:13:33,680 --> 03:13:36,309
mental tasks and then i go a lot
and then if i think of ai is like half

11346
03:13:36,309 --> 03:13:36,319
and then if i think of ai is like half
 

11347
03:13:36,319 --> 03:13:38,150
and then if i think of ai is like half
of everything

11348
03:13:38,150 --> 03:13:38,160
of everything
 

11349
03:13:38,160 --> 03:13:39,670
of everything
then i think well it's got to be

11350
03:13:39,670 --> 03:13:39,680
then i think well it's got to be
 

11351
03:13:39,680 --> 03:13:41,910
then i think well it's got to be
composed of lots of parts where anyone

11352
03:13:41,910 --> 03:13:41,920
composed of lots of parts where anyone
 

11353
03:13:41,920 --> 03:13:45,269
composed of lots of parts where anyone
innovation is only a small impact right

11354
03:13:45,269 --> 03:13:45,279
innovation is only a small impact right
 

11355
03:13:45,279 --> 03:13:49,670
innovation is only a small impact right
now if you think no no ai is like agi

11356
03:13:49,670 --> 03:13:49,680
now if you think no no ai is like agi
 

11357
03:13:49,680 --> 03:13:51,190
now if you think no no ai is like agi
and then you think

11358
03:13:51,190 --> 03:13:51,200
and then you think
 

11359
03:13:51,200 --> 03:13:53,190
and then you think
agi is a small thing right there's only

11360
03:13:53,190 --> 03:13:53,200
agi is a small thing right there's only
 

11361
03:13:53,200 --> 03:13:55,110
agi is a small thing right there's only
a small number of key innovations that

11362
03:13:55,110 --> 03:13:55,120
a small number of key innovations that
 

11363
03:13:55,120 --> 03:13:56,630
a small number of key innovations that
will enable it

11364
03:13:56,630 --> 03:13:56,640
will enable it
 

11365
03:13:56,640 --> 03:13:59,190
will enable it
now you're thinking there could be a

11366
03:13:59,190 --> 03:13:59,200
now you're thinking there could be a
 

11367
03:13:59,200 --> 03:14:00,309
now you're thinking there could be a
bigger

11368
03:14:00,309 --> 03:14:00,319
bigger
 

11369
03:14:00,319 --> 03:14:01,510
bigger
chunk that you might find that would

11370
03:14:01,510 --> 03:14:01,520
chunk that you might find that would
 

11371
03:14:01,520 --> 03:14:04,309
chunk that you might find that would
have a bigger impact so the way i would

11372
03:14:04,309 --> 03:14:04,319
have a bigger impact so the way i would
 

11373
03:14:04,319 --> 03:14:05,830
have a bigger impact so the way i would
ask you to frame these things in terms

11374
03:14:05,830 --> 03:14:05,840
ask you to frame these things in terms
 

11375
03:14:05,840 --> 03:14:07,190
ask you to frame these things in terms
the chunkiness

11376
03:14:07,190 --> 03:14:07,200
the chunkiness
 

11377
03:14:07,200 --> 03:14:09,750
the chunkiness
of different areas of technology

11378
03:14:09,750 --> 03:14:09,760
of different areas of technology
 

11379
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:11,429
of different areas of technology
in part in terms of how big they are if

11380
03:14:11,429 --> 03:14:11,439
in part in terms of how big they are if
 

11381
03:14:11,439 --> 03:14:12,389
in part in terms of how big they are if
you take

11382
03:14:12,389 --> 03:14:12,399
you take
 

11383
03:14:12,399 --> 03:14:13,910
you take
10 chunky areas and you add them

11384
03:14:13,910 --> 03:14:13,920
10 chunky areas and you add them
 

11385
03:14:13,920 --> 03:14:16,469
10 chunky areas and you add them
together the total is less chunky yeah

11386
03:14:16,469 --> 03:14:16,479
together the total is less chunky yeah
 

11387
03:14:16,479 --> 03:14:18,790
together the total is less chunky yeah
but don't you are you able until you

11388
03:14:18,790 --> 03:14:18,800
but don't you are you able until you
 

11389
03:14:18,800 --> 03:14:19,750
but don't you are you able until you
solve

11390
03:14:19,750 --> 03:14:19,760
solve
 

11391
03:14:19,760 --> 03:14:21,670
solve
the fundamental core

11392
03:14:21,670 --> 03:14:21,680
the fundamental core
 

11393
03:14:21,680 --> 03:14:23,190
the fundamental core
parts of the problem to estimate the

11394
03:14:23,190 --> 03:14:23,200
parts of the problem to estimate the
 

11395
03:14:23,200 --> 03:14:25,349
parts of the problem to estimate the
chunkiness of that problem

11396
03:14:25,349 --> 03:14:25,359
chunkiness of that problem
 

11397
03:14:25,359 --> 03:14:27,510
chunkiness of that problem
well if you have a history of prior

11398
03:14:27,510 --> 03:14:27,520
well if you have a history of prior
 

11399
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:29,190
well if you have a history of prior
chunkiness that could be your best

11400
03:14:29,190 --> 03:14:29,200
chunkiness that could be your best
 

11401
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:30,870
chunkiness that could be your best
estimate for future chunkiness so for

11402
03:14:30,870 --> 03:14:30,880
estimate for future chunkiness so for
 

11403
03:14:30,880 --> 03:14:32,710
estimate for future chunkiness so for
example i mean even at the level of the

11404
03:14:32,710 --> 03:14:32,720
example i mean even at the level of the
 

11405
03:14:32,720 --> 03:14:35,030
example i mean even at the level of the
world economy right we've had this what

11406
03:14:35,030 --> 03:14:35,040
world economy right we've had this what
 

11407
03:14:35,040 --> 03:14:36,630
world economy right we've had this what
10 000 years of

11408
03:14:36,630 --> 03:14:36,640
10 000 years of
 

11409
03:14:36,640 --> 03:14:38,229
10 000 years of
civilization well that's only a short

11410
03:14:38,229 --> 03:14:38,239
civilization well that's only a short
 

11411
03:14:38,239 --> 03:14:39,030
civilization well that's only a short
time

11412
03:14:39,030 --> 03:14:39,040
time
 

11413
03:14:39,040 --> 03:14:40,710
time
you might say oh that that doesn't

11414
03:14:40,710 --> 03:14:40,720
you might say oh that that doesn't
 

11415
03:14:40,720 --> 03:14:42,710
you might say oh that that doesn't
predict future chunkiness

11416
03:14:42,710 --> 03:14:42,720
predict future chunkiness
 

11417
03:14:42,720 --> 03:14:44,790
predict future chunkiness
uh but you know looks relatively steady

11418
03:14:44,790 --> 03:14:44,800
uh but you know looks relatively steady
 

11419
03:14:44,800 --> 03:14:46,229
uh but you know looks relatively steady
and consistent

11420
03:14:46,229 --> 03:14:46,239
and consistent
 

11421
03:14:46,239 --> 03:14:48,469
and consistent
we can say even in computer science

11422
03:14:48,469 --> 03:14:48,479
we can say even in computer science
 

11423
03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:50,070
we can say even in computer science
we've had you know seven years of

11424
03:14:50,070 --> 03:14:50,080
we've had you know seven years of
 

11425
03:14:50,080 --> 03:14:51,670
we've had you know seven years of
computer science we have enough data to

11426
03:14:51,670 --> 03:14:51,680
computer science we have enough data to
 

11427
03:14:51,680 --> 03:14:53,990
computer science we have enough data to
look at chunkiness in computer science

11428
03:14:53,990 --> 03:14:54,000
look at chunkiness in computer science
 

11429
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,790
look at chunkiness in computer science
like when were there algorithms or

11430
03:14:56,790 --> 03:14:56,800
like when were there algorithms or
 

11431
03:14:56,800 --> 03:14:58,630
like when were there algorithms or
approaches that made a big chunky

11432
03:14:58,630 --> 03:14:58,640
approaches that made a big chunky
 

11433
03:14:58,640 --> 03:15:00,630
approaches that made a big chunky
difference and you know

11434
03:15:00,630 --> 03:15:00,640
difference and you know
 

11435
03:15:00,640 --> 03:15:02,950
difference and you know
versus and how large a fraction of that

11436
03:15:02,950 --> 03:15:02,960
versus and how large a fraction of that
 

11437
03:15:02,960 --> 03:15:05,429
versus and how large a fraction of that
was that and i'd say mostly in computer

11438
03:15:05,429 --> 03:15:05,439
was that and i'd say mostly in computer
 

11439
03:15:05,439 --> 03:15:06,710
was that and i'd say mostly in computer
science most innovation has been

11440
03:15:06,710 --> 03:15:06,720
science most innovation has been
 

11441
03:15:06,720 --> 03:15:08,309
science most innovation has been
relatively small chunks the bigger

11442
03:15:08,309 --> 03:15:08,319
relatively small chunks the bigger
 

11443
03:15:08,319 --> 03:15:09,910
relatively small chunks the bigger
chunks have been rare

11444
03:15:09,910 --> 03:15:09,920
chunks have been rare
 

11445
03:15:09,920 --> 03:15:11,670
chunks have been rare
well this is the interesting thing this

11446
03:15:11,670 --> 03:15:11,680
well this is the interesting thing this
 

11447
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:13,429
well this is the interesting thing this
is about ai and just algorithms in

11448
03:15:13,429 --> 03:15:13,439
is about ai and just algorithms in
 

11449
03:15:13,439 --> 03:15:14,469
is about ai and just algorithms in
general

11450
03:15:14,469 --> 03:15:14,479
general
 

11451
03:15:14,479 --> 03:15:15,910
general
is

11452
03:15:15,910 --> 03:15:15,920
is
 

11453
03:15:15,920 --> 03:15:19,590
is
you know pagerank so google's right

11454
03:15:19,590 --> 03:15:19,600
you know pagerank so google's right
 

11455
03:15:19,600 --> 03:15:21,190
you know pagerank so google's right
so

11456
03:15:21,190 --> 03:15:21,200
so
 

11457
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:23,750
so
sometimes it's a simple algorithm that

11458
03:15:23,750 --> 03:15:23,760
sometimes it's a simple algorithm that
 

11459
03:15:23,760 --> 03:15:25,590
sometimes it's a simple algorithm that
by itself

11460
03:15:25,590 --> 03:15:25,600
by itself
 

11461
03:15:25,600 --> 03:15:29,110
by itself
is not that useful but the scale context

11462
03:15:29,110 --> 03:15:29,120
is not that useful but the scale context
 

11463
03:15:29,120 --> 03:15:31,670
is not that useful but the scale context
and in a context that's scalable like

11464
03:15:31,670 --> 03:15:31,680
and in a context that's scalable like
 

11465
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:33,349
and in a context that's scalable like
right depending on yeah depending on the

11466
03:15:33,349 --> 03:15:33,359
right depending on yeah depending on the
 

11467
03:15:33,359 --> 03:15:35,830
right depending on yeah depending on the
context is all of a sudden the power is

11468
03:15:35,830 --> 03:15:35,840
context is all of a sudden the power is
 

11469
03:15:35,840 --> 03:15:37,670
context is all of a sudden the power is
revealed and there's something i guess

11470
03:15:37,670 --> 03:15:37,680
revealed and there's something i guess
 

11471
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:39,670
revealed and there's something i guess
that's the nature of chunkiness

11472
03:15:39,670 --> 03:15:39,680
that's the nature of chunkiness
 

11473
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:41,750
that's the nature of chunkiness
is um

11474
03:15:41,750 --> 03:15:41,760
is um
 

11475
03:15:41,760 --> 03:15:43,429
is um
that you could things that can reach a

11476
03:15:43,429 --> 03:15:43,439
that you could things that can reach a
 

11477
03:15:43,439 --> 03:15:45,429
that you could things that can reach a
lot of people simply

11478
03:15:45,429 --> 03:15:45,439
lot of people simply
 

11479
03:15:45,439 --> 03:15:47,429
lot of people simply
can be quite challenging so one standard

11480
03:15:47,429 --> 03:15:47,439
can be quite challenging so one standard
 

11481
03:15:47,439 --> 03:15:49,590
can be quite challenging so one standard
story about algorithms is to say

11482
03:15:49,590 --> 03:15:49,600
story about algorithms is to say
 

11483
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:52,790
story about algorithms is to say
algorithms have a fixed cost plus a

11484
03:15:52,790 --> 03:15:52,800
algorithms have a fixed cost plus a
 

11485
03:15:52,800 --> 03:15:54,309
algorithms have a fixed cost plus a
marginal cost

11486
03:15:54,309 --> 03:15:54,319
marginal cost
 

11487
03:15:54,319 --> 03:15:55,349
marginal cost
and so

11488
03:15:55,349 --> 03:15:55,359
and so
 

11489
03:15:55,359 --> 03:15:56,950
and so
in history when you had computers are

11490
03:15:56,950 --> 03:15:56,960
in history when you had computers are
 

11491
03:15:56,960 --> 03:15:59,269
in history when you had computers are
very small you tried all the algorithms

11492
03:15:59,269 --> 03:15:59,279
very small you tried all the algorithms
 

11493
03:15:59,279 --> 03:16:01,750
very small you tried all the algorithms
had low fixed costs

11494
03:16:01,750 --> 03:16:01,760
had low fixed costs
 

11495
03:16:01,760 --> 03:16:03,429
had low fixed costs
and you look for the best of those but

11496
03:16:03,429 --> 03:16:03,439
and you look for the best of those but
 

11497
03:16:03,439 --> 03:16:04,870
and you look for the best of those but
over time as computers got bigger you

11498
03:16:04,870 --> 03:16:04,880
over time as computers got bigger you
 

11499
03:16:04,880 --> 03:16:06,950
over time as computers got bigger you
could afford to do larger fixed costs

11500
03:16:06,950 --> 03:16:06,960
could afford to do larger fixed costs
 

11501
03:16:06,960 --> 03:16:09,349
could afford to do larger fixed costs
and try those and some of those had

11502
03:16:09,349 --> 03:16:09,359
and try those and some of those had
 

11503
03:16:09,359 --> 03:16:10,870
and try those and some of those had
more effective algorithms in terms of

11504
03:16:10,870 --> 03:16:10,880
more effective algorithms in terms of
 

11505
03:16:10,880 --> 03:16:12,389
more effective algorithms in terms of
their marginal cost

11506
03:16:12,389 --> 03:16:12,399
their marginal cost
 

11507
03:16:12,399 --> 03:16:14,710
their marginal cost
and that in fact you know that it

11508
03:16:14,710 --> 03:16:14,720
and that in fact you know that it
 

11509
03:16:14,720 --> 03:16:16,389
and that in fact you know that it
roughly explains the long-term history

11510
03:16:16,389 --> 03:16:16,399
roughly explains the long-term history
 

11511
03:16:16,399 --> 03:16:18,550
roughly explains the long-term history
where in fact the rate of algorithmic

11512
03:16:18,550 --> 03:16:18,560
where in fact the rate of algorithmic
 

11513
03:16:18,560 --> 03:16:19,750
where in fact the rate of algorithmic
improvement is about the same as the

11514
03:16:19,750 --> 03:16:19,760
improvement is about the same as the
 

11515
03:16:19,760 --> 03:16:21,910
improvement is about the same as the
rate of hardware improvement

11516
03:16:21,910 --> 03:16:21,920
rate of hardware improvement
 

11517
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:24,710
rate of hardware improvement
which is a remarkable coincidence

11518
03:16:24,710 --> 03:16:24,720
which is a remarkable coincidence
 

11519
03:16:24,720 --> 03:16:27,030
which is a remarkable coincidence
but it would be explained by saying well

11520
03:16:27,030 --> 03:16:27,040
but it would be explained by saying well
 

11521
03:16:27,040 --> 03:16:28,950
but it would be explained by saying well
there's all these better algorithms you

11522
03:16:28,950 --> 03:16:28,960
there's all these better algorithms you
 

11523
03:16:28,960 --> 03:16:30,630
there's all these better algorithms you
can't try until you have a big enough

11524
03:16:30,630 --> 03:16:30,640
can't try until you have a big enough
 

11525
03:16:30,640 --> 03:16:32,790
can't try until you have a big enough
computer to pay the fixed cost of doing

11526
03:16:32,790 --> 03:16:32,800
computer to pay the fixed cost of doing
 

11527
03:16:32,800 --> 03:16:34,550
computer to pay the fixed cost of doing
some trials to find out if that

11528
03:16:34,550 --> 03:16:34,560
some trials to find out if that
 

11529
03:16:34,560 --> 03:16:36,070
some trials to find out if that
algorithm actually saves you on the

11530
03:16:36,070 --> 03:16:36,080
algorithm actually saves you on the
 

11531
03:16:36,080 --> 03:16:37,269
algorithm actually saves you on the
marginal cost

11532
03:16:37,269 --> 03:16:37,279
marginal cost
 

11533
03:16:37,279 --> 03:16:38,469
marginal cost
and so

11534
03:16:38,469 --> 03:16:38,479
and so
 

11535
03:16:38,479 --> 03:16:39,750
and so
that's an explanation for this

11536
03:16:39,750 --> 03:16:39,760
that's an explanation for this
 

11537
03:16:39,760 --> 03:16:41,750
that's an explanation for this
relatively continuous history where so

11538
03:16:41,750 --> 03:16:41,760
relatively continuous history where so
 

11539
03:16:41,760 --> 03:16:43,349
relatively continuous history where so
we have a good story about why hardware

11540
03:16:43,349 --> 03:16:43,359
we have a good story about why hardware
 

11541
03:16:43,359 --> 03:16:44,870
we have a good story about why hardware
is so continuous right and you might

11542
03:16:44,870 --> 03:16:44,880
is so continuous right and you might
 

11543
03:16:44,880 --> 03:16:46,229
is so continuous right and you might
think why would software be so

11544
03:16:46,229 --> 03:16:46,239
think why would software be so
 

11545
03:16:46,239 --> 03:16:47,429
think why would software be so
continuous

11546
03:16:47,429 --> 03:16:47,439
continuous
 

11547
03:16:47,439 --> 03:16:48,630
continuous
with the hardware but if there's a

11548
03:16:48,630 --> 03:16:48,640
with the hardware but if there's a
 

11549
03:16:48,640 --> 03:16:50,309
with the hardware but if there's a
distribution of algorithms in terms of

11550
03:16:50,309 --> 03:16:50,319
distribution of algorithms in terms of
 

11551
03:16:50,319 --> 03:16:52,469
distribution of algorithms in terms of
their fixed costs and it's safe spread

11552
03:16:52,469 --> 03:16:52,479
their fixed costs and it's safe spread
 

11553
03:16:52,479 --> 03:16:55,349
their fixed costs and it's safe spread
out a wide log normal distribution then

11554
03:16:55,349 --> 03:16:55,359
out a wide log normal distribution then
 

11555
03:16:55,359 --> 03:16:56,870
out a wide log normal distribution then
we could be sort of marching through

11556
03:16:56,870 --> 03:16:56,880
we could be sort of marching through
 

11557
03:16:56,880 --> 03:16:58,469
we could be sort of marching through
that log normal distribution

11558
03:16:58,469 --> 03:16:58,479
that log normal distribution
 

11559
03:16:58,479 --> 03:17:00,389
that log normal distribution
trying out algorithms with larger fixed

11560
03:17:00,389 --> 03:17:00,399
trying out algorithms with larger fixed
 

11561
03:17:00,399 --> 03:17:02,389
trying out algorithms with larger fixed
costs and finding the ones that have

11562
03:17:02,389 --> 03:17:02,399
costs and finding the ones that have
 

11563
03:17:02,399 --> 03:17:04,229
costs and finding the ones that have
lower marginal cost

11564
03:17:04,229 --> 03:17:04,239
lower marginal cost
 

11565
03:17:04,239 --> 03:17:05,510
lower marginal cost
so

11566
03:17:05,510 --> 03:17:05,520
so
 

11567
03:17:05,520 --> 03:17:08,790
so
would you say agi human level

11568
03:17:08,790 --> 03:17:08,800
would you say agi human level
 

11569
03:17:08,800 --> 03:17:10,710
would you say agi human level
ai

11570
03:17:10,710 --> 03:17:10,720
ai
 

11571
03:17:10,720 --> 03:17:13,349
ai
even em

is uh chunky

11578
03:17:18,469 --> 03:17:18,479
is uh chunky
 

11579
03:17:18,479 --> 03:17:20,710
is uh chunky
like a few breakthroughs can take so and

11580
03:17:20,710 --> 03:17:20,720
like a few breakthroughs can take so and
 

11581
03:17:20,720 --> 03:17:23,510
like a few breakthroughs can take so and
m is by its nature chunky in the sense

11582
03:17:23,510 --> 03:17:23,520
m is by its nature chunky in the sense
 

11583
03:17:23,520 --> 03:17:25,590
m is by its nature chunky in the sense
that if you have an emulated brain and

11584
03:17:25,590 --> 03:17:25,600
that if you have an emulated brain and
 

11585
03:17:25,600 --> 03:17:28,630
that if you have an emulated brain and
you're 25 effective at emulating it

11586
03:17:28,630 --> 03:17:28,640
you're 25 effective at emulating it
 

11587
03:17:28,640 --> 03:17:30,630
you're 25 effective at emulating it
that's crap that's nothing

11588
03:17:30,630 --> 03:17:30,640
that's crap that's nothing
 

11589
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:31,910
that's crap that's nothing
okay okay

11590
03:17:31,910 --> 03:17:31,920
okay okay
 

11591
03:17:31,920 --> 03:17:34,389
okay okay
you pretty much need to emulate a full

11592
03:17:34,389 --> 03:17:34,399
you pretty much need to emulate a full
 

11593
03:17:34,399 --> 03:17:36,389
you pretty much need to emulate a full
human brain is that obvious

11594
03:17:36,389 --> 03:17:36,399
human brain is that obvious
 

11595
03:17:36,399 --> 03:17:37,590
human brain is that obvious
is that obviously

11596
03:17:37,590 --> 03:17:37,600
is that obviously
 

11597
03:17:37,600 --> 03:17:39,830
is that obviously
pretty obvious i'm talking about like

11598
03:17:39,830 --> 03:17:39,840
pretty obvious i'm talking about like
 

11599
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:40,710
pretty obvious i'm talking about like
you know

11600
03:17:40,710 --> 03:17:40,720
you know
 

11601
03:17:40,720 --> 03:17:42,389
you know
so the key thing is you're emulating

11602
03:17:42,389 --> 03:17:42,399
so the key thing is you're emulating
 

11603
03:17:42,399 --> 03:17:44,070
so the key thing is you're emulating
various brain cells and so you have to

11604
03:17:44,070 --> 03:17:44,080
various brain cells and so you have to
 

11605
03:17:44,080 --> 03:17:45,670
various brain cells and so you have to
emulate the input output pattern of

11606
03:17:45,670 --> 03:17:45,680
emulate the input output pattern of
 

11607
03:17:45,680 --> 03:17:47,990
emulate the input output pattern of
those cells so if you get that pattern

11608
03:17:47,990 --> 03:17:48,000
those cells so if you get that pattern
 

11609
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:50,630
those cells so if you get that pattern
somewhat close but not close enough then

11610
03:17:50,630 --> 03:17:50,640
somewhat close but not close enough then
 

11611
03:17:50,640 --> 03:17:52,389
somewhat close but not close enough then
the whole system just doesn't have the

11612
03:17:52,389 --> 03:17:52,399
the whole system just doesn't have the
 

11613
03:17:52,399 --> 03:17:53,670
the whole system just doesn't have the
overall behavior you're looking for

11614
03:17:53,670 --> 03:17:53,680
overall behavior you're looking for
 

11615
03:17:53,680 --> 03:17:56,469
overall behavior you're looking for
right but it could have functionally

11616
03:17:56,469 --> 03:17:56,479
right but it could have functionally
 

11617
03:17:56,479 --> 03:17:58,150
right but it could have functionally
some of the power of the overall so

11618
03:17:58,150 --> 03:17:58,160
some of the power of the overall so
 

11619
03:17:58,160 --> 03:17:59,429
some of the power of the overall so
there'll be some threshold the question

11620
03:17:59,429 --> 03:17:59,439
there'll be some threshold the question
 

11621
03:17:59,439 --> 03:18:01,190
there'll be some threshold the question
is when you get close enough then it

11622
03:18:01,190 --> 03:18:01,200
is when you get close enough then it
 

11623
03:18:01,200 --> 03:18:03,190
is when you get close enough then it
goes over the threshold it's like taking

11624
03:18:03,190 --> 03:18:03,200
goes over the threshold it's like taking
 

11625
03:18:03,200 --> 03:18:05,110
goes over the threshold it's like taking
a computer chip and deleting every one

11626
03:18:05,110 --> 03:18:05,120
a computer chip and deleting every one
 

11627
03:18:05,120 --> 03:18:07,110
a computer chip and deleting every one
percent of the of the gates right

11628
03:18:07,110 --> 03:18:07,120
percent of the of the gates right
 

11629
03:18:07,120 --> 03:18:09,910
percent of the of the gates right
no that's that's very chunky but uh

11630
03:18:09,910 --> 03:18:09,920
no that's that's very chunky but uh
 

11631
03:18:09,920 --> 03:18:11,670
no that's that's very chunky but uh
right hope is that the emulating the

11632
03:18:11,670 --> 03:18:11,680
right hope is that the emulating the
 

11633
03:18:11,680 --> 03:18:13,510
right hope is that the emulating the
human brain i mean the human brain

11634
03:18:13,510 --> 03:18:13,520
human brain i mean the human brain
 

11635
03:18:13,520 --> 03:18:15,590
human brain i mean the human brain
itself is not right so it has a certain

11636
03:18:15,590 --> 03:18:15,600
itself is not right so it has a certain
 

11637
03:18:15,600 --> 03:18:17,030
itself is not right so it has a certain
level of redundancy and a certain level

11638
03:18:17,030 --> 03:18:17,040
level of redundancy and a certain level
 

11639
03:18:17,040 --> 03:18:18,309
level of redundancy and a certain level
of robustness and so there's some

11640
03:18:18,309 --> 03:18:18,319
of robustness and so there's some
 

11641
03:18:18,319 --> 03:18:19,590
of robustness and so there's some
threshold when you get close to that

11642
03:18:19,590 --> 03:18:19,600
threshold when you get close to that
 

11643
03:18:19,600 --> 03:18:21,110
threshold when you get close to that
level of redundancy and robustness then

11644
03:18:21,110 --> 03:18:21,120
level of redundancy and robustness then
 

11645
03:18:21,120 --> 03:18:23,030
level of redundancy and robustness then
it starts to work but until you you know

11646
03:18:23,030 --> 03:18:23,040
it starts to work but until you you know
 

11647
03:18:23,040 --> 03:18:24,229
it starts to work but until you you know
until you get to that level it's just

11648
03:18:24,229 --> 03:18:24,239
until you get to that level it's just
 

11649
03:18:24,239 --> 03:18:25,750
until you get to that level it's just
going to be crap right yeah it's going

11650
03:18:25,750 --> 03:18:25,760
going to be crap right yeah it's going
 

11651
03:18:25,760 --> 03:18:27,590
going to be crap right yeah it's going
to be just a big thing that isn't

11652
03:18:27,590 --> 03:18:27,600
to be just a big thing that isn't
 

11653
03:18:27,600 --> 03:18:29,830
to be just a big thing that isn't
working well so we can be pretty sure

11654
03:18:29,830 --> 03:18:29,840
working well so we can be pretty sure
 

11655
03:18:29,840 --> 03:18:33,190
working well so we can be pretty sure
that emulations is is a big chunk in an

11656
03:18:33,190 --> 03:18:33,200
that emulations is is a big chunk in an
 

11657
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:34,870
that emulations is is a big chunk in an
economic sense right at some point

11658
03:18:34,870 --> 03:18:34,880
economic sense right at some point
 

11659
03:18:34,880 --> 03:18:36,309
economic sense right at some point
you'll be able to make one that's

11660
03:18:36,309 --> 03:18:36,319
you'll be able to make one that's
 

11661
03:18:36,319 --> 03:18:38,070
you'll be able to make one that's
actually effective

11662
03:18:38,070 --> 03:18:38,080
actually effective
 

11663
03:18:38,080 --> 03:18:39,910
actually effective
in enable substituting for humans and

11664
03:18:39,910 --> 03:18:39,920
in enable substituting for humans and
 

11665
03:18:39,920 --> 03:18:42,550
in enable substituting for humans and
then that will be this huge economic

11666
03:18:42,550 --> 03:18:42,560
then that will be this huge economic
 

11667
03:18:42,560 --> 03:18:44,150
then that will be this huge economic
product that people will try to buy like

11668
03:18:44,150 --> 03:18:44,160
product that people will try to buy like
 

11669
03:18:44,160 --> 03:18:45,670
product that people will try to buy like
crazy now you bring a lot of value to

11670
03:18:45,670 --> 03:18:45,680
crazy now you bring a lot of value to
 

11671
03:18:45,680 --> 03:18:46,790
crazy now you bring a lot of value to
people's lives so they'll be able to

11672
03:18:46,790 --> 03:18:46,800
people's lives so they'll be able to
 

11673
03:18:46,800 --> 03:18:48,790
people's lives so they'll be able to
they'll be willing to pay for it

11674
03:18:48,790 --> 03:18:48,800
they'll be willing to pay for it
 

11675
03:18:48,800 --> 03:18:50,469
they'll be willing to pay for it
but it could be that you know the first

11676
03:18:50,469 --> 03:18:50,479
but it could be that you know the first
 

11677
03:18:50,479 --> 03:18:52,950
but it could be that you know the first
emulation costs a billion dollars each

11678
03:18:52,950 --> 03:18:52,960
emulation costs a billion dollars each
 

11679
03:18:52,960 --> 03:18:55,190
emulation costs a billion dollars each
right and then we have them but we can't

11680
03:18:55,190 --> 03:18:55,200
right and then we have them but we can't
 

11681
03:18:55,200 --> 03:18:56,469
right and then we have them but we can't
really use them too expensive then the

11682
03:18:56,469 --> 03:18:56,479
really use them too expensive then the
 

11683
03:18:56,479 --> 03:18:58,870
really use them too expensive then the
cost slowly comes down and now we have

11684
03:18:58,870 --> 03:18:58,880
cost slowly comes down and now we have
 

11685
03:18:58,880 --> 03:19:01,510
cost slowly comes down and now we have
less of a chunky adaptation adoption

11686
03:19:01,510 --> 03:19:01,520
less of a chunky adaptation adoption
 

11687
03:19:01,520 --> 03:19:02,309
less of a chunky adaptation adoption
right

11688
03:19:02,309 --> 03:19:02,319
right
 

11689
03:19:02,319 --> 03:19:04,710
right
that as the cross comes down then we use

11690
03:19:04,710 --> 03:19:04,720
that as the cross comes down then we use
 

11691
03:19:04,720 --> 03:19:05,990
that as the cross comes down then we use
more and more of them in more and more

11692
03:19:05,990 --> 03:19:06,000
more and more of them in more and more
 

11693
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:07,269
more and more of them in more and more
context

11694
03:19:07,269 --> 03:19:07,279
context
 

11695
03:19:07,279 --> 03:19:10,309
context
and that's a more continuous curve

11696
03:19:10,309 --> 03:19:10,319
and that's a more continuous curve
 

11697
03:19:10,319 --> 03:19:12,630
and that's a more continuous curve
so it's only if the first emulations are

11698
03:19:12,630 --> 03:19:12,640
so it's only if the first emulations are
 

11699
03:19:12,640 --> 03:19:14,790
so it's only if the first emulations are
relatively cheap that you get of more

11700
03:19:14,790 --> 03:19:14,800
relatively cheap that you get of more
 

11701
03:19:14,800 --> 03:19:18,070
relatively cheap that you get of more
sudden disruption to society uh and that

11702
03:19:18,070 --> 03:19:18,080
sudden disruption to society uh and that
 

11703
03:19:18,080 --> 03:19:19,910
sudden disruption to society uh and that
could happen if sort of the algorithm is

11704
03:19:19,910 --> 03:19:19,920
could happen if sort of the algorithm is
 

11705
03:19:19,920 --> 03:19:21,269
could happen if sort of the algorithm is
the last thing you figure out how to do

11706
03:19:21,269 --> 03:19:21,279
the last thing you figure out how to do
 

11707
03:19:21,279 --> 03:19:22,870
the last thing you figure out how to do
or something what about robots that

11708
03:19:22,870 --> 03:19:22,880
or something what about robots that
 

11709
03:19:22,880 --> 03:19:25,750
or something what about robots that
capture some magic

11710
03:19:25,750 --> 03:19:25,760
capture some magic
 

11711
03:19:25,760 --> 03:19:26,710
capture some magic
um

11712
03:19:26,710 --> 03:19:26,720
um
 

11713
03:19:26,720 --> 03:19:28,550
um
in terms of social connection

11714
03:19:28,550 --> 03:19:28,560
in terms of social connection
 

11715
03:19:28,560 --> 03:19:31,110
in terms of social connection
the robots like we have a robot dog on

11716
03:19:31,110 --> 03:19:31,120
the robots like we have a robot dog on
 

11717
03:19:31,120 --> 03:19:33,190
the robots like we have a robot dog on
the carpet right there uh

11718
03:19:33,190 --> 03:19:33,200
the carpet right there uh
 

11719
03:19:33,200 --> 03:19:35,030
the carpet right there uh
robots that are able to capture some

11720
03:19:35,030 --> 03:19:35,040
robots that are able to capture some
 

11721
03:19:35,040 --> 03:19:38,070
robots that are able to capture some
magic of human connection

11722
03:19:38,070 --> 03:19:38,080
magic of human connection
 

11723
03:19:38,080 --> 03:19:40,469
magic of human connection
as they interact with humans but are not

11724
03:19:40,469 --> 03:19:40,479
as they interact with humans but are not
 

11725
03:19:40,479 --> 03:19:42,950
as they interact with humans but are not
emulating the brain what about what

11726
03:19:42,950 --> 03:19:42,960
emulating the brain what about what
 

11727
03:19:42,960 --> 03:19:45,670
emulating the brain what about what
about those how far away

11728
03:19:45,670 --> 03:19:45,680
about those how far away
 

11729
03:19:45,680 --> 03:19:46,309
about those how far away
so

11730
03:19:46,309 --> 03:19:46,319
so
 

11731
03:19:46,319 --> 03:19:47,830
so
we're thinking about chunkiness or

11732
03:19:47,830 --> 03:19:47,840
we're thinking about chunkiness or
 

11733
03:19:47,840 --> 03:19:50,469
we're thinking about chunkiness or
distance now so if you ask how chunky is

11734
03:19:50,469 --> 03:19:50,479
distance now so if you ask how chunky is
 

11735
03:19:50,479 --> 03:19:53,750
distance now so if you ask how chunky is
the task of making a you know emulatable

11736
03:19:53,750 --> 03:19:53,760
the task of making a you know emulatable
 

11737
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,670
the task of making a you know emulatable
robot or something you know

11738
03:19:55,670 --> 03:19:55,680
robot or something you know
 

11739
03:19:55,680 --> 03:19:58,389
robot or something you know
which chunkiness and time are

11740
03:19:58,389 --> 03:19:58,399
which chunkiness and time are
 

11741
03:19:58,399 --> 03:20:01,110
which chunkiness and time are
correlated right but that it's about how

11742
03:20:01,110 --> 03:20:01,120
correlated right but that it's about how
 

11743
03:20:01,120 --> 03:20:02,950
correlated right but that it's about how
far away it is or how suddenly it would

11744
03:20:02,950 --> 03:20:02,960
far away it is or how suddenly it would
 

11745
03:20:02,960 --> 03:20:03,830
far away it is or how suddenly it would
happen

11746
03:20:03,830 --> 03:20:03,840
happen
 

11747
03:20:03,840 --> 03:20:06,070
happen
uh chunkiness is how suddenly

11748
03:20:06,070 --> 03:20:06,080
uh chunkiness is how suddenly
 

11749
03:20:06,080 --> 03:20:08,229
uh chunkiness is how suddenly
and you know difficulty is just how far

11750
03:20:08,229 --> 03:20:08,239
and you know difficulty is just how far
 

11751
03:20:08,239 --> 03:20:10,070
and you know difficulty is just how far
away it is but it could be a continuous

11752
03:20:10,070 --> 03:20:10,080
away it is but it could be a continuous
 

11753
03:20:10,080 --> 03:20:11,429
away it is but it could be a continuous
difficulty it would just be far away but

11754
03:20:11,429 --> 03:20:11,439
difficulty it would just be far away but
 

11755
03:20:11,439 --> 03:20:13,349
difficulty it would just be far away but
will slowly steadily get there or there

11756
03:20:13,349 --> 03:20:13,359
will slowly steadily get there or there
 

11757
03:20:13,359 --> 03:20:14,870
will slowly steadily get there or there
could be these thresholds where we reach

11758
03:20:14,870 --> 03:20:14,880
could be these thresholds where we reach
 

11759
03:20:14,880 --> 03:20:16,309
could be these thresholds where we reach
a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot

11760
03:20:16,309 --> 03:20:16,319
a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot
 

11761
03:20:16,319 --> 03:20:18,070
a threshold and suddenly we can do a lot
better yeah that's a good i mean

11762
03:20:18,070 --> 03:20:18,080
better yeah that's a good i mean
 

11763
03:20:18,080 --> 03:20:20,710
better yeah that's a good i mean
question for both i tend to believe that

11764
03:20:20,710 --> 03:20:20,720
question for both i tend to believe that
 

11765
03:20:20,720 --> 03:20:23,110
question for both i tend to believe that
all of it not just the m

11766
03:20:23,110 --> 03:20:23,120
all of it not just the m
 

11767
03:20:23,120 --> 03:20:25,750
all of it not just the m
but agi too is chunky

11768
03:20:25,750 --> 03:20:25,760
but agi too is chunky
 

11769
03:20:25,760 --> 03:20:26,630
but agi too is chunky
and

11770
03:20:26,630 --> 03:20:26,640
and
 

11771
03:20:26,640 --> 03:20:29,670
and
um human level intelligence so my my

11772
03:20:29,670 --> 03:20:29,680
um human level intelligence so my my
 

11773
03:20:29,680 --> 03:20:31,910
um human level intelligence so my my
best body in robots is also junk because

11774
03:20:31,910 --> 03:20:31,920
best body in robots is also junk because
 

11775
03:20:31,920 --> 03:20:33,269
best body in robots is also junk because
the history of computer science and

11776
03:20:33,269 --> 03:20:33,279
the history of computer science and
 

11777
03:20:33,279 --> 03:20:35,590
the history of computer science and
chunkiness so far seems to be my rough

11778
03:20:35,590 --> 03:20:35,600
chunkiness so far seems to be my rough
 

11779
03:20:35,600 --> 03:20:37,670
chunkiness so far seems to be my rough
best guess for the chunkiness of agi

11780
03:20:37,670 --> 03:20:37,680
best guess for the chunkiness of agi
 

11781
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:40,229
best guess for the chunkiness of agi
that is it is chunky it's modestly

11782
03:20:40,229 --> 03:20:40,239
that is it is chunky it's modestly
 

11783
03:20:40,239 --> 03:20:43,910
that is it is chunky it's modestly
chunky not that chunky right because

11784
03:20:43,910 --> 03:20:43,920
chunky not that chunky right because
 

11785
03:20:43,920 --> 03:20:45,750
chunky not that chunky right because
our ability chunky peanut butter too

11786
03:20:45,750 --> 03:20:45,760
our ability chunky peanut butter too
 

11787
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:47,110
our ability chunky peanut butter too
many things in the economy has been

11788
03:20:47,110 --> 03:20:47,120
many things in the economy has been
 

11789
03:20:47,120 --> 03:20:49,190
many things in the economy has been
moving relatively steadily overall in

11790
03:20:49,190 --> 03:20:49,200
moving relatively steadily overall in
 

11791
03:20:49,200 --> 03:20:52,469
moving relatively steadily overall in
terms of our use of computers in society

11792
03:20:52,469 --> 03:20:52,479
terms of our use of computers in society
 

11793
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:53,910
terms of our use of computers in society
they have been relatively steadily

11794
03:20:53,910 --> 03:20:53,920
they have been relatively steadily
 

11795
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:56,229
they have been relatively steadily
improving for 70 years no but i would

11796
03:20:56,229 --> 03:20:56,239
improving for 70 years no but i would
 

11797
03:20:56,239 --> 03:20:58,710
improving for 70 years no but i would
say that's hard well yeah okay

11798
03:20:58,710 --> 03:20:58,720
say that's hard well yeah okay
 

11799
03:20:58,720 --> 03:21:00,150
say that's hard well yeah okay
okay i would have to really think about

11800
03:21:00,150 --> 03:21:00,160
okay i would have to really think about
 

11801
03:21:00,160 --> 03:21:02,229
okay i would have to really think about
that because uh neural networks are

11802
03:21:02,229 --> 03:21:02,239
that because uh neural networks are
 

11803
03:21:02,239 --> 03:21:03,910
that because uh neural networks are
quite surprising

11804
03:21:03,910 --> 03:21:03,920
quite surprising
 

11805
03:21:03,920 --> 03:21:05,190
quite surprising
sure but every once in a while we have a

11806
03:21:05,190 --> 03:21:05,200
sure but every once in a while we have a
 

11807
03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:06,790
sure but every once in a while we have a
new thing that's surprising but if you

11808
03:21:06,790 --> 03:21:06,800
new thing that's surprising but if you
 

11809
03:21:06,800 --> 03:21:08,389
new thing that's surprising but if you
stand back you know we see something

11810
03:21:08,389 --> 03:21:08,399
stand back you know we see something
 

11811
03:21:08,399 --> 03:21:10,550
stand back you know we see something
like that every 10 10 years or so some

11812
03:21:10,550 --> 03:21:10,560
like that every 10 10 years or so some
 

11813
03:21:10,560 --> 03:21:12,950
like that every 10 10 years or so some
new innovation is gradual that has a big

11814
03:21:12,950 --> 03:21:12,960
new innovation is gradual that has a big
 

11815
03:21:12,960 --> 03:21:15,190
new innovation is gradual that has a big
effect

11816
03:21:15,190 --> 03:21:15,200
effect
 

11817
03:21:15,200 --> 03:21:17,990
effect
so moderately chunky

11818
03:21:17,990 --> 03:21:18,000
so moderately chunky
 

11819
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:19,269
so moderately chunky
huh

11820
03:21:19,269 --> 03:21:19,279
huh
 

11821
03:21:19,279 --> 03:21:20,870
huh
yeah the history of the level of

11822
03:21:20,870 --> 03:21:20,880
yeah the history of the level of
 

11823
03:21:20,880 --> 03:21:22,229
yeah the history of the level of
disruption we've seen in the past would

11824
03:21:22,229 --> 03:21:22,239
disruption we've seen in the past would
 

11825
03:21:22,239 --> 03:21:23,590
disruption we've seen in the past would
be a rough estimate of the level of

11826
03:21:23,590 --> 03:21:23,600
be a rough estimate of the level of
 

11827
03:21:23,600 --> 03:21:25,030
be a rough estimate of the level of
disruption in the future unless the

11828
03:21:25,030 --> 03:21:25,040
disruption in the future unless the
 

11829
03:21:25,040 --> 03:21:26,790
disruption in the future unless the
future is we're going to hit a chunky

11830
03:21:26,790 --> 03:21:26,800
future is we're going to hit a chunky
 

11831
03:21:26,800 --> 03:21:28,550
future is we're going to hit a chunky
territory much chunkier than we've seen

11832
03:21:28,550 --> 03:21:28,560
territory much chunkier than we've seen
 

11833
03:21:28,560 --> 03:21:31,910
territory much chunkier than we've seen
in the past well i do think there's um

11834
03:21:31,910 --> 03:21:31,920
in the past well i do think there's um
 

11835
03:21:31,920 --> 03:21:34,870
in the past well i do think there's um
it's like um like kunyan like revolution

11836
03:21:34,870 --> 03:21:34,880
it's like um like kunyan like revolution
 

11837
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:35,830
it's like um like kunyan like revolution
type

11838
03:21:35,830 --> 03:21:35,840
type
 

11839
03:21:35,840 --> 03:21:39,190
type
it it seems like the data especially on

11840
03:21:39,190 --> 03:21:39,200
it it seems like the data especially on
 

11841
03:21:39,200 --> 03:21:40,150
it it seems like the data especially on
ai's

11842
03:21:40,150 --> 03:21:40,160
ai's
 

11843
03:21:40,160 --> 03:21:44,710
ai's
is is difficult to um

11844
03:21:44,710 --> 03:21:44,720

 

11845
03:21:44,720 --> 03:21:46,550

uh to reason with because it's so recent

11846
03:21:46,550 --> 03:21:46,560
uh to reason with because it's so recent
 

11847
03:21:46,560 --> 03:21:49,030
uh to reason with because it's so recent
it's such a recent field right it's been

11848
03:21:49,030 --> 03:21:49,040
it's such a recent field right it's been
 

11849
03:21:49,040 --> 03:21:50,550
it's such a recent field right it's been
around for 50 years

11850
03:21:50,550 --> 03:21:50,560
around for 50 years
 

11851
03:21:50,560 --> 03:21:53,670
around for 50 years
i mean 50 60 70 80 years being recent

11852
03:21:53,670 --> 03:21:53,680
i mean 50 60 70 80 years being recent
 

11853
03:21:53,680 --> 03:21:56,070
i mean 50 60 70 80 years being recent
okay that's the that's

11854
03:21:56,070 --> 03:21:56,080
okay that's the that's
 

11855
03:21:56,080 --> 03:21:58,710
okay that's the that's
it's enough time to see a lot of trends

11856
03:21:58,710 --> 03:21:58,720
it's enough time to see a lot of trends
 

11857
03:21:58,720 --> 03:22:01,750
it's enough time to see a lot of trends
a lot a few trends a few trends i think

11858
03:22:01,750 --> 03:22:01,760
a lot a few trends a few trends i think
 

11859
03:22:01,760 --> 03:22:03,269
a lot a few trends a few trends i think
the internet

11860
03:22:03,269 --> 03:22:03,279
the internet
 

11861
03:22:03,279 --> 03:22:04,630
the internet
computing

11862
03:22:04,630 --> 03:22:04,640
computing
 

11863
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:06,630
computing
there's really a lot of interesting

11864
03:22:06,630 --> 03:22:06,640
there's really a lot of interesting
 

11865
03:22:06,640 --> 03:22:08,229
there's really a lot of interesting
stuff that's happened over the past 30

11866
03:22:08,229 --> 03:22:08,239
stuff that's happened over the past 30
 

11867
03:22:08,239 --> 03:22:09,269
stuff that's happened over the past 30
years

11868
03:22:09,269 --> 03:22:09,279
years
 

11869
03:22:09,279 --> 03:22:10,710
years
that

11870
03:22:10,710 --> 03:22:10,720
that
 

11871
03:22:10,720 --> 03:22:13,750
that
i think the possibility of revolutions

11872
03:22:13,750 --> 03:22:13,760
i think the possibility of revolutions
 

11873
03:22:13,760 --> 03:22:16,070
i think the possibility of revolutions
is likelier than it was

11874
03:22:16,070 --> 03:22:16,080
is likelier than it was
 

11875
03:22:16,080 --> 03:22:17,910
is likelier than it was
in the i think for the last 70 years

11876
03:22:17,910 --> 03:22:17,920
in the i think for the last 70 years
 

11877
03:22:17,920 --> 03:22:19,429
in the i think for the last 70 years
there have always been a lot of things

11878
03:22:19,429 --> 03:22:19,439
there have always been a lot of things
 

11879
03:22:19,439 --> 03:22:20,710
there have always been a lot of things
that look like they had a potential for

11880
03:22:20,710 --> 03:22:20,720
that look like they had a potential for
 

11881
03:22:20,720 --> 03:22:22,710
that look like they had a potential for
evolution so we can't reason well about

11882
03:22:22,710 --> 03:22:22,720
evolution so we can't reason well about
 

11883
03:22:22,720 --> 03:22:24,950
evolution so we can't reason well about
this i mean we can reason well by

11884
03:22:24,950 --> 03:22:24,960
this i mean we can reason well by
 

11885
03:22:24,960 --> 03:22:26,630
this i mean we can reason well by
looking at the past trends i would say

11886
03:22:26,630 --> 03:22:26,640
looking at the past trends i would say
 

11887
03:22:26,640 --> 03:22:28,070
looking at the past trends i would say
the past trend is roughly your best

11888
03:22:28,070 --> 03:22:28,080
the past trend is roughly your best
 

11889
03:22:28,080 --> 03:22:30,950
the past trend is roughly your best
guess for the future features but if i

11890
03:22:30,950 --> 03:22:30,960
guess for the future features but if i
 

11891
03:22:30,960 --> 03:22:32,790
guess for the future features but if i
look back at the things that might have

11892
03:22:32,790 --> 03:22:32,800
look back at the things that might have
 

11893
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:34,389
look back at the things that might have
looked like revolutions in the 70s and

11894
03:22:34,389 --> 03:22:34,399
looked like revolutions in the 70s and
 

11895
03:22:34,399 --> 03:22:36,070
looked like revolutions in the 70s and
80s and 90s

11896
03:22:36,070 --> 03:22:36,080
80s and 90s
 

11897
03:22:36,080 --> 03:22:37,349
80s and 90s
uh

11898
03:22:37,349 --> 03:22:37,359
uh
 

11899
03:22:37,359 --> 03:22:40,229
uh
they are less like the revolutions of

11900
03:22:40,229 --> 03:22:40,239
they are less like the revolutions of
 

11901
03:22:40,239 --> 03:22:42,790
they are less like the revolutions of
that appear to be happening now or the

11902
03:22:42,790 --> 03:22:42,800
that appear to be happening now or the
 

11903
03:22:42,800 --> 03:22:44,550
that appear to be happening now or the
capacity of revolution that appear to be

11904
03:22:44,550 --> 03:22:44,560
capacity of revolution that appear to be
 

11905
03:22:44,560 --> 03:22:46,870
capacity of revolution that appear to be
there now first of all there's a lot of

11906
03:22:46,870 --> 03:22:46,880
there now first of all there's a lot of
 

11907
03:22:46,880 --> 03:22:48,710
there now first of all there's a lot of
more money to be made

11908
03:22:48,710 --> 03:22:48,720
more money to be made
 

11909
03:22:48,720 --> 03:22:50,150
more money to be made
so there's a lot more incentive for

11910
03:22:50,150 --> 03:22:50,160
so there's a lot more incentive for
 

11911
03:22:50,160 --> 03:22:51,750
so there's a lot more incentive for
markets to do a lot of kind of

11912
03:22:51,750 --> 03:22:51,760
markets to do a lot of kind of
 

11913
03:22:51,760 --> 03:22:54,630
markets to do a lot of kind of
innovation it seems like in the ai space

11914
03:22:54,630 --> 03:22:54,640
innovation it seems like in the ai space
 

11915
03:22:54,640 --> 03:22:55,429
innovation it seems like in the ai space
but

11916
03:22:55,429 --> 03:22:55,439
but
 

11917
03:22:55,439 --> 03:22:57,030
but
then again there's a history of winters

11918
03:22:57,030 --> 03:22:57,040
then again there's a history of winters
 

11919
03:22:57,040 --> 03:22:59,349
then again there's a history of winters
and summers and so on so maybe we're

11920
03:22:59,349 --> 03:22:59,359
and summers and so on so maybe we're
 

11921
03:22:59,359 --> 03:23:01,030
and summers and so on so maybe we're
just like riding a nice wave right now

11922
03:23:01,030 --> 03:23:01,040
just like riding a nice wave right now
 

11923
03:23:01,040 --> 03:23:02,710
just like riding a nice wave right now
one of the biggest issues is the

11924
03:23:02,710 --> 03:23:02,720
one of the biggest issues is the
 

11925
03:23:02,720 --> 03:23:04,630
one of the biggest issues is the
difference between impressive demos and

11926
03:23:04,630 --> 03:23:04,640
difference between impressive demos and
 

11927
03:23:04,640 --> 03:23:07,510
difference between impressive demos and
commercial value yes so we often through

11928
03:23:07,510 --> 03:23:07,520
commercial value yes so we often through
 

11929
03:23:07,520 --> 03:23:09,269
commercial value yes so we often through
the history of ai we saw very impressive

11930
03:23:09,269 --> 03:23:09,279
the history of ai we saw very impressive
 

11931
03:23:09,279 --> 03:23:11,750
the history of ai we saw very impressive
demos that never really translated much

11932
03:23:11,750 --> 03:23:11,760
demos that never really translated much
 

11933
03:23:11,760 --> 03:23:13,590
demos that never really translated much
into commercial values somebody who

11934
03:23:13,590 --> 03:23:13,600
into commercial values somebody who
 

11935
03:23:13,600 --> 03:23:15,429
into commercial values somebody who
works on and cares about autonomous and

11936
03:23:15,429 --> 03:23:15,439
works on and cares about autonomous and
 

11937
03:23:15,439 --> 03:23:17,670
works on and cares about autonomous and
semi-autonomous vehicles tell me about

11938
03:23:17,670 --> 03:23:17,680
semi-autonomous vehicles tell me about
 

11939
03:23:17,680 --> 03:23:19,110
semi-autonomous vehicles tell me about
it uh so

11940
03:23:19,110 --> 03:23:19,120
it uh so
 

11941
03:23:19,120 --> 03:23:21,269
it uh so
and there again we return to the number

11942
03:23:21,269 --> 03:23:21,279
and there again we return to the number
 

11943
03:23:21,279 --> 03:23:23,510
and there again we return to the number
of elon musk's per earth

11944
03:23:23,510 --> 03:23:23,520
of elon musk's per earth
 

11945
03:23:23,520 --> 03:23:25,990
of elon musk's per earth
per year yeah generated

11946
03:23:25,990 --> 03:23:26,000
per year yeah generated
 

11947
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:26,870
per year yeah generated
uh

11948
03:23:26,870 --> 03:23:26,880
uh
 

11949
03:23:26,880 --> 03:23:28,950
uh
that's the um coincidentally same

11950
03:23:28,950 --> 03:23:28,960
that's the um coincidentally same
 

11951
03:23:28,960 --> 03:23:31,670
that's the um coincidentally same
initials as the m uh yeah uh very

11952
03:23:31,670 --> 03:23:31,680
initials as the m uh yeah uh very
 

11953
03:23:31,680 --> 03:23:33,429
initials as the m uh yeah uh very
suspicious very suspicious we're gonna

11954
03:23:33,429 --> 03:23:33,439
suspicious very suspicious we're gonna
 

11955
03:23:33,439 --> 03:23:35,990
suspicious very suspicious we're gonna
have to look into that all right two

11956
03:23:35,990 --> 03:23:36,000
have to look into that all right two
 

11957
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:37,830
have to look into that all right two
more fields

11958
03:23:37,830 --> 03:23:37,840
more fields
 

11959
03:23:37,840 --> 03:23:39,590
more fields
that i would like to force and twist

11960
03:23:39,590 --> 03:23:39,600
that i would like to force and twist
 

11961
03:23:39,600 --> 03:23:41,510
that i would like to force and twist
your arm to all right to look for view

11962
03:23:41,510 --> 03:23:41,520
your arm to all right to look for view
 

11963
03:23:41,520 --> 03:23:44,229
your arm to all right to look for view
quakes and for beautiful ideas economics

11964
03:23:44,229 --> 03:23:44,239
quakes and for beautiful ideas economics
 

11965
03:23:44,239 --> 03:23:46,950
quakes and for beautiful ideas economics
what is what what is a beautiful idea to

11966
03:23:46,950 --> 03:23:46,960
what is what what is a beautiful idea to
 

11967
03:23:46,960 --> 03:23:48,550
what is what what is a beautiful idea to
you

11968
03:23:48,550 --> 03:23:48,560
you
 

11969
03:23:48,560 --> 03:23:51,349
you
about economics

11970
03:23:51,349 --> 03:23:51,359
about economics
 

11971
03:23:51,359 --> 03:23:53,990
about economics
you you mentioned a lot of them sure uh

11972
03:23:53,990 --> 03:23:54,000
you you mentioned a lot of them sure uh
 

11973
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:54,870
you you mentioned a lot of them sure uh
so

11974
03:23:54,870 --> 03:23:54,880
so
 

11975
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:56,389
so
as you said before there's going to be

11976
03:23:56,389 --> 03:23:56,399
as you said before there's going to be
 

11977
03:23:56,399 --> 03:23:58,070
as you said before there's going to be
the first view cake most people

11978
03:23:58,070 --> 03:23:58,080
the first view cake most people
 

11979
03:23:58,080 --> 03:23:59,429
the first view cake most people
encounter that makes the biggest

11980
03:23:59,429 --> 03:23:59,439
encounter that makes the biggest
 

11981
03:23:59,439 --> 03:24:00,870
encounter that makes the biggest
difference on average in the world

11982
03:24:00,870 --> 03:24:00,880
difference on average in the world
 

11983
03:24:00,880 --> 03:24:02,630
difference on average in the world
because that's the only thing most

11984
03:24:02,630 --> 03:24:02,640
because that's the only thing most
 

11985
03:24:02,640 --> 03:24:04,950
because that's the only thing most
people ever see is the first one

11986
03:24:04,950 --> 03:24:04,960
people ever see is the first one
 

11987
03:24:04,960 --> 03:24:06,070
people ever see is the first one
and so

11988
03:24:06,070 --> 03:24:06,080
and so
 

11989
03:24:06,080 --> 03:24:08,550
and so
you know with ai the first one is just

11990
03:24:08,550 --> 03:24:08,560
you know with ai the first one is just
 

11991
03:24:08,560 --> 03:24:11,110
you know with ai the first one is just
how big the problem is and but once you

11992
03:24:11,110 --> 03:24:11,120
how big the problem is and but once you
 

11993
03:24:11,120 --> 03:24:12,229
how big the problem is and but once you
get past that you'll find others

11994
03:24:12,229 --> 03:24:12,239
get past that you'll find others
 

11995
03:24:12,239 --> 03:24:14,950
get past that you'll find others
certainly for economics the first one is

11996
03:24:14,950 --> 03:24:14,960
certainly for economics the first one is
 

11997
03:24:14,960 --> 03:24:15,990
certainly for economics the first one is
just

11998
03:24:15,990 --> 03:24:16,000
just
 

11999
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,070
just
the power of markets

12000
03:24:18,070 --> 03:24:18,080
the power of markets
 

12001
03:24:18,080 --> 03:24:18,870
the power of markets
um

12002
03:24:18,870 --> 03:24:18,880
um
 

12003
03:24:18,880 --> 03:24:19,990
um
you know you might have thought it's

12004
03:24:19,990 --> 03:24:20,000
you know you might have thought it's
 

12005
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:21,910
you know you might have thought it's
just really hard to figure out how to to

12006
03:24:21,910 --> 03:24:21,920
just really hard to figure out how to to
 

12007
03:24:21,920 --> 03:24:24,630
just really hard to figure out how to to
optimize in a big complicated space and

12008
03:24:24,630 --> 03:24:24,640
optimize in a big complicated space and
 

12009
03:24:24,640 --> 03:24:27,510
optimize in a big complicated space and
markets just do a good first pass

12010
03:24:27,510 --> 03:24:27,520
markets just do a good first pass
 

12011
03:24:27,520 --> 03:24:29,429
markets just do a good first pass
for an awful lot of stuff and they are

12012
03:24:29,429 --> 03:24:29,439
for an awful lot of stuff and they are
 

12013
03:24:29,439 --> 03:24:31,349
for an awful lot of stuff and they are
really quite robust and powerful

12014
03:24:31,349 --> 03:24:31,359
really quite robust and powerful
 

12015
03:24:31,359 --> 03:24:32,950
really quite robust and powerful
and uh

12016
03:24:32,950 --> 03:24:32,960
and uh
 

12017
03:24:32,960 --> 03:24:34,950
and uh
that's just quite the view craig

12018
03:24:34,950 --> 03:24:34,960
that's just quite the view craig
 

12019
03:24:34,960 --> 03:24:37,510
that's just quite the view craig
where you just say you know just let up

12020
03:24:37,510 --> 03:24:37,520
where you just say you know just let up
 

12021
03:24:37,520 --> 03:24:38,550
where you just say you know just let up
if you if you want to get in the

12022
03:24:38,550 --> 03:24:38,560
if you if you want to get in the
 

12023
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:41,429
if you if you want to get in the
ballpark just let a market handle it and

12024
03:24:41,429 --> 03:24:41,439
ballpark just let a market handle it and
 

12025
03:24:41,439 --> 03:24:42,950
ballpark just let a market handle it and
step back

12026
03:24:42,950 --> 03:24:42,960
step back
 

12027
03:24:42,960 --> 03:24:44,389
step back
and that's true for a wide range of

12028
03:24:44,389 --> 03:24:44,399
and that's true for a wide range of
 

12029
03:24:44,399 --> 03:24:45,750
and that's true for a wide range of
things it's not true for everything but

12030
03:24:45,750 --> 03:24:45,760
things it's not true for everything but
 

12031
03:24:45,760 --> 03:24:48,070
things it's not true for everything but
it's a it's a very good first

12032
03:24:48,070 --> 03:24:48,080
it's a it's a very good first
 

12033
03:24:48,080 --> 03:24:49,750
it's a it's a very good first
approximation most people's intuitions

12034
03:24:49,750 --> 03:24:49,760
approximation most people's intuitions
 

12035
03:24:49,760 --> 03:24:51,510
approximation most people's intuitions
for how they should limit markets are

12036
03:24:51,510 --> 03:24:51,520
for how they should limit markets are
 

12037
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:53,429
for how they should limit markets are
actually messing them up

12038
03:24:53,429 --> 03:24:53,439
actually messing them up
 

12039
03:24:53,439 --> 03:24:55,269
actually messing them up
they're that good in sense right most

12040
03:24:55,269 --> 03:24:55,279
they're that good in sense right most
 

12041
03:24:55,279 --> 03:24:56,630
they're that good in sense right most
people when you go i don't know if we

12042
03:24:56,630 --> 03:24:56,640
people when you go i don't know if we
 

12043
03:24:56,640 --> 03:24:57,990
people when you go i don't know if we
want to trust that well you should be

03:24:57,990 --> 03:24:58,000
want to trust that well you should be
 

12045

want to trust that well you should be
trusting that

12046
03:24:59,030 --> 03:24:59,040
trusting that
 

12047
03:24:59,040 --> 03:25:00,150
trusting that
what about

12048
03:25:00,150 --> 03:25:00,160
what about
 

12049
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:00,790
what about
wha

12050
03:25:00,790 --> 03:25:00,800
wha
 

12051
03:25:00,800 --> 03:25:02,469
wha
what are markets

12052
03:25:02,469 --> 03:25:02,479
what are markets
 

12053
03:25:02,479 --> 03:25:05,830
what are markets
like just a couple of words

12054
03:25:05,830 --> 03:25:05,840
like just a couple of words
 

12055
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:08,309
like just a couple of words
uh so so the idea is if if people want

12056
03:25:08,309 --> 03:25:08,319
uh so so the idea is if if people want
 

12057
03:25:08,319 --> 03:25:11,030
uh so so the idea is if if people want
something then let other companies form

12058
03:25:11,030 --> 03:25:11,040
something then let other companies form
 

12059
03:25:11,040 --> 03:25:12,870
something then let other companies form
to try to supply that thing let those

12060
03:25:12,870 --> 03:25:12,880
to try to supply that thing let those
 

12061
03:25:12,880 --> 03:25:14,870
to try to supply that thing let those
people pay for their cost of whatever

12062
03:25:14,870 --> 03:25:14,880
people pay for their cost of whatever
 

12063
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:16,389
people pay for their cost of whatever
they're making and try to offer that

12064
03:25:16,389 --> 03:25:16,399
they're making and try to offer that
 

12065
03:25:16,399 --> 03:25:18,790
they're making and try to offer that
product to those people that many people

12066
03:25:18,790 --> 03:25:18,800
product to those people that many people
 

12067
03:25:18,800 --> 03:25:21,269
product to those people that many people
many such firms enter that industry and

12068
03:25:21,269 --> 03:25:21,279
many such firms enter that industry and
 

12069
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:22,870
many such firms enter that industry and
let the customers decide which ones they

12070
03:25:22,870 --> 03:25:22,880
let the customers decide which ones they
 

12071
03:25:22,880 --> 03:25:24,309
let the customers decide which ones they
want and if the firm goes out of

12072
03:25:24,309 --> 03:25:24,319
want and if the firm goes out of
 

12073
03:25:24,319 --> 03:25:26,150
want and if the firm goes out of
business let it go bankrupt and let

12074
03:25:26,150 --> 03:25:26,160
business let it go bankrupt and let
 

12075
03:25:26,160 --> 03:25:27,590
business let it go bankrupt and let
other people invest in whichever

12076
03:25:27,590 --> 03:25:27,600
other people invest in whichever
 

12077
03:25:27,600 --> 03:25:29,190
other people invest in whichever
ventures they want to try to try to

12078
03:25:29,190 --> 03:25:29,200
ventures they want to try to try to
 

12079
03:25:29,200 --> 03:25:30,550
ventures they want to try to try to
attract customers to their version of

12080
03:25:30,550 --> 03:25:30,560
attract customers to their version of
 

12081
03:25:30,560 --> 03:25:31,670
attract customers to their version of
the product

12082
03:25:31,670 --> 03:25:31,680
the product
 

12083
03:25:31,680 --> 03:25:33,269
the product
and that just works for a wide range of

12084
03:25:33,269 --> 03:25:33,279
and that just works for a wide range of
 

12085
03:25:33,279 --> 03:25:34,950
and that just works for a wide range of
products and services and through all of

03:25:34,950 --> 03:25:34,960
products and services and through all of
 

12087
03:25:34,960 --> 03:25:36,309
products and services and through all of
this there's a free exchange of

this there's a free exchange of
 

12089
03:25:36,319 --> 03:25:37,750
this there's a free exchange of

there's a hope that there's no

learned in my research that's not all of

12120
03:26:07,349 --> 03:26:07,359
learned in my research that's not all of
 

12121
03:26:07,359 --> 03:26:09,190
learned in my research that's not all of
economics but something more specialized

12122
03:26:09,190 --> 03:26:09,200
economics but something more specialized
 

12123
03:26:09,200 --> 03:26:09,990
economics but something more specialized
is

12124
03:26:09,990 --> 03:26:10,000
is
 

12125
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:12,950
is
the rationality of disagreement that is

12126
03:26:12,950 --> 03:26:12,960
the rationality of disagreement that is
 

12127
03:26:12,960 --> 03:26:14,389
the rationality of disagreement that is
basically people who are trying to

12128
03:26:14,389 --> 03:26:14,399
basically people who are trying to
 

12129
03:26:14,399 --> 03:26:16,389
basically people who are trying to
believe what's true in a complicated

12130
03:26:16,389 --> 03:26:16,399
believe what's true in a complicated
 

12131
03:26:16,399 --> 03:26:17,510
believe what's true in a complicated
situation

12132
03:26:17,510 --> 03:26:17,520
situation
 

12133
03:26:17,520 --> 03:26:19,910
situation
would not actually disagree

12134
03:26:19,910 --> 03:26:19,920
would not actually disagree
 

12135
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:21,830
would not actually disagree
and of course humans disagree all the

12136
03:26:21,830 --> 03:26:21,840
and of course humans disagree all the
 

12137
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:23,750
and of course humans disagree all the
time so it was quite the striking fact

12138
03:26:23,750 --> 03:26:23,760
time so it was quite the striking fact
 

12139
03:26:23,760 --> 03:26:25,510
time so it was quite the striking fact
for me to learn in grad school that

12140
03:26:25,510 --> 03:26:25,520
for me to learn in grad school that
 

12141
03:26:25,520 --> 03:26:26,469
for me to learn in grad school that
actually

12142
03:26:26,469 --> 03:26:26,479
actually
 

12143
03:26:26,479 --> 03:26:27,990
actually
rational agents would not knowingly

12144
03:26:27,990 --> 03:26:28,000
rational agents would not knowingly
 

12145
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:29,910
rational agents would not knowingly
disagree

12146
03:26:29,910 --> 03:26:29,920
disagree
 

12147
03:26:29,920 --> 03:26:31,590
disagree
and so that makes disagreement more

12148
03:26:31,590 --> 03:26:31,600
and so that makes disagreement more
 

12149
03:26:31,600 --> 03:26:34,070
and so that makes disagreement more
puzzling and and it makes you less

12150
03:26:34,070 --> 03:26:34,080
puzzling and and it makes you less
 

12151
03:26:34,080 --> 03:26:37,510
puzzling and and it makes you less
willing to disagree

12152
03:26:37,510 --> 03:26:37,520

 

12153
03:26:37,520 --> 03:26:40,630

humans are to some degree rational and

12154
03:26:40,630 --> 03:26:40,640
humans are to some degree rational and
 

12155
03:26:40,640 --> 03:26:42,389
humans are to some degree rational and
are able to

their priorities
 

12159
03:26:43,840 --> 03:26:45,510
their priorities
are different than just figuring out the

that's another tangent that could take

that's the wrong thing so that's what

that's the wrong thing so that's what
 

12193
03:27:21,279 --> 03:27:22,710
that's the wrong thing so that's what
goes wrong that is when you say what's

goes wrong that is when you say what's

failures it's that people are ignorant

failures it's that people are ignorant

there's a
 

12211
03:27:40,479 --> 03:27:43,030
there's a
inability to arrive at a consensus

12212
03:27:43,030 --> 03:27:43,040
inability to arrive at a consensus
 

12213
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:45,750
inability to arrive at a consensus
so most political systems if everybody

12214
03:27:45,750 --> 03:27:45,760
so most political systems if everybody
 

12215
03:27:45,760 --> 03:27:47,110
so most political systems if everybody
looked to some authority say on a

12216
03:27:47,110 --> 03:27:47,120
looked to some authority say on a
 

12217
03:27:47,120 --> 03:27:48,630
looked to some authority say on a
question and that authority told them

12218
03:27:48,630 --> 03:27:48,640
question and that authority told them
 

12219
03:27:48,640 --> 03:27:50,309
question and that authority told them
the answer then most political systems

12220
03:27:50,309 --> 03:27:50,319
the answer then most political systems
 

12221
03:27:50,319 --> 03:27:54,229
the answer then most political systems
are capable of just doing that thing

12222
03:27:54,229 --> 03:27:54,239

 

12223
03:27:54,239 --> 03:27:55,190

but

12224
03:27:55,190 --> 03:27:55,200
but
 

12225
03:27:55,200 --> 03:27:57,830
but
that is uh and so it's the failure to

12226
03:27:57,830 --> 03:27:57,840
that is uh and so it's the failure to
 

12227
03:27:57,840 --> 03:27:59,750
that is uh and so it's the failure to
have trust for the authorities

12228
03:27:59,750 --> 03:27:59,760
have trust for the authorities
 

12229
03:27:59,760 --> 03:28:01,510
have trust for the authorities
yeah that is sort of the

12230
03:28:01,510 --> 03:28:01,520
yeah that is sort of the
 

12231
03:28:01,520 --> 03:28:03,910
yeah that is sort of the
underlying failure behind most political

12232
03:28:03,910 --> 03:28:03,920
underlying failure behind most political
 

12233
03:28:03,920 --> 03:28:06,389
underlying failure behind most political
failure we failed we have bad we invade

12234
03:28:06,389 --> 03:28:06,399
failure we failed we have bad we invade
 

12235
03:28:06,399 --> 03:28:08,469
failure we failed we have bad we invade
iraq say when we don't have an authority

12236
03:28:08,469 --> 03:28:08,479
iraq say when we don't have an authority
 

12237
03:28:08,479 --> 03:28:09,910
iraq say when we don't have an authority
to tell us that's a really stupid thing

12238
03:28:09,910 --> 03:28:09,920
to tell us that's a really stupid thing
 

12239
03:28:09,920 --> 03:28:11,510
to tell us that's a really stupid thing
to do

12240
03:28:11,510 --> 03:28:11,520
to do
 

12241
03:28:11,520 --> 03:28:15,830
to do
it's it's and it is possible to create

12242
03:28:15,830 --> 03:28:15,840
it's it's and it is possible to create
 

12243
03:28:15,840 --> 03:28:17,190
it's it's and it is possible to create
more informative trust for the

12244
03:28:17,190 --> 03:28:17,200
more informative trust for the
 

12245
03:28:17,200 --> 03:28:18,870
more informative trust for the
authorities that that's a remarkable

12246
03:28:18,870 --> 03:28:18,880
authorities that that's a remarkable
 

12247
03:28:18,880 --> 03:28:21,269
authorities that that's a remarkable
fact about the world of

12248
03:28:21,269 --> 03:28:21,279
fact about the world of
 

12249
03:28:21,279 --> 03:28:23,190
fact about the world of
institutions that we could do that but

12250
03:28:23,190 --> 03:28:23,200
institutions that we could do that but
 

12251
03:28:23,200 --> 03:28:24,630
institutions that we could do that but
we aren't

12252
03:28:24,630 --> 03:28:24,640
we aren't
 

12253
03:28:24,640 --> 03:28:27,110
we aren't
yeah that's that's surprising we could

12254
03:28:27,110 --> 03:28:27,120
yeah that's that's surprising we could
 

12255
03:28:27,120 --> 03:28:29,030
yeah that's that's surprising we could
and we aren't right and another big view

12256
03:28:29,030 --> 03:28:29,040
and we aren't right and another big view
 

12257
03:28:29,040 --> 03:28:30,950
and we aren't right and another big view
crick about politics is from the elf in

12258
03:28:30,950 --> 03:28:30,960
crick about politics is from the elf in
 

12259
03:28:30,960 --> 03:28:32,229
crick about politics is from the elf in
the brain that most people when they're

12260
03:28:32,229 --> 03:28:32,239
the brain that most people when they're
 

12261
03:28:32,239 --> 03:28:33,830
the brain that most people when they're
interacting with politics they say they

12262
03:28:33,830 --> 03:28:33,840
interacting with politics they say they
 

12263
03:28:33,840 --> 03:28:35,830
interacting with politics they say they
want to like make the world better and

12264
03:28:35,830 --> 03:28:35,840
want to like make the world better and
 

12265
03:28:35,840 --> 03:28:37,030
want to like make the world better and
make their city better their country

12266
03:28:37,030 --> 03:28:37,040
make their city better their country
 

12267
03:28:37,040 --> 03:28:39,190
make their city better their country
better that's not their priority

12268
03:28:39,190 --> 03:28:39,200
better that's not their priority
 

12269
03:28:39,200 --> 03:28:40,870
better that's not their priority
what is it so they they want to show

12270
03:28:40,870 --> 03:28:40,880
what is it so they they want to show
 

12271
03:28:40,880 --> 03:28:42,870
what is it so they they want to show
loyalty to their allies they want to

12272
03:28:42,870 --> 03:28:42,880
loyalty to their allies they want to

yes

12276
03:28:45,349 --> 03:28:45,359
yes
 

12277
03:28:45,359 --> 03:28:46,790
yes
their various tribes are in that that's

12278
03:28:46,790 --> 03:28:46,800
their various tribes are in that that's
 

12279
03:28:46,800 --> 03:28:49,030
their various tribes are in that that's
that's their primary primary

that's their primary primary
 

12281
03:28:49,040 --> 03:28:51,349
that's their primary primary

03:28:51,349 --> 03:28:51,359
priority and they do accomplish that
 

12283
03:28:51,359 --> 03:28:52,950

yeah and the tribes are usually

12284
03:28:52,950 --> 03:28:52,960
yeah and the tribes are usually
 

12285
03:28:52,960 --> 03:28:55,830
yeah and the tribes are usually
color-coded conveniently enough

um

12288
03:28:57,510 --> 03:28:57,520
um
 

12289
03:28:57,520 --> 03:28:58,870
um
what would you say

12290
03:28:58,870 --> 03:28:58,880
what would you say
 

12291
03:28:58,880 --> 03:29:01,510
what would you say
you know it's the churchill question uh

12292
03:29:01,510 --> 03:29:01,520
you know it's the churchill question uh
 

12293
03:29:01,520 --> 03:29:03,750
you know it's the churchill question uh
democracy is the the crappiest form of

03:29:03,750 --> 03:29:03,760
democracy is the the crappiest form of
 

12295
03:29:03,760 --> 03:29:06,070
democracy is the the crappiest form of
government but it's the best one we got

12296
03:29:06,070 --> 03:29:06,080
government but it's the best one we got
 

12297
03:29:06,080 --> 03:29:08,229
government but it's the best one we got
um what's the best form of government

12298
03:29:08,229 --> 03:29:08,239
um what's the best form of government
 

12299
03:29:08,239 --> 03:29:09,269
um what's the best form of government
for this

12300
03:29:09,269 --> 03:29:09,279
for this
 

12301
03:29:09,279 --> 03:29:10,229
for this
our

12302
03:29:10,229 --> 03:29:10,239
our

03:29:13,760 --> 03:29:16,150
seven billion human civilization and the
maybe as we get farther and farther you

12306
03:29:16,150 --> 03:29:16,160
maybe as we get farther and farther you
 

12307
03:29:16,160 --> 03:29:17,590
maybe as we get farther and farther you
mentioned a lot of stuff that's

12308
03:29:17,590 --> 03:29:17,600
mentioned a lot of stuff that's
 

12309
03:29:17,600 --> 03:29:19,429
mentioned a lot of stuff that's
fascinating about human history as we

12310
03:29:19,429 --> 03:29:19,439
fascinating about human history as we
 

12311
03:29:19,439 --> 03:29:21,670
fascinating about human history as we
become more forager-like

12312
03:29:21,670 --> 03:29:21,680
become more forager-like
 

12313
03:29:21,680 --> 03:29:24,150
become more forager-like
and looking out beyond what's the best

12314
03:29:24,150 --> 03:29:24,160
and looking out beyond what's the best
 

12315
03:29:24,160 --> 03:29:25,830
and looking out beyond what's the best
form of government in the next 50

12316
03:29:25,830 --> 03:29:25,840
form of government in the next 50
 

12317
03:29:25,840 --> 03:29:27,750
form of government in the next 50
hundred years as we become a multiple

12318
03:29:27,750 --> 03:29:27,760
hundred years as we become a multiple
 

12319
03:29:27,760 --> 03:29:29,590
hundred years as we become a multiple
terrorist species so

12320
03:29:29,590 --> 03:29:29,600
terrorist species so
 

12321
03:29:29,600 --> 03:29:32,389
terrorist species so
the the key failing is that

12322
03:29:32,389 --> 03:29:32,399
the the key failing is that
 

12323
03:29:32,399 --> 03:29:34,870
the the key failing is that
we have existing political institutions

12324
03:29:34,870 --> 03:29:34,880
we have existing political institutions
 

12325
03:29:34,880 --> 03:29:36,870
we have existing political institutions
and related institutions like in media

12326
03:29:36,870 --> 03:29:36,880
and related institutions like in media
 

12327
03:29:36,880 --> 03:29:38,389

institutions and
 

12331
03:29:40,399 --> 03:29:42,469
institutions and
these institutions sit in a vast space

12332
03:29:42,469 --> 03:29:42,479
these institutions sit in a vast space
 

12333
03:29:42,479 --> 03:29:44,550
these institutions sit in a vast space
of possible institutions yes and the key

12334
03:29:44,550 --> 03:29:44,560
of possible institutions yes and the key
 

12335
03:29:44,560 --> 03:29:46,070
of possible institutions yes and the key
failing we're just not exploring that

12336
03:29:46,070 --> 03:29:46,080
failing we're just not exploring that
 

12337
03:29:46,080 --> 03:29:47,510
failing we're just not exploring that
space

12338
03:29:47,510 --> 03:29:47,520
space
 

12339
03:29:47,520 --> 03:29:50,070
space
so i have made my proposals in that

12340
03:29:50,070 --> 03:29:50,080
so i have made my proposals in that
 

12341
03:29:50,080 --> 03:29:51,910
so i have made my proposals in that
space and i think i can identify many

12342
03:29:51,910 --> 03:29:51,920
space and i think i can identify many
 

12343
03:29:51,920 --> 03:29:53,990
space and i think i can identify many
promising solutions and many other

12344
03:29:53,990 --> 03:29:54,000
promising solutions and many other
 

12345
03:29:54,000 --> 03:29:55,510
promising solutions and many other
people have made many other promising

people have made many other promising
 

12347
03:29:55,520 --> 03:29:57,429
people have made many other promising
proposals in that space but the key

12348
03:29:57,429 --> 03:29:57,439
proposals in that space but the key
 

12349
03:29:57,439 --> 03:29:59,030
proposals in that space but the key
thing is we're just not pursuing those

12350
03:29:59,030 --> 03:29:59,040
thing is we're just not pursuing those
 

12351
03:29:59,040 --> 03:30:00,630
thing is we're just not pursuing those
proposals we're not trying them out on

12352
03:30:00,630 --> 03:30:00,640
proposals we're not trying them out on
 

12353
03:30:00,640 --> 03:30:02,150
proposals we're not trying them out on
small scales we're not doing tests we're

12354
03:30:02,150 --> 03:30:02,160
small scales we're not doing tests we're
 

12355
03:30:02,160 --> 03:30:03,510
small scales we're not doing tests we're
not

12356
03:30:03,510 --> 03:30:03,520
not
 

12357
03:30:03,520 --> 03:30:05,750
not
exploring the space of these options

12358
03:30:05,750 --> 03:30:05,760
exploring the space of these options
 

12359
03:30:05,760 --> 03:30:07,349
exploring the space of these options
that is the key thing we're failing to

12360
03:30:07,349 --> 03:30:07,359
that is the key thing we're failing to
 

12361
03:30:07,359 --> 03:30:09,830
that is the key thing we're failing to
do and if we did that

12362
03:30:09,830 --> 03:30:09,840
do and if we did that
 

12363
03:30:09,840 --> 03:30:11,830
do and if we did that
i am confident we would find much better

12364
03:30:11,830 --> 03:30:11,840
i am confident we would find much better
 

12365
03:30:11,840 --> 03:30:13,750
i am confident we would find much better
institutions than when we're using now

12366
03:30:13,750 --> 03:30:13,760
institutions than when we're using now
 

12367
03:30:13,760 --> 03:30:17,269
institutions than when we're using now

they have put so much effort into the
 

12415
03:31:05,040 --> 03:31:07,510
they have put so much effort into the
surface that they've constructed yeah

12416

surface that they've constructed yeah
 

12417

surface that they've constructed yeah
and that's where they put all their

12418

and that's where they put all their
 

12419
03:31:08,720 --> 03:31:11,110
and that's where they put all their
energy like so somebody might be a a you

don't have another life behind the
scenes they put all their energy into

12436
03:31:23,269 --> 03:31:23,279
scenes they put all their energy into
 

12437
03:31:23,279 --> 03:31:25,510
scenes they put all their energy into
this into that surface the one we admire

12438
03:31:25,510 --> 03:31:25,520
this into that surface the one we admire
 

12439
03:31:25,520 --> 03:31:27,750
this into that surface the one we admire
the one we're fascinated by and they

12440
03:31:27,750 --> 03:31:27,760
the one we're fascinated by and they
 

12441
03:31:27,760 --> 03:31:29,269
the one we're fascinated by and they
kind of have to make up the stuff behind

12442
03:31:29,269 --> 03:31:29,279
kind of have to make up the stuff behind
 

12443
03:31:29,279 --> 03:31:31,830
kind of have to make up the stuff behind
the scenes to supply it for you but it's

12444
03:31:31,830 --> 03:31:31,840
the scenes to supply it for you but it's
 

12445
03:31:31,840 --> 03:31:33,510
the scenes to supply it for you but it's
not really there well there's several

12446
03:31:33,510 --> 03:31:33,520
not really there well there's several
 

12447
03:31:33,520 --> 03:31:35,030
not really there well there's several
ways of phrasing this so one of his

12448
03:31:35,030 --> 03:31:35,040
ways of phrasing this so one of his
 

12449
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:37,910
ways of phrasing this so one of his
authenticity which is um

12450
03:31:37,910 --> 03:31:37,920
authenticity which is um
 

12451
03:31:37,920 --> 03:31:38,630
authenticity which is um
the

12452
03:31:38,630 --> 03:31:38,640
the
 

12453
03:31:38,640 --> 03:31:41,429
the
if you become the thing you are on the

12454
03:31:41,429 --> 03:31:41,439
if you become the thing you are on the
 

12455
03:31:41,439 --> 03:31:42,870
if you become the thing you are on the
surface

12456
03:31:42,870 --> 03:31:42,880
surface
 

12457
03:31:42,880 --> 03:31:45,429
surface
if the depths mirror the surface

12458
03:31:45,429 --> 03:31:45,439
if the depths mirror the surface
 

12459
03:31:45,439 --> 03:31:47,510
if the depths mirror the surface
then that's what authenticity is you're

12460
03:31:47,510 --> 03:31:47,520
then that's what authenticity is you're
 

12461
03:31:47,520 --> 03:31:48,710
then that's what authenticity is you're
not hiding something you're not

12462
03:31:48,710 --> 03:31:48,720
not hiding something you're not
 

12463
03:31:48,720 --> 03:31:50,630
not hiding something you're not
concealing something to push back on the

12464
03:31:50,630 --> 03:31:50,640
concealing something to push back on the
 

12465
03:31:50,640 --> 03:31:53,750
concealing something to push back on the
idea of actors they actually have often

12466
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:53,760
idea of actors they actually have often
 

12467
03:31:53,760 --> 03:31:56,630
idea of actors they actually have often
a manufactured surface that they put on

12468
03:31:56,630 --> 03:31:56,640
a manufactured surface that they put on
 

12469
03:31:56,640 --> 03:31:58,790
a manufactured surface that they put on
and they try on different masks

12470
03:31:58,790 --> 03:31:58,800
and they try on different masks
 

12471
03:31:58,800 --> 03:32:01,030
and they try on different masks
and the depths are very different from

12472
03:32:01,030 --> 03:32:01,040
and the depths are very different from
 

12473
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:02,389
and the depths are very different from
the surface and that's actually what

12474
03:32:02,389 --> 03:32:02,399
the surface and that's actually what
 

12475
03:32:02,399 --> 03:32:03,830
the surface and that's actually what
makes them very not interesting to

12476
03:32:03,830 --> 03:32:03,840
makes them very not interesting to
 

12477
03:32:03,840 --> 03:32:07,110
makes them very not interesting to
interview if you are an actor who

12478
03:32:07,110 --> 03:32:07,120
interview if you are an actor who
 

12479
03:32:07,120 --> 03:32:08,790
interview if you are an actor who
actually

12480
03:32:08,790 --> 03:32:08,800
actually
 

12481
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:11,349
actually
lives the role that

12482
03:32:11,349 --> 03:32:11,359
lives the role that
 

12483
03:32:11,359 --> 03:32:12,550
lives the role that
you play

12484
03:32:12,550 --> 03:32:12,560
you play
 

12485
03:32:12,560 --> 03:32:13,990
you play
so like i don't know a clint eastwood

12486
03:32:13,990 --> 03:32:14,000
so like i don't know a clint eastwood
 

12487
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:16,469
so like i don't know a clint eastwood
type character who clearly represents

12488
03:32:16,469 --> 03:32:16,479
type character who clearly represents
 

12489
03:32:16,479 --> 03:32:18,550
type character who clearly represents
the the cowboy

12490
03:32:18,550 --> 03:32:18,560
the the cowboy
 

12491
03:32:18,560 --> 03:32:21,429
the the cowboy
like at least uh rhymes or echoes the

12492
03:32:21,429 --> 03:32:21,439
like at least uh rhymes or echoes the
 

12493
03:32:21,439 --> 03:32:23,670
like at least uh rhymes or echoes the
person you play on the surface that's

12494
03:32:23,670 --> 03:32:23,680
person you play on the surface that's
 

12495
03:32:23,680 --> 03:32:25,910
person you play on the surface that's
authentic some people are typecast and

12496
03:32:25,910 --> 03:32:25,920
authentic some people are typecast and
 

12497
03:32:25,920 --> 03:32:27,670
authentic some people are typecast and
they have basically one persona they

12498
03:32:27,670 --> 03:32:27,680
they have basically one persona they
 

12499
03:32:27,680 --> 03:32:29,590
they have basically one persona they
play in all of their movies and tv shows

12500
03:32:29,590 --> 03:32:29,600

and so those people it probably is the

12502
03:32:31,510 --> 03:32:31,520
and so those people it probably is the
 

12503
03:32:31,520 --> 03:32:34,229
and so those people it probably is the
actual person persona that they are yeah

03:35:37,830 --> 03:35:37,840
the prettiest pictures there you go and
 

12683
03:35:37,840 --> 03:35:39,510
the prettiest pictures there you go and
then depending on the field if it's

12684
03:35:39,510 --> 03:35:39,520
then depending on the field if it's
 

12685
03:35:39,520 --> 03:35:41,269
then depending on the field if it's
technical then doing the homework

12686
03:35:41,269 --> 03:35:41,279
technical then doing the homework
 

12687
03:35:41,279 --> 03:35:42,790
technical then doing the homework
problems at the end yeah it's actually

12688
03:35:42,790 --> 03:35:42,800
problems at the end yeah it's actually
 

12689
03:35:42,800 --> 03:35:44,790
problems at the end yeah it's actually
extremely extremely useful

12690
03:35:44,790 --> 03:35:44,800
extremely extremely useful
 

12691
03:35:44,800 --> 03:35:46,950
extremely extremely useful
extremely powerful way to understand

12692
03:35:46,950 --> 03:35:46,960
extremely powerful way to understand
 

12693
03:35:46,960 --> 03:35:49,110
extremely powerful way to understand
something if you allow it you know i

12694
03:35:49,110 --> 03:35:49,120
something if you allow it you know i
 

12695
03:35:49,120 --> 03:35:50,950
something if you allow it you know i
actually think of like high school and

12696
03:35:50,950 --> 03:35:50,960
actually think of like high school and
 

12697
03:35:50,960 --> 03:35:52,550
actually think of like high school and
college

12698
03:35:52,550 --> 03:35:52,560
college
 

12699
03:35:52,560 --> 03:35:54,630
college
which you you kind of remind me of

12700
03:35:54,630 --> 03:35:54,640
which you you kind of remind me of
 

12701
03:35:54,640 --> 03:35:56,229
which you you kind of remind me of
people don't often think of it that way

12702
03:35:56,229 --> 03:35:56,239
people don't often think of it that way
 

12703
03:35:56,239 --> 03:35:57,429
people don't often think of it that way
but

12704
03:35:57,429 --> 03:35:57,439
but
 

12705
03:35:57,439 --> 03:35:59,269
but
you'll almost

12706
03:35:59,269 --> 03:35:59,279
you'll almost
 

12707
03:35:59,279 --> 03:36:02,070
you'll almost
not again get an opportunity

12708
03:36:02,070 --> 03:36:02,080
not again get an opportunity
 

12709
03:36:02,080 --> 03:36:04,630
not again get an opportunity
to spend the time with the fundamental

12710
03:36:04,630 --> 03:36:04,640
to spend the time with the fundamental
 

12711
03:36:04,640 --> 03:36:06,630
to spend the time with the fundamental
stuff

12712
03:36:06,630 --> 03:36:06,640
stuff
 

12713
03:36:06,640 --> 03:36:08,550
stuff
and everybody's forcing you like

12714
03:36:08,550 --> 03:36:08,560
and everybody's forcing you like
 

12715
03:36:08,560 --> 03:36:11,110
and everybody's forcing you like
everybody wants you to do it

12716
03:36:11,110 --> 03:36:11,120
everybody wants you to do it
 

12717
03:36:11,120 --> 03:36:13,110
everybody wants you to do it
and like you'll never get that chance

12718
03:36:13,110 --> 03:36:13,120
and like you'll never get that chance
 

12719
03:36:13,120 --> 03:36:15,190
and like you'll never get that chance
again to sit there even though it's

12720
03:36:15,190 --> 03:36:15,200
again to sit there even though it's
 

12721
03:36:15,200 --> 03:36:17,110
again to sit there even though it's
outside of your interest biology like in

03:36:17,110 --> 03:36:17,120
outside of your interest biology like in
 

12723
03:36:17,120 --> 03:36:19,670
outside of your interest biology like in
high school i took ap biology ap

um
 

12729
03:36:22,640 --> 03:36:24,790
um
i'm thinking of subjects i never again

12730
03:36:24,790 --> 03:36:24,800
i'm thinking of subjects i never again
 

12731
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:27,990
i'm thinking of subjects i never again
really visited seriously and it was so

12732
03:36:27,990 --> 03:36:28,000
really visited seriously and it was so
 

12733
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:30,710
really visited seriously and it was so
nice to be forced into uh anatomy and

12734
03:36:30,710 --> 03:36:30,720
nice to be forced into uh anatomy and
 

12735
03:36:30,720 --> 03:36:32,070
nice to be forced into uh anatomy and
physiology

12736
03:36:32,070 --> 03:36:32,080
physiology
 

12737
03:36:32,080 --> 03:36:34,710
physiology
to be forced into that world to stay

12738
03:36:34,710 --> 03:36:34,720
to be forced into that world to stay
 

12739
03:36:34,720 --> 03:36:36,710

of like how cell works and all those

12746
03:36:43,910 --> 03:36:43,920
of like how cell works and all those
 

12747
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:45,910
of like how cell works and all those
kinds of things and you're somehow that

you know the usual human tradition that
 

12771
03:37:08,720 --> 03:37:10,229
you know the usual human tradition that
goes back you know hundreds of thousands

12772
03:37:10,229 --> 03:37:10,239
goes back you know hundreds of thousands
 

12773
03:37:10,239 --> 03:37:12,630
goes back you know hundreds of thousands
of years is that people's productivity

12774
03:37:12,630 --> 03:37:12,640
of years is that people's productivity
 

12775
03:37:12,640 --> 03:37:14,389
of years is that people's productivity
rises with time and maybe peaks around

12776
03:37:14,389 --> 03:37:14,399
rises with time and maybe peaks around
 

12777
03:37:14,399 --> 03:37:17,269
rises with time and maybe peaks around
the age of 40 or 50. the age of 40 50 is

12779
03:37:17,279 --> 03:37:19,190
the age of 40 or 50. the age of 40 50 is
when you will be having the highest

practice trying to do things but

12810
03:37:46,710 --> 03:37:46,720
practice trying to do things but
 

12811
03:37:46,720 --> 03:37:48,229
practice trying to do things but
that's mostly about learning how to do

03:37:48,229 --> 03:37:48,239
that's mostly about learning how to do
 

12813
03:37:48,239 --> 03:37:49,590
that's mostly about learning how to do
things by practicing there's a lot of

12814
03:37:49,590 --> 03:37:49,600
things by practicing there's a lot of
 

12815
03:37:49,600 --> 03:37:50,870
things by practicing there's a lot of
things you can't do unless you just keep

03:37:50,870 --> 03:37:50,880
things you can't do unless you just keep
 

12817

trying them
 

12819
03:37:52,880 --> 03:37:55,429
trying them
and when all else fails try to maximize

03:38:49,760 --> 03:38:51,110
and
meaning is

12880
03:38:51,110 --> 03:38:51,120
meaning is
 

12881
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:53,110
meaning is
more goes along with sacrificing

well both but raw genetics is probably

well both but raw genetics is probably
 

13031
03:41:25,439 --> 03:41:27,030

and so i've been i'm apparently somewhat
 

13069
03:42:06,080 --> 03:42:08,710
and so i've been i'm apparently somewhat
emotionally scarred by just being very

13070
03:42:08,710 --> 03:42:08,720
emotionally scarred by just being very
 

13071
03:42:08,720 --> 03:42:10,229
emotionally scarred by just being very
rejection averse which must have

13072
03:42:10,229 --> 03:42:10,239
rejection averse which must have
 

13073
03:42:10,239 --> 03:42:12,229
rejection averse which must have
happened because some rejections were

13074
03:42:12,229 --> 03:42:12,239
happened because some rejections were
 

13075
03:42:12,239 --> 03:42:13,349
happened because some rejections were
just very

13076

just very
 

13077
03:42:13,359 --> 03:42:15,590
just very
scarring at a scale

13078
03:42:15,590 --> 03:42:15,600
scarring at a scale
 

13079
03:42:15,600 --> 03:42:17,990
scarring at a scale
in in what kinds of communities and they

13080
03:42:17,990 --> 03:42:18,000
in in what kinds of communities and they
 

13081
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:20,630
in in what kinds of communities and they
did the individual scale i mean lots of

13082
03:42:20,630 --> 03:42:20,640
did the individual scale i mean lots of
 

13083
03:42:20,640 --> 03:42:22,550
did the individual scale i mean lots of
different scales yeah

13084
03:42:22,550 --> 03:42:22,560
different scales yeah
 

13085
03:42:22,560 --> 03:42:24,389
different scales yeah
all the different many different scales

13086
03:42:24,389 --> 03:42:24,399
all the different many different scales
 

13087
03:42:24,399 --> 03:42:26,710
all the different many different scales
still that rejection stings

13088
03:42:26,710 --> 03:42:26,720
still that rejection stings
 

13089
03:42:26,720 --> 03:42:29,189
still that rejection stings
um hold on a second but you are

13090
03:42:29,189 --> 03:42:29,199
um hold on a second but you are
 

13091
03:42:29,199 --> 03:42:30,950
um hold on a second but you are
a

13092
03:42:30,950 --> 03:42:30,960
a
 

13093
03:42:30,960 --> 03:42:33,269
a
contrarian thinker you challenge the

13094
03:42:33,269 --> 03:42:33,279
contrarian thinker you challenge the
 

13095
03:42:33,279 --> 03:42:34,710
contrarian thinker you challenge the
knowledge

13096
03:42:34,710 --> 03:42:34,720
knowledge
 

13097
03:42:34,720 --> 03:42:36,070
knowledge
why

13098
03:42:36,070 --> 03:42:36,080
why
 

13099
03:42:36,080 --> 03:42:39,750
why
if you if you were scarred by rejection

13100
03:42:39,750 --> 03:42:39,760
if you if you were scarred by rejection
 

13101
03:42:39,760 --> 03:42:43,349
if you if you were scarred by rejection
why welcome it in so many ways at a much

13102
03:42:43,349 --> 03:42:43,359
why welcome it in so many ways at a much
 

13103
03:42:43,359 --> 03:42:45,269
why welcome it in so many ways at a much
larger scale constantly with your ideas

13104
03:42:45,269 --> 03:42:45,279
larger scale constantly with your ideas
 

13105
03:42:45,279 --> 03:42:47,910
larger scale constantly with your ideas
could be that i'm just stupid

13106
03:42:47,910 --> 03:42:47,920
could be that i'm just stupid
 

13107
03:42:47,920 --> 03:42:49,189
could be that i'm just stupid
and

13108
03:42:49,189 --> 03:42:49,199
and
 

13109
03:42:49,199 --> 03:42:51,110
and
or that i've just categorized them

or that i've just categorized them
 

13111
03:42:51,120 --> 03:42:52,950
or that i've just categorized them
differently than i should or something

13112
03:42:52,950 --> 03:42:52,960
differently than i should or something
 

13113
03:42:52,960 --> 03:42:53,910
differently than i should or something
um

13114
03:42:53,910 --> 03:42:53,920
um
 

13115
03:42:53,920 --> 03:42:56,389
um
you know the most rejection

13116
03:42:56,389 --> 03:42:56,399
you know the most rejection
 

13117
03:42:56,399 --> 03:42:58,550
you know the most rejection
that i've faced hasn't been because of

13118
03:42:58,550 --> 03:42:58,560
that i've faced hasn't been because of
 

13119
03:42:58,560 --> 03:43:01,910
that i've faced hasn't been because of
my intellectual ideas

13120
03:43:01,910 --> 03:43:01,920

 

13121
03:43:01,920 --> 03:43:04,790

uh so oh so once the intellectual ideas

13122
03:43:04,790 --> 03:43:04,800
uh so oh so once the intellectual ideas
 

13123
03:43:04,800 --> 03:43:06,469
uh so oh so once the intellectual ideas
haven't been the thing to risk the

13124
03:43:06,469 --> 03:43:06,479
haven't been the thing to risk the
 

13125
03:43:06,479 --> 03:43:10,229
haven't been the thing to risk the
rejection the one that the things that

13126
03:43:10,229 --> 03:43:10,239
rejection the one that the things that
 

13127
03:43:10,239 --> 03:43:11,590
rejection the one that the things that
put

13128
03:43:11,590 --> 03:43:11,600
put
 

13129
03:43:11,600 --> 03:43:13,269
put
challenge your mind

13130
03:43:13,269 --> 03:43:13,279
challenge your mind
 

13131
03:43:13,279 --> 03:43:16,229
challenge your mind
taking you to a dark place are the more

13132
03:43:16,229 --> 03:43:16,239
taking you to a dark place are the more
 

13133
03:43:16,239 --> 03:43:18,309
taking you to a dark place are the more
psychological rejections

13134
03:43:18,309 --> 03:43:18,319
psychological rejections
 

13135
03:43:18,319 --> 03:43:20,229
psychological rejections
so well you just asked me well you know

13136
03:43:20,229 --> 03:43:20,239
so well you just asked me well you know
 

13137
03:43:20,239 --> 03:43:22,150
so well you just asked me well you know
what took me to a dark place you didn't

13138
03:43:22,150 --> 03:43:22,160
what took me to a dark place you didn't
 

13139
03:43:22,160 --> 03:43:23,910
what took me to a dark place you didn't
specify it as sort of an intellectual

13140
03:43:23,910 --> 03:43:23,920
specify it as sort of an intellectual
 

13141
03:43:23,920 --> 03:43:25,830
specify it as sort of an intellectual
dark place i guess yeah i just meant

13142
03:43:25,830 --> 03:43:25,840
dark place i guess yeah i just meant
 

13143
03:43:25,840 --> 03:43:27,030
dark place i guess yeah i just meant
like what what

13144
03:43:27,030 --> 03:43:27,040
like what what
 

13145
03:43:27,040 --> 03:43:30,790
like what what
so intellectual is disjoint or at least

13146
03:43:30,790 --> 03:43:30,800
so intellectual is disjoint or at least
 

13147
03:43:30,800 --> 03:43:32,870
so intellectual is disjoint or at least
at a at a more surface level than

13148
03:43:32,870 --> 03:43:32,880
at a at a more surface level than
 

13149
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:35,189
at a at a more surface level than
something emotional

13150
03:43:35,189 --> 03:43:35,199
something emotional
 

13151
03:43:35,199 --> 03:43:36,790
something emotional
yeah i would i would just think you know

13152
03:43:36,790 --> 03:43:36,800
yeah i would i would just think you know
 

13153
03:43:36,800 --> 03:43:38,389
yeah i would i would just think you know
there are times in your life when you

13154
03:43:38,389 --> 03:43:38,399
there are times in your life when you
 

13155
03:43:38,399 --> 03:43:40,070
there are times in your life when you
know you're just in a dark place and

13156
03:43:40,070 --> 03:43:40,080
know you're just in a dark place and
 

13157
03:43:40,080 --> 03:43:42,070
know you're just in a dark place and
that can have many different causes and

13158
03:43:42,070 --> 03:43:42,080
that can have many different causes and
 

13159
03:43:42,080 --> 03:43:44,150
that can have many different causes and

know at some level it's important to us
but it's not very clearly shown to us

13234
03:44:56,870 --> 03:44:56,880
but it's not very clearly shown to us
 

13235

but it's not very clearly shown to us
exactly how or why or in what ways

want where we can just clearly see that

13240
03:45:02,870 --> 03:45:02,880
want where we can just clearly see that
 

13241
03:45:02,880 --> 03:45:04,229
want where we can just clearly see that
we want and widely we want it right we

13242
03:45:04,229 --> 03:45:04,239
we want and widely we want it right we
 

13243

about being thirsty and we know when
 

13249
03:45:09,279 --> 03:45:12,389
about being thirsty and we know when
it's over that we're no longer thirsty

13250
03:45:12,389 --> 03:45:12,399
it's over that we're no longer thirsty
 

13251
03:45:12,399 --> 03:45:14,469
it's over that we're no longer thirsty
love isn't like that

13252
03:45:14,469 --> 03:45:14,479
love isn't like that
 

13253
03:45:14,479 --> 03:45:16,469
love isn't like that
it's like what what do we seek from this

13254
03:45:16,469 --> 03:45:16,479
it's like what what do we seek from this
 

13255
03:45:16,479 --> 03:45:18,070
it's like what what do we seek from this
we're drawn to it but we do not

13256
03:45:18,070 --> 03:45:18,080
we're drawn to it but we do not
 

13257
03:45:18,080 --> 03:45:21,269
we're drawn to it but we do not
understand why right we're drawn exactly

13258
03:45:21,269 --> 03:45:21,279
understand why right we're drawn exactly
 

13259
03:45:21,279 --> 03:45:22,550
understand why right we're drawn exactly
because it's not

13260
03:45:22,550 --> 03:45:22,560
because it's not
 

13261
03:45:22,560 --> 03:45:24,469
because it's not
just affection because if it was just

13262
03:45:24,469 --> 03:45:24,479
just affection because if it was just
 

13263
03:45:24,479 --> 03:45:26,229
just affection because if it was just
affection we don't seem to be drawn to

13264
03:45:26,229 --> 03:45:26,239
affection we don't seem to be drawn to
 

13265
03:45:26,239 --> 03:45:27,830
affection we don't seem to be drawn to
pure affection

13266
03:45:27,830 --> 03:45:27,840
pure affection
 

13267
03:45:27,840 --> 03:45:29,590
pure affection
we don't seem to be drawn

13268
03:45:29,590 --> 03:45:29,600
we don't seem to be drawn
 

13269
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:31,030
we don't seem to be drawn
to uh

13270
03:45:31,030 --> 03:45:31,040
to uh
 

13271
03:45:31,040 --> 03:45:33,110
to uh
somebody who's like a servant we don't

13272
03:45:33,110 --> 03:45:33,120
somebody who's like a servant we don't
 

13273
03:45:33,120 --> 03:45:35,110
somebody who's like a servant we don't
seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody

13274
03:45:35,110 --> 03:45:35,120
seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody
 

13275
03:45:35,120 --> 03:45:37,189
seem to be necessarily drawn to somebody
that satisfies all your needs or

13276
03:45:37,189 --> 03:45:37,199
that satisfies all your needs or
 

13277
03:45:37,199 --> 03:45:39,110
that satisfies all your needs or
something like that

13278
03:45:39,110 --> 03:45:39,120
something like that
 

13279
03:45:39,120 --> 03:45:41,110
something like that
so it's clearly something we want or

13280
03:45:41,110 --> 03:45:41,120
so it's clearly something we want or
 

13281
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:43,030
so it's clearly something we want or
need but we're not exactly very clear

13282
03:45:43,030 --> 03:45:43,040
need but we're not exactly very clear
 

13283
03:45:43,040 --> 03:45:44,950
need but we're not exactly very clear
about it and that isn't kind of

13284
03:45:44,950 --> 03:45:44,960
about it and that isn't kind of
 

13285
03:45:44,960 --> 03:45:46,550
about it and that isn't kind of
important to it so i've also noticed

13286
03:45:46,550 --> 03:45:46,560
important to it so i've also noticed
 

13287
03:45:46,560 --> 03:45:48,710
important to it so i've also noticed
there are some kinds of things you can't

13288
03:45:48,710 --> 03:45:48,720
there are some kinds of things you can't
 

13289
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:50,950
there are some kinds of things you can't
imagine very well so if you imagine a

13290
03:45:50,950 --> 03:45:50,960
imagine very well so if you imagine a
 

13291
03:45:50,960 --> 03:45:52,630
imagine very well so if you imagine a
situation there's some aspects of the

13292
03:45:52,630 --> 03:45:52,640
situation there's some aspects of the
 

13293
03:45:52,640 --> 03:45:53,990
situation there's some aspects of the
situation you can clear that you can

13294
03:45:53,990 --> 03:45:54,000
situation you can clear that you can
 

13295
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:55,750
situation you can clear that you can
imagine it being bright or dim you can

13296
03:45:55,750 --> 03:45:55,760
imagine it being bright or dim you can
 

13297
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:58,150
imagine it being bright or dim you can
imagine it being windy or imagine being

13298
03:45:58,150 --> 03:45:58,160
imagine it being windy or imagine being
 

13299
03:45:58,160 --> 03:45:59,670

03:45:59,670 --> 03:45:59,680
hot or cold
 

13301
03:45:59,680 --> 03:46:01,189
hot or cold
but there's some aspects about your

13302
03:46:01,189 --> 03:46:01,199
but there's some aspects about your
 

13303
03:46:01,199 --> 03:46:03,429
but there's some aspects about your
emotional stance in a situation that's

13304
03:46:03,429 --> 03:46:03,439
emotional stance in a situation that's
 

13305
03:46:03,439 --> 03:46:05,830
emotional stance in a situation that's
actually just hard to imagine or even

13306
03:46:05,830 --> 03:46:05,840
actually just hard to imagine or even
 

13307
03:46:05,840 --> 03:46:07,910
actually just hard to imagine or even
remember it's hard to like you can often

13308
03:46:07,910 --> 03:46:07,920
remember it's hard to like you can often
 

13309
03:46:07,920 --> 03:46:09,510
remember it's hard to like you can often
remember an emotion only when you're in

13310
03:46:09,510 --> 03:46:09,520
remember an emotion only when you're in
 

13311
03:46:09,520 --> 03:46:11,590
remember an emotion only when you're in
a similar sort of emotion situation and

13312
03:46:11,590 --> 03:46:11,600
a similar sort of emotion situation and
 

13313
03:46:11,600 --> 03:46:13,110
a similar sort of emotion situation and
otherwise you just can't bring the

13314

otherwise you just can't bring the
 

13315
03:46:13,120 --> 03:46:14,469
otherwise you just can't bring the
emotion

13316
03:46:14,469 --> 03:46:14,479

imagine it right so there's certain
 

13321
03:46:18,239 --> 03:46:20,309
imagine it right so there's certain
kinds of imag emotions you can have and

when you're in that emotion you can know
 

13325
03:46:21,680 --> 03:46:23,030
when you're in that emotion you can know

and it's associated but later on i tell
 

13329
03:46:24,640 --> 03:46:25,349
and it's associated but later on i tell
you

13330
03:46:25,349 --> 03:46:25,359
you
 

13331
03:46:25,359 --> 03:46:27,910
you
you know remember joy and it does that

13332
03:46:27,910 --> 03:46:27,920
you know remember joy and it does that
 

13333
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:29,429
you know remember joy and it does that
doesn't come to mind you're not able to

13334
03:46:29,429 --> 03:46:29,439
doesn't come to mind you're not able to
 

13335
03:46:29,439 --> 03:46:31,670
doesn't come to mind you're not able to
replay it right and that's the sort of

13336
03:46:31,670 --> 03:46:31,680
replay it right and that's the sort of
 

13337
03:46:31,680 --> 03:46:33,429
replay it right and that's the sort of
reason why we ha we're one of the

13338
03:46:33,429 --> 03:46:33,439
reason why we ha we're one of the
 

13339
03:46:33,439 --> 03:46:35,429
reason why we ha we're one of the
reasons that pushes us to re-consume it

13340
03:46:35,429 --> 03:46:35,439
reasons that pushes us to re-consume it
 

13341
03:46:35,439 --> 03:46:36,870
reasons that pushes us to re-consume it
and reproduce it

13342
03:46:36,870 --> 03:46:36,880
and reproduce it
 

13343
03:46:36,880 --> 03:46:39,510
and reproduce it
is that we can't reimagine it

13344
03:46:39,510 --> 03:46:39,520
is that we can't reimagine it
 

13345
03:46:39,520 --> 03:46:42,630
is that we can't reimagine it
well there's a it's interesting because

13346
03:46:42,630 --> 03:46:42,640
well there's a it's interesting because
 

13347
03:46:42,640 --> 03:46:44,389
well there's a it's interesting because
there's a daniel kahneman type of thing

13348
03:46:44,389 --> 03:46:44,399
there's a daniel kahneman type of thing
 

13349
03:46:44,399 --> 03:46:46,389
there's a daniel kahneman type of thing
of like reliving memories because

13350
03:46:46,389 --> 03:46:46,399
of like reliving memories because
 

13351
03:46:46,399 --> 03:46:49,110
of like reliving memories because
i'm able to summon some aspect of that

13352
03:46:49,110 --> 03:46:49,120
i'm able to summon some aspect of that
 

13353
03:46:49,120 --> 03:46:50,870
i'm able to summon some aspect of that
emotion again by thinking of that

13354
03:46:50,870 --> 03:46:50,880
emotion again by thinking of that
 

13355
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:53,030
emotion again by thinking of that
situation that from which that emotion

13356
03:46:53,030 --> 03:46:53,040
situation that from which that emotion
 

13357
03:46:53,040 --> 03:46:56,229
situation that from which that emotion
came right so like a certain song you

13358
03:46:56,229 --> 03:46:56,239
came right so like a certain song you
 

13359
03:46:56,239 --> 03:46:58,870
came right so like a certain song you
can listen to it and you can feel the

13360
03:46:58,870 --> 03:46:58,880
can listen to it and you can feel the
 

13361
03:46:58,880 --> 03:47:00,550
can listen to it and you can feel the
same way you felt the first time you

13362
03:47:00,550 --> 03:47:00,560
same way you felt the first time you
 

13363
03:47:00,560 --> 03:47:02,469
same way you felt the first time you
remember that song associated with you

13364
03:47:02,469 --> 03:47:02,479
remember that song associated with you
 

13365
03:47:02,479 --> 03:47:04,150
remember that song associated with you
need to remember that situation in some

13366
03:47:04,150 --> 03:47:04,160
need to remember that situation in some
 

13367
03:47:04,160 --> 03:47:06,309
need to remember that situation in some
sort of complete package yes you can't

13368
03:47:06,309 --> 03:47:06,319
sort of complete package yes you can't
 

13369
03:47:06,319 --> 03:47:08,150
sort of complete package yes you can't
just take one part off of it and then if

13370
03:47:08,150 --> 03:47:08,160
just take one part off of it and then if
 

13371
03:47:08,160 --> 03:47:09,590
just take one part off of it and then if
you get the whole package again if you

13372
03:47:09,590 --> 03:47:09,600
you get the whole package again if you
 

13373
03:47:09,600 --> 03:47:11,830
you get the whole package again if you
remember the whole feeling yes or some

13374
03:47:11,830 --> 03:47:11,840
remember the whole feeling yes or some
 

13375
03:47:11,840 --> 03:47:13,830
remember the whole feeling yes or some
fundamental aspect of that whole

13376
03:47:13,830 --> 03:47:13,840
fundamental aspect of that whole
 

13377
03:47:13,840 --> 03:47:15,990
fundamental aspect of that whole
experience that arouse

13378
03:47:15,990 --> 03:47:16,000
experience that arouse
 

13379
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:17,269
experience that arouse
from which the feeling wrote and

13380
03:47:17,269 --> 03:47:17,279
from which the feeling wrote and
 

13381
03:47:17,279 --> 03:47:18,469
from which the feeling wrote and
actually the feeling is probably

13382
03:47:18,469 --> 03:47:18,479
actually the feeling is probably
 

13383
03:47:18,479 --> 03:47:19,670
actually the feeling is probably
different

13384
03:47:19,670 --> 03:47:19,680
different
 

13385
03:47:19,680 --> 03:47:21,349
different
in some way it could be more pleasant or

13386
03:47:21,349 --> 03:47:21,359
in some way it could be more pleasant or
 

13387
03:47:21,359 --> 03:47:23,110
in some way it could be more pleasant or
less pleasant than the feeling you felt

13388
03:47:23,110 --> 03:47:23,120
less pleasant than the feeling you felt
 

13389
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:25,349
less pleasant than the feeling you felt
originally and that morphs over time

13390
03:47:25,349 --> 03:47:25,359
originally and that morphs over time
 

13391
03:47:25,359 --> 03:47:27,510
originally and that morphs over time
every time you replay that memory it is

13392
03:47:27,510 --> 03:47:27,520
every time you replay that memory it is
 

13393
03:47:27,520 --> 03:47:29,269
every time you replay that memory it is
interesting you're not able to replay

13394
03:47:29,269 --> 03:47:29,279
interesting you're not able to replay
 

13395
03:47:29,279 --> 03:47:31,349
interesting you're not able to replay
the

13396
03:47:31,349 --> 03:47:31,359
the
 

13397
03:47:31,359 --> 03:47:31,750
the
because you feeling

13398
03:47:31,750 --> 03:47:31,760
because you feeling
 

13399
03:47:31,760 --> 03:47:33,189
because you feeling
remember the feeling you remember the

13400
03:47:33,189 --> 03:47:33,199
remember the feeling you remember the
 

13401
03:47:33,199 --> 03:47:34,950
remember the feeling you remember the
facts of the events so there's a sense

13402
03:47:34,950 --> 03:47:34,960
facts of the events so there's a sense
 

13403
03:47:34,960 --> 03:47:36,630
facts of the events so there's a sense
in which over time we expand our

13404
03:47:36,630 --> 03:47:36,640
in which over time we expand our
 

13405
03:47:36,640 --> 03:47:39,189
in which over time we expand our
vocabulary as a community of language

13406
03:47:39,189 --> 03:47:39,199
vocabulary as a community of language
 

13407
03:47:39,199 --> 03:47:40,950
vocabulary as a community of language
and that allows us to sort of have more

13408
03:47:40,950 --> 03:47:40,960
and that allows us to sort of have more
 

13409
03:47:40,960 --> 03:47:42,550
and that allows us to sort of have more
feelings and know that we are feeling

13410
03:47:42,550 --> 03:47:42,560
feelings and know that we are feeling
 

13411
03:47:42,560 --> 03:47:43,429
feelings and know that we are feeling
them

13412
03:47:43,429 --> 03:47:43,439
them
 

13413
03:47:43,439 --> 03:47:44,630
them
because you can have a feeling but not

13414
03:47:44,630 --> 03:47:44,640
because you can have a feeling but not
 

13415
03:47:44,640 --> 03:47:46,309
because you can have a feeling but not
have a word for it and then you don't

13416
03:47:46,309 --> 03:47:46,319
have a word for it and then you don't
 

13417
03:47:46,319 --> 03:47:47,990
have a word for it and then you don't
know how to categorize it or even what

13418
03:47:47,990 --> 03:47:48,000
know how to categorize it or even what
 

13419
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:49,750
know how to categorize it or even what
it is and whether it's the same as

13420
03:47:49,750 --> 03:47:49,760
it is and whether it's the same as
 

13421
03:47:49,760 --> 03:47:51,189
it is and whether it's the same as
something else but once you have a word

13422
03:47:51,189 --> 03:47:51,199
something else but once you have a word
 

13423
03:47:51,199 --> 03:47:52,150
something else but once you have a word
for it

13424
03:47:52,150 --> 03:47:52,160
for it
 

13425
03:47:52,160 --> 03:47:54,309
for it
you can sort of pull it together more

13426
03:47:54,309 --> 03:47:54,319
you can sort of pull it together more
 

13427
03:47:54,319 --> 03:47:56,710
you can sort of pull it together more
easily and so i think over time we are

13428
03:47:56,710 --> 03:47:56,720
easily and so i think over time we are
 

13429
03:47:56,720 --> 03:47:58,830
easily and so i think over time we are
having a richer palette of

13430
03:47:58,830 --> 03:47:58,840
having a richer palette of
 

13431
03:47:58,840 --> 03:48:01,269
having a richer palette of
feelings because we have more words for

13432
03:48:01,269 --> 03:48:01,279
feelings because we have more words for
 

13433
03:48:01,279 --> 03:48:02,950
feelings because we have more words for
them

13434
03:48:02,950 --> 03:48:02,960
them
 

13435
03:48:02,960 --> 03:48:04,710
them
what has been a painful loss in your

13436
03:48:04,710 --> 03:48:04,720

13468
03:48:37,670 --> 03:48:37,680
people do so and some stuff i've just
 

13469
03:48:37,680 --> 03:48:39,269
people do so and some stuff i've just
lost a lot of my history by not

13470
03:48:39,269 --> 03:48:39,279
lost a lot of my history by not
 

13471
03:48:39,279 --> 03:48:42,150
lost a lot of my history by not
remembering it but does that and i'm not

13472
03:48:42,150 --> 03:48:42,160
remembering it but does that and i'm not
 

13473
03:48:42,160 --> 03:48:43,750
remembering it but does that and i'm not
that person anymore that person's gone

13474
03:48:43,750 --> 03:48:43,760
that person anymore that person's gone
 

13475
03:48:43,760 --> 03:48:45,110
that person anymore that person's gone
is that painful

13476
03:48:45,110 --> 03:48:45,120
is that painful
 

13477
03:48:45,120 --> 03:48:46,950
is that painful
is it a painful loss though

13478
03:48:46,950 --> 03:48:46,960
is it a painful loss though
 

13479
03:48:46,960 --> 03:48:48,550
is it a painful loss though
yeah or is it a

13480
03:48:48,550 --> 03:48:48,560
yeah or is it a
 

13481
03:48:48,560 --> 03:48:50,630
yeah or is it a
why why is it painful because you're

13482
03:48:50,630 --> 03:48:50,640
why why is it painful because you're
 

13483
03:48:50,640 --> 03:48:52,710
why why is it painful because you're
wiser

13484
03:48:52,710 --> 03:48:52,720
wiser
 

13485
03:48:52,720 --> 03:48:54,389
wiser
you're

13486
03:48:54,389 --> 03:48:54,399
you're
 

13487
03:48:54,399 --> 03:48:56,229
you're
i mean there's so many things that are

13488
03:48:56,229 --> 03:48:56,239
i mean there's so many things that are
 

13489
03:48:56,239 --> 03:48:58,469
i mean there's so many things that are
beneficial to getting older

13490
03:48:58,469 --> 03:48:58,479
beneficial to getting older
 

13491
03:48:58,479 --> 03:48:59,429
beneficial to getting older
right but

13492
03:48:59,429 --> 03:48:59,439
right but
 

13493
03:48:59,439 --> 03:49:00,469
right but
are you just

13494
03:49:00,469 --> 03:49:00,479
are you just
 

13495
03:49:00,479 --> 03:49:04,070
are you just
just i just was this person and i felt

13496
03:49:04,070 --> 03:49:04,080
just i just was this person and i felt
 

13497
03:49:04,080 --> 03:49:05,830
just i just was this person and i felt
assured that i could continue to be that

13498
03:49:05,830 --> 03:49:05,840
assured that i could continue to be that
 

13499
03:49:05,840 --> 03:49:07,990
assured that i could continue to be that
person and you're no longer that and

13500
03:49:07,990 --> 03:49:08,000
person and you're no longer that and
 

13501
03:49:08,000 --> 03:49:10,150
person and you're no longer that and
he's he's gone and i'm not him anymore

13502
03:49:10,150 --> 03:49:10,160
he's he's gone and i'm not him anymore
 

13503
03:49:10,160 --> 03:49:12,870
he's he's gone and i'm not him anymore
and he's he died without fanfare or a

13504
03:49:12,870 --> 03:49:12,880
and he's he died without fanfare or a
 

13505
03:49:12,880 --> 03:49:14,309
and he's he died without fanfare or a
funeral

13506
03:49:14,309 --> 03:49:14,319
funeral
 

13507
03:49:14,319 --> 03:49:15,830
funeral
and that the person you are today

13508
03:49:15,830 --> 03:49:15,840
and that the person you are today
 

13509
03:49:15,840 --> 03:49:18,870
and that the person you are today
talking to me that person

13510
03:49:18,870 --> 03:49:18,880
talking to me that person
 

13511
03:49:18,880 --> 03:49:21,590
talking to me that person
will be changed too yes

13512
03:49:21,590 --> 03:49:21,600
will be changed too yes
 

13513
03:49:21,600 --> 03:49:23,830
will be changed too yes
and so that 20 years he won't be there

13514
03:49:23,830 --> 03:49:23,840
and so that 20 years he won't be there
 

13515
03:49:23,840 --> 03:49:25,910
and so that 20 years he won't be there
anymore and the future person

13516
03:49:25,910 --> 03:49:25,920
anymore and the future person
 

13517
03:49:25,920 --> 03:49:28,070
anymore and the future person
you have

13518
03:49:28,070 --> 03:49:28,080
you have
 

13519
03:49:28,080 --> 03:49:30,229
you have
uh will look back with each version of

13520
03:49:30,229 --> 03:49:30,239
uh will look back with each version of
 

13521
03:49:30,239 --> 03:49:31,910
uh will look back with each version of
you for m's this will be less of a

13522
03:49:31,910 --> 03:49:31,920
you for m's this will be less of a
 

13523
03:49:31,920 --> 03:49:33,750
you for m's this will be less of a
problem for m's they would be able to

13524
03:49:33,750 --> 03:49:33,760
problem for m's they would be able to
 

13525
03:49:33,760 --> 03:49:35,750
problem for m's they would be able to
save an archived copy of themselves at

13526
03:49:35,750 --> 03:49:35,760
save an archived copy of themselves at
 

13527
03:49:35,760 --> 03:49:37,110
save an archived copy of themselves at
each different age

13528
03:49:37,110 --> 03:49:37,120
each different age
 

13529
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:38,950
each different age
and they could turn it on periodically

13530
03:49:38,950 --> 03:49:38,960
and they could turn it on periodically
 

13531
03:49:38,960 --> 03:49:41,830
and they could turn it on periodically
and go back and talk to it to replay

13532
03:49:41,830 --> 03:49:41,840
and go back and talk to it to replay
 

13533
03:49:41,840 --> 03:49:44,389
and go back and talk to it to replay
you think some of that will be

13534
03:49:44,389 --> 03:49:44,399
you think some of that will be
 

13535
03:49:44,399 --> 03:49:45,189
you think some of that will be
so

13536
03:49:45,189 --> 03:49:45,199
so
 

13537
03:49:45,199 --> 03:49:48,790
so
with emulated minds with m's

13538
03:49:48,790 --> 03:49:48,800
with emulated minds with m's
 

13539
03:49:48,800 --> 03:49:52,229
with emulated minds with m's
there's a clue there's a digital cloning

13540
03:49:52,229 --> 03:49:52,239
there's a clue there's a digital cloning
 

13541
03:49:52,239 --> 03:49:53,990
there's a clue there's a digital cloning
that happens

13542
03:49:53,990 --> 03:49:54,000
that happens
 

13543
03:49:54,000 --> 03:49:55,670
that happens
and

13544
03:49:55,670 --> 03:49:55,680
and
 

13545
03:49:55,680 --> 03:49:57,269
and
do you think that makes

13546
03:49:57,269 --> 03:49:57,279
do you think that makes
 

13547
03:49:57,279 --> 03:49:59,590
do you think that makes
your

13548
03:49:59,590 --> 03:49:59,600
your
 

13549
03:49:59,600 --> 03:50:01,189
your
you less special

13550
03:50:01,189 --> 03:50:01,199
you less special
 

13551
03:50:01,199 --> 03:50:03,269
you less special
if if you're cloneable

13552
03:50:03,269 --> 03:50:03,279
if if you're cloneable
 

13553
03:50:03,279 --> 03:50:06,389
if if you're cloneable
like does does that make you

13554
03:50:06,389 --> 03:50:06,399
like does does that make you
 

13555
03:50:06,399 --> 03:50:07,269
like does does that make you
uh

13556
03:50:07,269 --> 03:50:07,279
uh
 

13557
03:50:07,279 --> 03:50:10,150
uh
the experience of life the

13558
03:50:10,150 --> 03:50:10,160
the experience of life the
 

13559
03:50:10,160 --> 03:50:12,229
the experience of life the
experience of a moment the scarcity of

13560
03:50:12,229 --> 03:50:12,239
experience of a moment the scarcity of
 

13561
03:50:12,239 --> 03:50:13,750
experience of a moment the scarcity of
that moment the scarcity of that

13562
03:50:13,750 --> 03:50:13,760
that moment the scarcity of that
 

13563
03:50:13,760 --> 03:50:16,229
that moment the scarcity of that
experience isn't that a fundamental part

13564
03:50:16,229 --> 03:50:16,239
experience isn't that a fundamental part
 

13565
03:50:16,239 --> 03:50:17,590
experience isn't that a fundamental part
of what makes that experience so

13566
03:50:17,590 --> 03:50:17,600
of what makes that experience so
 

13567
03:50:17,600 --> 03:50:18,950
of what makes that experience so
delicious

13568
03:50:18,950 --> 03:50:18,960
delicious
 

13569
03:50:18,960 --> 03:50:20,790
delicious
so rich of feeling i think if you think

13570
03:50:20,790 --> 03:50:20,800
so rich of feeling i think if you think
 

13571
03:50:20,800 --> 03:50:23,349
so rich of feeling i think if you think
of a song that lots of people listen to

13572
03:50:23,349 --> 03:50:23,359
of a song that lots of people listen to
 

13573
03:50:23,359 --> 03:50:25,030
of a song that lots of people listen to
that are copies all over the world we're

13574
03:50:25,030 --> 03:50:25,040
that are copies all over the world we're
 

13575
03:50:25,040 --> 03:50:27,990
that are copies all over the world we're
gonna call that a more special song

13576
03:50:27,990 --> 03:50:28,000
gonna call that a more special song
 

13577
03:50:28,000 --> 03:50:29,670
gonna call that a more special song
yeah

13578
03:50:29,670 --> 03:50:29,680
yeah
 

13579
03:50:29,680 --> 03:50:34,550
yeah
yeah

13580
03:50:34,550 --> 03:50:34,560

 

13581
03:50:34,560 --> 03:50:37,030

so there's a perspective on copying and

13582
03:50:37,030 --> 03:50:37,040
so there's a perspective on copying and
 

13583
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:39,269
so there's a perspective on copying and
cloning where you're just scaling

13584
03:50:39,269 --> 03:50:39,279
cloning where you're just scaling
 

13585
03:50:39,279 --> 03:50:42,389
cloning where you're just scaling
happiness versus uh degrading

13586
03:50:42,389 --> 03:50:42,399
happiness versus uh degrading
 

13587
03:50:42,399 --> 03:50:44,630
happiness versus uh degrading
each copy of a song is less special if

13588
03:50:44,630 --> 03:50:44,640
each copy of a song is less special if
 

13589
03:50:44,640 --> 03:50:46,150
each copy of a song is less special if
there are many copies but the song

13590
03:50:46,150 --> 03:50:46,160
there are many copies but the song
 

13591
03:50:46,160 --> 03:50:47,990
there are many copies but the song
itself is more special if there are many

13592
03:50:47,990 --> 03:50:48,000
itself is more special if there are many
 

13593
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:51,110
itself is more special if there are many
copies and on mass right you're

13594
03:50:51,110 --> 03:50:51,120
copies and on mass right you're
 

13595
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:52,389
copies and on mass right you're
you're actually

13596
03:50:52,389 --> 03:50:52,399
you're actually
 

13597
03:50:52,399 --> 03:50:54,070
you're actually
spreading the happiness even if it

13598
03:50:54,070 --> 03:50:54,080
spreading the happiness even if it
 

13599
03:50:54,080 --> 03:50:56,150
spreading the happiness even if it
diminishes over a large number of people

13600
03:50:56,150 --> 03:50:56,160
diminishes over a large number of people
 

13601
03:50:56,160 --> 03:50:57,910
diminishes over a large number of people
at scale and that increases the overall

13602
03:50:57,910 --> 03:50:57,920
at scale and that increases the overall
 

13603
03:50:57,920 --> 03:50:59,429
at scale and that increases the overall
happiness in the world

13604
03:50:59,429 --> 03:50:59,439
happiness in the world
 

13605
03:50:59,439 --> 03:51:00,630
happiness in the world
and then you're able to do that with

13606
03:51:00,630 --> 03:51:00,640
and then you're able to do that with
 

13607
03:51:00,640 --> 03:51:03,750
and then you're able to do that with
multiple songs is a person who has an

13608
03:51:03,750 --> 03:51:03,760
multiple songs is a person who has an
 

13609
03:51:03,760 --> 03:51:05,750
multiple songs is a person who has an
identical twin

13610
03:51:05,750 --> 03:51:05,760
identical twin
 

13611
03:51:05,760 --> 03:51:07,750
identical twin
more or less special

13612
03:51:07,750 --> 03:51:07,760
more or less special
 

13613
03:51:07,760 --> 03:51:11,189
more or less special
well

13614
03:51:11,189 --> 03:51:11,199

 

13615
03:51:11,199 --> 03:51:13,189

the problem with identical twins is you

13616
03:51:13,189 --> 03:51:13,199
the problem with identical twins is you
 

13617
03:51:13,199 --> 03:51:16,790
the problem with identical twins is you
know you it's like just two with m's

13618
03:51:16,790 --> 03:51:16,800
know you it's like just two with m's
 

13619
03:51:16,800 --> 03:51:18,469
know you it's like just two with m's
right but but two is different than one

13620
03:51:18,469 --> 03:51:18,479
right but but two is different than one
 

13621
03:51:18,479 --> 03:51:19,510
right but but two is different than one
so

13622
03:51:19,510 --> 03:51:19,520
so
 

13623
03:51:19,520 --> 03:51:22,229
so
but i think an identical twin's life is

13624
03:51:22,229 --> 03:51:22,239
but i think an identical twin's life is
 

13625
03:51:22,239 --> 03:51:23,990
but i think an identical twin's life is
richer for having this other identical

13626
03:51:23,990 --> 03:51:24,000
richer for having this other identical
 

13627
03:51:24,000 --> 03:51:25,349
richer for having this other identical
twin somebody who understands them

13628
03:51:25,349 --> 03:51:25,359
twin somebody who understands them
 

13629
03:51:25,359 --> 03:51:27,750
twin somebody who understands them
better than anybody else can

13630
03:51:27,750 --> 03:51:27,760
better than anybody else can
 

13631
03:51:27,760 --> 03:51:29,590
better than anybody else can
from the point of view of an identical

13632
03:51:29,590 --> 03:51:29,600
from the point of view of an identical
 

13633
03:51:29,600 --> 03:51:31,830
from the point of view of an identical
twin i think they have a richer life for

13634
03:51:31,830 --> 03:51:31,840
twin i think they have a richer life for
 

13635
03:51:31,840 --> 03:51:33,750
twin i think they have a richer life for
being part of this couple which each of

13636
03:51:33,750 --> 03:51:33,760
being part of this couple which each of
 

13637
03:51:33,760 --> 03:51:35,750
being part of this couple which each of
which is very similar now if you said

13638
03:51:35,750 --> 03:51:35,760
which is very similar now if you said
 

13639
03:51:35,760 --> 03:51:37,590
which is very similar now if you said
will the world you know if we lose one

13640
03:51:37,590 --> 03:51:37,600
will the world you know if we lose one
 

13641
03:51:37,600 --> 03:51:39,349
will the world you know if we lose one
of the identical twins will the world

13642
03:51:39,349 --> 03:51:39,359
of the identical twins will the world
 

13643
03:51:39,359 --> 03:51:40,870
of the identical twins will the world
miss it as much because you've got the

13644
03:51:40,870 --> 03:51:40,880
miss it as much because you've got the
 

13645
03:51:40,880 --> 03:51:42,229
miss it as much because you've got the
other one and they're pretty similar

13646
03:51:42,229 --> 03:51:42,239
other one and they're pretty similar
 

13647
03:51:42,239 --> 03:51:43,590
other one and they're pretty similar
maybe from the rest of the world's point

13648
03:51:43,590 --> 03:51:43,600
maybe from the rest of the world's point
 

13649
03:51:43,600 --> 03:51:44,950
maybe from the rest of the world's point
of view they are

13650
03:51:44,950 --> 03:51:44,960
of view they are
 

13651
03:51:44,960 --> 03:51:46,550
of view they are
they suffer less of a loss when they

13652
03:51:46,550 --> 03:51:46,560
they suffer less of a loss when they
 

13653
03:51:46,560 --> 03:51:48,550
they suffer less of a loss when they
lose one of the identical twins but from

13654
03:51:48,550 --> 03:51:48,560
lose one of the identical twins but from
 

13655
03:51:48,560 --> 03:51:49,990
lose one of the identical twins but from
the point of view of the identical twin

13656
03:51:49,990 --> 03:51:50,000
the point of view of the identical twin
 

13657
03:51:50,000 --> 03:51:51,269
the point of view of the identical twin
themselves

13658
03:51:51,269 --> 03:51:51,279
themselves
 

13659
03:51:51,279 --> 03:51:53,510
themselves
their life is enriched by having a twin

13660
03:51:53,510 --> 03:51:53,520
their life is enriched by having a twin
 

13661
03:51:53,520 --> 03:51:56,469
their life is enriched by having a twin
see but the identical twin copying

13662
03:51:56,469 --> 03:51:56,479
see but the identical twin copying
 

13663
03:51:56,479 --> 03:51:59,269
see but the identical twin copying
happens at the place of birth

13664
03:51:59,269 --> 03:51:59,279
happens at the place of birth
 

13665
03:51:59,279 --> 03:52:01,670
happens at the place of birth
uh that's different than copying after

13666
03:52:01,670 --> 03:52:01,680
uh that's different than copying after
 

13667
03:52:01,680 --> 03:52:03,349
uh that's different than copying after
you've done some of the

13668
03:52:03,349 --> 03:52:03,359
you've done some of the
 

13669
03:52:03,359 --> 03:52:05,830
you've done some of the
environment like the nurture yeah at the

13670
03:52:05,830 --> 03:52:05,840
environment like the nurture yeah at the
 

13671
03:52:05,840 --> 03:52:08,710
environment like the nurture yeah at the
teenage or the in the 20s

13672
03:52:08,710 --> 03:52:08,720
teenage or the in the 20s
 

13673
03:52:08,720 --> 03:52:10,309
teenage or the in the 20s
that'll be an interesting thing for ems

13674
03:52:10,309 --> 03:52:10,319
that'll be an interesting thing for ems
 

13675
03:52:10,319 --> 03:52:11,910
that'll be an interesting thing for ems
to find out all the different ways that

13676
03:52:11,910 --> 03:52:11,920
to find out all the different ways that
 

13677
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:13,510
to find out all the different ways that
can have different relationships to

13678
03:52:13,510 --> 03:52:13,520
can have different relationships to
 

13679
03:52:13,520 --> 03:52:15,030
can have different relationships to
different people who have different

13680
03:52:15,030 --> 03:52:15,040
different people who have different
 

13681
03:52:15,040 --> 03:52:17,750
different people who have different
degrees of similarity to them in time

13682
03:52:17,750 --> 03:52:17,760
degrees of similarity to them in time
 

13683
03:52:17,760 --> 03:52:19,590
degrees of similarity to them in time
yeah

13684
03:52:19,590 --> 03:52:19,600
yeah
 

13685
03:52:19,600 --> 03:52:20,870
yeah
yeah

13686
03:52:20,870 --> 03:52:20,880
yeah
 

13687
03:52:20,880 --> 03:52:23,910
yeah
man

13688
03:52:23,910 --> 03:52:23,920

 

13689
03:52:23,920 --> 03:52:25,349

but it seems like a rich space to

13690
03:52:25,349 --> 03:52:25,359
but it seems like a rich space to
 

13691
03:52:25,359 --> 03:52:26,870
but it seems like a rich space to
explore and i don't feel sorry for them

13692
03:52:26,870 --> 03:52:26,880
explore and i don't feel sorry for them
 

13693
03:52:26,880 --> 03:52:28,790
explore and i don't feel sorry for them
this sounds like interesting world to

13694
03:52:28,790 --> 03:52:28,800
this sounds like interesting world to
 

13695
03:52:28,800 --> 03:52:30,630
this sounds like interesting world to
living and there could be some ethical

13696
03:52:30,630 --> 03:52:30,640
living and there could be some ethical
 

13697
03:52:30,640 --> 03:52:33,110
living and there could be some ethical
conundrums there there will be many new

13698
03:52:33,110 --> 03:52:33,120
conundrums there there will be many new
 

13699
03:52:33,120 --> 03:52:35,189
conundrums there there will be many new
choices to make that they don't make now

13700
03:52:35,189 --> 03:52:35,199
choices to make that they don't make now
 

13701
03:52:35,199 --> 03:52:36,950
choices to make that they don't make now
so and then we discussed it and i

13702
03:52:36,950 --> 03:52:36,960
so and then we discussed it and i
 

13703
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:38,550
so and then we discussed it and i
discussed that in the book age if i'm

13704
03:52:38,550 --> 03:52:38,560
discussed that in the book age if i'm
 

13705
03:52:38,560 --> 03:52:39,429
discussed that in the book age if i'm
like

13706
03:52:39,429 --> 03:52:39,439
like
 

13707
03:52:39,439 --> 03:52:41,429

entitled
 

13719
03:52:51,760 --> 03:52:53,590
entitled
would you show up

13720
03:52:53,590 --> 03:52:53,600
would you show up
 

13721
03:52:53,600 --> 03:52:56,229
would you show up
yes so you'll have to make choices then

13722
03:52:56,229 --> 03:52:56,239
yes so you'll have to make choices then
 

13723
03:52:56,239 --> 03:52:58,070
yes so you'll have to make choices then
when you split yourself which which of

13724
03:52:58,070 --> 03:52:58,080
when you split yourself which which of
 

13725
03:52:58,080 --> 03:53:01,750
when you split yourself which which of
you inherit which unique things

13726
03:53:01,750 --> 03:53:01,760
you inherit which unique things
 

13727
03:53:01,760 --> 03:53:05,349
you inherit which unique things
yeah and of course there will be

13728
03:53:05,349 --> 03:53:05,359
yeah and of course there will be
 

13729
03:53:05,359 --> 03:53:07,429
yeah and of course there will be
an equivalent

13730
03:53:07,429 --> 03:53:07,439
an equivalent
 

13731
03:53:07,439 --> 03:53:09,510
an equivalent
increase in lawyers well i guess you can

13732
03:53:09,510 --> 03:53:09,520
increase in lawyers well i guess you can
 

13733
03:53:09,520 --> 03:53:11,750
increase in lawyers well i guess you can
clone the lawyers to help

13734
03:53:11,750 --> 03:53:11,760
clone the lawyers to help
 

13735
03:53:11,760 --> 03:53:14,630
clone the lawyers to help

only really need lawyers for this with

13744
03:53:23,990 --> 03:53:24,000
only really need lawyers for this with
 

13745
03:53:24,000 --> 03:53:26,070
only really need lawyers for this with
an inefficient awkward law that is not

13746
03:53:26,070 --> 03:53:26,080
an inefficient awkward law that is not
 

13747
03:53:26,080 --> 03:53:28,309
an inefficient awkward law that is not
very transparent and able to do things

13748
03:53:28,309 --> 03:53:28,319
very transparent and able to do things
 

13749
03:53:28,319 --> 03:53:30,630
very transparent and able to do things
so you know for example an operating

13750
03:53:30,630 --> 03:53:30,640
so you know for example an operating
 

13751
03:53:30,640 --> 03:53:32,950
so you know for example an operating
system of a computer is a law for that

13752
03:53:32,950 --> 03:53:32,960
system of a computer is a law for that
 

13753
03:53:32,960 --> 03:53:34,710
system of a computer is a law for that
computer when the operating system is

13754
03:53:34,710 --> 03:53:34,720
computer when the operating system is
 

13755
03:53:34,720 --> 03:53:36,870
computer when the operating system is
simple and clean you don't need to hire

13756
03:53:36,870 --> 03:53:36,880
simple and clean you don't need to hire
 

13757
03:53:36,880 --> 03:53:38,550
simple and clean you don't need to hire
a lawyer to make a key choice with the

13758
03:53:38,550 --> 03:53:38,560
a lawyer to make a key choice with the
 

13759
03:53:38,560 --> 03:53:39,830
a lawyer to make a key choice with the
operator you don't need a human in the

13760
03:53:39,830 --> 03:53:39,840
operator you don't need a human in the
 

13761
03:53:39,840 --> 03:53:41,990
operator you don't need a human in the
loop you just make a choice

13762
03:53:41,990 --> 03:53:42,000
loop you just make a choice
 

13763
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:44,229
loop you just make a choice
yeah right so ideally we want a legal

13764
03:53:44,229 --> 03:53:44,239
yeah right so ideally we want a legal
 

13765
03:53:44,239 --> 03:53:45,349
yeah right so ideally we want a legal
system that

13766
03:53:45,349 --> 03:53:45,359
system that
 

13767
03:53:45,359 --> 03:53:48,150
system that
makes the common choices easy and not

13768
03:53:48,150 --> 03:53:48,160
makes the common choices easy and not
 

13769
03:53:48,160 --> 03:53:50,389
makes the common choices easy and not
require much overhead and that's the

13770
03:53:50,389 --> 03:53:50,399
require much overhead and that's the
 

13771
03:53:50,399 --> 03:53:52,790
require much overhead and that's the
digitization of things uh further and

13772
03:53:52,790 --> 03:53:52,800
digitization of things uh further and
 

13773
03:53:52,800 --> 03:53:54,520
digitization of things uh further and
further further enables that

13774
03:53:54,520 --> 03:53:54,530
further further enables that
 

13775
03:53:54,530 --> 03:53:55,990

03:54:06,469 --> 03:54:06,479
are you afraid of it i am a cryonics
 

13785
03:54:06,479 --> 03:54:08,070
are you afraid of it i am a cryonics
customer that's what this little tag

13786
03:54:08,070 --> 03:54:08,080
customer that's what this little tag
 

13787
03:54:08,080 --> 03:54:10,630
customer that's what this little tag
around my deck says it says that if you

13788
03:54:10,630 --> 03:54:10,640
around my deck says it says that if you
 

13789
03:54:10,640 --> 03:54:12,870
around my deck says it says that if you
find me in a medical situation uh you

13790
03:54:12,870 --> 03:54:12,880
find me in a medical situation uh you
 

13791
03:54:12,880 --> 03:54:14,469
find me in a medical situation uh you
should call these people

13792
03:54:14,469 --> 03:54:14,479
should call these people
 

13793
03:54:14,479 --> 03:54:18,469
should call these people
to enable the cryonics transfer so i am

13794
03:54:18,469 --> 03:54:18,479
to enable the cryonics transfer so i am
 

13795
03:54:18,479 --> 03:54:21,030
to enable the cryonics transfer so i am
taking a long shot chance at living a

13796
03:54:21,030 --> 03:54:21,040
taking a long shot chance at living a
 

13797
03:54:21,040 --> 03:54:22,469
taking a long shot chance at living a
much longer life

13798
03:54:22,469 --> 03:54:22,479
much longer life
 

13799
03:54:22,479 --> 03:54:24,070
much longer life
can you explain

13800
03:54:24,070 --> 03:54:24,080
can you explain
 

13801
03:54:24,080 --> 03:54:26,790
can you explain
what cryonics is so

13802
03:54:26,790 --> 03:54:26,800
what cryonics is so
 

13803
03:54:26,800 --> 03:54:29,269
what cryonics is so
when medical science gives up on me

13804
03:54:29,269 --> 03:54:29,279
when medical science gives up on me
 

13805
03:54:29,279 --> 03:54:31,590
when medical science gives up on me
in this world instead of

13806
03:54:31,590 --> 03:54:31,600
in this world instead of
 

13807
03:54:31,600 --> 03:54:33,830
in this world instead of
burning me or letting worms eat me they

13808
03:54:33,830 --> 03:54:33,840
burning me or letting worms eat me they
 

13809
03:54:33,840 --> 03:54:35,429
burning me or letting worms eat me they
will freeze me

13810
03:54:35,429 --> 03:54:35,439
will freeze me
 

13811
03:54:35,439 --> 03:54:37,750
will freeze me
or at least freeze my head and

13812
03:54:37,750 --> 03:54:37,760
or at least freeze my head and
 

13813
03:54:37,760 --> 03:54:39,110
or at least freeze my head and
there's damage that happens in the

13814
03:54:39,110 --> 03:54:39,120
there's damage that happens in the
 

13815
03:54:39,120 --> 03:54:41,189
there's damage that happens in the
process of freezing the head but once

13816
03:54:41,189 --> 03:54:41,199
process of freezing the head but once
 

13817
03:54:41,199 --> 03:54:43,670
process of freezing the head but once
it's frozen it won't change for a very

13818
03:54:43,670 --> 03:54:43,680
it's frozen it won't change for a very
 

13819
03:54:43,680 --> 03:54:45,349
it's frozen it won't change for a very
long time chemically it'll just be

13820
03:54:45,349 --> 03:54:45,359
long time chemically it'll just be
 

13821
03:54:45,359 --> 03:54:47,510
long time chemically it'll just be
completely exactly the same

13822
03:54:47,510 --> 03:54:47,520
completely exactly the same
 

13823
03:54:47,520 --> 03:54:48,950
completely exactly the same
so future

13824
03:54:48,950 --> 03:54:48,960
so future
 

13825
03:54:48,960 --> 03:54:50,950
so future
technology might be able to revive me

13826
03:54:50,950 --> 03:54:50,960
technology might be able to revive me
 

13827
03:54:50,960 --> 03:54:52,790
technology might be able to revive me
and in fact i would be mainly counting

13828
03:54:52,790 --> 03:54:52,800
and in fact i would be mainly counting
 

13829
03:54:52,800 --> 03:54:54,790
and in fact i would be mainly counting
on the brain emulation scenario

13830
03:54:54,790 --> 03:54:54,800
on the brain emulation scenario
 

13831
03:54:54,800 --> 03:54:56,950
on the brain emulation scenario
which doesn't require reviving my entire

13832
03:54:56,950 --> 03:54:56,960
which doesn't require reviving my entire
 

13833
03:54:56,960 --> 03:54:59,429
which doesn't require reviving my entire
biological body it means i would be in a

13834
03:54:59,429 --> 03:54:59,439
biological body it means i would be in a
 

13835
03:54:59,439 --> 03:55:02,070
biological body it means i would be in a
computer simulation

13836
03:55:02,070 --> 03:55:02,080
computer simulation
 

13837
03:55:02,080 --> 03:55:03,030
computer simulation
and so

13838
03:55:03,030 --> 03:55:03,040
and so
 

13839
03:55:03,040 --> 03:55:04,710
and so
that's i think i've got at least a five

13840
03:55:04,710 --> 03:55:04,720
that's i think i've got at least a five
 

13841
03:55:04,720 --> 03:55:06,389
that's i think i've got at least a five
percent shot at that

13842
03:55:06,389 --> 03:55:06,399
percent shot at that
 

13843
03:55:06,399 --> 03:55:08,309
percent shot at that
and that's immortality

13844
03:55:08,309 --> 03:55:08,319
and that's immortality
 

13845
03:55:08,319 --> 03:55:09,910
and that's immortality
are you

13846
03:55:09,910 --> 03:55:09,920
are you
 

13847
03:55:09,920 --> 03:55:10,790
are you
so

13848
03:55:10,790 --> 03:55:10,800
so
 

13849
03:55:10,800 --> 03:55:12,070
so
most likely it won't happen and

13850
03:55:12,070 --> 03:55:12,080
most likely it won't happen and
 

13851
03:55:12,080 --> 03:55:14,950
most likely it won't happen and
therefore i'm sad that it won't happen

13852
03:55:14,950 --> 03:55:14,960
therefore i'm sad that it won't happen
 

13853
03:55:14,960 --> 03:55:17,750
therefore i'm sad that it won't happen
do you think immortality is something

13854
03:55:17,750 --> 03:55:17,760
do you think immortality is something
 

13855
03:55:17,760 --> 03:55:20,710
do you think immortality is something
that you would like to have

13856
03:55:20,710 --> 03:55:20,720
that you would like to have
 

13857
03:55:20,720 --> 03:55:23,349
that you would like to have
well i mean just like infinity i mean

13858
03:55:23,349 --> 03:55:23,359
well i mean just like infinity i mean
 

13859
03:55:23,359 --> 03:55:25,110
well i mean just like infinity i mean
you can't know until

13860
03:55:25,110 --> 03:55:25,120
you can't know until
 

13861
03:55:25,120 --> 03:55:27,189
you can't know until
forever which means never right so all

13862
03:55:27,189 --> 03:55:27,199
forever which means never right so all
 

13863
03:55:27,199 --> 03:55:29,110
forever which means never right so all
you can really you know the better

13864
03:55:29,110 --> 03:55:29,120
you can really you know the better
 

13865
03:55:29,120 --> 03:55:30,790
you can really you know the better
choices at each moment you want to keep

13866
03:55:30,790 --> 03:55:30,800
choices at each moment you want to keep
 

13867
03:55:30,800 --> 03:55:33,510
choices at each moment you want to keep
going so i would like at every moment to

13868
03:55:33,510 --> 03:55:33,520
going so i would like at every moment to
 

13869
03:55:33,520 --> 03:55:36,070
going so i would like at every moment to
have the option to keep going

13870
03:55:36,070 --> 03:55:36,080
have the option to keep going
 

13871
03:55:36,080 --> 03:55:38,950
have the option to keep going
the the interesting thing about

13872
03:55:38,950 --> 03:55:38,960
the the interesting thing about
 

13873
03:55:38,960 --> 03:55:43,349
the the interesting thing about
the human experience is that

13874
03:55:43,349 --> 03:55:43,359

 

13875
03:55:43,359 --> 03:55:45,429

the way you phrase it is exactly right

13876
03:55:45,429 --> 03:55:45,439
the way you phrase it is exactly right
 

13877
03:55:45,439 --> 03:55:47,670
the way you phrase it is exactly right
at every moment i would like to keep

13878
03:55:47,670 --> 03:55:47,680
at every moment i would like to keep
 

13879
03:55:47,680 --> 03:55:48,710
at every moment i would like to keep
going

13880
03:55:48,710 --> 03:55:48,720
going
 

13881
03:55:48,720 --> 03:55:51,830
going
but the thing that happens

13882
03:55:51,830 --> 03:55:51,840
but the thing that happens
 

13883
03:55:51,840 --> 03:55:53,030
but the thing that happens
uh

13884
03:55:53,030 --> 03:55:53,040
uh
 

13885
03:55:53,040 --> 03:55:53,990
uh
you know

13886
03:55:53,990 --> 03:55:54,000
you know
 

13887
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:56,309
you know
leave them wanting more of whatever that

13888
03:55:56,309 --> 03:55:56,319
leave them wanting more of whatever that
 

13889
03:55:56,319 --> 03:55:59,590
leave them wanting more of whatever that
uh right that phrase is the thing that

13890
03:55:59,590 --> 03:55:59,600
uh right that phrase is the thing that
 

13891
03:55:59,600 --> 03:56:01,750
uh right that phrase is the thing that
happens is over time

13892
03:56:01,750 --> 03:56:01,760
happens is over time
 

13893
03:56:01,760 --> 03:56:04,070
happens is over time
uh it's possible for certain experiences

13894
03:56:04,070 --> 03:56:04,080
uh it's possible for certain experiences
 

13895
03:56:04,080 --> 03:56:05,750
uh it's possible for certain experiences
to become bland

13896
03:56:05,750 --> 03:56:05,760
to become bland
 

13897
03:56:05,760 --> 03:56:08,150
to become bland
and you become tired of them and that

13898
03:56:08,150 --> 03:56:08,160
and you become tired of them and that
 

13899
03:56:08,160 --> 03:56:09,670
and you become tired of them and that
actually

13900
03:56:09,670 --> 03:56:09,680
actually
 

13901
03:56:09,680 --> 03:56:11,910
actually
makes life um

13902
03:56:11,910 --> 03:56:11,920
makes life um
 

13903
03:56:11,920 --> 03:56:13,910
makes life um
really unpleasant

13904
03:56:13,910 --> 03:56:13,920
really unpleasant
 

13905
03:56:13,920 --> 03:56:15,349
really unpleasant
sorry it makes that experience really

13906
03:56:15,349 --> 03:56:15,359
sorry it makes that experience really
 

13907
03:56:15,359 --> 03:56:16,469
sorry it makes that experience really
unpleasant and perhaps you can

13908
03:56:16,469 --> 03:56:16,479
unpleasant and perhaps you can
 

13909
03:56:16,479 --> 03:56:19,189
unpleasant and perhaps you can
generalize that that to life itself if

13910
03:56:19,189 --> 03:56:19,199
generalize that that to life itself if
 

13911
03:56:19,199 --> 03:56:21,990
generalize that that to life itself if
you have a long enough horizon and so it

13912
03:56:21,990 --> 03:56:22,000
you have a long enough horizon and so it
 

13913
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:23,830
you have a long enough horizon and so it
might happen but we might as well wait

13914
03:56:23,830 --> 03:56:23,840
might happen but we might as well wait
 

13915
03:56:23,840 --> 03:56:25,830
might happen but we might as well wait
and find out but then you're ending it

13916
03:56:25,830 --> 03:56:25,840
and find out but then you're ending it
 

13917
03:56:25,840 --> 03:56:27,429
and find out but then you're ending it
and suffering

13918
03:56:27,429 --> 03:56:27,439
and suffering
 

13919
03:56:27,439 --> 03:56:29,030
and suffering
you know so

13920
03:56:29,030 --> 03:56:29,040
you know so
 

13921
03:56:29,040 --> 03:56:30,950
you know so
in the world of brain emulations i have

13922
03:56:30,950 --> 03:56:30,960
in the world of brain emulations i have
 

13923
03:56:30,960 --> 03:56:32,870
in the world of brain emulations i have
more options

13924
03:56:32,870 --> 03:56:32,880
more options
 

13925
03:56:32,880 --> 03:56:35,510
more options
you can return yourself that is i i can

13926
03:56:35,510 --> 03:56:35,520
you can return yourself that is i i can
 

13927
03:56:35,520 --> 03:56:37,670
you can return yourself that is i i can
make copies of myself archive copies at

13928
03:56:37,670 --> 03:56:37,680
make copies of myself archive copies at
 

13929
03:56:37,680 --> 03:56:39,030
make copies of myself archive copies at
various ages

13930
03:56:39,030 --> 03:56:39,040
various ages
 

13931
03:56:39,040 --> 03:56:40,950
various ages
and at a later age i could decide that

13932
03:56:40,950 --> 03:56:40,960
and at a later age i could decide that
 

13933
03:56:40,960 --> 03:56:42,870
and at a later age i could decide that
i'd rather replace myself with a new

13934
03:56:42,870 --> 03:56:42,880
i'd rather replace myself with a new
 

13935
03:56:42,880 --> 03:56:44,630
i'd rather replace myself with a new
copy from a younger age

13936
03:56:44,630 --> 03:56:44,640
copy from a younger age
 

13937
03:56:44,640 --> 03:56:47,189
copy from a younger age
so does a brain emulation

13938
03:56:47,189 --> 03:56:47,199
so does a brain emulation
 

13939
03:56:47,199 --> 03:56:49,030
so does a brain emulation
still operate in the physical space so

13940
03:56:49,030 --> 03:56:49,040
still operate in the physical space so
 

13941
03:56:49,040 --> 03:56:50,469
still operate in the physical space so
can we do what do you think about like

13942
03:56:50,469 --> 03:56:50,479
can we do what do you think about like
 

13943
03:56:50,479 --> 03:56:52,550
can we do what do you think about like
the metaverse and operating in virtual

13944
03:56:52,550 --> 03:56:52,560
the metaverse and operating in virtual
 

13945
03:56:52,560 --> 03:56:55,429
the metaverse and operating in virtual
reality so we can conjure up not just

13946
03:56:55,429 --> 03:56:55,439
reality so we can conjure up not just
 

13947
03:56:55,439 --> 03:56:58,309
reality so we can conjure up not just
emulate not just your own um

13948
03:56:58,309 --> 03:56:58,319
emulate not just your own um
 

13949
03:56:58,319 --> 03:57:00,389
emulate not just your own um
brain and body but the entirety of the

13950
03:57:00,389 --> 03:57:00,399
brain and body but the entirety of the
 

13951
03:57:00,399 --> 03:57:02,950
brain and body but the entirety of the
environment well most brain emulations

13952
03:57:02,950 --> 03:57:02,960
environment well most brain emulations
 

13953
03:57:02,960 --> 03:57:04,790
environment well most brain emulations
will in fact spose most of their time in

13954
03:57:04,790 --> 03:57:04,800
will in fact spose most of their time in
 

13955
03:57:04,800 --> 03:57:07,189
will in fact spose most of their time in
virtual reality but they wouldn't think

13956
03:57:07,189 --> 03:57:07,199
virtual reality but they wouldn't think
 

13957
03:57:07,199 --> 03:57:09,110
virtual reality but they wouldn't think
of it as virtual reality or just think

13958
03:57:09,110 --> 03:57:09,120
of it as virtual reality or just think
 

13959
03:57:09,120 --> 03:57:11,110
of it as virtual reality or just think
of it as their usual reality

13960
03:57:11,110 --> 03:57:11,120
of it as their usual reality
 

13961
03:57:11,120 --> 03:57:12,950
of it as their usual reality
i mean the thing to notice i think in

13962
03:57:12,950 --> 03:57:12,960
i mean the thing to notice i think in
 

13963
03:57:12,960 --> 03:57:14,710
i mean the thing to notice i think in
our world most of us spend time most

13964
03:57:14,710 --> 03:57:14,720
our world most of us spend time most
 

13965
03:57:14,720 --> 03:57:16,309
our world most of us spend time most
time indoors

13966
03:57:16,309 --> 03:57:16,319
time indoors
 

13967
03:57:16,319 --> 03:57:18,630
time indoors
and indoors we are surrounded by

13968
03:57:18,630 --> 03:57:18,640
and indoors we are surrounded by
 

13969
03:57:18,640 --> 03:57:20,790
and indoors we are surrounded by
walls covered with paint and floors

13970
03:57:20,790 --> 03:57:20,800
walls covered with paint and floors
 

13971
03:57:20,800 --> 03:57:23,590
walls covered with paint and floors
covered with tile or rugs

13972
03:57:23,590 --> 03:57:23,600
covered with tile or rugs
 

13973
03:57:23,600 --> 03:57:26,389
covered with tile or rugs
most of our environment is artificial

13974
03:57:26,389 --> 03:57:26,399
most of our environment is artificial
 

13975
03:57:26,399 --> 03:57:28,550
most of our environment is artificial
it's constructed to be convenient for us

13976
03:57:28,550 --> 03:57:28,560
it's constructed to be convenient for us
 

13977
03:57:28,560 --> 03:57:30,070
it's constructed to be convenient for us
it's not the natural world that was

13978
03:57:30,070 --> 03:57:30,080
it's not the natural world that was
 

13979
03:57:30,080 --> 03:57:32,229
it's not the natural world that was
there before a virtual reality is

13980
03:57:32,229 --> 03:57:32,239
there before a virtual reality is
 

13981
03:57:32,239 --> 03:57:34,550
there before a virtual reality is
basically just like that it is the

13982
03:57:34,550 --> 03:57:34,560
basically just like that it is the
 

13983
03:57:34,560 --> 03:57:35,830
basically just like that it is the
environment that's comfortable and

13984
03:57:35,830 --> 03:57:35,840
environment that's comfortable and
 

13985
03:57:35,840 --> 03:57:37,349
environment that's comfortable and
convenient for you

13986
03:57:37,349 --> 03:57:37,359
convenient for you
 

13987
03:57:37,359 --> 03:57:39,750
convenient for you
and but if if when it's the right that

13988
03:57:39,750 --> 03:57:39,760
and but if if when it's the right that
 

13989
03:57:39,760 --> 03:57:41,349
and but if if when it's the right that
environment for you it's real for you

13990
03:57:41,349 --> 03:57:41,359
environment for you it's real for you
 

13991
03:57:41,359 --> 03:57:43,189
environment for you it's real for you
just like the room you're in right now

13992
03:57:43,189 --> 03:57:43,199
just like the room you're in right now
 

13993
03:57:43,199 --> 03:57:45,189
just like the room you're in right now
most likely is very real for you you're

13994
03:57:45,189 --> 03:57:45,199
most likely is very real for you you're
 

13995
03:57:45,199 --> 03:57:45,910
most likely is very real for you you're
not

13996
03:57:45,910 --> 03:57:45,920
not
 

13997
03:57:45,920 --> 03:57:47,269
not
focused on the fact that the paint is

13998
03:57:47,269 --> 03:57:47,279
focused on the fact that the paint is
 

13999
03:57:47,279 --> 03:57:49,830
focused on the fact that the paint is
hiding the actual studs behind the wall

14000
03:57:49,830 --> 03:57:49,840
hiding the actual studs behind the wall
 

14001
03:57:49,840 --> 03:57:51,590
hiding the actual studs behind the wall
and the actual wires and pipes and

14002
03:57:51,590 --> 03:57:51,600
and the actual wires and pipes and
 

14003
03:57:51,600 --> 03:57:52,870
and the actual wires and pipes and
everything else

03:57:52,870 --> 03:57:52,880
everything else
 

14005
03:57:52,880 --> 03:57:54,229
everything else
the fact that we're hiding that from you

14006
03:57:54,229 --> 03:57:54,239
the fact that we're hiding that from you
 

14007
03:57:54,239 --> 03:57:58,389
the fact that we're hiding that from you
doesn't make it fake or unreal

14008
03:57:58,389 --> 03:57:58,399

 

14009
03:57:58,399 --> 03:58:00,229

what are the chances

14010
03:58:00,229 --> 03:58:00,239
what are the chances
 

14011
03:58:00,239 --> 03:58:03,269
what are the chances
that we're actually in the very kind of

14012
03:58:03,269 --> 03:58:03,279
that we're actually in the very kind of
 

14013
03:58:03,279 --> 03:58:04,950
that we're actually in the very kind of
system that you're describing where the

14014
03:58:04,950 --> 03:58:04,960
system that you're describing where the
 

14015
03:58:04,960 --> 03:58:06,710
system that you're describing where the
the environment and the brain is being

14016
03:58:06,710 --> 03:58:06,720
the environment and the brain is being
 

14017
03:58:06,720 --> 03:58:08,389
the environment and the brain is being
emulated and you're just replaying an

14018
03:58:08,389 --> 03:58:08,399
emulated and you're just replaying an
 

14019
03:58:08,399 --> 03:58:11,510
emulated and you're just replaying an
experience when you or first

14020
03:58:11,510 --> 03:58:11,520
experience when you or first
 

14021
03:58:11,520 --> 03:58:14,309
experience when you or first
did a podcast with lex

14022
03:58:14,309 --> 03:58:14,319
did a podcast with lex
 

14023
03:58:14,319 --> 03:58:16,710
did a podcast with lex
after and now you know the person that

14024
03:58:16,710 --> 03:58:16,720
after and now you know the person that
 

14025
03:58:16,720 --> 03:58:18,309
after and now you know the person that
originally launched this already did

14026
03:58:18,309 --> 03:58:18,319
originally launched this already did
 

14027
03:58:18,319 --> 03:58:20,070
originally launched this already did
hundreds of podcasts with lex this is

14028
03:58:20,070 --> 03:58:20,080
hundreds of podcasts with lex this is
 

14029
03:58:20,080 --> 03:58:21,990
hundreds of podcasts with lex this is
just the first time and you like this

14030
03:58:21,990 --> 03:58:22,000
just the first time and you like this
 

14031
03:58:22,000 --> 03:58:24,550
just the first time and you like this
time because there's so much uncertainty

14032
03:58:24,550 --> 03:58:24,560
time because there's so much uncertainty
 

14033
03:58:24,560 --> 03:58:26,229
time because there's so much uncertainty
there's nerves you could have gone any

14034
03:58:26,229 --> 03:58:26,239
there's nerves you could have gone any
 

14035
03:58:26,239 --> 03:58:27,590
there's nerves you could have gone any
direction

14036
03:58:27,590 --> 03:58:27,600
direction
 

14037
03:58:27,600 --> 03:58:29,510
direction
um at the moment we don't have the

14038
03:58:29,510 --> 03:58:29,520
um at the moment we don't have the
 

14039
03:58:29,520 --> 03:58:31,670
um at the moment we don't have the
technical ability to create

14040
03:58:31,670 --> 03:58:31,680
technical ability to create
 

14041
03:58:31,680 --> 03:58:33,349
technical ability to create
that an emulation so we'd have to be

14042
03:58:33,349 --> 03:58:33,359
that an emulation so we'd have to be
 

14043
03:58:33,359 --> 03:58:35,830
that an emulation so we'd have to be
postulating that in the future we have

14044
03:58:35,830 --> 03:58:35,840
postulating that in the future we have
 

14045
03:58:35,840 --> 03:58:37,670
postulating that in the future we have
that ability and then they choose to

14046
03:58:37,670 --> 03:58:37,680
that ability and then they choose to
 

14047
03:58:37,680 --> 03:58:39,910
that ability and then they choose to
evaluate this moment now no but to

14048
03:58:39,910 --> 03:58:39,920
evaluate this moment now no but to
 

14049
03:58:39,920 --> 03:58:41,830
evaluate this moment now no but to
simulate it don't you think we're we

14050
03:58:41,830 --> 03:58:41,840
simulate it don't you think we're we
 

14051
03:58:41,840 --> 03:58:44,469
simulate it don't you think we're we
could be in the simulation of that exact

14052
03:58:44,469 --> 03:58:44,479
could be in the simulation of that exact
 

14053
03:58:44,479 --> 03:58:45,990
could be in the simulation of that exact
experience right now we wouldn't be able

14054
03:58:45,990 --> 03:58:46,000
experience right now we wouldn't be able
 

14055
03:58:46,000 --> 03:58:47,030
experience right now we wouldn't be able
to know

14056
03:58:47,030 --> 03:58:47,040
to know
 

14057
03:58:47,040 --> 03:58:48,309
to know
so

14058
03:58:48,309 --> 03:58:48,319
so
 

14059
03:58:48,319 --> 03:58:50,469
so
one scenario would be this never really

14060
03:58:50,469 --> 03:58:50,479
one scenario would be this never really
 

14061
03:58:50,479 --> 03:58:52,630
one scenario would be this never really
happened this only happens as a

14062
03:58:52,630 --> 03:58:52,640
happened this only happens as a
 

14063
03:58:52,640 --> 03:58:55,269
happened this only happens as a
reconstruction later on yeah that's

14064
03:58:55,269 --> 03:58:55,279
reconstruction later on yeah that's
 

14065
03:58:55,279 --> 03:58:57,030
reconstruction later on yeah that's
different than scenario this did happen

14066
03:58:57,030 --> 03:58:57,040
different than scenario this did happen
 

14067
03:58:57,040 --> 03:58:58,550
different than scenario this did happen
the first time and now it's happening

14068
03:58:58,550 --> 03:58:58,560
the first time and now it's happening
 

14069
03:58:58,560 --> 03:59:01,030
the first time and now it's happening
again as a reconstruction

14070
03:59:01,030 --> 03:59:01,040
again as a reconstruction
 

14071
03:59:01,040 --> 03:59:03,349
again as a reconstruction
second scenario is harder to put

14072
03:59:03,349 --> 03:59:03,359
second scenario is harder to put
 

14073
03:59:03,359 --> 03:59:05,189
second scenario is harder to put
together because it requires this

14074
03:59:05,189 --> 03:59:05,199
together because it requires this
 

14075
03:59:05,199 --> 03:59:07,429
together because it requires this
coincidence where between the two times

14076
03:59:07,429 --> 03:59:07,439
coincidence where between the two times
 

14077
03:59:07,439 --> 03:59:09,830
coincidence where between the two times
we produce the ability to do it

14078
03:59:09,830 --> 03:59:09,840
we produce the ability to do it
 

14079
03:59:09,840 --> 03:59:11,750
we produce the ability to do it
um no but don't you think replay of

14080
03:59:11,750 --> 03:59:11,760
um no but don't you think replay of
 

14081
03:59:11,760 --> 03:59:15,670
um no but don't you think replay of
memories uh um poor replay

14082
03:59:15,670 --> 03:59:15,680
memories uh um poor replay
 

14083
03:59:15,680 --> 03:59:17,510
memories uh um poor replay
of memories is

14084
03:59:17,510 --> 03:59:17,520
of memories is
 

14085
03:59:17,520 --> 03:59:19,429
of memories is
so that might be a possible thing in the

14086
03:59:19,429 --> 03:59:19,439
so that might be a possible thing in the
 

14087
03:59:19,439 --> 03:59:21,110
so that might be a possible thing in the
future saying it's harder than conjure

14088
03:59:21,110 --> 03:59:21,120
future saying it's harder than conjure
 

14089
03:59:21,120 --> 03:59:23,590
future saying it's harder than conjure
up things from scratch

14090
03:59:23,590 --> 03:59:23,600
up things from scratch
 

14091
03:59:23,600 --> 03:59:25,910
up things from scratch
it's certainly possible so the main way

14092
03:59:25,910 --> 03:59:25,920
it's certainly possible so the main way
 

14093
03:59:25,920 --> 03:59:27,670
it's certainly possible so the main way
i would think about it is in terms of

14094
03:59:27,670 --> 03:59:27,680
i would think about it is in terms of
 

14095
03:59:27,680 --> 03:59:30,150
i would think about it is in terms of
the demand for simulation versus other

14096
03:59:30,150 --> 03:59:30,160
the demand for simulation versus other
 

14097
03:59:30,160 --> 03:59:32,229
the demand for simulation versus other
kinds of things so i've given this a lot

14098
03:59:32,229 --> 03:59:32,239
kinds of things so i've given this a lot
 

14099
03:59:32,239 --> 03:59:34,309
kinds of things so i've given this a lot

of thought because you know i first
 

14101
03:59:34,319 --> 03:59:36,150
of thought because you know i first
wrote about this long ago when bostrom

14102
03:59:36,150 --> 03:59:36,160
wrote about this long ago when bostrom
 

14103
03:59:36,160 --> 03:59:38,229
wrote about this long ago when bostrom
first wrote his papers about simulation

14104
03:59:38,229 --> 03:59:38,239
first wrote his papers about simulation
 

14105
03:59:38,239 --> 03:59:39,670
first wrote his papers about simulation
argument and i wrote about how to live

14106
03:59:39,670 --> 03:59:39,680
argument and i wrote about how to live
 

14107
03:59:39,680 --> 03:59:41,110
argument and i wrote about how to live
in a simulation

14108
03:59:41,110 --> 03:59:41,120
in a simulation
 

14109
03:59:41,120 --> 03:59:42,150
in a simulation
um

14110
03:59:42,150 --> 03:59:42,160
um
 

14111
03:59:42,160 --> 03:59:44,070
um
and

14112
03:59:44,070 --> 03:59:44,080
and
 

14113
03:59:44,080 --> 03:59:46,229
and
so the key issue is

14114
03:59:46,229 --> 03:59:46,239
so the key issue is
 

14115
03:59:46,239 --> 03:59:47,910
so the key issue is
you know the fraction of creatures in

14116
03:59:47,910 --> 03:59:47,920
you know the fraction of creatures in
 

14117
03:59:47,920 --> 03:59:49,910
you know the fraction of creatures in
the universe that are really

14118
03:59:49,910 --> 03:59:49,920
the universe that are really
 

14119
03:59:49,920 --> 03:59:51,510
the universe that are really
experiencing what you appear to be

14120
03:59:51,510 --> 03:59:51,520
experiencing what you appear to be
 

14121
03:59:51,520 --> 03:59:53,110
experiencing what you appear to be
really experiencing relative to the

14122
03:59:53,110 --> 03:59:53,120
really experiencing relative to the
 

14123
03:59:53,120 --> 03:59:55,429
really experiencing relative to the
fraction that are experiencing it in a

14124
03:59:55,429 --> 03:59:55,439
fraction that are experiencing it in a
 

14125
03:59:55,439 --> 03:59:59,510
fraction that are experiencing it in a
simulation way i.e simulated so

14126
03:59:59,510 --> 03:59:59,520
simulation way i.e simulated so
 

14127
03:59:59,520 --> 04:00:00,550
simulation way i.e simulated so
then

14128
04:00:00,550 --> 04:00:00,560
then
 

14129
04:00:00,560 --> 04:00:03,030
then
the key parameter is at any one moment

14130
04:00:03,030 --> 04:00:03,040
the key parameter is at any one moment
 

14131
04:00:03,040 --> 04:00:04,710
the key parameter is at any one moment
in time

14132
04:00:04,710 --> 04:00:04,720
in time
 

14133
04:00:04,720 --> 04:00:07,030
in time
creatures at that time many of them most

14134
04:00:07,030 --> 04:00:07,040
creatures at that time many of them most
 

14135
04:00:07,040 --> 04:00:08,630
creatures at that time many of them most
of them are presumably really

14136
04:00:08,630 --> 04:00:08,640
of them are presumably really
 

14137
04:00:08,640 --> 04:00:09,910
of them are presumably really
experiencing what they're experiencing

14138
04:00:09,910 --> 04:00:09,920
experiencing what they're experiencing
 

14139
04:00:09,920 --> 04:00:11,590
experiencing what they're experiencing
but some fraction of them are

14140
04:00:11,590 --> 04:00:11,600
but some fraction of them are
 

14141
04:00:11,600 --> 04:00:14,550
but some fraction of them are
experiencing some past time

14142
04:00:14,550 --> 04:00:14,560
experiencing some past time
 

14143
04:00:14,560 --> 04:00:17,269
experiencing some past time
where that past time is being remembered

14144
04:00:17,269 --> 04:00:17,279
where that past time is being remembered
 

14145
04:00:17,279 --> 04:00:19,670
where that past time is being remembered
via their simulation

14146
04:00:19,670 --> 04:00:19,680
via their simulation
 

14147
04:00:19,680 --> 04:00:21,510
via their simulation
so um

14148
04:00:21,510 --> 04:00:21,520
so um
 

14149
04:00:21,520 --> 04:00:23,269
so um
to figure out this ratio what we need to

14150
04:00:23,269 --> 04:00:23,279
to figure out this ratio what we need to
 

14151
04:00:23,279 --> 04:00:25,110
to figure out this ratio what we need to
think about is basically

14152
04:00:25,110 --> 04:00:25,120
think about is basically
 

14153
04:00:25,120 --> 04:00:27,990
think about is basically
two functions one is how fast in time

14154
04:00:27,990 --> 04:00:28,000
two functions one is how fast in time
 

14155
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:30,229
two functions one is how fast in time
does the number of creatures grow

14156
04:00:30,229 --> 04:00:30,239
does the number of creatures grow
 

14157
04:00:30,239 --> 04:00:32,309
does the number of creatures grow
and then how fast in time does the

14158
04:00:32,309 --> 04:00:32,319
and then how fast in time does the
 

14159
04:00:32,319 --> 04:00:34,710
and then how fast in time does the
interest in the past decline

14160
04:00:34,710 --> 04:00:34,720
interest in the past decline
 

14161
04:00:34,720 --> 04:00:37,189
interest in the past decline
because at any one time people will be

14162
04:00:37,189 --> 04:00:37,199
because at any one time people will be
 

14163
04:00:37,199 --> 04:00:39,510
because at any one time people will be
simulating different periods in the past

14164
04:00:39,510 --> 04:00:39,520
simulating different periods in the past
 

14165
04:00:39,520 --> 04:00:40,950
simulating different periods in the past
with different emphasis

14166
04:00:40,950 --> 04:00:40,960
with different emphasis
 

14167
04:00:40,960 --> 04:00:42,790
with different emphasis
the way you think so much

14168
04:00:42,790 --> 04:00:42,800
the way you think so much
 

14169
04:00:42,800 --> 04:00:45,110
the way you think so much
that's exactly right yeah so

14170
04:00:45,110 --> 04:00:45,120
that's exactly right yeah so
 

14171
04:00:45,120 --> 04:00:47,910
that's exactly right yeah so
if if the first function grows slower

14172
04:00:47,910 --> 04:00:47,920
if if the first function grows slower
 

14173
04:00:47,920 --> 04:00:50,309
if if the first function grows slower
then the second one declines

14174
04:00:50,309 --> 04:00:50,319
then the second one declines
 

14175
04:00:50,319 --> 04:00:52,389
then the second one declines
then in fact your chances of being

14176
04:00:52,389 --> 04:00:52,399
then in fact your chances of being
 

14177
04:00:52,399 --> 04:00:53,590
then in fact your chances of being
simulated

14178
04:00:53,590 --> 04:00:53,600
simulated
 

14179
04:00:53,600 --> 04:00:55,349
simulated
are low

14180
04:00:55,349 --> 04:00:55,359
are low
 

14181
04:00:55,359 --> 04:00:57,510
are low
yes so the key question is how fast does

14182
04:00:57,510 --> 04:00:57,520
yes so the key question is how fast does
 

14183
04:00:57,520 --> 04:00:59,910
yes so the key question is how fast does
interest in the past decline relative to

14184
04:00:59,910 --> 04:00:59,920
interest in the past decline relative to
 

14185
04:00:59,920 --> 04:01:01,510
interest in the past decline relative to
the rate at which the population grows

14186
04:01:01,510 --> 04:01:01,520
the rate at which the population grows
 

14187
04:01:01,520 --> 04:01:03,269
the rate at which the population grows
with time does this correlate to you

14188
04:01:03,269 --> 04:01:03,279
with time does this correlate to you
 

14189
04:01:03,279 --> 04:01:04,950
with time does this correlate to you
earlier suggested that the interest in

14190
04:01:04,950 --> 04:01:04,960
earlier suggested that the interest in
 

14191
04:01:04,960 --> 04:01:07,349
earlier suggested that the interest in
the future increases over time

14192
04:01:07,349 --> 04:01:07,359
the future increases over time
 

14193
04:01:07,359 --> 04:01:09,189
the future increases over time
are those correlated interests in the

14194
04:01:09,189 --> 04:01:09,199
are those correlated interests in the
 

14195
04:01:09,199 --> 04:01:10,950
are those correlated interests in the
future versus interest in the past like

14196
04:01:10,950 --> 04:01:10,960
future versus interest in the past like
 

14197
04:01:10,960 --> 04:01:13,349
future versus interest in the past like
why do why are we interested in the past

14198
04:01:13,349 --> 04:01:13,359
why do why are we interested in the past
 

14199
04:01:13,359 --> 04:01:15,110
why do why are we interested in the past
but the simple way to do is as you know

14200
04:01:15,110 --> 04:01:15,120
but the simple way to do is as you know
 

14201
04:01:15,120 --> 04:01:17,349
but the simple way to do is as you know
like google engrams has a way to type in

14202
04:01:17,349 --> 04:01:17,359
like google engrams has a way to type in
 

14203
04:01:17,359 --> 04:01:19,990
like google engrams has a way to type in
a word and see how interested in client

14204
04:01:19,990 --> 04:01:20,000
a word and see how interested in client
 

14205
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:22,229
a word and see how interested in client
declines arises over time right yeah you

14206
04:01:22,229 --> 04:01:22,239
declines arises over time right yeah you
 

14207
04:01:22,239 --> 04:01:23,590
declines arises over time right yeah you
can just type in a year and get the

14208
04:01:23,590 --> 04:01:23,600
can just type in a year and get the
 

14209
04:01:23,600 --> 04:01:25,429
can just type in a year and get the
answer for that if you type in a

14210
04:01:25,429 --> 04:01:25,439
answer for that if you type in a
 

14211
04:01:25,439 --> 04:01:27,590
answer for that if you type in a
particular year like 1900

14212
04:01:27,590 --> 04:01:27,600
particular year like 1900
 

14213
04:01:27,600 --> 04:01:30,950
particular year like 1900
or 1950 you can see with google engram

14214
04:01:30,950 --> 04:01:30,960
or 1950 you can see with google engram
 

14215
04:01:30,960 --> 04:01:32,710
or 1950 you can see with google engram
how interest in that year

14216
04:01:32,710 --> 04:01:32,720
how interest in that year
 

14217
04:01:32,720 --> 04:01:34,150
how interest in that year
increased up until that date and

14218
04:01:34,150 --> 04:01:34,160
increased up until that date and
 

14219
04:01:34,160 --> 04:01:36,630
increased up until that date and
decreased after it yep and you can see

14220
04:01:36,630 --> 04:01:36,640
decreased after it yep and you can see
 

14221
04:01:36,640 --> 04:01:39,590
decreased after it yep and you can see
that interest in a date declines faster

14222
04:01:39,590 --> 04:01:39,600
that interest in a date declines faster
 

14223
04:01:39,600 --> 04:01:43,590
that interest in a date declines faster
than does the population grow with time

14224
04:01:43,590 --> 04:01:43,600
than does the population grow with time
 

14225
04:01:43,600 --> 04:01:45,349
than does the population grow with time
that is brilliant

14226
04:01:45,349 --> 04:01:45,359
that is brilliant
 

14227
04:01:45,359 --> 04:01:46,950
that is brilliant
and so that's so interesting to have the

14228
04:01:46,950 --> 04:01:46,960
and so that's so interesting to have the
 

14229
04:01:46,960 --> 04:01:48,950
and so that's so interesting to have the
answer

14230
04:01:48,950 --> 04:01:48,960
answer
 

14231
04:01:48,960 --> 04:01:50,630
answer
wow

14232
04:01:50,630 --> 04:01:50,640
wow
 

14233
04:01:50,640 --> 04:01:53,110
wow
and that was your argument against

14234
04:01:53,110 --> 04:01:53,120
and that was your argument against
 

14235
04:01:53,120 --> 04:01:55,510
and that was your argument against
not against this particular aspect of

14236
04:01:55,510 --> 04:01:55,520
not against this particular aspect of
 

14237
04:01:55,520 --> 04:01:58,150
not against this particular aspect of
the simulation how much

14238
04:01:58,150 --> 04:01:58,160
the simulation how much
 

14239
04:01:58,160 --> 04:02:00,389
the simulation how much
past simulation there will be

14240
04:02:00,389 --> 04:02:00,399
past simulation there will be
 

14241
04:02:00,399 --> 04:02:02,309
past simulation there will be
a replay of past memories first of all

14242
04:02:02,309 --> 04:02:02,319
a replay of past memories first of all
 

14243
04:02:02,319 --> 04:02:04,150
a replay of past memories first of all
if we assume that like simulation of the

14244
04:02:04,150 --> 04:02:04,160
if we assume that like simulation of the
 

14245
04:02:04,160 --> 04:02:05,990
if we assume that like simulation of the
past is a small fraction of all the

14246
04:02:05,990 --> 04:02:06,000
past is a small fraction of all the
 

14247
04:02:06,000 --> 04:02:08,870
past is a small fraction of all the
creatures at that moment yes right

14248
04:02:08,870 --> 04:02:08,880
creatures at that moment yes right
 

14249
04:02:08,880 --> 04:02:10,870
creatures at that moment yes right
and then it's about how fast now some

14250
04:02:10,870 --> 04:02:10,880
and then it's about how fast now some
 

14251
04:02:10,880 --> 04:02:13,510
and then it's about how fast now some
people have argued plausibly that maybe

14252
04:02:13,510 --> 04:02:13,520
people have argued plausibly that maybe
 

14253
04:02:13,520 --> 04:02:14,389
people have argued plausibly that maybe
most

14254
04:02:14,389 --> 04:02:14,399
most
 

14255
04:02:14,399 --> 04:02:15,830
most
interest in the past falls with this

14256
04:02:15,830 --> 04:02:15,840
interest in the past falls with this
 

14257
04:02:15,840 --> 04:02:17,990
interest in the past falls with this
fast function but some unusual category

14258
04:02:17,990 --> 04:02:18,000
fast function but some unusual category
 

14259
04:02:18,000 --> 04:02:19,670
fast function but some unusual category
of interest in the fast won't fall that

14260
04:02:19,670 --> 04:02:19,680
of interest in the fast won't fall that
 

14261
04:02:19,680 --> 04:02:21,269
of interest in the fast won't fall that
fat quickly and then that eventually

14262
04:02:21,269 --> 04:02:21,279
fat quickly and then that eventually
 

14263
04:02:21,279 --> 04:02:23,349
fat quickly and then that eventually
would dominate so that's a other

14264
04:02:23,349 --> 04:02:23,359
would dominate so that's a other
 

14265
04:02:23,359 --> 04:02:26,229
would dominate so that's a other
hypothesis some category so that that

14266
04:02:26,229 --> 04:02:26,239
hypothesis some category so that that
 

14267
04:02:26,239 --> 04:02:28,710
hypothesis some category so that that
very outlier specific kind of yeah okay

14268
04:02:28,710 --> 04:02:28,720
very outlier specific kind of yeah okay
 

14269
04:02:28,720 --> 04:02:32,070
very outlier specific kind of yeah okay
yeah yeah yeah like really popular

14270
04:02:32,070 --> 04:02:32,080
yeah yeah yeah like really popular
 

14271
04:02:32,080 --> 04:02:34,150
yeah yeah yeah like really popular
kinds of memories like

14272
04:02:34,150 --> 04:02:34,160
kinds of memories like
 

14273
04:02:34,160 --> 04:02:35,750
kinds of memories like
second probably second in a trillion

14274
04:02:35,750 --> 04:02:35,760
second probably second in a trillion
 

14275
04:02:35,760 --> 04:02:37,990
second probably second in a trillion
years there's some small research

14276
04:02:37,990 --> 04:02:38,000
years there's some small research
 

14277
04:02:38,000 --> 04:02:40,070
years there's some small research
institute that tries to randomly select

14278
04:02:40,070 --> 04:02:40,080
institute that tries to randomly select
 

14279
04:02:40,080 --> 04:02:43,349
institute that tries to randomly select
from all possible people in history yeah

14280
04:02:43,349 --> 04:02:43,359
from all possible people in history yeah
 

14281
04:02:43,359 --> 04:02:44,630
from all possible people in history yeah
yeah

14282
04:02:44,630 --> 04:02:44,640
yeah
 

14283
04:02:44,640 --> 04:02:45,830
yeah
yeah

14284
04:02:45,830 --> 04:02:45,840
yeah
 

14285
04:02:45,840 --> 04:02:48,309
yeah
yeah yeah how big is this research

14286
04:02:48,309 --> 04:02:48,319
yeah yeah how big is this research
 

14287
04:02:48,319 --> 04:02:50,309
yeah yeah how big is this research
institute and how big is the future in a

14288
04:02:50,309 --> 04:02:50,319
institute and how big is the future in a
 

14289
04:02:50,319 --> 04:02:51,830
institute and how big is the future in a
trillion years right and that's that

14290
04:02:51,830 --> 04:02:51,840
trillion years right and that's that
 

14291
04:02:51,840 --> 04:02:53,590
trillion years right and that's that
would be hard to say but if we just look

14292
04:02:53,590 --> 04:02:53,600
would be hard to say but if we just look
 

14293
04:02:53,600 --> 04:02:55,349
would be hard to say but if we just look
at the ordinary process by which people

14294
04:02:55,349 --> 04:02:55,359
at the ordinary process by which people
 

14295
04:02:55,359 --> 04:02:57,429
at the ordinary process by which people
simulate recent

14296
04:02:57,429 --> 04:02:57,439
simulate recent
 

14297
04:02:57,439 --> 04:02:59,269
simulate recent
errors so if you look at well i think

14298
04:02:59,269 --> 04:02:59,279
errors so if you look at well i think
 

14299
04:02:59,279 --> 04:03:00,870
errors so if you look at well i think
it's also true for movies and plays and

14300
04:03:00,870 --> 04:03:00,880
it's also true for movies and plays and
 

14301
04:03:00,880 --> 04:03:02,870
it's also true for movies and plays and
video games overwhelming they're

14302
04:03:02,870 --> 04:03:02,880
video games overwhelming they're
 

14303
04:03:02,880 --> 04:03:04,790
video games overwhelming they're
interested in the recent past

14304
04:03:04,790 --> 04:03:04,800
interested in the recent past
 

14305
04:03:04,800 --> 04:03:06,229
interested in the recent past
there's very few video games where you

14306
04:03:06,229 --> 04:03:06,239
there's very few video games where you
 

14307
04:03:06,239 --> 04:03:09,349
there's very few video games where you
play someone in the roman empire right

14308
04:03:09,349 --> 04:03:09,359
play someone in the roman empire right
 

14309
04:03:09,359 --> 04:03:11,030
play someone in the roman empire right
even fewer where you play someone in the

14310
04:03:11,030 --> 04:03:11,040
even fewer where you play someone in the
 

14311
04:03:11,040 --> 04:03:14,229
even fewer where you play someone in the
ancient egyptian empire

14312
04:03:14,229 --> 04:03:14,239
ancient egyptian empire
 

14313
04:03:14,239 --> 04:03:16,070
ancient egyptian empire
yeah just indifferent it's just declined

14314
04:03:16,070 --> 04:03:16,080
yeah just indifferent it's just declined
 

14315
04:03:16,080 --> 04:03:17,830
yeah just indifferent it's just declined
very quickly but every once in a while

14316
04:03:17,830 --> 04:03:17,840
very quickly but every once in a while
 

14317
04:03:17,840 --> 04:03:19,990
very quickly but every once in a while
that's brought back

14318
04:03:19,990 --> 04:03:20,000
that's brought back
 

14319
04:03:20,000 --> 04:03:22,469
that's brought back
um but yeah you're right i mean just if

14320
04:03:22,469 --> 04:03:22,479
um but yeah you're right i mean just if
 

14321
04:03:22,479 --> 04:03:25,110
um but yeah you're right i mean just if
you look at the mass of entertainment

14322
04:03:25,110 --> 04:03:25,120
you look at the mass of entertainment
 

14323
04:03:25,120 --> 04:03:27,670
you look at the mass of entertainment
movies and games it's it's focusing on

14324
04:03:27,670 --> 04:03:27,680
movies and games it's it's focusing on
 

14325
04:03:27,680 --> 04:03:30,229
movies and games it's it's focusing on
the present recent past and maybe some i

14326
04:03:30,229 --> 04:03:30,239
the present recent past and maybe some i
 

14327
04:03:30,239 --> 04:03:31,990
the present recent past and maybe some i
mean where does science fiction fit into

14328
04:03:31,990 --> 04:03:32,000
mean where does science fiction fit into
 

14329
04:03:32,000 --> 04:03:33,830
mean where does science fiction fit into
this because

14330
04:03:33,830 --> 04:03:33,840
this because
 

14331
04:03:33,840 --> 04:03:36,830
this because
um it's sort of uh

14332
04:03:36,830 --> 04:03:36,840
um it's sort of uh
 

14333
04:03:36,840 --> 04:03:39,429
um it's sort of uh
uh what is science fiction i mean it's a

14334
04:03:39,429 --> 04:03:39,439
uh what is science fiction i mean it's a
 

14335
04:03:39,439 --> 04:03:41,110
uh what is science fiction i mean it's a
mix of the past and the present and some

14336
04:03:41,110 --> 04:03:41,120
mix of the past and the present and some
 

14337
04:03:41,120 --> 04:03:43,670
mix of the past and the present and some
kind of manipulation of that right to uh

14338
04:03:43,670 --> 04:03:43,680
kind of manipulation of that right to uh
 

14339
04:03:43,680 --> 04:03:45,830
kind of manipulation of that right to uh
make it more efficient for us to ask

14340
04:03:45,830 --> 04:03:45,840
make it more efficient for us to ask
 

14341
04:03:45,840 --> 04:03:48,229
make it more efficient for us to ask
deep philosophical questions about

14342
04:03:48,229 --> 04:03:48,239
deep philosophical questions about
 

14343
04:03:48,239 --> 04:03:49,990
deep philosophical questions about
humanity the closest genre to science

14344
04:03:49,990 --> 04:03:50,000
humanity the closest genre to science
 

14345
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:51,990
humanity the closest genre to science
fiction is clearly fantasy fantasy and

14346
04:03:51,990 --> 04:03:52,000
fiction is clearly fantasy fantasy and
 

14347
04:03:52,000 --> 04:03:53,830
fiction is clearly fantasy fantasy and
science fiction many bookstores and even

14348
04:03:53,830 --> 04:03:53,840
science fiction many bookstores and even
 

14349
04:03:53,840 --> 04:03:55,269
science fiction many bookstores and even
netflix or whatever categories they're

14350
04:03:55,269 --> 04:03:55,279
netflix or whatever categories they're
 

14351
04:03:55,279 --> 04:03:56,630
netflix or whatever categories they're
just lumped together

14352
04:03:56,630 --> 04:03:56,640
just lumped together
 

14353
04:03:56,640 --> 04:03:58,790
just lumped together
so clearly they have a similar function

14354
04:03:58,790 --> 04:03:58,800
so clearly they have a similar function
 

14355
04:03:58,800 --> 04:04:01,110
so clearly they have a similar function
so that the function of fantasy is more

14356
04:04:01,110 --> 04:04:01,120
so that the function of fantasy is more
 

14357
04:04:01,120 --> 04:04:02,469
so that the function of fantasy is more
transparent than the function of science

14358
04:04:02,469 --> 04:04:02,479
transparent than the function of science
 

14359
04:04:02,479 --> 04:04:04,790
transparent than the function of science
fiction so use that as your guide

14360
04:04:04,790 --> 04:04:04,800
fiction so use that as your guide
 

14361
04:04:04,800 --> 04:04:06,790
fiction so use that as your guide
what's fantasy for it's just

14362
04:04:06,790 --> 04:04:06,800
what's fantasy for it's just
 

14363
04:04:06,800 --> 04:04:08,229
what's fantasy for it's just
to take away the constraints of the

14364
04:04:08,229 --> 04:04:08,239
to take away the constraints of the
 

14365
04:04:08,239 --> 04:04:09,910
to take away the constraints of the
ordinary world and imagine stories with

14366
04:04:09,910 --> 04:04:09,920
ordinary world and imagine stories with
 

14367
04:04:09,920 --> 04:04:11,590
ordinary world and imagine stories with
much fewer constraints right that's what

14368
04:04:11,590 --> 04:04:11,600
much fewer constraints right that's what
 

14369
04:04:11,600 --> 04:04:13,670
much fewer constraints right that's what
fantasy is you're much less constrained

14370
04:04:13,670 --> 04:04:13,680
fantasy is you're much less constrained
 

14371
04:04:13,680 --> 04:04:15,429
fantasy is you're much less constrained
what's the purpose to remove constraints

14372
04:04:15,429 --> 04:04:15,439
what's the purpose to remove constraints
 

14373
04:04:15,439 --> 04:04:17,110
what's the purpose to remove constraints
is it to escape

14374
04:04:17,110 --> 04:04:17,120
is it to escape
 

14375
04:04:17,120 --> 04:04:18,870
is it to escape
from the harshness of the constraints of

14376
04:04:18,870 --> 04:04:18,880
from the harshness of the constraints of
 

14377
04:04:18,880 --> 04:04:21,429
from the harshness of the constraints of
the real world or is it to just remove

14378
04:04:21,429 --> 04:04:21,439
the real world or is it to just remove
 

14379
04:04:21,439 --> 04:04:23,750
the real world or is it to just remove
constraints in order to explore some

14380
04:04:23,750 --> 04:04:23,760
constraints in order to explore some
 

14381
04:04:23,760 --> 04:04:25,990
constraints in order to explore some
some get a deeper understanding of our

14382
04:04:25,990 --> 04:04:26,000
some get a deeper understanding of our
 

14383
04:04:26,000 --> 04:04:27,030
some get a deeper understanding of our
world

14384
04:04:27,030 --> 04:04:27,040
world
 

14385
04:04:27,040 --> 04:04:28,950
world
what is it i mean why do people read i'm

14386
04:04:28,950 --> 04:04:28,960
what is it i mean why do people read i'm
 

14387
04:04:28,960 --> 04:04:31,349
what is it i mean why do people read i'm
not a i'm not a

not a i'm not a
a cheap fantasy reading kind of person

14390
04:04:34,309 --> 04:04:34,319
a cheap fantasy reading kind of person
 

14391
04:04:34,319 --> 04:04:36,389
a cheap fantasy reading kind of person
so i need to uh

14392
04:04:36,389 --> 04:04:36,399
so i need to uh
 

14393
04:04:36,399 --> 04:04:38,229
so i need to uh
one story that sounds plausible to me is

14394
04:04:38,229 --> 04:04:38,239
one story that sounds plausible to me is
 

14395
04:04:38,239 --> 04:04:39,670
one story that sounds plausible to me is
that there are sort of these

14396
04:04:39,670 --> 04:04:39,680
that there are sort of these
 

14397
04:04:39,680 --> 04:04:41,750
that there are sort of these
deep story structures that we

14398
04:04:41,750 --> 04:04:41,760
deep story structures that we
 

14399
04:04:41,760 --> 04:04:44,070
deep story structures that we
love and we want to realize and then

14400
04:04:44,070 --> 04:04:44,080
love and we want to realize and then
 

14401
04:04:44,080 --> 04:04:45,590
love and we want to realize and then
many details of the world get in their

14402
04:04:45,590 --> 04:04:45,600
many details of the world get in their
 

14403
04:04:45,600 --> 04:04:46,550
many details of the world get in their
way

14404
04:04:46,550 --> 04:04:46,560
way
 

14405
04:04:46,560 --> 04:04:48,309
way
fantasy takes all those obstacles out of

14406
04:04:48,309 --> 04:04:48,319
fantasy takes all those obstacles out of
 

14407
04:04:48,319 --> 04:04:50,469
fantasy takes all those obstacles out of
the way and lets you tell the essential

14408
04:04:50,469 --> 04:04:50,479
the way and lets you tell the essential
 

14409
04:04:50,479 --> 04:04:52,229
the way and lets you tell the essential
hero story or the essential love story

whatever essential story you want to
 

14413
04:04:53,520 --> 04:04:56,229
whatever essential story you want to
tell um the the reality and constraints

14414
04:04:56,229 --> 04:04:56,239
tell um the the reality and constraints
 

14415
04:04:56,239 --> 04:04:58,710
tell um the the reality and constraints
are not in the way

14416
04:04:58,710 --> 04:04:58,720
are not in the way
 

14417
04:04:58,720 --> 04:05:00,229
are not in the way
and so science fiction can be thought of

14418
04:05:00,229 --> 04:05:00,239
and so science fiction can be thought of
 

14419
04:05:00,239 --> 04:05:01,910
and so science fiction can be thought of
as like fantasy except you're not

14420
04:05:01,910 --> 04:05:01,920
as like fantasy except you're not
 

14421
04:05:01,920 --> 04:05:03,830
as like fantasy except you're not
willing to admit that it's not can't be

14422
04:05:03,830 --> 04:05:03,840
willing to admit that it's not can't be
 

14423
04:05:03,840 --> 04:05:05,910
willing to admit that it's not can't be
true so the future gives the excuse of

14424
04:05:05,910 --> 04:05:05,920
true so the future gives the excuse of
 

14425
04:05:05,920 --> 04:05:08,870
true so the future gives the excuse of
saying well it could happen

14426
04:05:08,870 --> 04:05:08,880
saying well it could happen
 

14427
04:05:08,880 --> 04:05:10,389
saying well it could happen
and you accept some more reality

14428
04:05:10,389 --> 04:05:10,399
and you accept some more reality
 

14429
04:05:10,399 --> 04:05:12,550
and you accept some more reality
constraints for the for the illusion at

14430
04:05:12,550 --> 04:05:12,560
constraints for the for the illusion at
 

14431
04:05:12,560 --> 04:05:14,150
constraints for the for the illusion at
least that it maybe it could really

14432
04:05:14,150 --> 04:05:14,160
least that it maybe it could really
 

14433
04:05:14,160 --> 04:05:16,389
least that it maybe it could really
happen

14434
04:05:16,389 --> 04:05:16,399
happen
 

14435
04:05:16,399 --> 04:05:18,550
happen
maybe it could happen and that it

14436
04:05:18,550 --> 04:05:18,560
maybe it could happen and that it
 

14437
04:05:18,560 --> 04:05:21,510
maybe it could happen and that it
stimulates the image the imagination

14438
04:05:21,510 --> 04:05:21,520
stimulates the image the imagination
 

14439
04:05:21,520 --> 04:05:23,110
stimulates the image the imagination
is something really interesting about

14440
04:05:23,110 --> 04:05:23,120
is something really interesting about
 

14441
04:05:23,120 --> 04:05:24,630
is something really interesting about
human beings

14442
04:05:24,630 --> 04:05:24,640
human beings
 

14443
04:05:24,640 --> 04:05:26,630
human beings
and it seems also to be an important

14444
04:05:26,630 --> 04:05:26,640
and it seems also to be an important
 

14445
04:05:26,640 --> 04:05:28,389
and it seems also to be an important
part of creating really special things

14446
04:05:28,389 --> 04:05:28,399
part of creating really special things
 

14447
04:05:28,399 --> 04:05:30,790
part of creating really special things
is to be able to first imagine them uh

14448
04:05:30,790 --> 04:05:30,800
is to be able to first imagine them uh
 

14449
04:05:30,800 --> 04:05:32,790
is to be able to first imagine them uh
with you and nick bostrom

14450
04:05:32,790 --> 04:05:32,800
with you and nick bostrom
 

14451
04:05:32,800 --> 04:05:34,870
with you and nick bostrom
where do you land on the simulation and

14452
04:05:34,870 --> 04:05:34,880
where do you land on the simulation and
 

14453
04:05:34,880 --> 04:05:36,389
where do you land on the simulation and
all the

14454
04:05:36,389 --> 04:05:36,399
all the
 

14455
04:05:36,399 --> 04:05:38,630
all the
mathematical ways of thinking it and

14456
04:05:38,630 --> 04:05:38,640
mathematical ways of thinking it and
 

14457
04:05:38,640 --> 04:05:41,510
mathematical ways of thinking it and
just the thought experiment of it are we

14458
04:05:41,510 --> 04:05:41,520
just the thought experiment of it are we
 

14459
04:05:41,520 --> 04:05:44,309
just the thought experiment of it are we
living in a simulation

14460
04:05:44,309 --> 04:05:44,319
living in a simulation
 

14461
04:05:44,319 --> 04:05:46,550
living in a simulation
that was the just discussion we just had

14462
04:05:46,550 --> 04:05:46,560
that was the just discussion we just had
 

14463
04:05:46,560 --> 04:05:49,030
that was the just discussion we just had
that is you should grant the possibility

14464
04:05:49,030 --> 04:05:49,040
that is you should grant the possibility
 

14465
04:05:49,040 --> 04:05:50,389
that is you should grant the possibility
of being a simulation you shouldn't be

14466
04:05:50,389 --> 04:05:50,399
of being a simulation you shouldn't be
 

14467
04:05:50,399 --> 04:05:52,389
of being a simulation you shouldn't be
100 confident that you're not you should

14468
04:05:52,389 --> 04:05:52,399
100 confident that you're not you should
 

14469
04:05:52,399 --> 04:05:54,229
100 confident that you're not you should
certainly grant a small probability the

14470
04:05:54,229 --> 04:05:54,239
certainly grant a small probability the
 

14471
04:05:54,239 --> 04:05:55,349
certainly grant a small probability the
question is how large is that

14472
04:05:55,349 --> 04:05:55,359
question is how large is that
 

14473
04:05:55,359 --> 04:05:58,710
question is how large is that
probability oh you're saying we would be

14474
04:05:58,710 --> 04:05:58,720
probability oh you're saying we would be
 

14475
04:05:58,720 --> 04:06:00,550
probability oh you're saying we would be
i i misunderstood because i thought our

14476
04:06:00,550 --> 04:06:00,560
i i misunderstood because i thought our
 

14477
04:06:00,560 --> 04:06:02,469
i i misunderstood because i thought our
discussion was about replaying things

14478
04:06:02,469 --> 04:06:02,479
discussion was about replaying things
 

14479
04:06:02,479 --> 04:06:03,750
discussion was about replaying things
that already happened right but the

14480
04:06:03,750 --> 04:06:03,760
that already happened right but the
 

14481
04:06:03,760 --> 04:06:05,349
that already happened right but the
whole question is

14482
04:06:05,349 --> 04:06:05,359
whole question is
 

14483
04:06:05,359 --> 04:06:08,070
whole question is
right now is that what's what i am

14484
04:06:08,070 --> 04:06:08,080
right now is that what's what i am
 

14485
04:06:08,080 --> 04:06:11,429
right now is that what's what i am
am i actually a replay from some distant

14486
04:06:11,429 --> 04:06:11,439
am i actually a replay from some distant
 

14487
04:06:11,439 --> 04:06:13,030
am i actually a replay from some distant
future but it doesn't necessarily need

14488
04:06:13,030 --> 04:06:13,040
future but it doesn't necessarily need
 

14489
04:06:13,040 --> 04:06:15,269
future but it doesn't necessarily need
to be a replay it could be a totally new

14490
04:06:15,269 --> 04:06:15,279
to be a replay it could be a totally new
 

14491
04:06:15,279 --> 04:06:17,030
to be a replay it could be a totally new
you could be you don't have to be right

14492
04:06:17,030 --> 04:06:17,040
you could be you don't have to be right
 

14493
04:06:17,040 --> 04:06:19,429
you could be you don't have to be right
but clearly i'm in a certain era with a

14494
04:06:19,429 --> 04:06:19,439
but clearly i'm in a certain era with a
 

14495
04:06:19,439 --> 04:06:21,030
but clearly i'm in a certain era with a
certain kind of world around me right so

14496
04:06:21,030 --> 04:06:21,040
certain kind of world around me right so
 

14497
04:06:21,040 --> 04:06:22,790
certain kind of world around me right so
either this is a complete fantasy or

14498
04:06:22,790 --> 04:06:22,800
either this is a complete fantasy or
 

14499
04:06:22,800 --> 04:06:24,229
either this is a complete fantasy or
it's a past of somebody else in the

14500
04:06:24,229 --> 04:06:24,239
it's a past of somebody else in the
 

14501
04:06:24,239 --> 04:06:25,670
it's a past of somebody else in the
future

14502
04:06:25,670 --> 04:06:25,680
future
 

14503
04:06:25,680 --> 04:06:26,469
future
but

14504
04:06:26,469 --> 04:06:26,479
but
 

14505
04:06:26,479 --> 04:06:28,150
but
no it could be a complete fantasy though

14506
04:06:28,150 --> 04:06:28,160
no it could be a complete fantasy though
 

14507
04:06:28,160 --> 04:06:29,590
no it could be a complete fantasy though
it could be right but then you might and

14508
04:06:29,590 --> 04:06:29,600
it could be right but then you might and
 

14509
04:06:29,600 --> 04:06:30,550
it could be right but then you might and
then you have to talk about what's the

14510
04:06:30,550 --> 04:06:30,560
then you have to talk about what's the
 

14511
04:06:30,560 --> 04:06:32,150
then you have to talk about what's the
frank fraction of complete fantasies

14512
04:06:32,150 --> 04:06:32,160
frank fraction of complete fantasies
 

14513
04:06:32,160 --> 04:06:33,670
frank fraction of complete fantasies
right

14514
04:06:33,670 --> 04:06:33,680
right
 

14515
04:06:33,680 --> 04:06:35,269
right
i would say it's easier to generate a

14516
04:06:35,269 --> 04:06:35,279
i would say it's easier to generate a
 

14517
04:06:35,279 --> 04:06:37,750
i would say it's easier to generate a
fantasy than to replay a memory right

14518
04:06:37,750 --> 04:06:37,760
fantasy than to replay a memory right
 

14519
04:06:37,760 --> 04:06:39,910
fantasy than to replay a memory right
sure just look at the entire

14520
04:06:39,910 --> 04:06:39,920
sure just look at the entire
 

14521
04:06:39,920 --> 04:06:41,269
sure just look at the entire
we just look at the entire history of

14522
04:06:41,269 --> 04:06:41,279
we just look at the entire history of
 

14523
04:06:41,279 --> 04:06:43,189
we just look at the entire history of
everything we should say sure but most

14524
04:06:43,189 --> 04:06:43,199
everything we should say sure but most
 

14525
04:06:43,199 --> 04:06:44,389
everything we should say sure but most
things are real most things aren't

14526
04:06:44,389 --> 04:06:44,399
things are real most things aren't
 

14527
04:06:44,399 --> 04:06:45,990
things are real most things aren't
fantasies right therefore the chance

14528
04:06:45,990 --> 04:06:46,000
fantasies right therefore the chance
 

14529
04:06:46,000 --> 04:06:47,910
fantasies right therefore the chance
that my thing is real right so so the

14530
04:06:47,910 --> 04:06:47,920
that my thing is real right so so the
 

14531
04:06:47,920 --> 04:06:49,910
that my thing is real right so so the
simulation argument works stronger about

14532
04:06:49,910 --> 04:06:49,920
simulation argument works stronger about
 

14533
04:06:49,920 --> 04:06:51,590
simulation argument works stronger about
sort of the past we say ah but there's

14534
04:06:51,590 --> 04:06:51,600
sort of the past we say ah but there's
 

14535
04:06:51,600 --> 04:06:53,750
sort of the past we say ah but there's
more future people than there are today

14536
04:06:53,750 --> 04:06:53,760
more future people than there are today
 

14537
04:06:53,760 --> 04:06:55,990
more future people than there are today
so you being in the past of the future

14538
04:06:55,990 --> 04:06:56,000
so you being in the past of the future
 

14539
04:06:56,000 --> 04:06:57,830
so you being in the past of the future
makes you special relative to them which

14540
04:06:57,830 --> 04:06:57,840
makes you special relative to them which
 

14541
04:06:57,840 --> 04:06:59,269
makes you special relative to them which
makes you more likely to be in a

14542
04:06:59,269 --> 04:06:59,279
makes you more likely to be in a
 

14543
04:06:59,279 --> 04:07:00,870
makes you more likely to be in a
simulation right if we're just taking

14544
04:07:00,870 --> 04:07:00,880
simulation right if we're just taking
 

14545
04:07:00,880 --> 04:07:02,950
simulation right if we're just taking
the full count and saying in all

14546
04:07:02,950 --> 04:07:02,960
the full count and saying in all
 

14547
04:07:02,960 --> 04:07:04,389
the full count and saying in all
creatures ever what percentage are in

14548
04:07:04,389 --> 04:07:04,399
creatures ever what percentage are in
 

14549
04:07:04,399 --> 04:07:07,510
creatures ever what percentage are in
simulations probably no more than 10

14550
04:07:07,510 --> 04:07:07,520
simulations probably no more than 10
 

14551
04:07:07,520 --> 04:07:09,910
simulations probably no more than 10
see so what's the good argument for that

14552
04:07:09,910 --> 04:07:09,920
see so what's the good argument for that
 

14553
04:07:09,920 --> 04:07:12,630
see so what's the good argument for that
that most things are real yeah because

14554
04:07:12,630 --> 04:07:12,640
that most things are real yeah because
 

14555
04:07:12,640 --> 04:07:14,950
that most things are real yeah because
foster says the other way right

14556
04:07:14,950 --> 04:07:14,960
foster says the other way right
 

14557
04:07:14,960 --> 04:07:17,349
foster says the other way right
in a competitive world in a world where

14558
04:07:17,349 --> 04:07:17,359
in a competitive world in a world where
 

14559
04:07:17,359 --> 04:07:19,429
in a competitive world in a world where
people like have to work

14560
04:07:19,429 --> 04:07:19,439
people like have to work
 

14561
04:07:19,439 --> 04:07:21,110
people like have to work
and have to get things done then they

14562
04:07:21,110 --> 04:07:21,120
and have to get things done then they
 

14563
04:07:21,120 --> 04:07:23,429
and have to get things done then they
have a limited budget for

14564
04:07:23,429 --> 04:07:23,439
have a limited budget for
 

14565
04:07:23,439 --> 04:07:24,630
have a limited budget for
leisure

14566
04:07:24,630 --> 04:07:24,640
leisure
 

14567
04:07:24,640 --> 04:07:25,670
leisure
and so

14568
04:07:25,670 --> 04:07:25,680
and so
 

14569
04:07:25,680 --> 04:07:28,070
and so
you know leisure things are less common

14570
04:07:28,070 --> 04:07:28,080
you know leisure things are less common
 

14571
04:07:28,080 --> 04:07:30,870
you know leisure things are less common
than work things like real things right

14572
04:07:30,870 --> 04:07:30,880
than work things like real things right
 

14573
04:07:30,880 --> 04:07:32,710
than work things like real things right
that that's just

14574
04:07:32,710 --> 04:07:32,720
that that's just
 

14575
04:07:32,720 --> 04:07:35,510
that that's just
but if you look at the stretch of

14576
04:07:35,510 --> 04:07:35,520
but if you look at the stretch of
 

14577
04:07:35,520 --> 04:07:37,750
but if you look at the stretch of
history in the universe

14578
04:07:37,750 --> 04:07:37,760
history in the universe
 

14579
04:07:37,760 --> 04:07:39,830
history in the universe
doesn't the ratio

14580
04:07:39,830 --> 04:07:39,840
doesn't the ratio
 

14581
04:07:39,840 --> 04:07:42,710
doesn't the ratio
of leisure increase

14582
04:07:42,710 --> 04:07:42,720
of leisure increase
 

14583
04:07:42,720 --> 04:07:43,510
of leisure increase
i

14584
04:07:43,510 --> 04:07:43,520
i
 

14585
04:07:43,520 --> 04:07:45,269
i
is that where we isn't that the fourth

14586
04:07:45,269 --> 04:07:45,279
is that where we isn't that the fourth
 

14587
04:07:45,279 --> 04:07:46,309
is that where we isn't that the fourth
right but now we're looking at the

14588
04:07:46,309 --> 04:07:46,319
right but now we're looking at the
 

14589
04:07:46,319 --> 04:07:48,469
right but now we're looking at the
fraction of leisure which takes the form

14590
04:07:48,469 --> 04:07:48,479
fraction of leisure which takes the form
 

14591
04:07:48,479 --> 04:07:50,070
fraction of leisure which takes the form
of something where the person doing the

14592
04:07:50,070 --> 04:07:50,080
of something where the person doing the
 

14593
04:07:50,080 --> 04:07:52,229
of something where the person doing the
leisure doesn't realize it now there

14594
04:07:52,229 --> 04:07:52,239
leisure doesn't realize it now there
 

14595
04:07:52,239 --> 04:07:53,510
leisure doesn't realize it now there
could be some fraction that's much

14596
04:07:53,510 --> 04:07:53,520
could be some fraction that's much
 

14597
04:07:53,520 --> 04:07:55,189
could be some fraction that's much
smaller right

14598
04:07:55,189 --> 04:07:55,199
smaller right
 

14599
04:07:55,199 --> 04:07:57,510
smaller right
yeah okay

14600
04:07:57,510 --> 04:07:57,520
yeah okay
 

14601
04:07:57,520 --> 04:07:58,870
yeah okay
clues forward

04:07:58,870 --> 04:07:58,880
clues forward
 

14603
04:07:58,880 --> 04:08:00,710
clues forward
or somebody is clueless in the process

04:08:00,710 --> 04:08:00,720
or somebody is clueless in the process
 

14605
04:08:00,720 --> 04:08:02,710
or somebody is clueless in the process
of supporting this this leisure right it

14606
04:08:02,710 --> 04:08:02,720
of supporting this this leisure right it
 

14607
04:08:02,720 --> 04:08:03,990
of supporting this this leisure right it
might not be the person leisuring

14608
04:08:03,990 --> 04:08:04,000
might not be the person leisuring
 

14609
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:05,269
might not be the person leisuring
somebody they're a supporting character

14610
04:08:05,269 --> 04:08:05,279
somebody they're a supporting character
 

14611
04:08:05,279 --> 04:08:06,550
somebody they're a supporting character
or something but still that's got to be

14612
04:08:06,550 --> 04:08:06,560
or something but still that's got to be
 

14613
04:08:06,560 --> 04:08:08,950
or something but still that's got to be
a pretty small fraction of leisure

14614
04:08:08,950 --> 04:08:08,960
a pretty small fraction of leisure
 

14615
04:08:08,960 --> 04:08:11,269
a pretty small fraction of leisure

broadly speaking then let me ask the big
 

14623
04:08:15,920 --> 04:08:17,429
broadly speaking then let me ask the big
question what's the meaning of this

14624
04:08:17,429 --> 04:08:17,439
question what's the meaning of this
 

14625

we talked about alien civilizations

14632
04:08:26,070 --> 04:08:26,080
we talked about alien civilizations
 

14633
04:08:26,080 --> 04:08:27,990
we talked about alien civilizations
but this is the one we got we are the

14634

but this is the one we got we are the
 

14635
04:08:28,000 --> 04:08:30,950
but this is the one we got we are the
aliens we are the human

what's why why why are we here this is
 

14643
04:08:37,600 --> 04:08:40,149
what's why why why are we here this is
the thing i told you before about how we

14644
04:08:40,149 --> 04:08:40,159
the thing i told you before about how we
 

14645
04:08:40,159 --> 04:08:41,590
the thing i told you before about how we
can predict that future creatures will

14646
04:08:41,590 --> 04:08:41,600
can predict that future creatures will
 

14647

we
our preferences are this amalgam of

things
so

14666
04:08:58,229 --> 04:08:58,239
so
 

14667
04:08:58,239 --> 04:08:59,670
so
we don't understand that very well it's

14668
04:08:59,670 --> 04:08:59,680
we don't understand that very well it's
 

14669
04:08:59,680 --> 04:09:02,229
we don't understand that very well it's
not very transparent and it's a mess

14670
04:09:02,229 --> 04:09:02,239
not very transparent and it's a mess
 

14671
04:09:02,239 --> 04:09:03,349
not very transparent and it's a mess
right

14672
04:09:03,349 --> 04:09:03,359
right
 

14673
04:09:03,359 --> 04:09:06,469
right
that is the source of our motivation

14674
04:09:06,469 --> 04:09:06,479
that is the source of our motivation
 

14675
04:09:06,479 --> 04:09:08,870
that is the source of our motivation
that is how we were made and how we are

14676
04:09:08,870 --> 04:09:08,880
that is how we were made and how we are
 

14677
04:09:08,880 --> 04:09:10,950
that is how we were made and how we are
induced to do things but we can't

14678
04:09:10,950 --> 04:09:10,960
induced to do things but we can't
 

14679
04:09:10,960 --> 04:09:12,790
induced to do things but we can't
summarize it very well and we don't even

14680
04:09:12,790 --> 04:09:12,800
summarize it very well and we don't even
 

14681
04:09:12,800 --> 04:09:15,030
summarize it very well and we don't even
understand it very well that's who we

14682
04:09:15,030 --> 04:09:15,040
understand it very well that's who we
 

14683
04:09:15,040 --> 04:09:16,870
understand it very well that's who we
are and often we find ourselves in a

14684
04:09:16,870 --> 04:09:16,880
are and often we find ourselves in a
 

14685
04:09:16,880 --> 04:09:18,149
are and often we find ourselves in a
situation where we don't feel very

14686
04:09:18,149 --> 04:09:18,159
situation where we don't feel very
 

14687
04:09:18,159 --> 04:09:19,670
situation where we don't feel very
motivated we don't know why in other

14688
04:09:19,670 --> 04:09:19,680
motivated we don't know why in other
 

14689
04:09:19,680 --> 04:09:21,110
motivated we don't know why in other
situations we find ourselves very

14690
04:09:21,110 --> 04:09:21,120
situations we find ourselves very
 

14691
04:09:21,120 --> 04:09:25,030
situations we find ourselves very
motivated and we don't know why either

14692
04:09:25,030 --> 04:09:25,040

 

14693
04:09:25,040 --> 04:09:27,189

and so that's the nature of being a

14694
04:09:27,189 --> 04:09:27,199
and so that's the nature of being a
 

14695
04:09:27,199 --> 04:09:29,750
and so that's the nature of being a
human of the sort that we are because

14696
04:09:29,750 --> 04:09:29,760
human of the sort that we are because
 

14697
04:09:29,760 --> 04:09:31,349
human of the sort that we are because
even though we can think abstractly and

14698
04:09:31,349 --> 04:09:31,359
even though we can think abstractly and
 

14699
04:09:31,359 --> 04:09:33,030
even though we can think abstractly and
reason abstractly this package of

14700
04:09:33,030 --> 04:09:33,040
reason abstractly this package of
 

14701
04:09:33,040 --> 04:09:35,830
reason abstractly this package of
motivations is just opaque and a mess

14702
04:09:35,830 --> 04:09:35,840
motivations is just opaque and a mess
 

14703
04:09:35,840 --> 04:09:37,990
motivations is just opaque and a mess
and that's what it means to be a human

14704
04:09:37,990 --> 04:09:38,000
and that's what it means to be a human
 

14705
04:09:38,000 --> 04:09:39,670
and that's what it means to be a human
today and the motivation

14706
04:09:39,670 --> 04:09:39,680
today and the motivation
 

14707
04:09:39,680 --> 04:09:41,349
today and the motivation
we can't very well tell the meaning of

14708
04:09:41,349 --> 04:09:41,359
we can't very well tell the meaning of
 

14709
04:09:41,359 --> 04:09:43,750
we can't very well tell the meaning of
our life it is this mess that our

14710
04:09:43,750 --> 04:09:43,760
our life it is this mess that our
 

14711
04:09:43,760 --> 04:09:45,189
our life it is this mess that our
descendants will be different they will

14712
04:09:45,189 --> 04:09:45,199
descendants will be different they will
 

14713
04:09:45,199 --> 04:09:48,149
descendants will be different they will
actually know exactly what they want

14714
04:09:48,149 --> 04:09:48,159
actually know exactly what they want
 

14715
04:09:48,159 --> 04:09:50,710
actually know exactly what they want
and it will be to have more descendants

14716
04:09:50,710 --> 04:09:50,720
and it will be to have more descendants
 

14717
04:09:50,720 --> 04:09:52,550
and it will be to have more descendants
for that will be the meaning for them

14718
04:09:52,550 --> 04:09:52,560
for that will be the meaning for them
 

14719
04:09:52,560 --> 04:09:53,830
for that will be the meaning for them
well it's funny that you have the

14720
04:09:53,830 --> 04:09:53,840
well it's funny that you have the
 

14721
04:09:53,840 --> 04:09:56,309
well it's funny that you have the
certainty you have more certainty you

14722
04:09:56,309 --> 04:09:56,319
certainty you have more certainty you
 

14723
04:09:56,319 --> 04:09:58,550
certainty you have more certainty you
have more transparency about our

14724
04:09:58,550 --> 04:09:58,560
have more transparency about our
 

14725
04:09:58,560 --> 04:10:01,110
have more transparency about our
descendants than you do about your own

14726
04:10:01,110 --> 04:10:01,120
descendants than you do about your own
 

14727
04:10:01,120 --> 04:10:03,429
descendants than you do about your own
self right so

14728
04:10:03,429 --> 04:10:03,439
self right so
 

14729
04:10:03,439 --> 04:10:04,630
self right so

um
 

14731
04:10:04,640 --> 04:10:05,990
um
it's really interesting to think because

14732
04:10:05,990 --> 04:10:06,000
it's really interesting to think because
 

14733
04:10:06,000 --> 04:10:07,910
it's really interesting to think because
you mentioned this about love

14734
04:10:07,910 --> 04:10:07,920
you mentioned this about love
 

14735
04:10:07,920 --> 04:10:08,870
you mentioned this about love
that

14736
04:10:08,870 --> 04:10:08,880
that
 

14737
04:10:08,880 --> 04:10:10,630
that
something

14738
04:10:10,630 --> 04:10:10,640
something
 

14739
04:10:10,640 --> 04:10:12,389
something
that's fundamental about love is this

14740
04:10:12,389 --> 04:10:12,399
that's fundamental about love is this
 

14741
04:10:12,399 --> 04:10:14,309
that's fundamental about love is this
opaqueness that we're not able to really

14742
04:10:14,309 --> 04:10:14,319
opaqueness that we're not able to really
 

14743
04:10:14,319 --> 04:10:16,710
opaqueness that we're not able to really
introspect what the heck it is

14744
04:10:16,710 --> 04:10:16,720
introspect what the heck it is
 

14745
04:10:16,720 --> 04:10:17,590
introspect what the heck it is
um

14746
04:10:17,590 --> 04:10:17,600
um
 

14747
04:10:17,600 --> 04:10:19,269
um
or all the feelings the complex feelings

14748
04:10:19,269 --> 04:10:19,279
or all the feelings the complex feelings
 

14749
04:10:19,279 --> 04:10:20,790
or all the feelings the complex feelings
involved true about many of our

14750
04:10:20,790 --> 04:10:20,800
involved true about many of our
 

14751
04:10:20,800 --> 04:10:22,630
involved true about many of our
motivations and that's what it means to

14752
04:10:22,630 --> 04:10:22,640
motivations and that's what it means to
 

14753
04:10:22,640 --> 04:10:25,910
motivations and that's what it means to
be human of the 20

14754
04:10:25,910 --> 04:10:25,920
be human of the 20
 

14755
04:10:25,920 --> 04:10:29,110
be human of the 20
20th and the 21st century variety

14756
04:10:29,110 --> 04:10:29,120
20th and the 21st century variety
 

14757
04:10:29,120 --> 04:10:32,469
20th and the 21st century variety
um why is that not a feature that we

14758
04:10:32,469 --> 04:10:32,479
um why is that not a feature that we
 

14759
04:10:32,479 --> 04:10:33,590
um why is that not a feature that we
want

14760
04:10:33,590 --> 04:10:33,600
want
 

14761
04:10:33,600 --> 04:10:35,750
want
will choose to persist

14762
04:10:35,750 --> 04:10:35,760
will choose to persist
 

14763
04:10:35,760 --> 04:10:38,229
will choose to persist
in civilization then this opaqueness you

14764
04:10:38,229 --> 04:10:38,239
in civilization then this opaqueness you
 

14765
04:10:38,239 --> 04:10:39,750
in civilization then this opaqueness you
know put another way

14766
04:10:39,750 --> 04:10:39,760
know put another way
 

14767
04:10:39,760 --> 04:10:41,590
know put another way
mystery maintaining a sense of mystery

14768
04:10:41,590 --> 04:10:41,600
mystery maintaining a sense of mystery
 

14769
04:10:41,600 --> 04:10:43,269
mystery maintaining a sense of mystery
about ourselves and about those around

14770
04:10:43,269 --> 04:10:43,279
about ourselves and about those around
 

14771
04:10:43,279 --> 04:10:44,070
about ourselves and about those around
us

14772
04:10:44,070 --> 04:10:44,080
us
 

14773
04:10:44,080 --> 04:10:45,590
us
uh maybe that's a really nice thing to

14774
04:10:45,590 --> 04:10:45,600
uh maybe that's a really nice thing to
 

14775
04:10:45,600 --> 04:10:46,389
uh maybe that's a really nice thing to
have

14776
04:10:46,389 --> 04:10:46,399
have
 

14777
04:10:46,399 --> 04:10:49,030
have
maybe but so i mean this is the

14778
04:10:49,030 --> 04:10:49,040
maybe but so i mean this is the
 

14779
04:10:49,040 --> 04:10:50,630
maybe but so i mean this is the
fundamental issue and

14780
04:10:50,630 --> 04:10:50,640
fundamental issue and
 

14781
04:10:50,640 --> 04:10:52,710
fundamental issue and
analyzing the future what will set the

14782
04:10:52,710 --> 04:10:52,720
analyzing the future what will set the
 

14783
04:10:52,720 --> 04:10:53,670
analyzing the future what will set the
future

14784
04:10:53,670 --> 04:10:53,680
future
 

14785
04:10:53,680 --> 04:10:55,030
future
one theory about what will set the

14786
04:10:55,030 --> 04:10:55,040
one theory about what will set the
 

14787
04:10:55,040 --> 04:10:56,389
one theory about what will set the
future is

14788
04:10:56,389 --> 04:10:56,399
future is
 

14789
04:10:56,399 --> 04:10:58,389
future is
what do we want the future to be

14790
04:10:58,389 --> 04:10:58,399
what do we want the future to be
 

14791
04:10:58,399 --> 04:10:59,910
what do we want the future to be
so under that theory we should sit and

14792
04:10:59,910 --> 04:10:59,920
so under that theory we should sit and
 

14793
04:10:59,920 --> 04:11:01,429
so under that theory we should sit and
talk about what we went to future we

14794
04:11:01,429 --> 04:11:01,439
talk about what we went to future we
 

14795
04:11:01,439 --> 04:11:02,870
talk about what we went to future we
have some conferences have some

14796
04:11:02,870 --> 04:11:02,880
have some conferences have some
 

14797
04:11:02,880 --> 04:11:04,710
have some conferences have some
conventions you know discussion things

14798
04:11:04,710 --> 04:11:04,720
conventions you know discussion things
 

14799
04:11:04,720 --> 04:11:06,870
conventions you know discussion things
vote on it maybe and then hand out off

14800
04:11:06,870 --> 04:11:06,880
vote on it maybe and then hand out off
 

14801
04:11:06,880 --> 04:11:08,469
vote on it maybe and then hand out off
to the implementation people to make the

14802
04:11:08,469 --> 04:11:08,479
to the implementation people to make the
 

14803
04:11:08,479 --> 04:11:10,469
to the implementation people to make the
future the way we've decided it should

14804
04:11:10,469 --> 04:11:10,479
future the way we've decided it should
 

14805
04:11:10,479 --> 04:11:12,389
future the way we've decided it should
be

14806
04:11:12,389 --> 04:11:12,399
be
 

14807
04:11:12,399 --> 04:11:14,149
be
that's not the actual process that's

14808
04:11:14,149 --> 04:11:14,159
that's not the actual process that's
 

14809
04:11:14,159 --> 04:11:16,149
that's not the actual process that's
changed the world over history up to

14810
04:11:16,149 --> 04:11:16,159
changed the world over history up to
 

14811
04:11:16,159 --> 04:11:18,550
changed the world over history up to
this point it has not been the result of

14812
04:11:18,550 --> 04:11:18,560
this point it has not been the result of
 

14813
04:11:18,560 --> 04:11:20,149
this point it has not been the result of
us deciding what we want and making it

14814
04:11:20,149 --> 04:11:20,159
us deciding what we want and making it
 

14815
04:11:20,159 --> 04:11:21,349
us deciding what we want and making it
happen

14816
04:11:21,349 --> 04:11:21,359
happen
 

14817
04:11:21,359 --> 04:11:23,189
happen
in our individual lives we can do that

14818
04:11:23,189 --> 04:11:23,199
in our individual lives we can do that
 

14819
04:11:23,199 --> 04:11:24,710
in our individual lives we can do that
and we might decide what career we want

14820
04:11:24,710 --> 04:11:24,720
and we might decide what career we want
 

14821
04:11:24,720 --> 04:11:26,070
and we might decide what career we want
or where we want to live who we want to

14822
04:11:26,070 --> 04:11:26,080
or where we want to live who we want to
 

14823
04:11:26,080 --> 04:11:27,990
or where we want to live who we want to
live with in our individual lives we

14824
04:11:27,990 --> 04:11:28,000
live with in our individual lives we
 

14825
04:11:28,000 --> 04:11:29,110
live with in our individual lives we
often do

14826
04:11:29,110 --> 04:11:29,120
often do
 

14827
04:11:29,120 --> 04:11:30,790
often do
slowly make our lives better according

14828
04:11:30,790 --> 04:11:30,800
slowly make our lives better according
 

14829
04:11:30,800 --> 04:11:32,309
slowly make our lives better according
to our plan and our things but that's

14830
04:11:32,309 --> 04:11:32,319
to our plan and our things but that's
 

14831
04:11:32,319 --> 04:11:34,389
to our plan and our things but that's
not the whole world

14832
04:11:34,389 --> 04:11:34,399
not the whole world
 

14833
04:11:34,399 --> 04:11:36,389
not the whole world
the whole world so far has mostly been a

14834
04:11:36,389 --> 04:11:36,399
the whole world so far has mostly been a
 

14835
04:11:36,399 --> 04:11:38,870
the whole world so far has mostly been a
competitive world where things happen if

14836
04:11:38,870 --> 04:11:38,880
competitive world where things happen if
 

14837
04:11:38,880 --> 04:11:40,950
competitive world where things happen if
anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them

14838
04:11:40,950 --> 04:11:40,960
anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them
 

14839
04:11:40,960 --> 04:11:42,550
anybody anywhere chooses to adopt them
and they have an advantage and then it

14840
04:11:42,550 --> 04:11:42,560
and they have an advantage and then it
 

14841
04:11:42,560 --> 04:11:43,910
and they have an advantage and then it
spreads and other people are forced to

14842
04:11:43,910 --> 04:11:43,920
spreads and other people are forced to
 

14843
04:11:43,920 --> 04:11:46,229
spreads and other people are forced to
adopt it by competitive pressures

14844
04:11:46,229 --> 04:11:46,239
adopt it by competitive pressures
 

14845
04:11:46,239 --> 04:11:48,229
adopt it by competitive pressures
so that's the kind of analysis i can use

14846
04:11:48,229 --> 04:11:48,239
so that's the kind of analysis i can use
 

14847
04:11:48,239 --> 04:11:50,070
so that's the kind of analysis i can use
to predict the future and i do use that

14848
04:11:50,070 --> 04:11:50,080
to predict the future and i do use that
 

14849
04:11:50,080 --> 04:11:51,429
to predict the future and i do use that
to predict the future it doesn't tell us

14850
04:11:51,429 --> 04:11:51,439
to predict the future it doesn't tell us
 

14851
04:11:51,439 --> 04:11:53,030
to predict the future it doesn't tell us
it'll be a future we like it just tells

14852
04:11:53,030 --> 04:11:53,040
it'll be a future we like it just tells
 

14853
04:11:53,040 --> 04:11:54,630
it'll be a future we like it just tells
us what it'll be

14854
04:11:54,630 --> 04:11:54,640
us what it'll be
 

14855
04:11:54,640 --> 04:11:55,990
us what it'll be
and it'll be one where we're trying to

14856
04:11:55,990 --> 04:11:56,000
and it'll be one where we're trying to
 

14857
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:57,830
and it'll be one where we're trying to
maximize the number of our descendants

14858
04:11:57,830 --> 04:11:57,840
maximize the number of our descendants
 

14859
04:11:57,840 --> 04:12:00,389
maximize the number of our descendants
and we know that abstractly indirectly

14860
04:12:00,389 --> 04:12:00,399
and we know that abstractly indirectly
 

14861
04:12:00,399 --> 04:12:02,070
and we know that abstractly indirectly
and it's not opaque with some

14862
04:12:02,070 --> 04:12:02,080
and it's not opaque with some
 

14863
04:12:02,080 --> 04:12:04,710
and it's not opaque with some
probability that's non-zero that will

14864
04:12:04,710 --> 04:12:04,720
probability that's non-zero that will
 

14865
04:12:04,720 --> 04:12:07,349
probability that's non-zero that will
lead us to become grabby

14866
04:12:07,349 --> 04:12:07,359
lead us to become grabby
 

14867
04:12:07,359 --> 04:12:08,550
lead us to become grabby
in

14868
04:12:08,550 --> 04:12:08,560
in
 

14869
04:12:08,560 --> 04:12:09,910
in
expanding

14870
04:12:09,910 --> 04:12:09,920
expanding
 

14871
04:12:09,920 --> 04:12:12,149
expanding
aggressively out into the cosmos until

14872
04:12:12,149 --> 04:12:12,159
aggressively out into the cosmos until
 

14873
04:12:12,159 --> 04:12:14,469
aggressively out into the cosmos until
we meet other aliens the timing isn't

14874
04:12:14,469 --> 04:12:14,479
we meet other aliens the timing isn't
 

14875
04:12:14,479 --> 04:12:16,149
we meet other aliens the timing isn't
clear we might become glabby and then

14876
04:12:16,149 --> 04:12:16,159
clear we might become glabby and then
 

14877
04:12:16,159 --> 04:12:18,309
clear we might become glabby and then
this happens these are

14878
04:12:18,309 --> 04:12:18,319
this happens these are
 

14879
04:12:18,319 --> 04:12:19,750
this happens these are
grubbiness and this are both the results

14880
04:12:19,750 --> 04:12:19,760
grubbiness and this are both the results
 

14881
04:12:19,760 --> 04:12:21,750
grubbiness and this are both the results
of competition but it's less clear which

14882
04:12:21,750 --> 04:12:21,760
of competition but it's less clear which
 

14883
04:12:21,760 --> 04:12:24,229
of competition but it's less clear which
happens first

14884
04:12:24,229 --> 04:12:24,239
happens first
 

14885
04:12:24,239 --> 04:12:26,630
happens first
does this future excite you or scare you

14886
04:12:26,630 --> 04:12:26,640
does this future excite you or scare you
 

14887
04:12:26,640 --> 04:12:28,070
does this future excite you or scare you
how do you feel about this well i think

14888
04:12:28,070 --> 04:12:28,080
