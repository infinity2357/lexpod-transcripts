you're both a physicist and a

22
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:25,599
you're both a physicist and a
 

23
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,189
you're both a physicist and a
mathematician

24
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:27,199
mathematician
 

25
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,950
mathematician
so let me ask what is the difference

26
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:28,960
so let me ask what is the difference
 

27
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,509
so let me ask what is the difference
between physics and mathematics

28
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:31,519
between physics and mathematics
 

29
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,190
between physics and mathematics
well there's kind of a conventional

30
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:33,200
well there's kind of a conventional
 

31
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,470
well there's kind of a conventional
understanding of the subject that

32
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:34,480
understanding of the subject that
 

33
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,430
understanding of the subject that
they're

34
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,440
they're
 

35
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,350
they're
two you know quite different things so

36
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:37,360
two you know quite different things so
 

37
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,510
two you know quite different things so
that mathematics is about you know

38
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:39,520
that mathematics is about you know
 

39
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,549
that mathematics is about you know
making

40
00:00:40,549 --> 00:00:40,559
making
 

41
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,389
making
rigorous statements about

42
00:00:42,389 --> 00:00:42,399
rigorous statements about
 

43
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:45,510
rigorous statements about
these abstract you know abstract things

44
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:45,520
these abstract you know abstract things
 

45
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,510
these abstract you know abstract things
things of mathematics and and proving

46
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:47,520
things of mathematics and and proving
 

47
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,670
things of mathematics and and proving
them rigorously and physics is about you

48
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:49,680
them rigorously and physics is about you
 

49
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,590
them rigorously and physics is about you
know doing experiments and

50
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:51,600
know doing experiments and
 

51
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,310
know doing experiments and
testing various models and that but i

52
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,320
testing various models and that but i
 

53
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,069
testing various models and that but i
think the more interesting thing is that

54
00:00:56,069 --> 00:00:56,079
think the more interesting thing is that
 

55
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:56,869
think the more interesting thing is that
the

56
00:00:56,869 --> 00:00:56,879
the
 

57
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,549
the
there's a

58
00:00:58,549 --> 00:00:58,559
there's a
 

59
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,389
there's a
yeah there's a wide variety of what

60
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:00,399
yeah there's a wide variety of what
 

61
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,990
yeah there's a wide variety of what
people do as mathematics what they do is

62
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:02,000
people do as mathematics what they do is
 

63
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,430
people do as mathematics what they do is
physics and there's a significant

64
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:03,440
physics and there's a significant
 

65
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,149
physics and there's a significant
overlap and that i think is actually the

66
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
overlap and that i think is actually the
 

67
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,030
overlap and that i think is actually the
much much very very interesting area and

68
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,040
much much very very interesting area and
 

69
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,950
much much very very interesting area and
if you go back kind of far enough to in

70
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:10,960
if you go back kind of far enough to in
 

71
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,830
if you go back kind of far enough to in
in in history and look at figures like

72
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,840
in in history and look at figures like
 

73
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,749
in in history and look at figures like
newton or something i mean there it at

74
00:01:15,749 --> 00:01:15,759
newton or something i mean there it at
 

75
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,030
newton or something i mean there it at
that point you can't really tell you

76
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:17,040
that point you can't really tell you
 

77
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,310
that point you can't really tell you
know was newton a physicist or a

78
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:18,320
know was newton a physicist or a
 

79
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,550
know was newton a physicist or a
mathematician yeah mathematicians will

80
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,560
mathematician yeah mathematicians will
 

81
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,670
mathematician yeah mathematicians will
tell you as a mathematician the

82
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:21,680
tell you as a mathematician the
 

83
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,270
tell you as a mathematician the
physicist will tell you as a physicist

84
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:23,280
physicist will tell you as a physicist
 

85
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,789
physicist will tell you as a physicist
but he would say he's a philosopher yeah

86
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
but he would say he's a philosopher yeah
 

87
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:27,670
but he would say he's a philosopher yeah
yeah

88
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:27,680
yeah
 

89
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,830
yeah
that's that's interesting but uh yeah

90
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:29,840
that's that's interesting but uh yeah
 

91
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,749
that's that's interesting but uh yeah
anyway there there was kind of no such

92
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:31,759
anyway there there was kind of no such
 

93
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,590
anyway there there was kind of no such
distinction then it's more of a modern

94
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
distinction then it's more of a modern
 

95
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,789
distinction then it's more of a modern
thing and

96
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:34,799
thing and
 

97
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,149
thing and
but anyway i think these days there's a

98
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
but anyway i think these days there's a
 

99
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,590
but anyway i think these days there's a
very interesting space in between the

100
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:37,600
very interesting space in between the
 

101
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,630
very interesting space in between the
two so in the story of the 20th century

102
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,640
two so in the story of the 20th century
 

103
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,630
two so in the story of the 20th century
and the early 21st century what is the

104
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
and the early 21st century what is the
 

105
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,469
and the early 21st century what is the
overlap between mathematics and physics

106
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:44,479
overlap between mathematics and physics
 

107
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,749
overlap between mathematics and physics
would you say

108
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:45,759
would you say
 

109
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,030
would you say
well i think

110
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,040
well i think
 

111
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,030
well i think
it's actually become very very

112
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
it's actually become very very
 

113
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,550
it's actually become very very
complicated i think it's really

114
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,560
complicated i think it's really
 

115
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,230
complicated i think it's really
interesting to see a lot of what my

116
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,240
interesting to see a lot of what my
 

117
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,590
interesting to see a lot of what my
colleagues and

118
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:53,600
colleagues and
 

119
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,990
colleagues and
math department are doing they

120
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:56,000
math department are doing they
 

121
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,030
math department are doing they
most of what they're doing they're doing

122
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:57,040
most of what they're doing they're doing
 

123
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,630
most of what they're doing they're doing
all sorts of different things but um

124
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:58,640
all sorts of different things but um
 

125
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,149
all sorts of different things but um
most of them have some kind of overlap

126
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
most of them have some kind of overlap
 

127
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,230
most of them have some kind of overlap
with physics or other

128
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,240
with physics or other
 

129
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,069
with physics or other
so i mean i'm personally interested in

130
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:04,079
so i mean i'm personally interested in
 

131
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,069
so i mean i'm personally interested in
one spec one particular aspect of this

132
00:02:06,069 --> 00:02:06,079
one spec one particular aspect of this
 

133
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,670
one spec one particular aspect of this
overlap which i think

134
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:07,680
overlap which i think
 

135
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,710
overlap which i think
has a lot to do with the most

136
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:08,720
has a lot to do with the most
 

137
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,229
has a lot to do with the most
fundamental ideas about physics and

138
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:10,239
fundamental ideas about physics and
 

139
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,110
fundamental ideas about physics and
about

140
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,120
about
 

141
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,270
about
mathematics but um

142
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:13,280
mathematics but um
 

143
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,229
mathematics but um
there's just

144
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:14,239
there's just
 

145
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,710
there's just
you you kind of see this this uh

146
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:16,720
you you kind of see this this uh
 

147
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,710
you you kind of see this this uh
really really everywhere at this point

148
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,720
really really everywhere at this point
 

149
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,550
really really everywhere at this point
which particular overlap are you looking

150
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
which particular overlap are you looking
 

151
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,910
which particular overlap are you looking
at group theory yeah so the um

152
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:23,920
at group theory yeah so the um
 

153
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,110
at group theory yeah so the um
at least

154
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120
at least
 

155
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,550
at least
what the way it seems to me that if you

156
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
what the way it seems to me that if you
 

157
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,390
what the way it seems to me that if you
look at physics and look at the our most

158
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,400
look at physics and look at the our most
 

159
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,910
look at physics and look at the our most
successful um

160
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:29,920
successful um
 

161
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,750
successful um
laws of fundamental physics

162
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:31,760
laws of fundamental physics
 

163
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,869
laws of fundamental physics
they're

164
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:32,879
they're
 

165
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,070
they're
really you know they have a certain kind

166
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,080
really you know they have a certain kind
 

167
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,670
really you know they have a certain kind
of mathematical structure it's based

168
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:35,680
of mathematical structure it's based
 

169
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,550
of mathematical structure it's based
upon

170
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
upon
 

171
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,150
upon
certain kind of mathematical objects and

172
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,160
certain kind of mathematical objects and
 

173
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,270
certain kind of mathematical objects and
geometry connections and curvature the

174
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
geometry connections and curvature the
 

175
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,750
geometry connections and curvature the
spinners the rock equation

176
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:43,760
spinners the rock equation
 

177
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,270
spinners the rock equation
and uh that

178
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
and uh that
 

179
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,270
and uh that
these this very deep mathematics

180
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:47,280
these this very deep mathematics
 

181
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,670
these this very deep mathematics
provides kind of a unifying

182
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
provides kind of a unifying
 

183
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,910
provides kind of a unifying
set of meth of ways of thinking that

184
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
set of meth of ways of thinking that
 

185
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,830
set of meth of ways of thinking that
allow you to to make a unified theory of

186
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
allow you to to make a unified theory of
 

187
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,990
allow you to to make a unified theory of
physics but the interesting thing is

188
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,000
physics but the interesting thing is
 

189
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,990
physics but the interesting thing is
that if you go to mathematics and look

190
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,000
that if you go to mathematics and look
 

191
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,470
that if you go to mathematics and look
at what's been going on in mathematics

192
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
at what's been going on in mathematics
 

193
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,589
at what's been going on in mathematics
the last

194
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
the last
 

195
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,630
the last
1500 years and even especially recently

196
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
1500 years and even especially recently
 

197
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,990
1500 years and even especially recently
there's a

198
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
there's a
 

199
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,630
there's a
similarly some kind of unifying ideas

200
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:08,640
similarly some kind of unifying ideas
 

201
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,990
similarly some kind of unifying ideas
which bring together different areas of

202
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:10,000
which bring together different areas of
 

203
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,589
which bring together different areas of
mathematics and which have been

204
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
mathematics and which have been
 

205
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,110
mathematics and which have been
especially powerful in number theory

206
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,120
especially powerful in number theory
 

207
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,470
especially powerful in number theory
recently and

208
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,480
recently and
 

209
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,790
recently and
there's a book for instance by um

210
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:16,800
there's a book for instance by um
 

211
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,030
there's a book for instance by um
edward frankel about love and math and

212
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
edward frankel about love and math and
 

213
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,710
edward frankel about love and math and
oh yeah that book is great i recommend

214
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:20,720
oh yeah that book is great i recommend
 

215
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,990
oh yeah that book is great i recommend
it highly it's uh partially accessible

216
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,000
it highly it's uh partially accessible
 

217
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,710
it highly it's uh partially accessible
but there's a nice audio book

218
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:26,720
but there's a nice audio book
 

219
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,869
but there's a nice audio book
that i had listened to while

220
00:03:28,869 --> 00:03:28,879
that i had listened to while
 

221
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,750
that i had listened to while
running an exceptionally long distance

222
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:31,760
running an exceptionally long distance
 

223
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,390
running an exceptionally long distance
like across the san francisco

224
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:34,400
like across the san francisco
 

225
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,350
like across the san francisco
bridge

226
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
bridge
 

227
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,750
bridge
and uh there's something magic about the

228
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
and uh there's something magic about the
 

229
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,670
and uh there's something magic about the
way he writes about it but some of the

230
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:39,680
way he writes about it but some of the
 

231
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,869
way he writes about it but some of the
group theory in there is a little bit

232
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:40,879
group theory in there is a little bit
 

233
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,830
group theory in there is a little bit
difficult

234
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
difficult
 

235
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,589
difficult
uh yeah it's a problem with any of these

236
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
uh yeah it's a problem with any of these
 

237
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,350
uh yeah it's a problem with any of these
things to kind of really say what's

238
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:45,360
things to kind of really say what's
 

239
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,869
things to kind of really say what's
going on is

240
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:46,879
going on is
 

241
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,869
going on is
and make it accessible is very hard

242
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
and make it accessible is very hard
 

243
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,550
and make it accessible is very hard
he in this book and elsewhere i think

244
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:50,560
he in this book and elsewhere i think
 

245
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,869
he in this book and elsewhere i think
you know takes the attitude that kinds

246
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:52,879
you know takes the attitude that kinds
 

247
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,390
you know takes the attitude that kinds
of mathematics he's interested in and

248
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:54,400
of mathematics he's interested in and
 

249
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,030
of mathematics he's interested in and
that he's talking about are provide kind

250
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,040
that he's talking about are provide kind
 

251
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,110
that he's talking about are provide kind
of a grand unified theory of mathematics

252
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,120
of a grand unified theory of mathematics
 

253
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,229
of a grand unified theory of mathematics
they um they bring together geometry and

254
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
they um they bring together geometry and
 

255
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:03,990
they um they bring together geometry and
number theory and

256
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
number theory and
 

257
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,670
number theory and
representation theory a lot of different

258
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:05,680
representation theory a lot of different
 

259
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,030
representation theory a lot of different
ideas

260
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,040
ideas
 

261
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,070
ideas
in a really

262
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:08,080
in a really
 

263
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,509
in a really
unexpected way

264
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
unexpected way
 

265
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,190
unexpected way
but i think to me the most fascinating

266
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:11,200
but i think to me the most fascinating
 

267
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,470
but i think to me the most fascinating
thing is if you look at

268
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
thing is if you look at
 

269
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,750
thing is if you look at
the kind of grand unified theory of

270
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:13,760
the kind of grand unified theory of
 

271
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,509
the kind of grand unified theory of
mathematics he's talking about and you

272
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:15,519
mathematics he's talking about and you
 

273
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,349
mathematics he's talking about and you
look at the physicists kind of ideas

274
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
look at the physicists kind of ideas
 

275
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,749
look at the physicists kind of ideas
about unification it's more or less the

276
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:19,759
about unification it's more or less the
 

277
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,430
about unification it's more or less the
same mathematical objects are appearing

278
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,440
same mathematical objects are appearing
 

279
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,469
same mathematical objects are appearing
in both

280
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
in both
 

281
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,710
in both
so it's this um i think there's a really

282
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
so it's this um i think there's a really
 

283
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,310
so it's this um i think there's a really
we're seeing a really strong indication

284
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
we're seeing a really strong indication
 

285
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,390
we're seeing a really strong indication
that you know the deepest

286
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:28,400
that you know the deepest
 

287
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,670
that you know the deepest
ideas that we're discovering about

288
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
ideas that we're discovering about
 

289
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,270
ideas that we're discovering about
physics and some of the deepest ideas

290
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:31,280
physics and some of the deepest ideas
 

291
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,030
physics and some of the deepest ideas
that mathematicians are learning about

292
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
that mathematicians are learning about
 

293
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,950
that mathematicians are learning about
are really are you know intimately

294
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:34,960
are really are you know intimately
 

295
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,990
are really are you know intimately
connected

296
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
connected
 

297
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,230
connected
is there something like if i was five

298
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:38,240
is there something like if i was five
 

299
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,590
is there something like if i was five
years old you were trying to explain

300
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
years old you were trying to explain
 

301
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,030
years old you were trying to explain
this to me is there ways to try to sneak

302
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
this to me is there ways to try to sneak
 

303
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,070
this to me is there ways to try to sneak
up to the to to what this unified world

304
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
up to the to to what this unified world
 

305
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,590
up to the to to what this unified world
of mathematics looks like you said

306
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:47,600
of mathematics looks like you said
 

307
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,230
of mathematics looks like you said
number theory he said geometry

308
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:50,240
number theory he said geometry
 

309
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,390
number theory he said geometry
words like topology

310
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:52,400
words like topology
 

311
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,070
words like topology
what does this universe begin to look

312
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
what does this universe begin to look
 

313
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,390
what does this universe begin to look
like are these what should we imagine in

314
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:56,400
like are these what should we imagine in
 

315
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,390
like are these what should we imagine in
our mind is it a

316
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:58,400
our mind is it a
 

317
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,550
our mind is it a
a three-dimensional surface

318
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:00,560
a three-dimensional surface
 

319
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,390
a three-dimensional surface
and we're trying to say something about

320
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
and we're trying to say something about
 

321
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,110
and we're trying to say something about
it

322
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
it
 

323
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,550
it
is it uh

324
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:04,560
is it uh
 

325
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,350
is it uh
triangles and squares and cubes like

326
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:07,360
triangles and squares and cubes like
 

327
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,950
triangles and squares and cubes like
what what are we supposed to imagine our

328
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:08,960
what what are we supposed to imagine our
 

329
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,270
what what are we supposed to imagine our
minds is this natural number what what's

330
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,280
minds is this natural number what what's
 

331
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,670
minds is this natural number what what's
a good thing to try to

332
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:13,680
a good thing to try to
 

333
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,189
a good thing to try to
for people that

334
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:15,199

335
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,870
for people that
don't know any of these tools except

00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:16,880
don't know any of these tools except
 

337
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,870
don't know any of these tools except
maybe some basic calculus and geometry

338
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
maybe some basic calculus and geometry
 

339
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,629
maybe some basic calculus and geometry
from high school that they should keep

00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:20,639
from high school that they should keep

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,790
as to the unified world of mathematics
that also

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:26,800
that also
 

347
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,710
that also
allows us to explore the unified world

348
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
allows us to explore the unified world
 

349
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,830
allows us to explore the unified world
of physics

find kind of remarkable about this is

00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:34,240
find kind of remarkable about this is
 

355
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,990
find kind of remarkable about this is
the way in which

356
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,000
the way in which
 

357
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,230
the way in which
these we've discovered these ideas but

358
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
these we've discovered these ideas but
 

359
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,310
these we've discovered these ideas but
they're they're actually quite alien to

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:40,320
they're they're actually quite alien to
 

361
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,029
they're they're actually quite alien to
our everyday understanding you know we

grow up in this three spatial
 

365
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,390
grow up in this three spatial
dimensional world and we have

366
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:46,400
dimensional world and we have
 

367
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,070
dimensional world and we have
intimate understanding of certain kinds

of geometry and certain kinds of things
 

371
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,870
of geometry and certain kinds of things
but um these things that we've

372
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:52,880
but um these things that we've
 

373
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,830
but um these things that we've
discovered in both math and physics are

374
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
discovered in both math and physics are
 

375
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,510
discovered in both math and physics are
that they're not at all

376
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:57,520
that they're not at all
 

377
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,749
that they're not at all
close have any obvious connection to

379
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,670
close have any obvious connection to
kind of human everyday experience that

380
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
kind of human everyday experience that
 

381
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,749
kind of human everyday experience that
they're really quite different and i can

382
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
they're really quite different and i can
 

383
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,670
they're really quite different and i can
say some of my initial fascination with

384
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
say some of my initial fascination with
 

385
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,029
say some of my initial fascination with
this when i was

386
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
this when i was
 

387
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,629
this when i was
young and starting to learn about it was

388
00:06:08,629 --> 00:06:08,639
young and starting to learn about it was
 

389
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,510
young and starting to learn about it was
actually

390
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:09,520
actually
 

391
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,790
actually
exactly this um

392
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800

 

393
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,150

this kind of arcane nature of these

394
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,160
this kind of arcane nature of these
 

395
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,790
this kind of arcane nature of these
things it was a little bit like being

396
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
things it was a little bit like being
 

397
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,189
things it was a little bit like being
being told well there are these kind of

398
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:19,199
being told well there are these kind of
 

399
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,110
being told well there are these kind of
some semi-mystical experience that you

400
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
some semi-mystical experience that you
 

401
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,230
some semi-mystical experience that you
can acquire by a long study and whatever

402
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
can acquire by a long study and whatever
 

403
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,110
can acquire by a long study and whatever
except

404
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,120
except
 

405
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,029
except
that that it was actually true there's

406
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:27,039
that that it was actually true there's
 

407
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,230
that that it was actually true there's
actually evidence that this actually

408
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:28,240
actually evidence that this actually
 

409
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,350
actually evidence that this actually
works

410
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,360
works
 

411
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,510
works
so you know i'm a little bit wary of

412
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:31,520
so you know i'm a little bit wary of
 

413
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,950
so you know i'm a little bit wary of
trying to give people

414
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
trying to give people
 

415
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,909
trying to give people
and that kind of thing because i think

416
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:33,919
and that kind of thing because i think
 

417
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,590
and that kind of thing because i think
it's mostly misleading but one thing to

418
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:35,600
it's mostly misleading but one thing to
 

419
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,830
it's mostly misleading but one thing to
say is that you know that geometry is a

420
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
say is that you know that geometry is a
 

421
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,189
say is that you know that geometry is a
large

422
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
large
 

423
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,270
large
part of it and um

424
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
part of it and um
 

425
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,110
part of it and um
maybe one interesting thing to say very

426
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
maybe one interesting thing to say very
 

427
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,629
maybe one interesting thing to say very
that's about more recent some of the

428
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:44,639
that's about more recent some of the
 

429
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,029
that's about more recent some of the
most recent ideas is that it um when we

430
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
most recent ideas is that it um when we
 

431
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,350
most recent ideas is that it um when we
think about the geometry of our space

432
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:49,360
think about the geometry of our space
 

433
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,589
think about the geometry of our space
and time it's kind of three spatial and

434
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:51,599
and time it's kind of three spatial and
 

435
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:52,390
and time it's kind of three spatial and
one

436
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
one
 

437
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,350
one
time dimension it's a um

438
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:55,360
time dimension it's a um
 

439
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,749
time dimension it's a um
physics is in some sense about

440
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:57,759
physics is in some sense about
 

441
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,909
physics is in some sense about
something as kind of four dimensional in

442
00:06:59,909 --> 00:06:59,919
something as kind of four dimensional in
 

443
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,390
something as kind of four dimensional in
a way and that a really interesting

444
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
a way and that a really interesting
 

445
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,150
a way and that a really interesting
thing about um some of the recent

446
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,160
thing about um some of the recent
 

447
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,629
thing about um some of the recent
developments and number theory have been

448
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
developments and number theory have been
 

449
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,189
developments and number theory have been
to realize that the um

450
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:09,199
to realize that the um
 

451
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,710
to realize that the um
these ideas that we were looking at you

452
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:10,720
these ideas that we were looking at you
 

453
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,029
these ideas that we were looking at you
know naturally fit into a context where

454
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:13,039
know naturally fit into a context where
 

455
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,469
know naturally fit into a context where
your theory is for is kind of four

456
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
your theory is for is kind of four
 

457
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,670
your theory is for is kind of four
dimensional

458
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
dimensional
 

459
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,629
dimensional
so

460
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:16,639
so
 

461
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,350
so
so so so i mean geometry is a big part

462
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
so so so i mean geometry is a big part
 

463
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,430
so so so i mean geometry is a big part
of this and we know a lot and feel a lot

464
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:21,440
of this and we know a lot and feel a lot
 

465
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,189
of this and we know a lot and feel a lot
about you know two one two three

466
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:23,199
about you know two one two three
 

467
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,589
about you know two one two three
dimensional geometry so wait a minute so

468
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:25,599
dimensional geometry so wait a minute so
 

469
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,990
dimensional geometry so wait a minute so
we can at least rely

470
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
we can at least rely
 

471
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,350
we can at least rely
on the four dimensions of space and time

472
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,360
on the four dimensions of space and time
 

473
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,029
on the four dimensions of space and time
and say that we can get pretty far by

474
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
and say that we can get pretty far by
 

475
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,589
and say that we can get pretty far by
working that in those four dimensions i

476
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
working that in those four dimensions i
 

477
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,710
working that in those four dimensions i
thought you were going to scare me that

478
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:36,720
thought you were going to scare me that
 

479
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,629
thought you were going to scare me that
we're going to have to go to many many

480
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:38,639
we're going to have to go to many many
 

481
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,950
we're going to have to go to many many
many many more dimensions than that

482
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:40,960
many many more dimensions than that
 

483
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,790
many many more dimensions than that
my point of view which is which goes

484
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:42,800
my point of view which is which goes
 

485
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,070
my point of view which is which goes
against a lot of these ideas about

486
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,080
against a lot of these ideas about
 

487
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,189
against a lot of these ideas about
unification is that no this is really

488
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
unification is that no this is really
 

489
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,270
unification is that no this is really
everything we do we know about really is

490
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,280
everything we do we know about really is
 

491
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,309
everything we do we know about really is
about four dimensions that um

492
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:52,319
about four dimensions that um
 

493
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,150
about four dimensions that um
and and that you can actually understand

494
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
and and that you can actually understand
 

495
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,430
and and that you can actually understand
a lot of these structures that we've

496
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
a lot of these structures that we've
 

497
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,950
a lot of these structures that we've
been seeing in fundamental physics and

498
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960

499
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,670
been seeing in fundamental physics and
in

500
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
in
 

501
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,469
in
in number theory just in terms of

502
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
in number theory just in terms of
 

503
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,550
in number theory just in terms of
four dimensions that it's kind of

504
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
four dimensions that it's kind of
 

505
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,270
four dimensions that it's kind of
it's in some sense i would claim

506
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
it's in some sense i would claim
 

507
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,189
it's in some sense i would claim
has been a really um

508
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
has been a really um
 

509
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,749
has been a really um
has been kind of a mistake that

510
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:09,759
has been kind of a mistake that
 

511
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,510
has been kind of a mistake that
physicists have made and

512
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,520
physicists have made and
 

513
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,629
physicists have made and
for decades and decades to try to

514
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
for decades and decades to try to
 

515
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,629
for decades and decades to try to
to try to go to higher dimensions to try

516
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
to try to go to higher dimensions to try
 

517
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,230
to try to go to higher dimensions to try
to formulate a theory in higher

518
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
to formulate a theory in higher
 

519
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,230
to formulate a theory in higher
dimensions and then then you're stuck

520
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
dimensions and then then you're stuck
 

521
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,029
dimensions and then then you're stuck
with

522
00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:21,039
with
 

523
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,309
with
the problem how do you get rid of all

524
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:22,319
the problem how do you get rid of all
 

525
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,589
the problem how do you get rid of all
these extra dimensions that you've

526
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:23,599
these extra dimensions that you've
 

527
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,869
these extra dimensions that you've
created and

528
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:24,879
created and
 

529
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,309
created and
because we only ever see anything

530
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
because we only ever see anything
 

531
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,270
because we only ever see anything
important

532
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
important
 

533
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,029
important
that kind of thing leads us astray you

534
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
that kind of thing leads us astray you
 

535
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,350
that kind of thing leads us astray you
think so so creating all these extra

536
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
think so so creating all these extra
 

537
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,190
think so so creating all these extra
dimensions just to get to give yourself

538
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,200
dimensions just to get to give yourself
 

539
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,589
dimensions just to get to give yourself
extra degrees of freedom

540
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:35,599
extra degrees of freedom
 

541
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,110
extra degrees of freedom
yeah it's not i mean isn't that the

542
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,120
yeah it's not i mean isn't that the
 

543
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,509
yeah it's not i mean isn't that the
process of mathematics is to create

544
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
process of mathematics is to create
 

545
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,350
process of mathematics is to create
all these trajectories for yourself but

546
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:41,360
all these trajectories for yourself but
 

547
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,030
all these trajectories for yourself but
eventually you have to end up at the uh

548
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
eventually you have to end up at the uh
 

549
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,750
eventually you have to end up at the uh
like a final place but it's okay to

550
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
like a final place but it's okay to
 

551
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,150
like a final place but it's okay to
it's okay to sort of um

552
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
it's okay to sort of um
 

553
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,990
it's okay to sort of um
create abstract objects on your path to

554
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,000
create abstract objects on your path to
 

555
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,750
create abstract objects on your path to
uh proving something

556
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
uh proving something
 

557
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,750
uh proving something
yeah so yeah certainly but and from from

558
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:57,760
yeah so yeah certainly but and from from
 

559
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,509
yeah so yeah certainly but and from from
mathematicians point of view

560
00:08:59,509 --> 00:08:59,519
mathematicians point of view
 

561
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,470
mathematicians point of view
i mean

562
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:00,480
i mean
 

563
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,070
i mean
the kinds of mathematicians also are

564
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
the kinds of mathematicians also are
 

565
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,990
the kinds of mathematicians also are
very different than physicists and that

566
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:04,000
very different than physicists and that
 

567
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,829
very different than physicists and that
we like to develop very general theories

568
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
we like to develop very general theories
 

569
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,509
we like to develop very general theories
we like to if we have an idea we want to

570
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:07,519
we like to if we have an idea we want to
 

571
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,590
we like to if we have an idea we want to
um see what's the greatest generality in

572
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
um see what's the greatest generality in
 

573
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,509
um see what's the greatest generality in
which you can talk about it so from the

574
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:11,519
which you can talk about it so from the
 

575
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,509
which you can talk about it so from the
point of view of most of the ways

576
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
point of view of most of the ways
 

577
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,750
point of view of most of the ways
geometry is formulated um

578
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
geometry is formulated um
 

579
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,430
geometry is formulated um
by mathematicians it really doesn't

580
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
by mathematicians it really doesn't
 

581
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,190
by mathematicians it really doesn't
matter it works in any dimension we can

582
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,200
matter it works in any dimension we can
 

583
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,150
matter it works in any dimension we can
do

584
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:20,160
do
 

585
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,910
do
one two three four any any number

586
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:21,920
one two three four any any number
 

587
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,509
one two three four any any number
there's no particular

588
00:09:23,509 --> 00:09:23,519
there's no particular
 

589
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,030
there's no particular
for most of geometry there's no

590
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
for most of geometry there's no
 

591
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,070
for most of geometry there's no
particular special thing but for

592
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
particular special thing but for
 

593
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,910
particular special thing but for
but um

594
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:29,920
but um
 

595
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,310
but um
and anyway but but what physicists have

596
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:32,320
and anyway but but what physicists have
 

597
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,829
and anyway but but what physicists have
have been trying to do over the years is

598
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:33,839
have been trying to do over the years is
 

599
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,590
have been trying to do over the years is
try to understand

600
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:35,600
try to understand
 

601
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,269
try to understand
these fundamental theories in a

602
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
these fundamental theories in a
 

603
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,590
these fundamental theories in a
geometrical way and it's very tempting

604
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
geometrical way and it's very tempting
 

605
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,710
geometrical way and it's very tempting
to kind of just

606
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
to kind of just
 

607
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,949
to kind of just
start bringing in

608
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:42,959
start bringing in
 

609
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,310
start bringing in
extra dimensions

610
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:44,320
extra dimensions
 

611
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,070
extra dimensions
and using them to explain the structure

612
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,080
and using them to explain the structure
 

613
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,350
and using them to explain the structure
but

614
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
but
 

615
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,269
but
um

616
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:49,279
um
 

617
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,710
um
typically this this attempt kind of

618
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:50,720
typically this this attempt kind of
 

619
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,350
typically this this attempt kind of
founders because you just don't know

620
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:53,360
founders because you just don't know
 

621
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,829
founders because you just don't know
you end up not being able to explain why

622
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
you end up not being able to explain why
 

623
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,110
you end up not being able to explain why
we only see four and anyway

624
00:09:59,110 --> 00:09:59,120
we only see four and anyway
 

625
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,910
we only see four and anyway
it is nice in the space of physics that

626
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
it is nice in the space of physics that
 

627
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,509
it is nice in the space of physics that
uh like if you look at from o's last

628
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
uh like if you look at from o's last
 

629
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,389
uh like if you look at from o's last
theorem

630
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:04,399
theorem
 

631
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:05,910
theorem
it's much easier to prove that there's

632
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:05,920
it's much easier to prove that there's
 

633
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,389
it's much easier to prove that there's
no solution for n equals three

634
00:10:08,389 --> 00:10:08,399
no solution for n equals three
 

635
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,509
no solution for n equals three
than it is for the general case

636
00:10:11,509 --> 00:10:11,519
than it is for the general case
 

637
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,150
than it is for the general case
and and so i guess that's the nice

638
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
and and so i guess that's the nice
 

639
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,470
and and so i guess that's the nice
benefit of being a physicist is you

640
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
benefit of being a physicist is you
 

641
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,150
benefit of being a physicist is you
don't have to worry about the general

642
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
don't have to worry about the general
 

643
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,389
don't have to worry about the general
case because we live in a universe with

644
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:20,399
case because we live in a universe with
 

645
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,670
case because we live in a universe with
n equals

646
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:21,680
n equals
 

647
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,190
n equals
four in this case

648
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
four in this case
 

649
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,269
four in this case
yeah the physiophysicists are very

650
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
yeah the physiophysicists are very
 

651
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,110
yeah the physiophysicists are very
interested in

652
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,120
interested in
 

653
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,110
interested in
saying something about specific examples

654
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:29,120
saying something about specific examples
 

655
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,829
saying something about specific examples
and

656
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:29,839
and
 

657
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,509
and
i find that interesting even when i'm

658
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:31,519
i find that interesting even when i'm
 

659
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,670
i find that interesting even when i'm
trying to do things in mathematics and

660
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:33,680
trying to do things in mathematics and
 

661
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,829
trying to do things in mathematics and
i'm trying even teaching courses and

662
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:35,839
i'm trying even teaching courses and
 

663
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,230
i'm trying even teaching courses and
mathematics students i find that

664
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
mathematics students i find that
 

665
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,069
mathematics students i find that
i'm teaching them in a different way

666
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:40,079
i'm teaching them in a different way
 

667
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,030
i'm teaching them in a different way
than um most mathematicians because i'm

668
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
than um most mathematicians because i'm
 

669
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,590
than um most mathematicians because i'm
very often very focused on examples on

670
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
very often very focused on examples on
 

671
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,630
very often very focused on examples on
what's

672
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:46,640
what's
 

673
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,389
what's
what's kind of the crucial example that

674
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
what's kind of the crucial example that
 

675
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,710
what's kind of the crucial example that
shows how this um

676
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:50,720
shows how this um
 

677
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,710
shows how this um
this powerful new mathematical technique

678
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:52,720
this powerful new mathematical technique
 

679
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,630
this powerful new mathematical technique
how it works and why you would want to

680
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:54,640
how it works and why you would want to
 

681
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,750
how it works and why you would want to
to do it

682
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
to do it
 

683
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,310
to do it
and i'm less interested in kind of

684
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:58,320
and i'm less interested in kind of
 

685
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,069
and i'm less interested in kind of
you know proving a precise theorem about

686
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:00,079
you know proving a precise theorem about
 

687
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,430
you know proving a precise theorem about
exactly when it's going to work and when

688
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,440
exactly when it's going to work and when
 

689
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,790
exactly when it's going to work and when
it's not going to work do you think

690
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:02,800
it's not going to work do you think
 

691
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,670
it's not going to work do you think
about really simple examples like uh

692
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
about really simple examples like uh
 

693
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,310
about really simple examples like uh
both for teaching and when you

694
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:08,320
both for teaching and when you
 

695
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,710
both for teaching and when you
try to solve a difficult problem are you

696
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:10,720
try to solve a difficult problem are you
 

697
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,389
try to solve a difficult problem are you
do construct like the simplest possible

698
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:12,399
do construct like the simplest possible
 

699
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,150
do construct like the simplest possible
examples that captures the fundamentals

700
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,160
examples that captures the fundamentals
 

701
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,829
examples that captures the fundamentals
of the problem and try to solve it yeah

702
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
of the problem and try to solve it yeah
 

703
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,470
of the problem and try to solve it yeah
yeah exactly that's often

704
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
yeah exactly that's often
 

705
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,389
yeah exactly that's often
a really fruitful way to if you've got

706
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:20,399
a really fruitful way to if you've got
 

707
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,110
a really fruitful way to if you've got
some idea to you just kind of try to

708
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
some idea to you just kind of try to
 

709
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,230
some idea to you just kind of try to
boil it down to what's the simplest

710
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
boil it down to what's the simplest
 

711
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,829
boil it down to what's the simplest
situation in which this kind of thing is

712
00:11:27,829 --> 00:11:27,839
situation in which this kind of thing is
 

713
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,509
situation in which this kind of thing is
going to happen and then try to really

714
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
going to happen and then try to really
 

715
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,269
going to happen and then try to really
understand that and understand that and

716
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
understand that and understand that and
 

717
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,190
understand that and understand that and
that that is almost always a really good

718
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
that that is almost always a really good
 

719
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,030
that that is almost always a really good
way to get insight into do you work with

720
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
way to get insight into do you work with
 

721
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,829
way to get insight into do you work with
uh paper and pen or like for example for

722
00:11:37,829 --> 00:11:37,839
uh paper and pen or like for example for
 

723
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,990
uh paper and pen or like for example for

kind of mathematical object
 

731
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,389
kind of mathematical object
i like to mess around with it sort of

732
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
i like to mess around with it sort of
 

733
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,949
i like to mess around with it sort of
numerically i just visualize different

numerically i just visualize different
 

735
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,269
numerically i just visualize different
parts of it visualize however i can so

00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
parts of it visualize however i can so

most of the work is like with neural

738
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
most of the work is like with neural
 

739
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,350
most of the work is like with neural
networks for example as you try to play

740
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
networks for example as you try to play
 

741
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,350
networks for example as you try to play
with the simplest possible example and

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:03,279
um you know
 

747
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,710
um you know
any kind of object has a bunch of

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
any kind of object has a bunch of
 

749
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,790
any kind of object has a bunch of

variables in it
 

751
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,310
variables in it
you start to mess around with them in

752
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
you start to mess around with them in
 

753
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,509
you start to mess around with them in
different ways and visualize in

different ways and visualize in
 

755
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,710
different ways and visualize in
different ways to start to build

or do you go to einstein route and just

760
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
or do you go to einstein route and just
 

761
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,230
or do you go to einstein route and just
imagine

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,509
imagine
like

764
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:17,519
like
 

765
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,590
like
everything inside your mind and sort of

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
everything inside your mind and sort of
 

767
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,230
everything inside your mind and sort of

00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:31,680
can kind of
 

779
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,430
can kind of
it's really something that is really

kind of
 

783
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,870
kind of
or even the simplest example

784
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:36,880
or even the simplest example
 

785
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,470
or even the simplest example
you know it can is you can kind of see

786
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
you know it can is you can kind of see
 

787
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,990
you know it can is you can kind of see
what's going on by it looking at

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,000
what's going on by it looking at
 

789
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,150
what's going on by it looking at
something happening in three dimensions

790
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,160
something happening in three dimensions
 

791
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,509
something happening in three dimensions
there's there's generally this the

792
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:43,519
there's there's generally this the
 

793
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,710
there's there's generally this the
structures involved are um

794
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:46,720
structures involved are um
 

795
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,230
structures involved are um
either they're more abstract or if you

796
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:48,240
either they're more abstract or if you
 

797
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,829
either they're more abstract or if you
try to kind of embed them in some kind

798
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
try to kind of embed them in some kind
 

799
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,790
try to kind of embed them in some kind
of space and where you could um

800
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:52,800
of space and where you could um
 

801
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,230
of space and where you could um
manipulate them in some kind of

802
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
manipulate them in some kind of
 

803
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,990
manipulate them in some kind of
geometrical way it's going to be a much

804
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
geometrical way it's going to be a much
 

805
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,230
geometrical way it's going to be a much
higher dimensional space so even simple

806
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
higher dimensional space so even simple
 

807
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,910
higher dimensional space so even simple
examples

808
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
examples
 

809
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:00,949
examples
the embedding them into

810
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:00,959
the embedding them into
 

811
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,389
the embedding them into
three-dimensional space you're losing a

812
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
three-dimensional space you're losing a
 

813
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,590
three-dimensional space you're losing a
lot yeah or but to capture what your

814
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
lot yeah or but to capture what your
 

815
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,949
lot yeah or but to capture what your
what you're trying to understand about

816
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
what you're trying to understand about
 

817
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,030
what you're trying to understand about
them you have to go to four or more

818
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
them you have to go to four or more
 

819
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,710
them you have to go to four or more
dimensions so it starts to get to be

820
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
dimensions so it starts to get to be
 

821
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,750
dimensions so it starts to get to be
hard to

822
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:11,760
hard to
 

823
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,949
hard to
i mean you can

824
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
i mean you can
 

825
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,030
i mean you can
train yourself to try it as much as to

826
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
train yourself to try it as much as to
 

827
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,470
train yourself to try it as much as to
kind of

828
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
kind of
 

829
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,310
kind of
think about things in your mind and you

830
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:18,320
think about things in your mind and you
 

831
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,509
think about things in your mind and you
know i often use pad and paper and often

832
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
know i often use pad and paper and often
 

833
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,389
know i often use pad and paper and often
if i'm

834
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
if i'm
 

835
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,629
if i'm
in my office often use the blackboard

836
00:13:24,629 --> 00:13:24,639
in my office often use the blackboard
 

837
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,710
in my office often use the blackboard
um and you are kind of drawing things

838
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:26,720
um and you are kind of drawing things
 

839
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,470
um and you are kind of drawing things
but they're really kind of more abstract

840
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:28,480
but they're really kind of more abstract
 

841
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,550
but they're really kind of more abstract
representations of how

842
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
representations of how
 

843
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,949
representations of how
things are supposed to fit together and

844
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:32,959
things are supposed to fit together and
 

845
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,470
things are supposed to fit together and
they're not really

846
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:34,480
they're not really
 

847
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,389
they're not really
unfortunately not just kind of really

848
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
unfortunately not just kind of really
 

849
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,949
unfortunately not just kind of really
living in three dimensions where you can

850
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
living in three dimensions where you can
 

851
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,670
living in three dimensions where you can
are we supposed to be sad or excited by

852
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:41,680
are we supposed to be sad or excited by
 

853
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,189
are we supposed to be sad or excited by
the fact that our human minds can't

854
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
the fact that our human minds can't
 

855
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,870
the fact that our human minds can't
fully comprehend the kind of mathematics

856
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:44,880
fully comprehend the kind of mathematics
 

857
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,750
fully comprehend the kind of mathematics
you're talking about i i mean

858
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
you're talking about i i mean
 

859
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,110
you're talking about i i mean
what do we make of that i mean to me

860
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:49,120
what do we make of that i mean to me
 

861
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,670
what do we make of that i mean to me
that makes me quite sad it makes me it

862
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:51,680
that makes me quite sad it makes me it
 

863
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,110
that makes me quite sad it makes me it
makes it seem like there's a giant

864
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
makes it seem like there's a giant
 

865
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,350
makes it seem like there's a giant
mystery out there that we'll never truly

866
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
mystery out there that we'll never truly
 

867
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,350
mystery out there that we'll never truly
get to experience

868
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:57,360
get to experience
 

869
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,230
get to experience
directly it is kind of sad you know how

870
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
directly it is kind of sad you know how
 

871
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,629
directly it is kind of sad you know how
difficult this is i mean or i would put

872
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:02,639
difficult this is i mean or i would put
 

873
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,949
difficult this is i mean or i would put
it a different way that um

874
00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:04,959
it a different way that um
 

875
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,470
it a different way that um
you know most questions that people have

876
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
you know most questions that people have
 

877
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,470
you know most questions that people have
about this kind of thing

878
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:08,480
about this kind of thing
 

879
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,470
about this kind of thing
you know you couldn't you can give them

880
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:10,480
you know you couldn't you can give them
 

881
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,389
you know you couldn't you can give them
a really a true answer and really

882
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
a really a true answer and really
 

883
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,750
a really a true answer and really
understand it but

884
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
understand it but
 

885
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,470
understand it but
the problem is is one more of um of time

886
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
the problem is is one more of um of time
 

887
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,590
the problem is is one more of um of time
it's like

888
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:17,600
it's like
 

889
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,590
it's like
yes you know i could explain to you how

890
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:19,600
yes you know i could explain to you how
 

891
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,230
yes you know i could explain to you how
this works but you have to be willing to

892
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:22,240
this works but you have to be willing to
 

893
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,150
this works but you have to be willing to
sit down with me and you know work at

894
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,160
sit down with me and you know work at
 

895
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,670
sit down with me and you know work at
this repeatedly for

896
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
this repeatedly for
 

897
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,829
this repeatedly for
you know for hours and days and weeks

898
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:27,839
you know for hours and days and weeks
 

899
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,069
you know for hours and days and weeks
and you you mean it's just going to take

900
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:30,079
and you you mean it's just going to take
 

901
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,470
and you you mean it's just going to take
that long for your mind to really wrap

902
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:32,480
that long for your mind to really wrap
 

903
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,509
that long for your mind to really wrap
itself around what's going on and um

904
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
itself around what's going on and um
 

905
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,590
itself around what's going on and um
and that so that does make things an

906
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:37,600
and that so that does make things an
 

907
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,750
and that so that does make things an
inaccessible which is uh

908
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:39,760
inaccessible which is uh
 

909
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,750
inaccessible which is uh
which is sad but it again i mean it's

910
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,760
which is sad but it again i mean it's
 

911
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,269
which is sad but it again i mean it's
just kind of part of life that we all

912
00:14:43,269 --> 00:14:43,279
just kind of part of life that we all
 

913
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,030
just kind of part of life that we all
have a limited amount of time and we

914
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,040
have a limited amount of time and we
 

915
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,509
have a limited amount of time and we
have to decide what we're going to

916
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
have to decide what we're going to
 

917
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,750
have to decide what we're going to
what we're going to spend our time doing

918
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:49,760
what we're going to spend our time doing
 

919
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,389
what we're going to spend our time doing
speaking of a limited amount of time we

920
00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:52,399
speaking of a limited amount of time we
 

921
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,030
speaking of a limited amount of time we
only have a few hours maybe a few days

922
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
only have a few hours maybe a few days
 

923
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,590
only have a few hours maybe a few days
together here on this podcast

924
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:57,600
together here on this podcast
 

925
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,829
together here on this podcast
let me ask you the question

926
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
let me ask you the question
 

927
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,949
let me ask you the question
of um

928
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
of um
 

929
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,790
of um
amongst many of the ideas that you work

930
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:02,800
amongst many of the ideas that you work
 

931
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,590
amongst many of the ideas that you work
on

932
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:03,600
on
 

933
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,910
on
in mathematics and physics what to use

934
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:05,920
in mathematics and physics what to use
 

935
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,069
in mathematics and physics what to use
the most beautiful idea or one of the

936
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:08,079
the most beautiful idea or one of the
 

937
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:10,150
the most beautiful idea or one of the
most beautiful ideas maybe a surprising

938
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:10,160
most beautiful ideas maybe a surprising
 

939
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,030
most beautiful ideas maybe a surprising
idea and once again unfortunately the

940
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
idea and once again unfortunately the
 

941
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,710
idea and once again unfortunately the
way life works we only have a limited

942
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
way life works we only have a limited
 

943
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,310
way life works we only have a limited
time together try to convey such an idea

944
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:18,320
time together try to convey such an idea
 

945
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,269
time together try to convey such an idea
okay well actually let me just tell you

946
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:21,279
okay well actually let me just tell you
 

947
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,150
okay well actually let me just tell you
something which i i'm tempted to kind of

948
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:24,160
something which i i'm tempted to kind of
 

949
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,590
something which i i'm tempted to kind of
start trying to explain what i think is

950
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:25,600
start trying to explain what i think is
 

951
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,269
start trying to explain what i think is
this most powerful idea that brings

952
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:27,279
this most powerful idea that brings
 

953
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,509
this most powerful idea that brings
together math and physics ideas about

954
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:29,519
together math and physics ideas about
 

955
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,509
together math and physics ideas about
groups and representations and how it

956
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:31,519
groups and representations and how it
 

957
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,590
groups and representations and how it
fits quantum mechanics and but in some

958
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:33,600
fits quantum mechanics and but in some
 

959
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,189
fits quantum mechanics and but in some
sense i wrote a whole textbook about

960
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:35,199
sense i wrote a whole textbook about
 

961
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,310
sense i wrote a whole textbook about
that and

962
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
that and
 

963
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,509
that and
i don't think we really have time to get

964
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:37,519
i don't think we really have time to get
 

965
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,910
i don't think we really have time to get
very far into it so well can i actually

966
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:39,920
very far into it so well can i actually
 

967
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,069
very far into it so well can i actually
on a small tangent you did write a paper

968
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
on a small tangent you did write a paper
 

969
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,509
on a small tangent you did write a paper
towards the grant unified theory

970
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
towards the grant unified theory
 

971
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,509
towards the grant unified theory
mathematics and physics

972
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:45,519
mathematics and physics
 

973
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,829
mathematics and physics
um maybe you could step there first what

974
00:15:47,829 --> 00:15:47,839
um maybe you could step there first what
 

975
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,509
um maybe you could step there first what
is the key idea in that paper well i

976
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
is the key idea in that paper well i
 

977
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,430
is the key idea in that paper well i
think we've kind of gone over that i

978
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:51,440
think we've kind of gone over that i
 

979
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,949
think we've kind of gone over that i
think that the key idea is what we were

980
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:52,959
think that the key idea is what we were
 

981
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,230
think that the key idea is what we were
talking about earlier that um

982
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
talking about earlier that um
 

983
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,990
talking about earlier that um
that just kind of a claim that if you

984
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,000
that just kind of a claim that if you
 

985
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,350
that just kind of a claim that if you
look and see what's that have been

986
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
look and see what's that have been
 

987
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,430
look and see what's that have been
successful ideas in unification in

988
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:01,440
successful ideas in unification in
 

989
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,509
successful ideas in unification in
physics and over the last

990
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:03,519
physics and over the last
 

991
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,230
physics and over the last
um 50 years or so and what

992
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
um 50 years or so and what
 

993
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,749
um 50 years or so and what
has been happening in mathematics and

994
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:07,759
has been happening in mathematics and
 

995
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,189
has been happening in mathematics and
the kind of thing that

996
00:16:09,189 --> 00:16:09,199
the kind of thing that
 

997
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,189
the kind of thing that
frankl's book is about that these are

998
00:16:11,189 --> 00:16:11,199
frankl's book is about that these are
 

999
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:12,870
frankl's book is about that these are
very much the same kind of mathematics

1000
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
very much the same kind of mathematics
 

1001
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,310
very much the same kind of mathematics
and so it's kind of an argument that

1002
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
and so it's kind of an argument that
 

1003
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,430
and so it's kind of an argument that
there really

1004
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
there really
 

1005
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,310
there really
is

1006
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:16,320
is
 

1007
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,189
is
you shouldn't be looking to unify just

1008
00:16:19,189 --> 00:16:19,199
you shouldn't be looking to unify just
 

1009
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,870
you shouldn't be looking to unify just
math or just

1010
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:20,880
math or just
 

1011
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,230
math or just
fundamental physics but taking

1012
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,240
fundamental physics but taking
 

1013
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,550
fundamental physics but taking
inspiration for looking for new ideas in

1014
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
inspiration for looking for new ideas in
 

1015
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,990
inspiration for looking for new ideas in
fundamental physics that they are going

1016
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
fundamental physics that they are going
 

1017
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,470
fundamental physics that they are going
to be in the same direction of

1018
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:28,480
to be in the same direction of
 

1019
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,710
to be in the same direction of
getting deeper into mathematics and

1020
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:30,720
getting deeper into mathematics and
 

1021
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,189
getting deeper into mathematics and
looking for more inspiration mathematics

1022
00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:33,199
looking for more inspiration mathematics
 

1023
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,470
looking for more inspiration mathematics
from

1024
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
from
 

1025
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,150
from
these successful ideas about fundamental

1026
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
these successful ideas about fundamental
 

1027
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,189
these successful ideas about fundamental
physics

1028
00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:37,199
physics
 

1029
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,870
physics
could you put words to sort of the

1030
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
could you put words to sort of the
 

1031
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,470
could you put words to sort of the
disciplines we're trying to unify so you

1032
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:40,480
disciplines we're trying to unify so you
 

1033
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,550
disciplines we're trying to unify so you
said number theory are we literally

1034
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:42,560
said number theory are we literally
 

1035
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,829
said number theory are we literally
talking about all the major fields of

1036
00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:43,839
talking about all the major fields of
 

1037
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,150
talking about all the major fields of
mathematics so it's like the number

1038
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:46,160
mathematics so it's like the number
 

1039
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,829
mathematics so it's like the number
theory geometry

1040
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:47,839
theory geometry
 

1041
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,710
theory geometry
uh so the differential geometry topology

1042
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:50,720
uh so the differential geometry topology
 

1043
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,670
uh so the differential geometry topology
like yeah

1044
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:51,680
like yeah
 

1045
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,189
like yeah
so the i mean one one name for this

1046
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
so the i mean one one name for this
 

1047
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,430
so the i mean one one name for this
that this is acquired in in mathematics

1048
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
that this is acquired in in mathematics
 

1049
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,590
that this is acquired in in mathematics
is the so-called language program

1050
00:16:59,590 --> 00:16:59,600
is the so-called language program
 

1051
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,110
is the so-called language program
and uh so this started out in

1052
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:01,120
and uh so this started out in
 

1053
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,030
and uh so this started out in
mathematics it's that

1054
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
mathematics it's that
 

1055
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,470
mathematics it's that
you know robert langland's kind of

1056
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:04,480
you know robert langland's kind of
 

1057
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,029
you know robert langland's kind of
realized that a lot of what people were

1058
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:07,039
realized that a lot of what people were
 

1059
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,870
realized that a lot of what people were
doing and um

1060
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
doing and um
 

1061
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,230
doing and um
that was starting to be really

1062
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
that was starting to be really
 

1063
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,949
that was starting to be really
successful in number theory in the

1064
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:12,959
successful in number theory in the
 

1065
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,870
successful in number theory in the
60s and so that this actually

1066
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:16,880
60s and so that this actually
 

1067
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,949
60s and so that this actually
was

1068
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:18,959
was
 

1069
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,549
was
anyway that this could be could be

1070
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:20,559
anyway that this could be could be
 

1071
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,710
anyway that this could be could be
thought of in terms of um

1072
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:22,720
thought of in terms of um
 

1073
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,549
thought of in terms of um
these ideas about symmetry in groups and

1074
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:24,559
these ideas about symmetry in groups and
 

1075
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:25,990
these ideas about symmetry in groups and
representations

1076
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
representations
 

1077
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,069
representations
and and

1078
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:28,079
and and
 

1079
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,750
and and
in a way that was also close to some

1080
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
in a way that was also close to some
 

1081
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,710
in a way that was also close to some
ideas about about geometry and um then

1082
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:32,720
ideas about about geometry and um then
 

1083
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,950
ideas about about geometry and um then
it more later on in the 80s and 90s

1084
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:34,960
it more later on in the 80s and 90s
 

1085
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,789
it more later on in the 80s and 90s
there was something called um

1086
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:36,799
there was something called um
 

1087
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,190
there was something called um
geometric language that people realize

1088
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
geometric language that people realize
 

1089
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,710
geometric language that people realize
that you could take what people have

1090
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:40,720
that you could take what people have
 

1091
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,390
that you could take what people have
been doing in number theory in language

1092
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:42,400
been doing in number theory in language
 

1093
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,710
been doing in number theory in language
and and and get re just forget about the

1094
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:44,720
and and and get re just forget about the
 

1095
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,230
and and and get re just forget about the
number theory and ask what is this

1096
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:46,240
number theory and ask what is this
 

1097
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,310
number theory and ask what is this
telling you about geometry and you get a

1098
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:48,320
telling you about geometry and you get a
 

1099
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,230
telling you about geometry and you get a
whole some new insights into certain

1100
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:50,240
whole some new insights into certain
 

1101
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,230
whole some new insights into certain
kinds of geometry that way

1102
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:52,240
kinds of geometry that way
 

1103
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,390
kinds of geometry that way
so it's anyway that that's kind of the

1104
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:54,400
so it's anyway that that's kind of the
 

1105
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,310
so it's anyway that that's kind of the
name for this area is langlins and

1106
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:56,320
name for this area is langlins and
 

1107
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,909
name for this area is langlins and
geometric language

1108
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
geometric language
 

1109
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,430
geometric language
and just recently in the last few months

1110
00:17:59,430 --> 00:17:59,440
and just recently in the last few months
 

1111
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,029
and just recently in the last few months
there's been um

1112
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:01,039
there's been um
 

1113
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,549
there's been um
there's kind of a really major paper

1114
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
there's kind of a really major paper
 

1115
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,270
there's kind of a really major paper
that uh appeared by uh peter schultz and

1116
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,280
that uh appeared by uh peter schultz and
 

1117
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,669
that uh appeared by uh peter schultz and
laurel farg where they

1118
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:07,679
laurel farg where they
 

1119
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:10,390
laurel farg where they
you know made you know some serious

1120
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:10,400
you know made you know some serious
 

1121
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,710
you know made you know some serious
advance and trying to understand

1122
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:12,720
advance and trying to understand
 

1123
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,870
advance and trying to understand
a very much

1124
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:14,880
a very much
 

1125
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,710
a very much
kind of a local problem of what happens

1126
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:16,720
kind of a local problem of what happens
 

1127
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,789
kind of a local problem of what happens
in number theory near a certain prime

1128
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
in number theory near a certain prime
 

1129
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,710
in number theory near a certain prime
number and they

1130
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:20,720
number and they
 

1131
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,029
number and they
turn this into a problem of exactly the

1132
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
turn this into a problem of exactly the
 

1133
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,190
turn this into a problem of exactly the
the kind the geometric

1134
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
the kind the geometric
 

1135
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,549
the kind the geometric
language people had been doing these

1136
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
language people had been doing these
 

1137
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,789
language people had been doing these
kind of pure a pure geometry problem and

1138
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
kind of pure a pure geometry problem and
 

1139
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,669
kind of pure a pure geometry problem and
they

1140
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
they
 

1141
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,789
they
found

1142
00:18:30,789 --> 00:18:30,799
found
 

1143
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,310
found
by generalizing the mathematics they

1144
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
by generalizing the mathematics they
 

1145
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,830
by generalizing the mathematics they
could actually reformulate it in that

1146
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
could actually reformulate it in that
 

1147
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,870
could actually reformulate it in that
way and it worked perfectly well

1148
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:36,880
way and it worked perfectly well
 

1149
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,669
way and it worked perfectly well
one of the things that makes me sad

1150
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
one of the things that makes me sad
 

1151
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,270
one of the things that makes me sad
is you know i'm um pretty knowledgeable

1152
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
is you know i'm um pretty knowledgeable
 

1153
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,590
is you know i'm um pretty knowledgeable
person and then

1154
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
person and then
 

1155
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,950
person and then
uh what is it at least i'm in the

1156
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
uh what is it at least i'm in the
 

1157
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,789
uh what is it at least i'm in the
neighborhood of like theoretical

1158
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:48,799
neighborhood of like theoretical
 

1159
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,390
neighborhood of like theoretical
computer science right

1160
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:50,400
computer science right
 

1161
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,630
computer science right
and it's still way out of my reach and

1162
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
and it's still way out of my reach and
 

1163
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,310
and it's still way out of my reach and
so many people talk about like language

1164
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,320
so many people talk about like language
 

1165
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,830
so many people talk about like language
for example is one of the most brilliant

1166
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
for example is one of the most brilliant
 

1167
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,150
for example is one of the most brilliant
people in mathematics and just really

1168
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:58,160
people in mathematics and just really
 

1169
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,830
people in mathematics and just really
admires work

1170
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
admires work
 

1171
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,270
admires work
and i can't

1172
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:01,280
and i can't
 

1173
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,510
and i can't
it's like almost i can't hear the music

1174
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:03,520
it's like almost i can't hear the music
 

1175
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,750
it's like almost i can't hear the music
that he composed and it makes me sad

1176
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:05,760
that he composed and it makes me sad
 

1177
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,310
that he composed and it makes me sad
yeah well i mean i i think that

1178
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
yeah well i mean i i think that
 

1179
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,549
yeah well i mean i i think that
unfortunately it's not just

1180
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
unfortunately it's not just
 

1181
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,029
unfortunately it's not just
you as i think even most mathematicians

1182
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
you as i think even most mathematicians
 

1183
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,029
you as i think even most mathematicians
have no really don't actually understand

1184
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
have no really don't actually understand
 

1185
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,870
have no really don't actually understand
this about them in the the group of

1186
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:16,880
this about them in the the group of
 

1187
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,270
this about them in the the group of
people who really understand

1188
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
people who really understand
 

1189
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,029
people who really understand
all these ideas and so for instance this

1190
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,039
all these ideas and so for instance this
 

1191
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,310
all these ideas and so for instance this
paper of

1192
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
paper of
 

1193
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,669
paper of
schultz and farg that i was talking

1194
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
schultz and farg that i was talking
 

1195
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,270
schultz and farg that i was talking
about the number of people who really

1196
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:25,280
about the number of people who really
 

1197
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,150
about the number of people who really
actually understand how that works is

1198
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
actually understand how that works is
 

1199
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,669
actually understand how that works is
anyway one

1200
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:29,679
anyway one
 

1201
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,310
anyway one
very very small and so it's uh so i i

1202
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,320
very very small and so it's uh so i i
 

1203
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,510
very very small and so it's uh so i i
think even

1204
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:33,520
think even
 

1205
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,029
think even
you find if you talk to mathematicians

1206
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:35,039
you find if you talk to mathematicians
 

1207
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,950
you find if you talk to mathematicians
and physicists even they will often feel

1208
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:36,960
and physicists even they will often feel
 

1209
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,549
and physicists even they will often feel
that you know there's this really

1210
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:38,559
that you know there's this really
 

1211
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,350
that you know there's this really
interesting sounding stuff going on and

1212
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:41,360
interesting sounding stuff going on and
 

1213
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,710
interesting sounding stuff going on and
which i should be able to understand

1214
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:42,720
which i should be able to understand
 

1215
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,230
which i should be able to understand
it's kind of in my own field i have a

1216
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:44,240
it's kind of in my own field i have a
 

1217
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,549
it's kind of in my own field i have a
phd in but it still seems it's pretty

1218
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
phd in but it still seems it's pretty
 

1219
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,590
phd in but it still seems it's pretty
clearly far beyond me right now

1220
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:49,600
clearly far beyond me right now
 

1221
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,150
clearly far beyond me right now
well if we can step into the back to the

1222
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:52,160
well if we can step into the back to the
 

1223
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,390
well if we can step into the back to the
question of beauty uh

1224
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
question of beauty uh
 

1225
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,029
question of beauty uh
is there an idea that maybe is a little

1226
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
is there an idea that maybe is a little
 

1227
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,390
is there an idea that maybe is a little
bit smaller

1228
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
bit smaller
 

1229
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,909
bit smaller
that you find beautiful in the space of

1230
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
that you find beautiful in the space of
 

1231
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,830
that you find beautiful in the space of
mathematics or physics

1232
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:01,840
mathematics or physics
 

1233
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,590
mathematics or physics
there's an idea that you know i kind of

1234
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
there's an idea that you know i kind of
 

1235
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,590
there's an idea that you know i kind of
went got a physics phd and spent a lot

1236
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:05,600
went got a physics phd and spent a lot
 

1237
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,669
went got a physics phd and spent a lot
of time learning about mathematics and i

1238
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
of time learning about mathematics and i
 

1239
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,630
of time learning about mathematics and i
guess

1240
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
guess
 

1241
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,710
guess
it was embarrassing and i hadn't really

1242
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
it was embarrassing and i hadn't really
 

1243
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,390
it was embarrassing and i hadn't really
actually understood this very simple

1244
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
actually understood this very simple
 

1245
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,430
actually understood this very simple
idea

1246
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:13,440
idea
 

1247
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,590
idea
um until and kind of learned it when i

1248
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
um until and kind of learned it when i
 

1249
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,990
um until and kind of learned it when i
actually started teaching math classes

1250
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,000
actually started teaching math classes
 

1251
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,830
actually started teaching math classes
which

1252
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:18,840
which
 

1253
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,390
which
is maybe that there there may be

1254
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:22,400
is maybe that there there may be
 

1255
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,830
is maybe that there there may be
there's a simple way to explain kind of

1256
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:23,840
there's a simple way to explain kind of
 

1257
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,230
there's a simple way to explain kind of
the fundamental way in which algebra and

1258
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
the fundamental way in which algebra and
 

1259
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,549
the fundamental way in which algebra and
geometry are connected so you normally

1260
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
geometry are connected so you normally
 

1261
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,510
geometry are connected so you normally
think of geometry is about these spaces

1262
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
think of geometry is about these spaces
 

1263
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,510
think of geometry is about these spaces
and these points and

1264
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
and these points and
 

1265
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,350
and these points and
and you think of algebra is this very

1266
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
and you think of algebra is this very
 

1267
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,669
and you think of algebra is this very
abstract thing about with these

1268
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
abstract thing about with these
 

1269
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,510
abstract thing about with these
abstract objects that satisfy certain

1270
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:39,520
abstract objects that satisfy certain
 

1271
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,149
abstract objects that satisfy certain
kinds of relations you can multiply them

1272
00:20:42,149 --> 00:20:42,159
kinds of relations you can multiply them
 

1273
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,750
kinds of relations you can multiply them
and add them and

1274
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:43,760
and add them and
 

1275
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,270
and add them and
do stuff but it's it's completely

1276
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:45,280
do stuff but it's it's completely
 

1277
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,110
do stuff but it's it's completely
abstract and there's nothing geometric

1278
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,120
abstract and there's nothing geometric
 

1279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,789
abstract and there's nothing geometric
about it but the um

1280
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:48,799
about it but the um
 

1281
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:50,630
about it but the um
the kind of really

1282
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
the kind of really
 

1283
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,350
the kind of really
fundamental idea is that unifies algebra

1284
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
fundamental idea is that unifies algebra
 

1285
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,149
fundamental idea is that unifies algebra
and geometry is to is to realize is to

1286
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
and geometry is to is to realize is to
 

1287
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,590
and geometry is to is to realize is to
think when whenever anybody gives you

1288
00:20:59,590 --> 00:20:59,600
think when whenever anybody gives you
 

1289
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,430
think when whenever anybody gives you
what you call an algebra some abstract

1290
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:01,440
what you call an algebra some abstract
 

1291
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,110
what you call an algebra some abstract
thing of things that you can multiply

1292
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
thing of things that you can multiply
 

1293
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,149
thing of things that you can multiply
and add

1294
00:21:04,149 --> 00:21:04,159
and add
 

1295
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,230
and add
that you should ask yourself

1296
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:06,240
that you should ask yourself
 

1297
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,549
that you should ask yourself
is that algebra the space of functions

1298
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:08,559
is that algebra the space of functions
 

1299
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,470
is that algebra the space of functions
on some geometry

1300
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:10,480
on some geometry
 

1301
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,149
on some geometry
so one of the most surprising examples

1302
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:12,159
so one of the most surprising examples
 

1303
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,230
so one of the most surprising examples
of this for instance is a

1304
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
of this for instance is a
 

1305
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,470
of this for instance is a
i mean a standard kind of

1306
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
i mean a standard kind of
 

1307
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,669
i mean a standard kind of
thing that seems to have nothing to do

1308
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
thing that seems to have nothing to do
 

1309
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,149
thing that seems to have nothing to do
with geometry is the um

1310
00:21:20,149 --> 00:21:20,159
with geometry is the um
 

1311
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,110
with geometry is the um
is the

1312
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
is the
 

1313
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,029
is the
the integers so then they're you can you

1314
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:23,039
the integers so then they're you can you
 

1315
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:26,149
the integers so then they're you can you
can multiply them and add them it's

1316
00:21:26,149 --> 00:21:26,159
can multiply them and add them it's
 

1317
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,870
can multiply them and add them it's
it's an algebra but the um

1318
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:28,880
it's an algebra but the um
 

1319
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,990
it's an algebra but the um
it has seems to have nothing to do with

1320
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:30,000
it has seems to have nothing to do with
 

1321
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,990
it has seems to have nothing to do with
geometry but what you can it turns out

1322
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:32,000
geometry but what you can it turns out
 

1323
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,590
geometry but what you can it turns out
but if you ask yourself this question

1324
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
but if you ask yourself this question
 

1325
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,310
but if you ask yourself this question
and ask you know is are integers can you

1326
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:36,320
and ask you know is are integers can you
 

1327
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,669
and ask you know is are integers can you
think if somebody gives you an integer

1328
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
think if somebody gives you an integer
 

1329
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,350
think if somebody gives you an integer
can you think of it as a function on

1330
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,360
can you think of it as a function on
 

1331
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,630
can you think of it as a function on
some space

1332
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
some space
 

1333
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,029
some space
on some geometry and it turns out that

1334
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:43,039
on some geometry and it turns out that
 

1335
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,590
on some geometry and it turns out that
yes you can and the space is the space

1336
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:45,600
yes you can and the space is the space
 

1337
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,110
yes you can and the space is the space
of prime numbers

1338
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
of prime numbers
 

1339
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,549
of prime numbers
and so what you do is you just if

1340
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:48,559
and so what you do is you just if
 

1341
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,230
and so what you do is you just if
somebody gives you an integer

1342
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,240
somebody gives you an integer
 

1343
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,470
somebody gives you an integer
you can make a function on the prime

1344
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:52,480
you can make a function on the prime
 

1345
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,990
you can make a function on the prime
numbers by just

1346
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:54,000
numbers by just
 

1347
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,669
numbers by just
you know at each prime number taking

1348
00:21:55,669 --> 00:21:55,679
you know at each prime number taking
 

1349
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:56,789
you know at each prime number taking
that

1350
00:21:56,789 --> 00:21:56,799
that
 

1351
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,669
that
that integer modulo that prime so if uh

1352
00:21:59,669 --> 00:21:59,679
that integer modulo that prime so if uh
 

1353
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,430
that integer modulo that prime so if uh
if you say i don't know if you get given

1354
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:01,440
if you say i don't know if you get given
 

1355
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,310
if you say i don't know if you get given
10

1356
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
10
 

1357
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,549
10
you know 10 and you ask what is its

1358
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
you know 10 and you ask what is its
 

1359
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,710
you know 10 and you ask what is its
value at 2 well it's

1360
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
value at 2 well it's
 

1361
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,669
value at 2 well it's
it's 5 times 2 so mod 2 it's zero so it

1362
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
it's 5 times 2 so mod 2 it's zero so it
 

1363
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,230
it's 5 times 2 so mod 2 it's zero so it
has zero one what what is what is this

1364
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
has zero one what what is what is this
 

1365
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,510
has zero one what what is what is this
value at three

1366
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:13,520
value at three
 

1367
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,070
value at three
well it's nine plus one so it's it's one

1368
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
well it's nine plus one so it's it's one
 

1369
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,270
well it's nine plus one so it's it's one
mod three

1370
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
mod three
 

1371
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,350
mod three
so it's about it's zero at two it's one

1372
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:19,360
so it's about it's zero at two it's one
 

1373
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,750
so it's about it's zero at two it's one
at three and you can kind of keep going

1374
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
at three and you can kind of keep going
 

1375
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,350
at three and you can kind of keep going
and so

1376
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:23,360
and so
 

1377
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,270
and so
this is really kind of a

1378
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,280
this is really kind of a
 

1379
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,510
this is really kind of a
truly fundamental idea it's at the basis

1380
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:27,520
truly fundamental idea it's at the basis
 

1381
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,270
truly fundamental idea it's at the basis
of what's called algebraic geometry and

1382
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
of what's called algebraic geometry and
 

1383
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,710
of what's called algebraic geometry and
it just links these two parts of

1384
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
it just links these two parts of
 

1385
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,990
it just links these two parts of
mathematics that look completely

1386
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,000
mathematics that look completely
 

1387
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,149
mathematics that look completely
different and it's just an incredibly

1388
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:34,159
different and it's just an incredibly
 

1389
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,630
different and it's just an incredibly
powerful idea and so much of mathematics

1390
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
powerful idea and so much of mathematics
 

1391
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,230
powerful idea and so much of mathematics
emerges from this kind of

1392
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
emerges from this kind of
 

1393
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,029
emerges from this kind of
simple relation so uh you're talking

1394
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:41,039
simple relation so uh you're talking
 

1395
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,029
simple relation so uh you're talking
about mapping from one discrete space to

1396
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:43,039
about mapping from one discrete space to
 

1397
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,430
about mapping from one discrete space to
another to another so

1398
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:45,440
another to another so
 

1399
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,870
another to another so
um

1400
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:46,880
um
 

1401
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,710
um
for a second i thought perhaps

1402
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:48,720
for a second i thought perhaps
 

1403
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,710
for a second i thought perhaps
uh mapping like a continuous space of

1404
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:50,720
uh mapping like a continuous space of
 

1405
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,390
uh mapping like a continuous space of
discrete space like functions over a

1406
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
discrete space like functions over a
 

1407
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,029
discrete space like functions over a
continuous space

1408
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
continuous space
 

1409
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,110
continuous space
because yeah well you can i mean you can

1410
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:57,120
because yeah well you can i mean you can
 

1411
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,830
because yeah well you can i mean you can
take if somebody gives you a space

1412
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
take if somebody gives you a space
 

1413
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,270
take if somebody gives you a space
you can ask you can say well let's let's

1414
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
you can ask you can say well let's let's
 

1415
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,630
you can ask you can say well let's let's
and this is also this is part of the

1416
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:04,640
and this is also this is part of the
 

1417
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,070
and this is also this is part of the
same idea the part of the same idea is

1418
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
same idea the part of the same idea is
 

1419
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,149
same idea the part of the same idea is
that if you try and do geometry and

1420
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
that if you try and do geometry and
 

1421
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,390
that if you try and do geometry and
somebody tells you here's a space

1422
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:10,400
somebody tells you here's a space
 

1423
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,750
somebody tells you here's a space
that what you should do is you said wait

1424
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:11,760
that what you should do is you said wait
 

1425
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,830
that what you should do is you said wait
say wait wait a minute maybe i should be

1426
00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:13,840
say wait wait a minute maybe i should be
 

1427
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,830
say wait wait a minute maybe i should be
trying to solve this using algebra and

1428
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
trying to solve this using algebra and
 

1429
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,230
trying to solve this using algebra and
so if i do that the way to start is you

1430
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:18,240
so if i do that the way to start is you
 

1431
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,590
so if i do that the way to start is you
give me the space

1432
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:19,600
give me the space
 

1433
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,029
give me the space
i start to think about the functions of

1434
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
i start to think about the functions of
 

1435
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,669
i start to think about the functions of
the space okay so for to each point in

1436
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:23,679
the space okay so for to each point in
 

1437
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,669
the space okay so for to each point in
the space i associate

1438
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:25,679
the space i associate
 

1439
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,029
the space i associate
a number i can take different kinds of

1440
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:27,039
a number i can take different kinds of
 

1441
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,950
a number i can take different kinds of
functions and different kinds of values

1442
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:28,960
functions and different kinds of values
 

1443
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,510
functions and different kinds of values
but but basically functions on a space

1444
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:31,520
but but basically functions on a space
 

1445
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,430
but but basically functions on a space
so

1446
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,440
so
 

1447
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,390
so
what this

1448
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
what this
 

1449
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,470
what this
insight is telling you is that if you're

1450
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:36,480
insight is telling you is that if you're
 

1451
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,510
insight is telling you is that if you're
a geometer often the way to to to work

1452
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:39,520
a geometer often the way to to to work
 

1453
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,190
a geometer often the way to to to work
is to trans change your problem into

1454
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,200
is to trans change your problem into
 

1455
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,430
is to trans change your problem into
algebra by changing your space stop

1456
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
algebra by changing your space stop
 

1457
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,269
algebra by changing your space stop
thinking about your space and the points

1458
00:23:45,269 --> 00:23:45,279
thinking about your space and the points
 

1459
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,029
thinking about your space and the points
in it and think about the functions on

1460
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:47,039
in it and think about the functions on
 

1461
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,029
in it and think about the functions on
it got it and if you're if you're an

1462
00:23:49,029 --> 00:23:49,039
it got it and if you're if you're an
 

1463
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,470
it got it and if you're if you're an
algebraic and you and you've got these

1464
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
algebraic and you and you've got these
 

1465
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,310
algebraic and you and you've got these
abstract algebraic gadgets that you're

1466
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
abstract algebraic gadgets that you're
 

1467
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,029
abstract algebraic gadgets that you're
multiplying and adding say wait a minute

1468
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
multiplying and adding say wait a minute
 

1469
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,870
multiplying and adding say wait a minute
are those gadgets

1470
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
are those gadgets
 

1471
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,630
are those gadgets
can i think of them in some way as a

1472
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
can i think of them in some way as a
 

1473
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,990
can i think of them in some way as a
function on a space what would that

1474
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
function on a space what would that
 

1475
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,830
function on a space what would that
space be and what kind of functions

1476
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:01,840
space be and what kind of functions
 

1477
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,630
space be and what kind of functions
would they be and that going back and

1478
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:04,640
would they be and that going back and
 

1479
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,630
would they be and that going back and
forth really brings these two

1480
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
forth really brings these two
 

1481
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,149
forth really brings these two
completely different looking areas of

1482
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
completely different looking areas of
 

1483
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,789
completely different looking areas of
mathematics together do you have uh

1484
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:10,799
mathematics together do you have uh
 

1485
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,590
mathematics together do you have uh
particular examples where it allowed to

1486
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
particular examples where it allowed to
 

1487
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,350
particular examples where it allowed to
prove some difficult things by jumping

1488
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:15,360
prove some difficult things by jumping
 

1489
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,350
prove some difficult things by jumping
from one to the other is that something

1490
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:17,360
from one to the other is that something
 

1491
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,510
from one to the other is that something
that's a part of modern mathematics

1492
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:19,520
that's a part of modern mathematics
 

1493
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,149
that's a part of modern mathematics
where such jumps are made oh yes this is

1494
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
where such jumps are made oh yes this is
 

1495
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,350
where such jumps are made oh yes this is
kind of all the time

1496
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
kind of all the time
 

1497
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,269
kind of all the time
a lot much much of modern number theory

1498
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:25,279
a lot much much of modern number theory
 

1499
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,149
a lot much much of modern number theory
is kind of based on this idea but

1500
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:28,159
is kind of based on this idea but
 

1501
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,909
is kind of based on this idea but
and and when you start doing this you

1502
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:29,919
and and when you start doing this you
 

1503
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,789
and and when you start doing this you
start to realize that you need you know

1504
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:32,799
start to realize that you need you know
 

1505
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,630
start to realize that you need you know
what simple

1506
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:34,640
what simple
 

1507
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,549
what simple
things simple things on one side

1508
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:36,559
things simple things on one side
 

1509
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,870
things simple things on one side
algebras start to require you to think

1510
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:38,880
algebras start to require you to think
 

1511
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,070
algebras start to require you to think
about

1512
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,080
about
 

1513
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,990
about
the other side about geometry in a new

1514
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,000
the other side about geometry in a new
 

1515
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,110
the other side about geometry in a new
way you have to kind of get a more

1516
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
way you have to kind of get a more
 

1517
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,590
way you have to kind of get a more
sophisticated idea about geometry or if

1518
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
sophisticated idea about geometry or if
 

1519
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,390
sophisticated idea about geometry or if
you

1520
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
you
 

1521
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,669
you
start thinking about the functions on a

1522
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:47,679
start thinking about the functions on a
 

1523
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:48,870
start thinking about the functions on a
space

1524
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:48,880
space
 

1525
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,549
space
you may have you may need a more

1526
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
you may have you may need a more
 

1527
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,029
you may have you may need a more
sophisticated kind of algebra but um but

1528
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:53,039
sophisticated kind of algebra but um but
 

1529
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,549
sophisticated kind of algebra but um but
in some sense i mean much or most of

1530
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
in some sense i mean much or most of
 

1531
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,310
in some sense i mean much or most of
modern number theory is

1532
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,320
modern number theory is
 

1533
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,669
modern number theory is
based upon this move to geometry and um

1534
00:24:59,669 --> 00:24:59,679
based upon this move to geometry and um
 

1535
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,190
based upon this move to geometry and um
there's also a lot of geometry and

1536
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:01,200
there's also a lot of geometry and
 

1537
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,990
there's also a lot of geometry and
topology is also based upon

1538
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,000
topology is also based upon
 

1539
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,590
topology is also based upon
yeah changing if you want to understand

1540
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:05,600
yeah changing if you want to understand
 

1541
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,029
yeah changing if you want to understand
the topology of something you look at

1542
00:25:07,029 --> 00:25:07,039
the topology of something you look at
 

1543
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,990
the topology of something you look at
the functions you do dram comology and

1544
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
the functions you do dram comology and
 

1545
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,230
the functions you do dram comology and
you get the topology

1546
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
you get the topology
 

1547
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,510
you get the topology
anyway

1548
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:13,520
anyway
 

1549
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,029
anyway
well let me let me ask you then the

1550
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
well let me let me ask you then the
 

1551
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,870
well let me let me ask you then the
ridiculous question you said that this

1552
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
ridiculous question you said that this
 

1553
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,470
ridiculous question you said that this
idea is beautiful

1554
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
idea is beautiful
 

1555
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,110
idea is beautiful
uh can you formalize the definition of

1556
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
uh can you formalize the definition of
 

1557
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,549
uh can you formalize the definition of
the word beautiful

1558
00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:22,559
the word beautiful
 

1559
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,350
the word beautiful
and why is this beautiful like first why

1560
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:25,360
and why is this beautiful like first why
 

1561
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,269
and why is this beautiful like first why
is this beautiful and second

1562
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:27,279
is this beautiful and second
 

1563
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,750
is this beautiful and second
um what is beautiful

1564
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:29,760
um what is beautiful
 

1565
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,630
um what is beautiful
well

1566
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:30,640
well
 

1567
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,750
well
and i think there are many different

1568
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
and i think there are many different
 

1569
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,350
and i think there are many different
things you can find beautiful for

1570
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:33,360
things you can find beautiful for
 

1571
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,269
things you can find beautiful for
different reasons i mean i think in this

1572
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:35,279
different reasons i mean i think in this
 

1573
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,870
different reasons i mean i think in this
context

1574
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
context
 

1575
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,549
context
the notion of beauty i think really is

1576
00:25:38,549 --> 00:25:38,559
the notion of beauty i think really is
 

1577
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,990
the notion of beauty i think really is
just kind of

1578
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,000
just kind of
 

1579
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,549
just kind of
an idea is beautiful if it's

1580
00:25:42,549 --> 00:25:42,559
an idea is beautiful if it's
 

1581
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,190
an idea is beautiful if it's
packages a huge amount of kind of

1582
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:45,200
packages a huge amount of kind of
 

1583
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,590
packages a huge amount of kind of
power and information into

1584
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:47,600
power and information into
 

1585
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,909
power and information into
something very simple so in some sense

1586
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:49,919
something very simple so in some sense
 

1587
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,230
something very simple so in some sense
you i mean

1588
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
you i mean
 

1589
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,310
you i mean
you can almost kind of try and measure

1590
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,320
you can almost kind of try and measure
 

1591
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,470
you can almost kind of try and measure
it in the sense of you know what's the

1592
00:25:56,470 --> 00:25:56,480
it in the sense of you know what's the
 

1593
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,230
it in the sense of you know what's the
what are the implications of this idea

1594
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:58,240
what are the implications of this idea
 

1595
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,950
what are the implications of this idea
what

1596
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
what
 

1597
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,710
what
non-trivial things does it tell you

1598
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:00,720
non-trivial things does it tell you
 

1599
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,990
non-trivial things does it tell you
versus

1600
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
versus
 

1601
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,870
versus
you know how how how how simply can you

1602
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:04,880
you know how how how how simply can you
 

1603
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,350
you know how how how how simply can you
can you express the idea and so so level

1604
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:07,360
can you express the idea and so so level
 

1605
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,470
can you express the idea and so so level
of compression yeah uh what is it

1606
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
of compression yeah uh what is it
 

1607
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,110
of compression yeah uh what is it
correlates with uh beauty yeah that's

1608
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,120
correlates with uh beauty yeah that's
 

1609
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,110
correlates with uh beauty yeah that's
that's one and one aspect of it and so

1610
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,120
that's one and one aspect of it and so
 

1611
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,789
that's one and one aspect of it and so
you can start to tell that an idea is

1612
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:16,799
you can start to tell that an idea is
 

1613
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,710
you can start to tell that an idea is
becoming uglier and uglier

1614
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:18,720
becoming uglier and uglier
 

1615
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,870
becoming uglier and uglier
as you start kind of having to

1616
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:20,880
as you start kind of having to
 

1617
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,909
as you start kind of having to
you know it doesn't quite do what you

1618
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
you know it doesn't quite do what you
 

1619
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,430
you know it doesn't quite do what you
want so you throw in

1620
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:23,440
want so you throw in
 

1621
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,789
want so you throw in
something else to the idea and you keep

1622
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:24,799
something else to the idea and you keep
 

1623
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,230
something else to the idea and you keep
doing that until

1624
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:26,240
doing that until
 

1625
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,230
doing that until
you get what you want but that's how you

1626
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:28,240
you get what you want but that's how you
 

1627
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,590
you get what you want but that's how you
know you're doing something uglier and

1628
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:29,600
know you're doing something uglier and
 

1629
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,430
know you're doing something uglier and
uglier when you have to kind of keep

1630
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:31,440
uglier when you have to kind of keep
 

1631
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,070
uglier when you have to kind of keep
adding in

1632
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080

 

1633
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,510

more

1634
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:35,520
more
 

1635
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,669
more
more into what was originally a fairly

1636
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
more into what was originally a fairly
 

1637
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,350
more into what was originally a fairly
simple idea and making it more and more

1638
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
simple idea and making it more and more
 

1639
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,669
simple idea and making it more and more
complicated to get what you want

1640
00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:41,679
complicated to get what you want
 

1641
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,310
complicated to get what you want
okay so let's put some uh philosophical

1642
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
okay so let's put some uh philosophical
 

1643
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,070
okay so let's put some uh philosophical
words on the table and try to make some

1644
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,080
words on the table and try to make some
 

1645
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,630
words on the table and try to make some
sense of them one word is beauty another

1646
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:48,640
sense of them one word is beauty another
 

1647
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,710
sense of them one word is beauty another
one is simplicity as you mentioned

1648
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:50,720
one is simplicity as you mentioned
 

1649
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,269
one is simplicity as you mentioned
another one is truth

1650
00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:53,279
another one is truth
 

1651
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,390
another one is truth
so

1652
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
so
 

1653
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,230
so
do you have a sense if i give you two

1654
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
do you have a sense if i give you two
 

1655
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,190
do you have a sense if i give you two
theories one is

1656
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
theories one is
 

1657
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,390
theories one is
simpler one is more complicated

1658
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:02,400
simpler one is more complicated
 

1659
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,070
simpler one is more complicated
do you have a sense which one is more

1660
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
do you have a sense which one is more
 

1661
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,750
do you have a sense which one is more
likely to be true

1662
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
likely to be true
 

1663
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,029
likely to be true
to uh

1664
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:07,039
to uh
 

1665
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,110
to uh
capture

1666
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,120
capture
 

1667
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,110
capture
deeply

1668
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
deeply
 

1669
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,110
deeply
the fabric of reality

1670
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
the fabric of reality
 

1671
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,710
the fabric of reality
the simple one or the more complicated

1672
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
the simple one or the more complicated
 

1673
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,389
the simple one or the more complicated
one yeah i think all of our evidence

1674
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
one yeah i think all of our evidence
 

1675
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,590
one yeah i think all of our evidence
what we see in the history of the

1676
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:19,600
what we see in the history of the
 

1677
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,310
what we see in the history of the
subject is the the simpler one though

1678
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
subject is the the simpler one though
 

1679
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,350
subject is the the simpler one though
often it's a surprise it's simpler in a

1680
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,360
often it's a surprise it's simpler in a
 

1681
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,430
often it's a surprise it's simpler in a
surprising way but um

1682
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:27,440
surprising way but um
 

1683
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,789
surprising way but um
yeah that that we just don't we just

1684
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:30,799
yeah that that we just don't we just
 

1685
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,870
yeah that that we just don't we just
anyway when the kind of best theories

1686
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:32,880
anyway when the kind of best theories
 

1687
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,389
anyway when the kind of best theories
have been coming coming up with are

1688
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
have been coming coming up with are
 

1689
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,430
have been coming coming up with are
ultimately when properly understood

1690
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:37,440
ultimately when properly understood
 

1691
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,750
ultimately when properly understood
relatively simple and uh much much

1692
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:39,760
relatively simple and uh much much
 

1693
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,669
relatively simple and uh much much
simpler than you would expect them to be

1694
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
simpler than you would expect them to be
 

1695
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,110
simpler than you would expect them to be
do you have a good explanation why that

1696
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
do you have a good explanation why that
 

1697
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,950
do you have a good explanation why that
is is it just because humans want it to

1698
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:44,960
is is it just because humans want it to
 

1699
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,950
is is it just because humans want it to
be that way are we just like ultra

1700
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
be that way are we just like ultra
 

1701
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,350
be that way are we just like ultra
biased then we we we just kind of

1702
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:49,360
biased then we we we just kind of
 

1703
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,950
biased then we we we just kind of
convinced ourselves

1704
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:50,960
convinced ourselves
 

1705
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,470
convinced ourselves
that simple is better because we find

1706
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:52,480
that simple is better because we find
 

1707
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,149
that simple is better because we find
simplicity beautiful or is there

1708
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:54,159
simplicity beautiful or is there
 

1709
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,990
simplicity beautiful or is there
something about at the our actual

1710
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:56,000
something about at the our actual
 

1711
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,190
something about at the our actual
universe

1712
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
universe
 

1713
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,830
universe
that uh at the core is simple

1714
00:27:59,830 --> 00:27:59,840
that uh at the core is simple
 

1715
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,510
that uh at the core is simple
my own belief is that there is something

1716
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:01,520
my own belief is that there is something
 

1717
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,070
my own belief is that there is something
about a universe that that's simple and

1718
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
about a universe that that's simple and
 

1719
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,590
about a universe that that's simple and
i was trying to say that you know there

1720
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
i was trying to say that you know there
 

1721
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,110
i was trying to say that you know there
is some some kind of fundamental thing

1722
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,120
is some some kind of fundamental thing
 

1723
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,950
is some some kind of fundamental thing
about math physics

1724
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:08,960
about math physics
 

1725
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,630
about math physics
and physics and all this picture which

1726
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
and physics and all this picture which
 

1727
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,389
and physics and all this picture which
is um

1728
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:12,399
is um
 

1729
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,630
is um
which which is in some sense simple

1730
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:14,640
which which is in some sense simple
 

1731
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,710
which which is in some sense simple
it's true that you know it

1732
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:16,720
it's true that you know it
 

1733
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,909
it's true that you know it
it's of course true that you know our

1734
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:17,919
it's of course true that you know our
 

1735

it's of course true that you know our
minds have certain have

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
minds have certain have
 

1737
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,230

are very limited and can certainly do

1738
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:22,240
are very limited and can certainly do
 

1739
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,630
are very limited and can certainly do
certain things and not others so it

1740
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
certain things and not others so it
 

1741
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,470
certain things and not others so it
it's it's in principle possible that

1742
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
it's it's in principle possible that
 

1743
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,310
it's it's in principle possible that
there's some

1744
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:28,320
there's some
 

1745
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,669
there's some
great insight there are a lot of

1746
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
great insight there are a lot of
 

1747
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,110
great insight there are a lot of
insights into the way the world works

1748
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
insights into the way the world works
 

1749
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,190
insights into the way the world works
which is aren't accessible to us because

1750
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
which is aren't accessible to us because
 

1751
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,870
which is aren't accessible to us because
that's not the way our minds work we

1752
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
that's not the way our minds work we
 

1753
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,470
that's not the way our minds work we
don't and that what we're seeing this

1754
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:36,480
don't and that what we're seeing this
 

1755
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,750
don't and that what we're seeing this
kind of simplicity is just because

1756
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:37,760
kind of simplicity is just because
 

1757
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,110
kind of simplicity is just because
that's

1758
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,120
that's
 

1759
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,470
that's
all we ever have any hope of seeing but

1760
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
all we ever have any hope of seeing but
 

1761
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,950
all we ever have any hope of seeing but
so there's a brilliant

1762
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:44,960
so there's a brilliant
 

1763
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,669
so there's a brilliant
physicist by the name of sabine

1764
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
physicist by the name of sabine
 

1765
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,070
physicist by the name of sabine
hasenfelder who both agrees and

1766
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,080
hasenfelder who both agrees and
 

1767
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,630
hasenfelder who both agrees and
disagrees with you i suppose agrees

1768
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:52,640
disagrees with you i suppose agrees
 

1769
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,870
disagrees with you i suppose agrees
that uh

1770
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
that uh
 

1771
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,389
that uh
the final answer will be simple yeah

1772
00:28:58,389 --> 00:28:58,399
the final answer will be simple yeah
 

1773
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,710
the final answer will be simple yeah
but uh simplicity and beauty leads us

1774
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
but uh simplicity and beauty leads us
 

1775
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,350
but uh simplicity and beauty leads us
astray in the lo in the local pockets of

1776
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:03,360
astray in the lo in the local pockets of
 

1777
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,269
astray in the lo in the local pockets of
scientific progress

1778
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:05,279
scientific progress
 

1779
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,830
scientific progress
uh do you uh do you agree with her

1780
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,840
uh do you uh do you agree with her
 

1781
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,510
uh do you uh do you agree with her
disagreement do you disagree with her

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,350
yes i thought it was really fascinating
reading your book and and and anyway it

1792
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:19,360
reading your book and and and anyway it
 

1793
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,269
reading your book and and and anyway it
was finding disagreeing with with a lot

1794
00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:21,279
was finding disagreeing with with a lot
 

1795
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,190
was finding disagreeing with with a lot
but then at the end when she says yes

1796
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
but then at the end when she says yes
 

1797
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,549
but then at the end when she says yes
when we find

1798
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:24,559
when we find
 

1799
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,470
when we find
there when we actually figure this out

1800
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
there when we actually figure this out
 

1801
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,389
there when we actually figure this out
it will it will be simple and yeah and

1802
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:28,399
it will it will be simple and yeah and
 

1803
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,350
it will it will be simple and yeah and
okay so

1804
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:29,360
okay so
 

1805
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,190
okay so
we agree in the end

1806
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
we agree in the end
 

1807
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,070
we agree in the end
does beauty lead us astray which is the

1808
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,080
does beauty lead us astray which is the
 

1809
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,470
does beauty lead us astray which is the
the core thesis of her work

1810
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:36,480
the core thesis of her work
 

1811
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,950
the core thesis of her work
in that book i actually i guess i do

1812
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:38,960
in that book i actually i guess i do
 

1813
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,110
in that book i actually i guess i do
disagree with her on on that so much i

1814
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,120
disagree with her on on that so much i
 

1815
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,870
disagree with her on on that so much i
don't think and especially and i

1816
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:42,880
don't think and especially and i
 

1817
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,310
don't think and especially and i
actually fairly strongly disagree with

1818
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
actually fairly strongly disagree with
 

1819
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,909
actually fairly strongly disagree with
her about sometimes sometimes the way

1820
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:45,919
her about sometimes sometimes the way
 

1821
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,750
her about sometimes sometimes the way
she'll refer to math and

1822
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:47,760
she'll refer to math and
 

1823
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,430
she'll refer to math and
so the problem is

1824
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,440
so the problem is
 

1825
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,230
so the problem is
you know

1826
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,240
you know
 

1827
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,510
you know
physicists and people in general just

1828
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
physicists and people in general just
 

1829
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,350
physicists and people in general just
refer to as math and and they're often

1830
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:53,360
refer to as math and and they're often
 

1831
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,630
refer to as math and and they're often
um

1832
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
um
 

1833
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,389
um
they're they're often meaning not what i

1834
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
they're they're often meaning not what i
 

1835
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,230
they're they're often meaning not what i
would call math which is the interesting

1836
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
would call math which is the interesting
 

1837
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,710
would call math which is the interesting
ideas of math but just

1838
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:00,720
ideas of math but just
 

1839
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,110
ideas of math but just
cause some complicated calculation and

1840
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
cause some complicated calculation and
 

1841
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,029
cause some complicated calculation and
and so um

1842
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:05,039
and so um
 

1843
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,630
and so um
i i guess

1844
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
i i guess
 

1845
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,149
i i guess
my feeling about it is more that it's

1846
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:08,159
my feeling about it is more that it's
 

1847
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,110
my feeling about it is more that it's
very

1848
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
very
 

1849
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,310
very
the problem with talking about

1850
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:10,320
the problem with talking about
 

1851
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,470
the problem with talking about
simplicity and using simplicity as a

1852
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:12,480
simplicity and using simplicity as a
 

1853
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,510
simplicity and using simplicity as a
guide

1854
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:13,520
guide
 

1855
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,990
guide
is that it's very um

1856
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,000
is that it's very um
 

1857
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,830
is that it's very um
it's very easy to fool yourself and you

1858
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:17,840
it's very easy to fool yourself and you
 

1859
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,230
it's very easy to fool yourself and you
know it's very easy to decide

1860
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:20,240
know it's very easy to decide
 

1861
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,190
know it's very easy to decide
to you know to fall in love with an idea

1862
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,200
to you know to fall in love with an idea
 

1863
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,190
to you know to fall in love with an idea
you have an idea you think oh this is

1864
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
you have an idea you think oh this is
 

1865
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,710
you have an idea you think oh this is
this is great and you fall in love with

1866
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:26,720
this is great and you fall in love with
 

1867
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,350
this is great and you fall in love with
it and it's like any kind of love affair

1868
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
it and it's like any kind of love affair
 

1869
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,870
it and it's like any kind of love affair
it's very easy to believe that you know

1870
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:30,880
it's very easy to believe that you know
 

1871
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,789
it's very easy to believe that you know
you're the object of your affections is

1872
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:32,799
you're the object of your affections is
 

1873
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,630
you're the object of your affections is
much more beautiful than they others

1874
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:34,640
much more beautiful than they others
 

1875
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,230
much more beautiful than they others
might think and they're that they really

1876
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:36,240
might think and they're that they really
 

1877
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,149
might think and they're that they really
are and that's

1878
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
are and that's
 

1879
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:40,630
are and that's
very very easy to do so um if you say

1880
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:40,640
very very easy to do so um if you say
 

1881
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,350
very very easy to do so um if you say
i'm just gonna pursue ideas about

1882
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,360
i'm just gonna pursue ideas about
 

1883
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,549
i'm just gonna pursue ideas about
beauty and

1884
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:44,559
beauty and
 

1885
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,549
beauty and
this and mathematics and this it's

1886
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
this and mathematics and this it's
 

1887
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,789
this and mathematics and this it's
extremely easy to to just fool yourself

1888
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:48,799
extremely easy to to just fool yourself
 

1889
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:51,510
extremely easy to to just fool yourself
i think um and i think that's a lot of

1890
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
i think um and i think that's a lot of
 

1891
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,029
i think um and i think that's a lot of
what

1892
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
what
 

1893
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,950
what
the story is she was thinking of about

1894
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
the story is she was thinking of about
 

1895
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,389
the story is she was thinking of about
where people have gone astray that i

1896
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
where people have gone astray that i
 

1897
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,230
where people have gone astray that i
think it's i would argue that as more

1898
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
think it's i would argue that as more
 

1899
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,789
think it's i would argue that as more
people it's not that there was some

1900
00:31:00,789 --> 00:31:00,799
people it's not that there was some
 

1901
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,870
people it's not that there was some
simple powerful wonderful idea which

1902
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:02,880
simple powerful wonderful idea which
 

1903
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,990
simple powerful wonderful idea which
they'd found and it turned out not to be

1904
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,000
they'd found and it turned out not to be
 

1905
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,430
they'd found and it turned out not to be
um

1906
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:07,440
um
 

1907
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,870
um
not to be useful but it was more that

1908
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:08,880
not to be useful but it was more that
 

1909
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,389
not to be useful but it was more that
they kind of fooled themselves that this

1910
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
they kind of fooled themselves that this
 

1911
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,230
they kind of fooled themselves that this
was actually a better idea than it

1912
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
was actually a better idea than it
 

1913
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,990
was actually a better idea than it
really was and it was

1914
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:14,000
really was and it was
 

1915
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,430
really was and it was
simpler more beautiful than it really

1916
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:15,440
simpler more beautiful than it really
 

1917
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,110
simpler more beautiful than it really
was is a lot of the story um i see so

1918
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
was is a lot of the story um i see so
 

1919
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,549
was is a lot of the story um i see so
it's not that the simplicity would be

1920
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
it's not that the simplicity would be
 

1921
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,389
it's not that the simplicity would be
lisa's astrays that's just people or

1922
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:22,399
lisa's astrays that's just people or
 

1923
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,750
lisa's astrays that's just people or
people and they

1924
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
people and they
 

1925
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,230
people and they
uh fall in love with with whatever idea

1926
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
uh fall in love with with whatever idea
 

1927
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,230
uh fall in love with with whatever idea
they have and then they they weave

1928
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,240
they have and then they they weave
 

1929
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,389
they have and then they they weave
narratives around that idea or they

1930
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:30,399
narratives around that idea or they
 

1931
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,149
narratives around that idea or they
present in such a way that uh emphasizes

1932
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:34,159
present in such a way that uh emphasizes
 

1933
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,710
present in such a way that uh emphasizes
uh the simplicity and the beauty

1934
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
uh the simplicity and the beauty
 

1935
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,230
uh the simplicity and the beauty
yeah that's part of it but i mean the

1936
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:38,240
yeah that's part of it but i mean the
 

1937
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,710
yeah that's part of it but i mean the
thing about physics that you have

1938
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
thing about physics that you have
 

1939
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,789
thing about physics that you have
is that you you know what what really

1940
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:42,799
is that you you know what what really
 

1941
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,149
is that you you know what what really
can tell

1942
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
can tell
 

1943
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:45,990
can tell
if you can do an experiment and check

1944
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
if you can do an experiment and check
 

1945
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,950
if you can do an experiment and check
and see if nature is really doing what

1946
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
and see if nature is really doing what
 

1947
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,269
and see if nature is really doing what
your your idea expects that you you do

1948
00:31:51,269 --> 00:31:51,279
your your idea expects that you you do
 

1949
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,350
your your idea expects that you you do
in principle have a way of really of

1950
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:53,360
in principle have a way of really of
 

1951
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,350
in principle have a way of really of
testing it and and it's certainly true

1952
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
testing it and and it's certainly true
 

1953
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,029
testing it and and it's certainly true
that if you um

1954
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
that if you um
 

1955
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,789
that if you um
you know if you thought you had a simple

1956
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:58,799
you know if you thought you had a simple
 

1957
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,870
you know if you thought you had a simple
idea and that doesn't work and you got

1958
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:00,880
idea and that doesn't work and you got
 

1959
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,630
idea and that doesn't work and you got
into an experiment and what actually

1960
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:02,640
into an experiment and what actually
 

1961
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,630
into an experiment and what actually
does work is somewhere maybe some more

1962
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:04,640
does work is somewhere maybe some more
 

1963
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,630
does work is somewhere maybe some more
complicated version of it that can

1964
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:06,640
complicated version of it that can
 

1965
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,389
complicated version of it that can
certainly happen and

1966
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
certainly happen and
 

1967
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,630
certainly happen and
that that that can be true

1968
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
that that that can be true
 

1969
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,190
that that that can be true
i think her emphasis is more that i

1970
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
i think her emphasis is more that i
 

1971
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,830
i think her emphasis is more that i
don't really disagree with is that

1972
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:15,840
don't really disagree with is that
 

1973
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,950
don't really disagree with is that
um

1974
00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:16,960
um
 

1975
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,070
um
people should be concentrating on

1976
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:20,080
people should be concentrating on
 

1977
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,350
people should be concentrating on
when they're trying to develop better

1978
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,360
when they're trying to develop better
 

1979
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,870
when they're trying to develop better
theories on

1980
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:22,880
theories on
 

1981
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,029
theories on
morons on self-consistency not so much

1982
00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:25,039
morons on self-consistency not so much
 

1983
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:27,750
morons on self-consistency not so much
on beauty but you know not is this idea

1984
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
on beauty but you know not is this idea
 

1985
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,950
on beauty but you know not is this idea
beautiful but you know is there

1986
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
beautiful but you know is there
 

1987
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,789
beautiful but you know is there
something about the theory which is not

1988
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:30,799
something about the theory which is not
 

1989
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,310
something about the theory which is not
quite consistent

1990
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,320
quite consistent
 

1991
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,110
quite consistent
and that and use that as a guide

1992
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,120
and that and use that as a guide
 

1993
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,630
and that and use that as a guide
that there's something wrong there which

1994
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
that there's something wrong there which
 

1995
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,590
that there's something wrong there which
needs fixing and and so i think that

1996
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
needs fixing and and so i think that
 

1997
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,750
needs fixing and and so i think that
part of her argument i think i was

1998
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:41,760
part of her argument i think i was
 

1999
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,830
part of her argument i think i was
we're on the same page about

2000
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:43,840
we're on the same page about
 

2001
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,909
we're on the same page about
uh what's what is consistency in

2002
00:32:45,909 --> 00:32:45,919
uh what's what is consistency in
 

2003
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,830
uh what's what is consistency in
inconsistencies

2004
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:47,840
inconsistencies
 

2005
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,789
inconsistencies
what what exactly um

2006
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
what what exactly um
 

2007
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,789
what what exactly um
do you have examples in mind

2008
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
do you have examples in mind
 

2009
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,509
do you have examples in mind
well it can be just simple inconsistency

2010
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:55,519
well it can be just simple inconsistency
 

2011
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,990
well it can be just simple inconsistency
between theory and an experiment that if

2012
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:58,000
between theory and an experiment that if
 

2013
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,830
between theory and an experiment that if
you so we have this

2014
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
you so we have this
 

2015
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,190
you so we have this
great fundamental theory but there are

2016
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
great fundamental theory but there are
 

2017
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,190
great fundamental theory but there are
some things we see out there which don't

2018
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:03,200
some things we see out there which don't
 

2019
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,430
some things we see out there which don't
seem to fit in it like like dark energy

2020
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
seem to fit in it like like dark energy
 

2021
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,269
seem to fit in it like like dark energy
and dark matter for instance

2022
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
and dark matter for instance
 

2023
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,470
and dark matter for instance
but if there's something which you can't

2024
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:08,480
but if there's something which you can't
 

2025
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,470
but if there's something which you can't
test experimentally i think

2026
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:10,480
test experimentally i think
 

2027
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,590
test experimentally i think
you know she would argue and i would

2028
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
you know she would argue and i would
 

2029
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,870
you know she would argue and i would
agree that for instance if you're trying

2030
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:12,880
agree that for instance if you're trying
 

2031
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,389
agree that for instance if you're trying
to think about

2032
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
to think about
 

2033
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,669
to think about
gravity and how are you going to have a

2034
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:15,679
gravity and how are you going to have a
 

2035
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,509
gravity and how are you going to have a
quantum theory of gravity you should

2036
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
quantum theory of gravity you should
 

2037
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,190
quantum theory of gravity you should
kind of

2038
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
kind of
 

2039
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,350
kind of
be you know and test any of your ideas

2040
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:21,360
be you know and test any of your ideas
 

2041
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,870
be you know and test any of your ideas
with kind of

2042
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:22,880
with kind of
 

2043
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,789
with kind of
kind of a thought experiment you know is

2044
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:24,799
kind of a thought experiment you know is
 

2045
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:26,230
kind of a thought experiment you know is
does this actually give a consistent

2046
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:26,240
does this actually give a consistent
 

2047
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,149
does this actually give a consistent
picture what's going to happen of what

2048
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:28,159
picture what's going to happen of what
 

2049
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,470
picture what's going to happen of what
happens in this particular situation or

2050
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
happens in this particular situation or
 

2051
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,149
happens in this particular situation or
not

2052
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:32,159
not
 

2053
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,750
not
so this is a good example you've written

2054
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:33,760
so this is a good example you've written
 

2055
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,070
so this is a good example you've written
about this um

2056
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:36,080
about this um
 

2057
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,750
about this um
you know since quantum gravitational

2058
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:37,760
you know since quantum gravitational
 

2059
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,029
you know since quantum gravitational
effects are

2060
00:33:39,029 --> 00:33:39,039
effects are
 

2061
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,549
effects are
really small

2062
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
really small
 

2063
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,149
really small
super small arguably unobservably small

2064
00:33:44,149 --> 00:33:44,159
super small arguably unobservably small
 

2065
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,549
super small arguably unobservably small
should we have hope to arrive at a

2066
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
should we have hope to arrive at a
 

2067
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,430
should we have hope to arrive at a
theory of quantum gravity somehow

2068
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440
theory of quantum gravity somehow
 

2069
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,029
theory of quantum gravity somehow
what are the different ways we can get

2070
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
what are the different ways we can get
 

2071
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:52,470
what are the different ways we can get
there you've mentioned that you're not

2072
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
there you've mentioned that you're not
 

2073
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,110
there you've mentioned that you're not
as interested in that effort because

2074
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
as interested in that effort because
 

2075
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,389
as interested in that effort because
basically

2076
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
basically
 

2077
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,990
basically
yes you cannot

2078
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000

 

2079
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,310

have uh ways to scientifically validate

2080
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:02,320
have uh ways to scientifically validate
 

2081
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,870
have uh ways to scientifically validate
it given the tools of today yeah i've

2082
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:04,880
it given the tools of today yeah i've
 

2083
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,230
it given the tools of today yeah i've
actually you know i've over the years

2084
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
actually you know i've over the years
 

2085
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,590
actually you know i've over the years
certainly spent a lot of time learning

2086
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
certainly spent a lot of time learning
 

2087
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,310
certainly spent a lot of time learning
about

2088
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
about
 

2089
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,909
about
gravity and about attempts to quantize

2090
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:09,919
gravity and about attempts to quantize
 

2091
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:11,030
gravity and about attempts to quantize
it but it

2092
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,040
it but it
 

2093
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,869
it but it
it hasn't been that much

2094
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:12,879
it hasn't been that much
 

2095
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,270
it hasn't been that much
in the past the focus of what i've been

2096
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:15,280
in the past the focus of what i've been
 

2097
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,349
in the past the focus of what i've been
thinking about but

2098
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
thinking about but
 

2099
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:18,869
thinking about but
i mean my feeling was always you know as

2100
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:18,879
i mean my feeling was always you know as
 

2101
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,470
i mean my feeling was always you know as
i think speed would agree that the uh

2102
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
i think speed would agree that the uh
 

2103
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,149
i think speed would agree that the uh
you know one way you can pursue this if

2104
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:24,159
you know one way you can pursue this if
 

2105
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,629
you know one way you can pursue this if
you if you can't do experiments is

2106
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
you if you can't do experiments is
 

2107
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,030
you if you can't do experiments is
just this kind of search for consistency

2108
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,040
just this kind of search for consistency
 

2109
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,430
just this kind of search for consistency
you know it can be remarkably hard to

2110
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
you know it can be remarkably hard to
 

2111
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,109
you know it can be remarkably hard to
come up with a completely consistent

2112
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
come up with a completely consistent
 

2113
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,510
come up with a completely consistent
model of model of this in a way that

2114
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
model of model of this in a way that
 

2115
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,829
model of model of this in a way that
brings together quantum mechanics and

2116
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
brings together quantum mechanics and
 

2117
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,349
brings together quantum mechanics and
general relativity

2118
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:39,359
general relativity
 

2119
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,829
general relativity
and that's i think kind of been

2120
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:41,839
and that's i think kind of been
 

2121
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,109
and that's i think kind of been
the traditional way that people who have

2122
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
the traditional way that people who have
 

2123
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,869
the traditional way that people who have
pursued quantum gravity have often

2124
00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:44,879
pursued quantum gravity have often
 

2125
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,149
pursued quantum gravity have often
pursued you know

2126
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:48,159

 

2127
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,629

we have the best route to finding a

2128
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
we have the best route to finding a
 

2129
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,990
we have the best route to finding a
consistent

2130
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:52,000
consistent
 

2131
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,990
consistent
theory of quantum gravity and string

2132
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,000
theory of quantum gravity and string
 

2133
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,589
theory of quantum gravity and string
theorists will tell you this

2134
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
theorists will tell you this
 

2135
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,910
theorists will tell you this
other other people will tell you it it's

2136
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:57,920
other other people will tell you it it's
 

2137
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,150
other other people will tell you it it's
it's kind of what people argue about but

2138
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
it's kind of what people argue about but
 

2139
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,390
it's kind of what people argue about but
but the problem with all of that is that

2140
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
but the problem with all of that is that
 

2141
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,069
but the problem with all of that is that
you end up

2142
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
you end up
 

2143
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,190
you end up
um

2144
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,200
um
 

2145
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,550
um
the danger is that you end up with that

2146
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
the danger is that you end up with that
 

2147
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,069
the danger is that you end up with that
that everybody could be successful

2148
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
that everybody could be successful
 

2149
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,470
that everybody could be successful
everybody everybody's

2150
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:12,480
everybody everybody's
 

2151
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,630
everybody everybody's
program for how to find a theory of kind

2152
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
program for how to find a theory of kind
 

2153
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,990
program for how to find a theory of kind
of gravity you know ends up with

2154
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,000
of gravity you know ends up with
 

2155
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,390
of gravity you know ends up with
something that is consistent

2156
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:18,400
something that is consistent
 

2157
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,349
something that is consistent
and so

2158
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:19,359
and so
 

2159
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,870
and so
in some sense you could argue this is

2160
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:20,880
in some sense you could argue this is
 

2161
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,230
in some sense you could argue this is
what happened to the strength there is

2162
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:22,240
what happened to the strength there is
 

2163
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,670
what happened to the strength there is
they um

2164
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
they um
 

2165
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,349
they um
they solved their problem of finding a

2166
00:35:25,349 --> 00:35:25,359
they solved their problem of finding a
 

2167
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,950
they solved their problem of finding a
consistent theory of quantum gravity and

2168
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
consistent theory of quantum gravity and
 

2169
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,109
consistent theory of quantum gravity and
they ended but they found 10 of the 500

2170
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
they ended but they found 10 of the 500
 

2171
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,190
they ended but they found 10 of the 500
solutions so

2172
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:31,200
solutions so
 

2173
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,630
solutions so
you you know

2174
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
you you know
 

2175
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,630
you you know
if you believe that everything that they

2176
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:34,640
if you believe that everything that they
 

2177
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,190
if you believe that everything that they
would like to be true is true well

2178
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:37,200
would like to be true is true well
 

2179
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,589
would like to be true is true well
okay you've got a theory but it's

2180
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
okay you've got a theory but it's
 

2181
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,270
okay you've got a theory but it's
it ends up being kind of useless because

2182
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:41,280
it ends up being kind of useless because
 

2183
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,030
it ends up being kind of useless because
it's just one of

2184
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
it's just one of
 

2185
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,589
it's just one of
an infant essentially infinite number of

2186
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:45,599
an infant essentially infinite number of
 

2187
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,030
an infant essentially infinite number of
things which you have no way to

2188
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:47,040
things which you have no way to
 

2189
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,630
things which you have no way to
experimentally distinguish and so this

2190
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
experimentally distinguish and so this
 

2191
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,430
experimentally distinguish and so this
is a

2192
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
is a
 

2193
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,589
is a
just a depressing situation

2194
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
just a depressing situation
 

2195
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,829
just a depressing situation
um but but i but i do think that there

2196
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
um but but i but i do think that there
 

2197
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,109
um but but i but i do think that there
is a um

2198
00:35:55,109 --> 00:35:55,119
is a um
 

2199
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:57,109
is a um
so again i think pursuing ideas about

2200
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:57,119
so again i think pursuing ideas about
 

2201
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,190
so again i think pursuing ideas about
what

2202
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
what
 

2203
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,710
what
more about beauty and how can you

2204
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
more about beauty and how can you
 

2205
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,710
more about beauty and how can you
integrate and unify

2206
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:02,720
integrate and unify
 

2207
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,630
integrate and unify
these issues about gravity with other

2208
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:04,640
these issues about gravity with other
 

2209
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,310
these issues about gravity with other
things we know about physics and can you

2210
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
things we know about physics and can you
 

2211
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,069
things we know about physics and can you
find a theory which were they were these

2212
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:08,079
find a theory which were they were these
 

2213
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,910
find a theory which were they were these
fit together in a in a way that makes

2214
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:09,920
fit together in a in a way that makes
 

2215
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,589
fit together in a in a way that makes
sense and and hopefully predict

2216
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,599
sense and and hopefully predict
 

2217
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,829
sense and and hopefully predict
something that's much more promising

2218
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:13,839
something that's much more promising
 

2219
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,150
something that's much more promising
well it makes sense and hopefully i mean

2220
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
well it makes sense and hopefully i mean
 

2221
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,750
well it makes sense and hopefully i mean
we'll sneak up

2222
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
we'll sneak up
 

2223
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,430
we'll sneak up
onto this question a bunch of times

2224
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
onto this question a bunch of times
 

2225
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,870
onto this question a bunch of times
because you kind of said

2226
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
because you kind of said
 

2227
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,349
because you kind of said
uh a few slightly contradictory things

2228
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
uh a few slightly contradictory things
 

2229
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,430
uh a few slightly contradictory things
which is like it's nice to have a theory

2230
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
which is like it's nice to have a theory
 

2231
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,030
which is like it's nice to have a theory
that's consistent

2232
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
that's consistent
 

2233
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,390
that's consistent
but then

2234
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:28,400
but then
 

2235
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,150
but then
if the theory is consistent it doesn't

2236
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,160
if the theory is consistent it doesn't
 

2237
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,710
if the theory is consistent it doesn't
necessarily mean anything

2238
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:32,720
necessarily mean anything
 

2239
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,790
necessarily mean anything
so like it's it's not enough it's not

2240
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
so like it's it's not enough it's not
 

2241
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,230
so like it's it's not enough it's not
enough it's not enough and that's the

2242
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
enough it's not enough and that's the
 

2243
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,069
enough it's not enough and that's the
problem so it's like it keeps coming

2244
00:36:38,069 --> 00:36:38,079
problem so it's like it keeps coming
 

2245
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,270
problem so it's like it keeps coming
back to

2246
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,280
back to
 

2247
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,030
back to
okay there should be some experimental

2248
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:41,040
okay there should be some experimental
 

2249
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,270
okay there should be some experimental
validation

2250
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
validation
 

2251
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,630
validation
so okay

2252
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:44,640
so okay
 

2253
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,470
so okay
let's talk a little bit about string

2254
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
let's talk a little bit about string
 

2255
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,150
let's talk a little bit about string
theory you've been uh

2256
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
theory you've been uh
 

2257
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,710
theory you've been uh
a bit of an outspoken critic of strength

2258
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
a bit of an outspoken critic of strength
 

2259
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,310
a bit of an outspoken critic of strength
theory

2260
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:52,320
theory
 

2261
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,950
theory
maybe one question first to ask is what

2262
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
maybe one question first to ask is what
 

2263
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,550
maybe one question first to ask is what
is string theory

2264
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:56,560
is string theory
 

2265
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,069
is string theory
and uh

2266
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:58,079
and uh
 

2267
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,630
and uh
beyond that why is it

2268
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:00,640
beyond that why is it
 

2269
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,750
beyond that why is it
wrong

2270
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:01,760
wrong
 

2271
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,470
wrong
or rather the title of your blog says

2272
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,480
or rather the title of your blog says
 

2273
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,589
or rather the title of your blog says
not even wrong okay

2274
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599
not even wrong okay
 

2275
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:08,870
not even wrong okay
well one interesting thing about the

2276
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:08,880
well one interesting thing about the
 

2277
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,470
well one interesting thing about the
current state of strength theory is that

2278
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:10,480
current state of strength theory is that
 

2279
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,390
current state of strength theory is that
i think it i'd argue it's actually very

2280
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
i think it i'd argue it's actually very
 

2281
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,630
i think it i'd argue it's actually very
very difficult to at this point to say

2282
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:14,640
very difficult to at this point to say
 

2283
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,310
very difficult to at this point to say
what string theory means if people say

2284
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:16,320
what string theory means if people say
 

2285
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,550
what string theory means if people say
they're string theorists what they

2286
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
they're string theorists what they
 

2287
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,950
they're string theorists what they
mean and what they're doing is uh

2288
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:20,960
mean and what they're doing is uh
 

2289
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,710
mean and what they're doing is uh
it's kind of hard it's hard to pin down

2290
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:22,720
it's kind of hard it's hard to pin down
 

2291
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,710
it's kind of hard it's hard to pin down
the meaning of the term but the but the

2292
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:24,720
the meaning of the term but the but the
 

2293
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,150
the meaning of the term but the but the
initial meaning i think goes back to um

2294
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:28,160
initial meaning i think goes back to um
 

2295
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,750
initial meaning i think goes back to um
there was kind of a series of

2296
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:29,760
there was kind of a series of
 

2297
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,710
there was kind of a series of
developments starting in 1984 in which

2298
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:32,720
developments starting in 1984 in which
 

2299
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,270
developments starting in 1984 in which
people felt that they had found a

2300
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
people felt that they had found a
 

2301
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,990
people felt that they had found a
unified theory of

2302
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:38,000
unified theory of
 

2303
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,990
unified theory of
our so-called standard model of of all

2304
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,000
our so-called standard model of of all
 

2305
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,430
our so-called standard model of of all
the standard

2306
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:41,440
the standard
 

2307
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,510
the standard
well-known kind of particle interactions

2308
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
well-known kind of particle interactions
 

2309
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,670
well-known kind of particle interactions
and gravity and it all fit together in a

2310
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:45,680
and gravity and it all fit together in a
 

2311
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,270
and gravity and it all fit together in a
quantum theory and that you could do

2312
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:47,280
quantum theory and that you could do
 

2313
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,069
quantum theory and that you could do
this

2314
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
this
 

2315
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,950
this
in a very specific way by

2316
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:50,960
in a very specific way by
 

2317
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,750
in a very specific way by
instead of thinking about

2318
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
instead of thinking about
 

2319
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,349
instead of thinking about
having a quantum theory of particles

2320
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:55,359
having a quantum theory of particles
 

2321
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,069
having a quantum theory of particles
moving around in space time think about

2322
00:37:58,069 --> 00:37:58,079
moving around in space time think about
 

2323
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,510
moving around in space time think about
uh quantum theory of kind of

2324
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,520
uh quantum theory of kind of
 

2325
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,190
uh quantum theory of kind of
one-dimensional loops moving around in

2326
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
one-dimensional loops moving around in
 

2327
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,069
one-dimensional loops moving around in
space-time so-called strings and so

2328
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
space-time so-called strings and so
 

2329
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,310
space-time so-called strings and so
instead of one degree of freedom

2330
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:06,320
instead of one degree of freedom
 

2331
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,670
instead of one degree of freedom
these have an infinite number of degrees

2332
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:07,680
these have an infinite number of degrees
 

2333
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,270
these have an infinite number of degrees
of freedom it's a much more complicated

2334
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
of freedom it's a much more complicated
 

2335
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,069
of freedom it's a much more complicated
theory but you can imagine

2336
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:12,079
theory but you can imagine
 

2337
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,750
theory but you can imagine
okay we're going to quantize this theory

2338
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:13,760
okay we're going to quantize this theory
 

2339
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,550
okay we're going to quantize this theory
of loops moving around in space-time

2340
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
of loops moving around in space-time
 

2341
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,109
of loops moving around in space-time
and what they found is that they

2342
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
and what they found is that they
 

2343
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,950
and what they found is that they
is that you could make you could do this

2344
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:20,960
is that you could make you could do this
 

2345
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,550
is that you could make you could do this
and you could fairly relatively

2346
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
and you could fairly relatively
 

2347
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,109
and you could fairly relatively
straightforwardly make sense of

2348
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
straightforwardly make sense of
 

2349
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,310
straightforwardly make sense of
of such a quantum theory but only if

2350
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:28,320
of such a quantum theory but only if
 

2351
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,510
of such a quantum theory but only if
space and time together were

2352
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:29,520
space and time together were
 

2353
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,349
space and time together were
10-dimensional

2354
00:38:31,349 --> 00:38:31,359
10-dimensional
 

2355
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,030
10-dimensional
and so then you had this problem again

2356
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:33,040
and so then you had this problem again
 

2357
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:33,990
and so then you had this problem again
the problem i referred to at the

2358
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
the problem i referred to at the
 

2359
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,630
the problem i referred to at the
beginning of okay now once you make that

2360
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:36,640
beginning of okay now once you make that
 

2361
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,990
beginning of okay now once you make that
move you've got to get rid of six

2362
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,000
move you've got to get rid of six
 

2363
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,430
move you've got to get rid of six
dimensions

2364
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:39,440
dimensions
 

2365
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,510
dimensions
and so the hope was that

2366
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
and so the hope was that
 

2367
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,030
and so the hope was that
you could get rid of the six dimensions

2368
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
you could get rid of the six dimensions
 

2369
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,030
you could get rid of the six dimensions
by making them very small and that

2370
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:45,040
by making them very small and that
 

2371
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,990
by making them very small and that
consistency of the theory would require

2372
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:48,000
consistency of the theory would require
 

2373
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,630
consistency of the theory would require
these that these six dimensions um

2374
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
these that these six dimensions um
 

2375
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:53,270
these that these six dimensions um
satisfy a very specific condition called

2376
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:53,280
satisfy a very specific condition called
 

2377
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,829
satisfy a very specific condition called
being a claudio manifold and that we

2378
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:55,839
being a claudio manifold and that we
 

2379
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,150
being a claudio manifold and that we
knew very very few examples of this

2380
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,160
knew very very few examples of this
 

2381
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,150
knew very very few examples of this
so what got a lot of people very excited

2382
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,160
so what got a lot of people very excited
 

2383
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,109
so what got a lot of people very excited
back in

2384
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
back in
 

2385
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,910
back in
84 85 was the hope that

2386
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:03,920
84 85 was the hope that
 

2387
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,750
84 85 was the hope that
you could just take this some 10

2388
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:05,760
you could just take this some 10
 

2389
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,390
you could just take this some 10
dimensional string theory and

2390
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:08,400
dimensional string theory and
 

2391
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,390
dimensional string theory and
find one of a limited number of possible

2392
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:10,400
find one of a limited number of possible
 

2393
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,910
find one of a limited number of possible
ways of

2394
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
ways of
 

2395
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,589
ways of
of getting rid of six dimensions by

2396
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:13,599
of getting rid of six dimensions by
 

2397
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,109
of getting rid of six dimensions by
making them small and then you would end

2398
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
making them small and then you would end
 

2399
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,109
making them small and then you would end
up with a an effective four-dimensional

2400
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:17,119
up with a an effective four-dimensional
 

2401
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:18,630
up with a an effective four-dimensional
theory which looked like the real world

2402
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:18,640
theory which looked like the real world
 

2403
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,870
theory which looked like the real world
this was the hope so then

2404
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:20,880
this was the hope so then
 

2405
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,550
this was the hope so then
there's been a very long story about

2406
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:22,560
there's been a very long story about
 

2407
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,390
there's been a very long story about
what happened to that hope over the

2408
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:24,400
what happened to that hope over the
 

2409
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,750
what happened to that hope over the
years i mean

2410
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
years i mean
 

2411
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,990
years i mean
i i would argue and like part of the

2412
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,000
i i would argue and like part of the
 

2413
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,069
i i would argue and like part of the
point of the book and its title was that

2414
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,079
point of the book and its title was that
 

2415
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,349
point of the book and its title was that
um

2416
00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:31,359
um
 

2417
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,950
um
you know that this this ultimately was

2418
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:32,960
you know that this this ultimately was
 

2419
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,950
you know that this this ultimately was
it was a failure that you ended up that

2420
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:34,960
it was a failure that you ended up that
 

2421
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,710
it was a failure that you ended up that
this idea just didn't um

2422
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:38,720

 

2423
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,230

there ended up being just too many ways

2424
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,240
there ended up being just too many ways
 

2425
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,750
there ended up being just too many ways
of doing this and you didn't know how to

2426
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:41,760
of doing this and you didn't know how to
 

2427
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,829
of doing this and you didn't know how to
do this consistently

2428
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:43,839
do this consistently
 

2429
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:45,349
do this consistently
that it was kind of

2430
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
that it was kind of
 

2431
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,870
that it was kind of
not even wrong in the sense that you

2432
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:46,880
not even wrong in the sense that you
 

2433
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,630
not even wrong in the sense that you
couldn't even you never could pin it

2434
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:48,640
couldn't even you never could pin it
 

2435
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,310
couldn't even you never could pin it

falsifiable prediction out of it that

2438
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:53,920
falsifiable prediction out of it that
 

2439
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,510
falsifiable prediction out of it that
would tell you it was wrong but it was

2440
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
would tell you it was wrong but it was
 

2441
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,550
would tell you it was wrong but it was
um

2442
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,560
um
 

2443
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,790
um
it was kind of in the in the realm of

2444
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:58,800
it was kind of in the in the realm of
 

2445
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,310
it was kind of in the in the realm of
ideas which initially looked good but

2446
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:00,320
ideas which initially looked good but
 

2447
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,910
ideas which initially looked good but
the more you look at them

2448
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:01,920
the more you look at them
 

2449
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,349
the more you look at them
they just um

2450
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
they just um
 

2451
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,870
they just um
they don't work out the way the way you

2452
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:04,880
they don't work out the way the way you
 

2453
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,710
they don't work out the way the way you
want and they don't actually end up

2454
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
want and they don't actually end up
 

2455
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,550
want and they don't actually end up
carrying the power or the that you

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:08,560
carrying the power or the that you
 

2457
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:11,270
carrying the power or the that you
originally had this vision of

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:17,680
title is not even wrong
 

2465
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,829
title is not even wrong
okay but there is nevertheless been a

2466
00:40:19,829 --> 00:40:19,839
okay but there is nevertheless been a
 

2467
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,589
okay but there is nevertheless been a
lot of excitement about string theory

2468
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
lot of excitement about string theory
 

2469
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,550
lot of excitement about string theory
through the decades as you mentioned uh

2470
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
through the decades as you mentioned uh
 

2471
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,950
through the decades as you mentioned uh
what are the different flavors of ideas

2472
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:26,960
what are the different flavors of ideas
 

2473
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,550
what are the different flavors of ideas
that came

2474
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
that came
 

2475
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,270
that came
uh

2476
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:29,280
uh
 

2477
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,829
uh
like they branched out you mentioned 10

2478
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:31,839
like they branched out you mentioned 10
 

2479
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:33,670
like they branched out you mentioned 10
dimensions you mentioned

2480
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:33,680
dimensions you mentioned
 

2481
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,390

what what other interesting ideas to you

2484
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:38,640
what what other interesting ideas to you
 

2485
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,790
what what other interesting ideas to you
that kind of emerge from this world

2486
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:40,800
that kind of emerge from this world
 

2487
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,230
that kind of emerge from this world
well yeah i mean the problem in talking

2488
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
well yeah i mean the problem in talking
 

2489
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,910
well yeah i mean the problem in talking
about the whole subject and well partly

2490
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
about the whole subject and well partly
 

2491
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,589
about the whole subject and well partly
one reason i wrote the book

2492
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
one reason i wrote the book
 

2493
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,150
one reason i wrote the book
is that you know it it gets very very

2494
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
is that you know it it gets very very
 

2495
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,109
is that you know it it gets very very
complicated i mean there's a huge amount

2496
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:51,119
complicated i mean there's a huge amount
 

2497
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,589
complicated i mean there's a huge amount
you know you a lot of people got very

2498
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:53,599
you know you a lot of people got very
 

2499
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:54,790
you know you a lot of people got very
interested in this a lot of people

2500
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
interested in this a lot of people
 

2501
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,109
interested in this a lot of people
worked on it and and in some sense i

2502
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
worked on it and and in some sense i
 

2503
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,190
worked on it and and in some sense i
think what happened is exactly because

2504
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,200
think what happened is exactly because
 

2505
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,190
think what happened is exactly because
the idea didn't really work

2506
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,200
the idea didn't really work
 

2507
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,150
the idea didn't really work
that this caused people to

2508
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:04,160
that this caused people to
 

2509
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,589
that this caused people to
you know instead of focusing on this one

2510
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:05,599
you know instead of focusing on this one
 

2511
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,069
you know instead of focusing on this one
idea and digging in and working on that

2512
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:08,079
idea and digging in and working on that
 

2513
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,349
idea and digging in and working on that
they just kind of

2514
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:09,359
they just kind of
 

2515
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,990
they just kind of
kept trying new things and so

2516
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
kept trying new things and so
 

2517
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,910
kept trying new things and so
people i think ended up wandering around

2518
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:13,920
people i think ended up wandering around
 

2519
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,990
people i think ended up wandering around
in a very very rich space of ideas about

2520
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,000
in a very very rich space of ideas about
 

2521
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,309
in a very very rich space of ideas about
mathematics and physics and discovering

2522
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
mathematics and physics and discovering
 

2523
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,510
mathematics and physics and discovering
you know all sorts of really interesting

2524
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:19,520
you know all sorts of really interesting
 

2525
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,589
you know all sorts of really interesting
things it's just the problem is there

2526
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
things it's just the problem is there
 

2527
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,270
things it's just the problem is there
tended to be an inverse relationship

2528
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
tended to be an inverse relationship
 

2529
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,270
tended to be an inverse relationship
between how interesting and beautiful

2530
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
between how interesting and beautiful
 

2531
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,030
between how interesting and beautiful
and fruitful this new

2532
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
and fruitful this new
 

2533
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,790
and fruitful this new
idea that they were trying to pursue was

2534
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:28,800
idea that they were trying to pursue was
 

2535
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,470
idea that they were trying to pursue was
and how much it looked like the real

2536
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:30,480
and how much it looked like the real
 

2537
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,670
and how much it looked like the real
world

2538
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
world
 

2539
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,710
world
so there's a lot of beautiful

2540
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:32,720
so there's a lot of beautiful
 

2541
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,390
so there's a lot of beautiful
mathematics came out of it

2542
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:34,400
mathematics came out of it
 

2543
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,069
mathematics came out of it
i think one of the most spectacular is

2544
00:41:36,069 --> 00:41:36,079
i think one of the most spectacular is
 

2545
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,589
i think one of the most spectacular is
what the

2546
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:37,599
what the
 

2547
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:38,870
what the
physicists call two-dimensional

2548
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
physicists call two-dimensional
 

2549
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,270
physicists call two-dimensional
conformal field theory and so these are

2550
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
conformal field theory and so these are
 

2551
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:41,790
conformal field theory and so these are
basically

2552
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:41,800
basically
 

2553
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,510
basically

quantum field theories and kind of think

2556
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:45,200
quantum field theories and kind of think
 

2557
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,790
quantum field theories and kind of think
of it as one space and one time

2558
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:46,800
of it as one space and one time
 

2559
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,550
of it as one space and one time
dimension which

2560
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:48,560
dimension which
 

2561
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,550
dimension which
you know have just this huge amount of

2562
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:50,560
you know have just this huge amount of
 

2563
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,510
you know have just this huge amount of
symmetry and a huge amount of structure

2564
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:53,520
symmetry and a huge amount of structure
 

2565
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,870
symmetry and a huge amount of structure
which

2566
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:54,880
which
 

2567
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,150
which
and just some totally fantastic

2568
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:56,160
and just some totally fantastic
 

2569
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,390
and just some totally fantastic
mathematics behind it and um and again

2570
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
mathematics behind it and um and again
 

2571
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,309
mathematics behind it and um and again
and and some of that mathematics

2572
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:00,319
and and some of that mathematics
 

2573
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,829
and and some of that mathematics
is exactly also what appears in the

2574
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:01,839
is exactly also what appears in the
 

2575
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:05,910
is exactly also what appears in the
language program so a lot of the um

2576
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
language program so a lot of the um
 

2577
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,270
language program so a lot of the um
first interaction between math and

2578
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:07,280
first interaction between math and
 

2579
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,870
first interaction between math and
physics around the language program has

2580
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:08,880
physics around the language program has
 

2581
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,230
physics around the language program has
been around these two-dimensional

2582
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:10,240
been around these two-dimensional
 

2583
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,470
been around these two-dimensional
conformal field theories

2584
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:12,480
conformal field theories
 

2585
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,030
conformal field theories
is there um something you could say

2586
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:15,040
is there um something you could say
 

2587
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,270
is there um something you could say
about what the major problems are with

2588
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:17,280
about what the major problems are with
 

2589
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,790
about what the major problems are with
strength theory

2590
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
strength theory
 

2591
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,670
strength theory
so

2592
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:19,680
so
 

2593
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,829
so
like um

2594
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
like um
 

2595
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:23,030
like um
besides

2596
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,040
besides
 

2597
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,670
besides
that there's no experimental validation

2598
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
that there's no experimental validation
 

2599
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,510
that there's no experimental validation
you've written that a big hole

2600
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:29,520
you've written that a big hole
 

2601
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,510
you've written that a big hole
in string theory has been its

2602
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:31,520
in string theory has been its
 

2603
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,309
in string theory has been its
perturbative definition yeah

2604
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
perturbative definition yeah
 

2605
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,910
perturbative definition yeah
perhaps that's one can you explain what

2606
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:35,920
perhaps that's one can you explain what
 

2607
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,910
perhaps that's one can you explain what
that means well maybe to begin with i

2608
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920
that means well maybe to begin with i
 

2609
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,430
that means well maybe to begin with i
mean i think i mean the simplest thing

2610
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:39,440
mean i think i mean the simplest thing
 

2611
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,069
mean i think i mean the simplest thing
to say is

2612
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
to say is
 

2613
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,150
to say is
you know the the initial idea really was

2614
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:44,160
you know the the initial idea really was
 

2615
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,030
you know the the initial idea really was
that

2616
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
that
 

2617
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,870
that
okay we're we have this

2618
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:46,880
okay we're we have this
 

2619
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,710
okay we're we have this
instead of what's great is we have this

2620
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:48,720
instead of what's great is we have this
 

2621
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,550
instead of what's great is we have this
thing that only works

2622
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
thing that only works
 

2623
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:53,109
thing that only works
that's very structured and has to

2624
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
that's very structured and has to
 

2625
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,790
that's very structured and has to
work in a certain way for it to make

2626
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,800
work in a certain way for it to make
 

2627
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,750
work in a certain way for it to make
sense

2628
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
sense
 

2629
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,510
sense
and um

2630
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:57,520
and um
 

2631
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,670
and um
but but then you ended up you ended up

2632
00:42:59,670 --> 00:42:59,680
but but then you ended up you ended up
 

2633
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,550
but but then you ended up you ended up
in ten space time dimensions and so to

2634
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:02,560
in ten space time dimensions and so to
 

2635
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,150
in ten space time dimensions and so to
get back to physics you had to get rid

2636
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,160
get back to physics you had to get rid
 

2637
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,589
get back to physics you had to get rid
of five of the dimension six of

2638
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
of five of the dimension six of
 

2639
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,710
of five of the dimension six of
dimensions

2640
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
dimensions
 

2641
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,510
dimensions
and

2642
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
and
 

2643
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,710
and
the bottom line i would say in some

2644
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:08,720
the bottom line i would say in some
 

2645
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,150
the bottom line i would say in some
sense it's very simple that what people

2646
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:10,160
sense it's very simple that what people
 

2647
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,630
sense it's very simple that what people
just discovered is just

2648
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:12,640
just discovered is just
 

2649
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,550
just discovered is just
there there's kind of no particularly

2650
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:14,560
there there's kind of no particularly
 

2651
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,829
there there's kind of no particularly
nice way of doing this there's an

2652
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
nice way of doing this there's an
 

2653
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,510
nice way of doing this there's an
infinite number of ways of doing it and

2654
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
infinite number of ways of doing it and
 

2655
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,950
infinite number of ways of doing it and
you can get whatever you want depending

2656
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
you can get whatever you want depending
 

2657
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,670
you can get whatever you want depending
on how you do it so the you you end up

2658
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
on how you do it so the you you end up
 

2659
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,270
on how you do it so the you you end up
the whole program of starting at ten

2660
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:23,280
the whole program of starting at ten
 

2661
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,349
the whole program of starting at ten
dimensions and getting to four

2662
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:25,359
dimensions and getting to four
 

2663
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,069
dimensions and getting to four
just kind of collapses out of a lack of

2664
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:28,079
just kind of collapses out of a lack of
 

2665
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,589
just kind of collapses out of a lack of
any way to kind of get to where you want

2666
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
any way to kind of get to where you want
 

2667
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,349
any way to kind of get to where you want
because you can get anything

2668
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:31,359
because you can get anything
 

2669
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,990
because you can get anything
the hope around that problem has always

2670
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
the hope around that problem has always
 

2671
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,150
the hope around that problem has always
been that

2672
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
been that
 

2673
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,150
been that
the standard formulation that we have of

2674
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,160
the standard formulation that we have of
 

2675
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,550
the standard formulation that we have of
string theory which is

2676
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
string theory which is
 

2677
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,390
string theory which is
you can go in by the name perturbative

2678
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:42,400
you can go in by the name perturbative
 

2679
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,950
you can go in by the name perturbative
but it's kind of um

2680
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:44,960
but it's kind of um
 

2681
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,550
but it's kind of um
there's a standard way we know of given

2682
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:46,560
there's a standard way we know of given
 

2683
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,589
there's a standard way we know of given
a classical theory of constructing

2684
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
a classical theory of constructing
 

2685
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,910
a classical theory of constructing
a quantum theory and

2686
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:51,920
a quantum theory and
 

2687
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:55,270
a quantum theory and
and working with it which is

2688
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
and working with it which is
 

2689
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,870
and working with it which is
that's the so-called perturbation theory

2690
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:56,880
that's the so-called perturbation theory
 

2691
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,109
that's the so-called perturbation theory
that um that we know how to do

2692
00:43:59,109 --> 00:43:59,119
that um that we know how to do
 

2693
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:00,870
that um that we know how to do
and that

2694
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:00,880
and that
 

2695
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,430
and that
that by itself just just doesn't doesn't

2696
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:03,440
that by itself just just doesn't doesn't
 

2697
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,109
that by itself just just doesn't doesn't
give you any hint as to what to do about

2698
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:05,119
give you any hint as to what to do about
 

2699
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,550
give you any hint as to what to do about
the six dimensions

2700
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:06,560
the six dimensions
 

2701
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,550
the six dimensions
so actual perturbed string theory by

2702
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:08,560
so actual perturbed string theory by
 

2703
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:10,069
so actual perturbed string theory by
itself really only works in 10

2704
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
itself really only works in 10
 

2705
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,270
itself really only works in 10
dimensions

2706
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:11,280
dimensions
 

2707
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:11,990
dimensions
so

2708
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:12,000
so
 

2709
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,589
so
you have to start making some kinds of

2710
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:13,599
you have to start making some kinds of
 

2711
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,309
you have to start making some kinds of
assumptions about how i'm going to

2712
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:16,319
assumptions about how i'm going to
 

2713
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,950
assumptions about how i'm going to
go beyond

2714
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:18,960
go beyond
 

2715
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,390
go beyond
this formulation that we really

2716
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:20,400
this formulation that we really
 

2717
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,990
this formulation that we really
understand of string theory and get rid

2718
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
understand of string theory and get rid
 

2719
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,309
understand of string theory and get rid
of these six six dimensions so kind of

2720
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:24,319
of these six six dimensions so kind of
 

2721
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:26,230
of these six six dimensions so kind of
the simplest one was the um

2722
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
the simplest one was the um
 

2723
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,910
the simplest one was the um
the claudio

2724
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:27,920
the claudio
 

2725
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,190
the claudio
postulate

2726
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:29,200
postulate
 

2727
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,390
postulate
but um

2728
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
but um
 

2729
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,910
but um
when that didn't really work out people

2730
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
when that didn't really work out people
 

2731
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,430
when that didn't really work out people
have tried more and more different

2732
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:33,440
have tried more and more different
 

2733
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,270
have tried more and more different
things and and the hope has always been

2734
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:35,280
things and and the hope has always been
 

2735
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,030
things and and the hope has always been
that

2736
00:44:37,030 --> 00:44:37,040
that
 

2737
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,309
that
the solution

2738
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:38,319
the solution
 

2739
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,750
the solution
this problem would be that you would

2740
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:39,760
this problem would be that you would
 

2741
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,470
this problem would be that you would
find a a deeper and better understanding

2742
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
find a a deeper and better understanding
 

2743
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:44,470
find a a deeper and better understanding
of what string theory is that would

2744
00:44:44,470 --> 00:44:44,480
of what string theory is that would
 

2745
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,109
of what string theory is that would
actually go beyond this perturbative

2746
00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:47,119
actually go beyond this perturbative
 

2747
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,670
actually go beyond this perturbative
expansion and which would um which would

2748
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:49,680
expansion and which would um which would
 

2749
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,390
expansion and which would um which would
generalize this and and that once you

2750
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:52,400
generalize this and and that once you
 

2751
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,790
generalize this and and that once you
had that it would um

2752
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:54,800
had that it would um
 

2753
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,349
had that it would um
it would solve this problem of

2754
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
it would solve this problem of
 

2755
00:44:57,359 --> 00:44:58,630
it would solve this problem of
it would pick out what to do with the

2756
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:58,640
it would pick out what to do with the
 

2757
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,630
it would pick out what to do with the
six dimensions how difficult is this

2758
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
six dimensions how difficult is this
 

2759
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,349
six dimensions how difficult is this
problem so

2760
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359

 

2761
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,829

if i could restate the problem it seems

2762
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:05,839
if i could restate the problem it seems
 

2763
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,630
if i could restate the problem it seems
like there's a very consistent

2764
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
like there's a very consistent
 

2765
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,630
like there's a very consistent
physical world operating in four

2766
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
physical world operating in four
 

2767
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,270
physical world operating in four
dimensions

2768
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
dimensions
 

2769
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,829
dimensions
and uh how do you map a consistent

2770
00:45:15,829 --> 00:45:15,839
and uh how do you map a consistent
 

2771
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,750
and uh how do you map a consistent
physical world in 10 dimensions to a

2772
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:17,760
physical world in 10 dimensions to a
 

2773
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,750
physical world in 10 dimensions to a
consistent physical world in four

2774
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:19,760
consistent physical world in four
 

2775
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,230
consistent physical world in four
dimensions right and how how difficult

2776
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
dimensions right and how how difficult
 

2777
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,150
dimensions right and how how difficult
is this problem is is that something you

2778
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:24,160
is this problem is is that something you
 

2779
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,589
is this problem is is that something you
can even answer

2780
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
can even answer
 

2781
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:27,589
can even answer
um

2782
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
um
 

2783
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,710
um
just

2784
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
just
 

2785
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,630
just
in terms of physics intuition in terms

2786
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:30,640
in terms of physics intuition in terms
 

2787
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,670
in terms of physics intuition in terms
of mathematics mapping from

2788
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:33,680
of mathematics mapping from
 

2789
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,190
of mathematics mapping from
ten dimensions to four dimensions well

2790
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:35,200
ten dimensions to four dimensions well
 

2791
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,550
ten dimensions to four dimensions well
basically i mean you have to get rid of

2792
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:36,560
basically i mean you have to get rid of
 

2793
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,270
basically i mean you have to get rid of
the of six of the dimensions so there's

2794
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:39,280
the of six of the dimensions so there's
 

2795
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,349
the of six of the dimensions so there's
i mean there's kind of two ways of doing

2796
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:41,359
i mean there's kind of two ways of doing
 

2797
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,910
i mean there's kind of two ways of doing
it one is what we call compactification

2798
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:43,920
it one is what we call compactification
 

2799
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:45,270
it one is what we call compactification
you say that

2800
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:45,280
you say that
 

2801
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,349
you say that
there really are 10 dimensions but for

2802
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
there really are 10 dimensions but for
 

2803
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,190
there really are 10 dimensions but for
whatever reason six of them are really

2804
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
whatever reason six of them are really
 

2805
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,750
whatever reason six of them are really
are so so small we can't see them

2806
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:51,760
are so so small we can't see them
 

2807
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,349
are so so small we can't see them
so you basically start out with ten

2808
00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
so you basically start out with ten
 

2809
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,510
so you basically start out with ten
dimensions and what we call you know

2810
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
dimensions and what we call you know
 

2811
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,750
dimensions and what we call you know
make make six of them

2812
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
make make six of them
 

2813
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,589
make make six of them
not go out to infinity but just kind of

2814
00:45:59,589 --> 00:45:59,599
not go out to infinity but just kind of
 

2815
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,750
not go out to infinity but just kind of
a finite extent and then make that size

2816
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
a finite extent and then make that size
 

2817
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,670
a finite extent and then make that size
go down

2818
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
go down
 

2819
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,750
go down
so small it's unobservable but that's

2820
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:05,760
so small it's unobservable but that's
 

2821
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,150
so small it's unobservable but that's
like that's a math trick

2822
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
like that's a math trick
 

2823
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,190
like that's a math trick
so

2824
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:09,200
so
 

2825
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,349
so
can you also help me build an intuition

2826
00:46:11,349 --> 00:46:11,359
can you also help me build an intuition
 

2827
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:12,309
can you also help me build an intuition
about

2828
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:12,319
about
 

2829
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:13,750
about
how rich

2830
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:13,760
how rich
 

2831
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,990
how rich
and interesting the world in those six

2832
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:16,000
and interesting the world in those six
 

2833
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,670
and interesting the world in those six
dimensions is

2834
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:17,680
dimensions is
 

2835
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,589
dimensions is
because so compactification seems to

2836
00:46:19,589 --> 00:46:19,599
because so compactification seems to
 

2837
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,870
because so compactification seems to
imply

2838
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
imply
 

2839
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,270
imply
well that's very interesting well no but

2840
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:23,280
well that's very interesting well no but
 

2841
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,710
well that's very interesting well no but
the problem is that what you learn if

2842
00:46:24,710 --> 00:46:24,720
the problem is that what you learn if
 

2843
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,030
the problem is that what you learn if
you start doing math mathematics looking

2844
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
you start doing math mathematics looking
 

2845
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,750
you start doing math mathematics looking
at geometry and topology and in more and

2846
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:29,760
at geometry and topology and in more and
 

2847
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,430
at geometry and topology and in more and
more dimensions is that

2848
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:31,440
more dimensions is that
 

2849
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,109
more dimensions is that
i mean

2850
00:46:33,109 --> 00:46:33,119
i mean
 

2851
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:34,630
i mean
asking the question like what are all

2852
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
asking the question like what are all
 

2853
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,470
asking the question like what are all
possible six dimensional spaces it's

2854
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
possible six dimensional spaces it's
 

2855
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,069
possible six dimensional spaces it's
just a it's kind of an unanswerable

2856
00:46:38,069 --> 00:46:38,079
just a it's kind of an unanswerable
 

2857
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,990
just a it's kind of an unanswerable
question it's just uh i mean it's even

2858
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:40,000
question it's just uh i mean it's even
 

2859
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,670
question it's just uh i mean it's even
kind of technically undecidable in some

2860
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:41,680
kind of technically undecidable in some
 

2861
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,190
kind of technically undecidable in some
way they're just they're just too too

2862
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:43,200
way they're just they're just too too
 

2863
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,710
way they're just they're just too too
they're too many things you can do with

2864
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:44,720
they're too many things you can do with
 

2865
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,069
they're too many things you can do with
all these

2866
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:46,079
all these
 

2867
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,829
all these
if you start trying to make if you start

2868
00:46:47,829 --> 00:46:47,839
if you start trying to make if you start
 

2869
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:49,430
if you start trying to make if you start
trying to make one-dimensional spaces

2870
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:49,440
trying to make one-dimensional spaces
 

2871
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,190
trying to make one-dimensional spaces
it's like well you got a line you can

2872
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:51,200
it's like well you got a line you can
 

2873
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,829
it's like well you got a line you can
make a circle you can make graphs you

2874
00:46:53,829 --> 00:46:53,839
make a circle you can make graphs you
 

2875
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:55,670
make a circle you can make graphs you
can kind of see what you can do but as

2876
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:55,680
can kind of see what you can do but as
 

2877
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,069
can kind of see what you can do but as
you go to higher and higher dimensions

2878
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:58,079
you go to higher and higher dimensions
 

2879
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,550
you go to higher and higher dimensions
there's just so many ways you can

2880
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:00,560
there's just so many ways you can
 

2881
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,069
there's just so many ways you can
put things together of and get something

2882
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
put things together of and get something
 

2883
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,309
put things together of and get something
of that dimensionality and

2884
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:06,319
of that dimensionality and
 

2885
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:07,670
of that dimensionality and
so it it

2886
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:07,680
so it it
 

2887
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,270
so it it
unless you have some very very strong

2888
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
unless you have some very very strong
 

2889
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,710
unless you have some very very strong
principle which is going to pick out

2890
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
principle which is going to pick out
 

2891
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,470
principle which is going to pick out
some very specific

2892
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
some very specific
 

2893
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,270
some very specific
ones of these six dimensional spaces

2894
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
ones of these six dimensional spaces
 

2895
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,069
ones of these six dimensional spaces
and

2896
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
and
 

2897
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,430
and
they're just too many of them and you

2898
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
they're just too many of them and you
 

2899
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,910
they're just too many of them and you
can get anything you want but um so if

2900
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:19,920
can get anything you want but um so if
 

2901
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,470
can get anything you want but um so if
you have 10 dimensions

2902
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:22,480
you have 10 dimensions
 

2903
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,549
you have 10 dimensions
the kind of things that happen

2904
00:47:24,549 --> 00:47:24,559
the kind of things that happen
 

2905
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,470
the kind of things that happen
say that's actually the way

2906
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
say that's actually the way
 

2907
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,910
say that's actually the way
that's actually the fabric of our

2908
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:27,920
that's actually the fabric of our
 

2909
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,990
that's actually the fabric of our
realities 10 dimensions there's a

2910
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,000
realities 10 dimensions there's a
 

2911
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,030
realities 10 dimensions there's a
limited set of behaviors of objects i

2912
00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:33,040
limited set of behaviors of objects i
 

2913
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,230
limited set of behaviors of objects i
don't even know what the right

2914
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
don't even know what the right
 

2915
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,109
don't even know what the right
terminology to use that can

2916
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:37,119
terminology to use that can
 

2917
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:39,430
terminology to use that can
occur when within those dimensions like

2918
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,440
occur when within those dimensions like
 

2919
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,349
occur when within those dimensions like
in reality yeah

2920
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
in reality yeah
 

2921
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,190
in reality yeah
and so like

2922
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:43,200
and so like
 

2923
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:44,790
and so like
what i'm getting at is like is there

2924
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,800
what i'm getting at is like is there
 

2925
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,190
what i'm getting at is like is there
some consistent constraints

2926
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:47,200
some consistent constraints
 

2927
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:49,430
some consistent constraints
so if you have some constraints that map

2928
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
so if you have some constraints that map
 

2929
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,950
so if you have some constraints that map
to reality

2930
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:50,960
to reality
 

2931
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,349
to reality
then you can start saying like

2932
00:47:53,349 --> 00:47:53,359
then you can start saying like
 

2933
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,150
then you can start saying like
dimension number seven is kind of boring

2934
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,160
dimension number seven is kind of boring
 

2935
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,750
dimension number seven is kind of boring
all the excitement happens in the

2936
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
all the excitement happens in the
 

2937
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,309
all the excitement happens in the
spatial dimensions one two three yeah

2938
00:48:00,309 --> 00:48:00,319
spatial dimensions one two three yeah
 

2939
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:02,630
spatial dimensions one two three yeah
and time is also kind of boring

2940
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
and time is also kind of boring
 

2941
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,990
and time is also kind of boring
yeah and like

2942
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,000
yeah and like
 

2943
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,589
yeah and like
some are more exciting than others or we

2944
00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:05,599
some are more exciting than others or we
 

2945
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,990
some are more exciting than others or we
can use our metric of beauty

2946
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
can use our metric of beauty
 

2947
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,589
can use our metric of beauty
some dimensions are more beautiful than

2948
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:09,599
some dimensions are more beautiful than
 

2949
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,430
some dimensions are more beautiful than
others once you have an actual

2950
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:11,440
others once you have an actual
 

2951
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,230
others once you have an actual
understanding of what actually happens

2952
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:14,240
understanding of what actually happens
 

2953
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,829
understanding of what actually happens
in those dimensions in our physical

2954
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:15,839
in those dimensions in our physical
 

2955
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,750
in those dimensions in our physical
world as opposed to sort of all the

2956
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:17,760
world as opposed to sort of all the
 

2957
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,510
world as opposed to sort of all the
possible things that could happen in

2958
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:19,520
possible things that could happen in
 

2959
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,430
possible things that could happen in
some sense i mean just the basic factors

2960
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:21,440
some sense i mean just the basic factors
 

2961
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,630
some sense i mean just the basic factors
you need to get rid of them we don't see

2962
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:22,640
you need to get rid of them we don't see
 

2963
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,630
you need to get rid of them we don't see
them so you need to somehow explain them

2964
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:24,640
them so you need to somehow explain them
 

2965
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,069
them so you need to somehow explain them
what you have to the main thing you're

2966
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
what you have to the main thing you're
 

2967
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,510
what you have to the main thing you're
trying to do is to explain why we're not

2968
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:27,520
trying to do is to explain why we're not
 

2969
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,710
trying to do is to explain why we're not
seeing them

2970
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:28,720
seeing them
 

2971
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,589
seeing them
and so you can you have to come up with

2972
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:31,599
and so you can you have to come up with
 

2973
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:33,829
and so you can you have to come up with
some theory of these extra dimensions

2974
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:33,839
some theory of these extra dimensions
 

2975
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,630
some theory of these extra dimensions
and how they're going to behave and

2976
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:36,640
and how they're going to behave and
 

2977
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,230
and how they're going to behave and
string theory gives you some ideas about

2978
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:38,240
string theory gives you some ideas about
 

2979
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,150
string theory gives you some ideas about
how to do that but

2980
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160
how to do that but
 

2981
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,510
how to do that but
but

2982
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:41,520
but
 

2983
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,109
but
the bottom line is where you're trying

2984
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
the bottom line is where you're trying
 

2985
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,870
the bottom line is where you're trying
to go with this whole theory you're

2986
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
to go with this whole theory you're
 

2987
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,390
to go with this whole theory you're
creating is

2988
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
creating is
 

2989
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,150
creating is
to just make all of its effects

2990
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:48,160
to just make all of its effects
 

2991
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,470
to just make all of its effects
essentially unobservable so it's a it's

2992
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:50,480
essentially unobservable so it's a it's
 

2993
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,470
essentially unobservable so it's a it's
not a really

2994
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
not a really
 

2995
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,630
not a really
it

2996
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:54,640
it
 

2997
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,549
it
it's an inherently kind of dubious and

2998
00:48:56,549 --> 00:48:56,559
it's an inherently kind of dubious and
 

2999
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:57,990
it's an inherently kind of dubious and
worrisome thing that you're trying to do

3000
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,000
worrisome thing that you're trying to do
 

3001
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,430
worrisome thing that you're trying to do
there why are you just

3002
00:48:59,430 --> 00:48:59,440
there why are you just
 

3003
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,870
there why are you just
adding in all the stuff and then trying

3004
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:00,880
adding in all the stuff and then trying
 

3005
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,309
adding in all the stuff and then trying
to explain why we don't see it i mean

3006
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,319
to explain why we don't see it i mean
 

3007
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:03,750
to explain why we don't see it i mean
it's just good this may be a dumb

3008
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:03,760
it's just good this may be a dumb
 

3009
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,150
it's just good this may be a dumb
question but it's is this an obvious

3010
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:06,160
question but it's is this an obvious
 

3011
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,589
question but it's is this an obvious
thing to state

3012
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:07,599
thing to state
 

3013
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:08,710
thing to state
that

3014
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:08,720
that
 

3015
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,589
that
those six dimensions are unobservable or

3016
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
those six dimensions are unobservable or
 

3017
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:14,829
those six dimensions are unobservable or
anything beyond four dimensions is

3018
00:49:14,829 --> 00:49:14,839
anything beyond four dimensions is
 

3019
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:17,190
anything beyond four dimensions is
unobservable or

3020
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
unobservable or
 

3021
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,589
unobservable or
do you leave a little door open to

3022
00:49:19,589 --> 00:49:19,599
do you leave a little door open to
 

3023
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:20,870
do you leave a little door open to
saying

3024
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
saying
 

3025
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,030
saying
the current tools of physics

3026
00:49:23,030 --> 00:49:23,040
the current tools of physics
 

3027
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,270
the current tools of physics
and obviously our brains aren't unable

3028
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:25,280
and obviously our brains aren't unable
 

3029
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,630
and obviously our brains aren't unable
to observe them

3030
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
to observe them
 

3031
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,030
to observe them
yeah but we may need to come up with

3032
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,040
yeah but we may need to come up with
 

3033
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,870
yeah but we may need to come up with
methodologies for observing so as

3034
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:30,880
methodologies for observing so as
 

3035
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,630
methodologies for observing so as
opposed to collapsing your mathematical

3036
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:32,640
opposed to collapsing your mathematical
 

3037
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,950
opposed to collapsing your mathematical
theory into four dimensions

3038
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
theory into four dimensions
 

3039
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,030
theory into four dimensions
leaving the door open a little bit too

3040
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,040
leaving the door open a little bit too
 

3041
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,870
leaving the door open a little bit too
maybe we need to come up with tools that

3042
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
maybe we need to come up with tools that
 

3043
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,190
maybe we need to come up with tools that
actually allow us to directly measure

3044
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,200
actually allow us to directly measure
 

3045
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,549
actually allow us to directly measure
those dimensions

3046
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:42,559
those dimensions
 

3047
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:43,990
those dimensions
yes i mean but you mean you can

3048
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:44,000
yes i mean but you mean you can
 

3049
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,470
yes i mean but you mean you can
certainly ask you know assume

3050
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
certainly ask you know assume
 

3051
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,150
certainly ask you know assume
that that we've got

3052
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:48,160
that that we've got
 

3053
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,910
that that we've got
model look look at models with more

3054
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:49,920
model look look at models with more
 

3055
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,510
model look look at models with more
dimensions and ask you know what would

3056
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
dimensions and ask you know what would
 

3057
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,589
dimensions and ask you know what would
the observable effects how would we

3058
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
the observable effects how would we
 

3059
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:54,790
the observable effects how would we
know this and you go out and do

3060
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:54,800
know this and you go out and do
 

3061
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,109
know this and you go out and do
experiments so for instance

3062
00:49:57,109 --> 00:49:57,119
experiments so for instance
 

3063
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,549
experiments so for instance
you have a

3064
00:49:58,549 --> 00:49:58,559
you have a
 

3065
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,349
you have a
like

3066
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
like
 

3067
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,030
like
gravitationally you have an inverse

3068
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:01,040
gravitationally you have an inverse
 

3069
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:02,870
gravitationally you have an inverse
square law of forces okay if you had

3070
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:02,880
square law of forces okay if you had
 

3071
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:04,790
square law of forces okay if you had
more dimensions that inverse square law

3072
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
more dimensions that inverse square law
 

3073
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,470
more dimensions that inverse square law
would change something else

3074
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:06,480
would change something else
 

3075
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,150
would change something else
so you can go and start

3076
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,160
so you can go and start
 

3077
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,589
so you can go and start
measuring the inverse square law and say

3078
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:09,599
measuring the inverse square law and say
 

3079
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,910
measuring the inverse square law and say
okay an inverse square law is working

3080
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
okay an inverse square law is working
 

3081
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,950
okay an inverse square law is working
but maybe if i get get and it turns out

3082
00:50:14,950 --> 00:50:14,960
but maybe if i get get and it turns out
 

3083
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,390
but maybe if i get get and it turns out
to be actually kind of very very hard

3084
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:16,400
to be actually kind of very very hard
 

3085
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,390
to be actually kind of very very hard
measuring gravitational effects and even

3086
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:18,400
measuring gravitational effects and even
 

3087
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,510
measuring gravitational effects and even
kind of

3088
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:19,520
kind of
 

3089
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,750
kind of
you know somewhat macroscopic distances

3090
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,760
you know somewhat macroscopic distances
 

3091
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,150
you know somewhat macroscopic distances
because they're so small so you can you

3092
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:24,160
because they're so small so you can you
 

3093
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,750
because they're so small so you can you
can start looking at the inverse square

3094
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:25,760
can start looking at the inverse square
 

3095
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,829
can start looking at the inverse square
law and say start trying to measure it

3096
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:27,839
law and say start trying to measure it
 

3097
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,870
law and say start trying to measure it
at shorter and shorter distances and see

3098
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:30,880
at shorter and shorter distances and see
 

3099
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,430
at shorter and shorter distances and see
if there were extra dimensions at those

3100
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
if there were extra dimensions at those
 

3101
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,950
if there were extra dimensions at those
distance scales you would start to see

3102
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
distance scales you would start to see
 

3103
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,589
distance scales you would start to see
the inverse square law fail and um so

3104
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:37,599
the inverse square law fail and um so
 

3105
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:39,589
the inverse square law fail and um so
people look for that and again you don't

3106
00:50:39,589 --> 00:50:39,599
people look for that and again you don't
 

3107
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:41,270
people look for that and again you don't
see it but

3108
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:41,280
see it but
 

3109
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,549
see it but
you can i mean there's all sorts of

3110
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:42,559
you can i mean there's all sorts of
 

3111
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,309
you can i mean there's all sorts of
experiments of this kind you can you can

3112
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:44,319
experiments of this kind you can you can
 

3113
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,470
experiments of this kind you can you can
imagine which test

3114
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
imagine which test
 

3115
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,470
imagine which test
for effects of extra dimensions at

3116
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
for effects of extra dimensions at
 

3117
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,510
for effects of extra dimensions at
different at

3118
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,520
different at
 

3119
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,430
different at
different distance scales but

3120
00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:51,440
different distance scales but
 

3121
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,589
different distance scales but
you know none of them

3122
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
you know none of them
 

3123
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,109
you know none of them
i mean they they all just don't work

3124
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
i mean they they all just don't work
 

3125
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,870
i mean they they all just don't work
nothing yet i think yeah but you could

3126
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
nothing yet i think yeah but you could
 

3127
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,270
nothing yet i think yeah but you could
say ah but it it's if it's just it's

3128
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
say ah but it it's if it's just it's
 

3129
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,950
say ah but it it's if it's just it's
just much much smaller you can say that

3130
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:04,960
just much much smaller you can say that
 

3131
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:07,589
just much much smaller you can say that

what do you make of him and his work on
 

3147
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,230
what do you make of him and his work on
string theory

3148

string theory
 

3149
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,670

00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
well i think you know he's a truly
 

3151
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,990
well i think you know he's a truly
remarkable figure i've

you know had the pleasure of meeting him

3154
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
you know had the pleasure of meeting him
 

3155
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,750
you know had the pleasure of meeting him
first when he was a postdoc and um i

3156
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:31,760
first when he was a postdoc and um i
 

3157
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,790
first when he was a postdoc and um i
mean he's a

3158
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:32,800
mean he's a
 

3159
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,990
mean he's a
just completely

3160
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
just completely
 

3161
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,829
just completely
amazing um mathematician and physicist

3162
00:51:37,829 --> 00:51:37,839
amazing um mathematician and physicist
 

3163
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:40,309
amazing um mathematician and physicist
and uh you know he's

3164
00:51:40,309 --> 00:51:40,319
and uh you know he's
 

3165
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:42,230
and uh you know he's
quite a bit smarter than just about

3166
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:42,240
quite a bit smarter than just about
 

3167
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:43,589
quite a bit smarter than just about
about any of the rest of us and also

3168
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:43,599
about any of the rest of us and also
 

3169
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,510
about any of the rest of us and also
more hard working and it's a it's a kind

3170
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:45,520
more hard working and it's a it's a kind
 

3171
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,030
more hard working and it's a it's a kind
of frightening combination to see how

3172
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
of frightening combination to see how
 

3173
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,069
of frightening combination to see how
much he's

3174
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:48,079
much he's
 

3175
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:49,349
much he's
been able to do

3176
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
been able to do
 

3177
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,430
been able to do
and um but i would actually argue that

3178
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:51,440
and um but i would actually argue that
 

3179
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,510
and um but i would actually argue that
you know his his greatest work the

3180
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:53,520
you know his his greatest work the
 

3181
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,589
you know his his greatest work the
things that he's done that have been of

3182
00:51:55,589 --> 00:51:55,599
things that he's done that have been of
 

3183
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:57,510
things that he's done that have been of
just this mind-blowing significance of

3184
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
just this mind-blowing significance of
 

3185
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,190
just this mind-blowing significance of
giving us i mean he's completely

3186
00:51:59,190 --> 00:51:59,200
giving us i mean he's completely
 

3187
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,910
giving us i mean he's completely
revolutionized some areas of mathematics

3188
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:01,920
revolutionized some areas of mathematics
 

3189
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,589
revolutionized some areas of mathematics
he's totally revolutionized the way we

3190
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:03,599
he's totally revolutionized the way we
 

3191
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,950
he's totally revolutionized the way we
understand the relations between

3192
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:04,960
understand the relations between
 

3193
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,030
understand the relations between
mathematics and physics

3194
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:07,040
mathematics and physics
 

3195
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,510
mathematics and physics
and most of those

3196
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:09,520
and most of those
 

3197
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,589
and most of those
his greatest work is is stuff that

3198
00:52:11,589 --> 00:52:11,599
his greatest work is is stuff that
 

3199
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,750
his greatest work is is stuff that
doesn't have has little or nothing to do

3200
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:13,760
doesn't have has little or nothing to do
 

3201
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,069
doesn't have has little or nothing to do
with string theory i mean for instance

3202
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:16,079
with string theory i mean for instance
 

3203
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:17,190
with string theory i mean for instance
he um

3204
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:17,200
he um
 

3205
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,470
he um
you know he so he was actually one of

3206
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:18,480
you know he so he was actually one of
 

3207
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,230
you know he so he was actually one of
fields the very strange thing about him

3208
00:52:20,230 --> 00:52:20,240
fields the very strange thing about him
 

3209
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,150
fields the very strange thing about him
in some sense is that he um

3210
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
in some sense is that he um
 

3211
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,309
in some sense is that he um
he doesn't have a nobel prize so there

3212
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319
he doesn't have a nobel prize so there
 

3213
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:25,670
he doesn't have a nobel prize so there
there's a very large number of people

3214
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
there's a very large number of people
 

3215
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,549
there's a very large number of people
who are

3216
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
who are
 

3217
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,710
who are
nowhere near as smart as he is when

3218
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:28,720
nowhere near as smart as he is when
 

3219
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,069
nowhere near as smart as he is when
don't work anywhere near as hard who

3220
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:30,079
don't work anywhere near as hard who
 

3221
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,309
don't work anywhere near as hard who
have nobel prizes i think he just had

3222
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:32,319
have nobel prizes i think he just had
 

3223
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:33,750
have nobel prizes i think he just had
the misfortune of

3224
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
the misfortune of
 

3225
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,829
the misfortune of
coming into the field at a time when

3226
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:35,839
coming into the field at a time when
 

3227
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,589
coming into the field at a time when
things had gotten much much much tougher

3228
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:37,599
things had gotten much much much tougher
 

3229
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,990
things had gotten much much much tougher
and nobody really had

3230
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
and nobody really had
 

3231
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,910
and nobody really had
no matter how smart you were it was very

3232
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:41,920
no matter how smart you were it was very
 

3233
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,150
no matter how smart you were it was very
hard to come up with a new idea that was

3234
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,160
hard to come up with a new idea that was
 

3235
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,069
hard to come up with a new idea that was
going to work physically and get you a

3236
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
going to work physically and get you a
 

3237
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,510
going to work physically and get you a
nobel prize

3238
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:47,520
nobel prize
 

3239
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,990
nobel prize
but he but he um you know he he got a

3240
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,000
but he but he um you know he he got a
 

3241
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,910
but he but he um you know he he got a
fields medal for

3242
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:51,920
fields medal for
 

3243
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,750
fields medal for

mathematics and that's just completely
 

3247
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,190

kind of came together in 1973 pretty

3278
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
kind of came together in 1973 pretty
 

3279
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,470
kind of came together in 1973 pretty
much

3280
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
much
 

3281
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,790
much
and post and so and and all of the

3282
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
and post and so and and all of the
 

3283
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,870
and post and so and and all of the
people who kind of were involved in that

3284
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
people who kind of were involved in that
 

3285
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,630
people who kind of were involved in that
coming together you know many of them

3286
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
coming together you know many of them
 

3287
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,950
coming together you know many of them
ended up with nobel prizes for that but

3288
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:38,960
ended up with nobel prizes for that but
 

3289
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,190
ended up with nobel prizes for that but
but if you look

3290
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
but if you look
 

3291
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,990
but if you look
post 1973 pretty much it it's a little

3292
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:44,000
post 1973 pretty much it it's a little
 

3293
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,390
post 1973 pretty much it it's a little
bit more there's some

3294
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:46,400
bit more there's some
 

3295
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,150
bit more there's some
edge cases if you like but the if you

3296
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
edge cases if you like but the if you
 

3297
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,670
edge cases if you like but the if you
look post 1973 at what people have done

3298
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:51,680
look post 1973 at what people have done
 

3299
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,750
look post 1973 at what people have done
to try to do better than the standard

3300
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
to try to do better than the standard
 

3301
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:56,069
to try to do better than the standard
model and to get a better unified theory

3302
00:53:56,069 --> 00:53:56,079
model and to get a better unified theory
 

3303
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,990
model and to get a better unified theory
it really hasn't it's been too hard a

3304
00:53:57,990 --> 00:53:58,000
it really hasn't it's been too hard a
 

3305
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,349
it really hasn't it's been too hard a
problem it hasn't worked the theory is

3306
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359
problem it hasn't worked the theory is
 

3307
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,589
problem it hasn't worked the theory is
too good and so it's not that other

3308
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
too good and so it's not that other
 

3309
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:02,630
too good and so it's not that other
people

3310
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:02,640
people
 

3311
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,510
people
went out there and did and did it and uh

3312
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
went out there and did and did it and uh
 

3313
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,190
went out there and did and did it and uh
not him and that they got nobel prizes

3314
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:07,200
not him and that they got nobel prizes
 

3315
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,870
not him and that they got nobel prizes
for doing it is that no one really the

3316
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:08,880
for doing it is that no one really the
 

3317
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,309
for doing it is that no one really the
kind of thing he's been trying to do

3318
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:10,319
kind of thing he's been trying to do
 

3319
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,549
kind of thing he's been trying to do
with string theory is not um no one has

3320
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:12,559
with string theory is not um no one has
 

3321
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:15,349
with string theory is not um no one has
been able to do since 1973.

00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:16,640
is there something you can say about the
 

3325
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,150
is there something you can say about the

uh
 

3331
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,870
uh
yet people are striving to do more

talking about unification so on why

3334
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
talking about unification so on why

that's the big problem everybody talks

3360
00:54:51,829 --> 00:54:51,839
that's the big problem everybody talks
 

3361
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:53,430
that's the big problem everybody talks
about um

3362
00:54:53,430 --> 00:54:53,440
about um
 

3363
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,230
about um
i mean

3364
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
i mean
 

3365
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,750
i mean
but but it's also true that if you look

3366
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:55,760
but but it's also true that if you look
 

3367
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,589
but but it's also true that if you look
at the standard model it has these very

3368
00:54:57,589 --> 00:54:57,599
at the standard model it has these very
 

3369
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,150
at the standard model it has these very
very deep beautiful ideas but

3370
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
very deep beautiful ideas but
 

3371
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,829
very deep beautiful ideas but
there's certain aspects of it that are

00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
there's certain aspects of it that are

3375
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:07,430

let's just say that they're not

00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
let's just say that they're not
 

3377
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,670
let's just say that they're not
beautiful they're not um

3378
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
beautiful they're not um
 

3379
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:11,430
beautiful they're not um
you have to to make the thing work you

3380
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
you have to to make the thing work you
 

3381
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:12,549
you have to to make the thing work you
have to throw in

3382
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
have to throw in
 

3383
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,150
have to throw in
lots and lots of extra parameters at

3384
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
lots and lots of extra parameters at
 

3385
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,510
lots and lots of extra parameters at
various points

3386

various points
 

3387
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,589
various points
um and a lot of this has to do with the

3388
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
um and a lot of this has to do with the
 

3389
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,109
um and a lot of this has to do with the
so-called uh

3390
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
so-called uh
 

3391
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:20,549
so-called uh
you know the so-called higgs mechanism

3392
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
you know the so-called higgs mechanism
 

3393
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,950
you know the so-called higgs mechanism
in the higgs field that if you look at

3394
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
in the higgs field that if you look at
 

3395
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,870
in the higgs field that if you look at
the theory it's

3396
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:24,880
the theory it's
 

3397
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,549
the theory it's
everything is if you forget about the

3398
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:26,559
everything is if you forget about the
 

3399
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,710
everything is if you forget about the
higgs field and what it needs to do

3400
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
higgs field and what it needs to do
 

3401
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,750
higgs field and what it needs to do
the rest of the theory is

the rest of the theory is

the rest of the theory is
is very very constrained and has very

is very very constrained and has very

is very very constrained and has very
very few free parameters really a very

small number there's a very small number
 

3409
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,870
small number there's a very small number
of parameters and a few integers which

00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
of parameters and a few integers which
 

3411
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,710
of parameters and a few integers which
tell you what the theory is

3412
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:40,720
tell you what the theory is

00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:42,150
tell you what the theory is
to make this work as a theory of the

to make this work as a theory of the
 

3415
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,150
to make this work as a theory of the
real world you need a higgs field and

00:55:44,150 --> 00:55:44,160
real world you need a higgs field and

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,270
real world you need a higgs field and
you need to

3418
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:45,280
you need to

00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:46,710
you need to
it needs to do

it needs to do

it needs to do
to do something and

00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
to do something and
 

3423
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:50,870
to do something and
once you introduce that higgs field all

3424
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
once you introduce that higgs field all
 

3425
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,789
once you introduce that higgs field all
sorts of parameters

00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:55,750

um make an appearance so now we've got

3428
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:55,760
um make an appearance so now we've got
 

3429
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,549
um make an appearance so now we've got
20 or 30 or whatever whatever parameters

3430
00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
20 or 30 or whatever whatever parameters
 

3431
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,670
20 or 30 or whatever whatever parameters
that are going to tell you what all the

3432
00:55:59,670 --> 00:55:59,680
that are going to tell you what all the
 

3433
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,190
that are going to tell you what all the
masses of things are and what's going to

00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:01,200
masses of things are and what's going to
 

3435
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,990
masses of things are and what's going to
happen so you've gone from

3436
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
happen so you've gone from
 

3437
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,510
happen so you've gone from
a very tightly constrained thing with a

00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
a very tightly constrained thing with a
 

3439
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,069
a very tightly constrained thing with a
couple parameters to uh

3440
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
couple parameters to uh
 

3441
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,630
couple parameters to uh
this this thing which the minute you put

3442
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:10,640
this this thing which the minute you put
 

3443
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,950
this this thing which the minute you put
it in you had to add all this extra

3444
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
it in you had to add all this extra
 

3445
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,230
it in you had to add all this extra
all these extra parameters to make

3446
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:14,240
all these extra parameters to make
 

3447
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,750
all these extra parameters to make
things work and so that

3448
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
things work and so that
 

3449
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,109
things work and so that
it may be one argument as well that's

3450
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,119
it may be one argument as well that's
 

3451
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,589
it may be one argument as well that's
just the way the world is and

3452
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
just the way the world is and
 

3453
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:23,109
just the way the world is and
the fact that you don't find that

3454
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119
the fact that you don't find that
 

3455
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,470
the fact that you don't find that
aesthetically pleasing is just your

this is just telling us that there's

this is just telling us that there's

00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,069
this is just telling us that there's

something we don't understand about

something we don't understand about
what's going on in a deeper way which

what's going on in a deeper way which
would explain those numbers and there's

some kind of

deeper idea about where the higgs field

that's

that's
that's what we should look for but to

that's what we should look for but to
 

3487
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:54,789
that's what we should look for but to
stick on string theory a little bit

stick on string theory a little bit
 

3489

3529
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,510

3533
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,510

this is just such a fruitful and

3534
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:37,520
this is just such a fruitful and
 

3535
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,390
this is just such a fruitful and
inspiring idea and it's led to so many

3536
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,400
inspiring idea and it's led to so many
 

3537
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,750
inspiring idea and it's led to so many
other different things coming out of it

3538
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
other different things coming out of it
 

3539
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,510
other different things coming out of it
that you know there must be something

3540
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:43,520
that you know there must be something
 

3541
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:45,030
that you know there must be something
right about this

3542
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:45,040
right about this
 

3543
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:47,510
right about this
and um yeah that's you know okay that

3544
00:57:47,510 --> 00:57:47,520
and um yeah that's you know okay that
 

3545
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,870
and um yeah that's you know okay that
anyway i think that that's probably the

3546
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:48,880
anyway i think that that's probably the
 

3547
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,950
anyway i think that that's probably the
strong the strongest thing that they

3548
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:50,960
strong the strongest thing that they
 

3549
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:53,270
strong the strongest thing that they
that that they've got um but you you

3550
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
that that they've got um but you you
 

3551
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,789
that that they've got um but you you
don't think there's

3552
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:54,799
don't think there's
 

3553
00:57:54,799 --> 00:57:57,349
don't think there's
aspects to it that could be uh

3554
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:57,359
aspects to it that could be uh
 

3555
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:00,470
aspects to it that could be uh

00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,589
everything like it could it may not be
exactly um

3562
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
exactly um
 

3563
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,470
exactly um
uh exactly the theory but uh sticking on

3564
00:58:10,470 --> 00:58:10,480
uh exactly the theory but uh sticking on
 

3565
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,630
uh exactly the theory but uh sticking on
it longer might get us closer to the

3566
00:58:12,630 --> 00:58:12,640
it longer might get us closer to the
 

3567
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:14,150
it longer might get us closer to the
theory of everything

3568
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:14,160
theory of everything
 

3569
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,670
theory of everything
well the problem now really is that you

3570
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:15,680
well the problem now really is that you
 

3571
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,589
well the problem now really is that you
really don't know what it is now you've

3572
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:17,599
really don't know what it is now you've
 

3573
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:19,670
really don't know what it is now you've
never nobody has ever kind of come up

3574
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:19,680
never nobody has ever kind of come up
 

3575
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,470
never nobody has ever kind of come up
with this non-perturbative

3576
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:22,480
with this non-perturbative
 

3577
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,470
with this non-perturbative
theory so there

3578
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:24,480
theory so there
 

3579
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:26,710
theory so there
it's become more and more

3580
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:26,720
it's become more and more
 

3581
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,789
it's become more and more
frustrating and an odd activity to try

3582
00:58:28,789 --> 00:58:28,799
frustrating and an odd activity to try
 

3583
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,950
frustrating and an odd activity to try
to argue with the string theorists about

3584
00:58:30,950 --> 00:58:30,960
to argue with the string theorists about
 

3585
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,910
to argue with the string theorists about
string theory because it's become

3586
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
string theory because it's become
 

3587
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,510
string theory because it's become
less and less well-defined what what

3588
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:35,520
less and less well-defined what what
 

3589
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,109
less and less well-defined what what
what it is

3590
00:58:37,109 --> 00:58:37,119
what it is
 

3591
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,190
what it is
and it's become actually more and more

3592
00:58:39,190 --> 00:58:39,200
and it's become actually more and more
 

3593
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,789
and it's become actually more and more
kind of uh whether

3594
00:58:40,789 --> 00:58:40,799
kind of uh whether
 

3595
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:42,549
kind of uh whether
you have this weird phenomenon of people

3596
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:42,559
you have this weird phenomenon of people
 

3597
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,630
you have this weird phenomenon of people
calling themselves string theorists

3598
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:44,640
calling themselves string theorists
 

3599
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,630
calling themselves string theorists
when they've never actually worked on

3600
00:58:46,630 --> 00:58:46,640
when they've never actually worked on
 

3601
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,230
when they've never actually worked on
any theory were there any strings

3602
00:58:48,230 --> 00:58:48,240
any theory were there any strings
 

3603
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,430
any theory were there any strings
anywhere

3604
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
anywhere
 

3605
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,510
anywhere
so what has actually happened kind of

3606
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:51,520
so what has actually happened kind of
 

3607
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,670
so what has actually happened kind of
sociologically is that

3608
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,680
sociologically is that
 

3609
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,950
sociologically is that
you started out with this fairly

3610
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:54,960
you started out with this fairly
 

3611
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,510
you started out with this fairly
well-defined proposal and then

3612
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:57,520
well-defined proposal and then
 

3613
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,030
well-defined proposal and then
i would argue because that didn't work

3614
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
i would argue because that didn't work
 

3615
00:58:59,040 --> 00:58:59,990
i would argue because that didn't work
people and

3616
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:00,000
people and
 

3617
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,589
people and
branched out in all sorts of directions

3618
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:01,599
branched out in all sorts of directions
 

3619
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,109
branched out in all sorts of directions
doing all sorts of things it became

3620
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
doing all sorts of things it became
 

3621
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,430
doing all sorts of things it became
farther and farther removed from that

3622
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:05,440
farther and farther removed from that
 

3623
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,150
farther and farther removed from that
and for sociological reasons the ones

3624
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:08,160
and for sociological reasons the ones
 

3625
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,270
and for sociological reasons the ones
who kind of

3626
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,280
who kind of
 

3627
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,510
who kind of
started out

3628
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:11,520
started out
 

3629
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,069
started out
or now or or were trained by the people

3630
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:14,079
or now or or were trained by the people
 

3631
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:16,390
or now or or were trained by the people
who worked on that have now

3632
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
who worked on that have now
 

3633
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,030
who worked on that have now
become this string string theorist and

3634
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:19,040
become this string string theorist and
 

3635
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:20,230
become this string string theorist and
um

3636
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:20,240
um
 

3637
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:21,030
um
and

3638
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
and
 

3639
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,950
and
but but but it's become

3640
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:22,960
but but but it's become
 

3641
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,030
but but but it's become
almost more kind of a tribal denominator

3642
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:25,040
almost more kind of a tribal denominator
 

3643
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,549
almost more kind of a tribal denominator
than a um

3644
00:59:26,549 --> 00:59:26,559
than a um
 

3645
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,150
than a um
i think so it's very hard to know what

3646
00:59:28,150 --> 00:59:28,160
i think so it's very hard to know what
 

3647
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,430
i think so it's very hard to know what
you're arguing about when you're arguing

3648
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:29,440
you're arguing about when you're arguing
 

3649
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,870
you're arguing about when you're arguing
about string theory these days well to

3650
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:30,880
about string theory these days well to
 

3651
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,230
about string theory these days well to
push back on that a little bit i mean

3652
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:32,240
push back on that a little bit i mean
 

3653
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,470
push back on that a little bit i mean
string theory it's just a term right it

3654
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:34,480
string theory it's just a term right it
 

3655
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,349
string theory it's just a term right it
doesn't

3656
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:35,359
doesn't
 

3657
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,589
doesn't
like you could uh like this is the way

3658
00:59:37,589 --> 00:59:37,599
like you could uh like this is the way
 

3659
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,589
like you could uh like this is the way
language evolves

3660
00:59:39,589 --> 00:59:39,599
language evolves
 

3661
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,270
language evolves
is it could start to represent something

3662
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:41,280
is it could start to represent something
 

3663
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,870
is it could start to represent something
more than just the theory that involves

3664
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:42,880
more than just the theory that involves
 

3665
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:45,750
more than just the theory that involves
strings it could represent the uh the

3666
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:45,760
strings it could represent the uh the
 

3667
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,030
strings it could represent the uh the
effort

3668
00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:47,040
effort
 

3669
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,150
effort
to unify the laws of physics right yeah

3670
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,160
to unify the laws of physics right yeah
 

3671
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,870
to unify the laws of physics right yeah
and uh at high dimensions with these

3672
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:52,880
and uh at high dimensions with these
 

3673
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,030
and uh at high dimensions with these
super tiny objects right or something

3674
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,040
super tiny objects right or something
 

3675
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:55,910
super tiny objects right or something
like that

3676
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
like that
 

3677
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,630
like that
i mean we can sort of uh put string

3678
00:59:58,630 --> 00:59:58,640
i mean we can sort of uh put string
 

3679
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,150
i mean we can sort of uh put string
theory aside so for example neural

3680
01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:00,160
theory aside so for example neural
 

3681
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:01,589
theory aside so for example neural
networks in the space of machine

3682
01:00:01,589 --> 01:00:01,599
networks in the space of machine
 

3683
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,630
networks in the space of machine
learning

3684
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
learning
 

3685
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,750
learning
there was a

3686
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:03,760
there was a
 

3687
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,349
there was a
time when they were extremely popular

3688
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:05,359
time when they were extremely popular
 

3689
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:07,270
time when they were extremely popular
they became much much less popular to a

3690
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
they became much much less popular to a
 

3691
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,470
they became much much less popular to a
point where if you mentioned you'll

3692
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:08,480
point where if you mentioned you'll
 

3693
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,390
point where if you mentioned you'll
never gain no funding

3694
01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:10,400
never gain no funding
 

3695
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,470
never gain no funding
and uh you're not going to be respected

3696
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:12,480
and uh you're not going to be respected
 

3697
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,630
and uh you're not going to be respected
at conferences and then once again

3698
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
at conferences and then once again
 

3699
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,270
at conferences and then once again
uh you know networks became all the all

3700
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,280
uh you know networks became all the all
 

3701
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,030
uh you know networks became all the all
the rage about 10 15 years ago and as it

3702
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:21,040
the rage about 10 15 years ago and as it
 

3703
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,950
the rage about 10 15 years ago and as it
goes up and down and a lot of people

3704
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
goes up and down and a lot of people
 

3705
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:25,670
goes up and down and a lot of people
would argue that uh using terminology

3706
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
would argue that uh using terminology
 

3707
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,349
would argue that uh using terminology
like machine learning and deep learning

3708
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
like machine learning and deep learning
 

3709
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,030
like machine learning and deep learning
is um

3710
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:29,040
is um
 

3711
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:29,829
is um
is

3712
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:29,839
is
 

3713
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,109
is
you know often misused over general

3714
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
you know often misused over general
 

3715
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,710
you know often misused over general
you know everything that works is deep

3716
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:34,720
you know everything that works is deep
 

3717
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,789
you know everything that works is deep
learning everything that doesn't isn't

3718
01:00:36,789 --> 01:00:36,799
learning everything that doesn't isn't
 

3719
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,309
learning everything that doesn't isn't
yeah something like that you know that's

3720
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
yeah something like that you know that's
 

3721
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:39,990
yeah something like that you know that's
just the way uh

3722
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:40,000
just the way uh
 

3723
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,789
just the way uh
again we're back to sociological things

3724
01:00:42,789 --> 01:00:42,799
again we're back to sociological things
 

3725
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:45,109
again we're back to sociological things
but i guess what i'm trying to get at is

3726
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
but i guess what i'm trying to get at is
 

3727
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,670
but i guess what i'm trying to get at is
if if we leave the sociological mess

3728
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
if if we leave the sociological mess
 

3729
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,910
if if we leave the sociological mess
aside

3730
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
aside
 

3731
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,390
aside
uh do we throw out the baby with the

3732
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:52,400
uh do we throw out the baby with the
 

3733
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,390
uh do we throw out the baby with the
bath water is there some

3734
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
bath water is there some
 

3735
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,950
bath water is there some
besides the side effects of nice ideas

3736
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:56,960
besides the side effects of nice ideas
 

3737
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,109
besides the side effects of nice ideas
from the edwins of the world

3738
01:00:59,109 --> 01:00:59,119
from the edwins of the world
 

3739
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:01,750
from the edwins of the world
is there some core truths there

3740
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:01,760
is there some core truths there
 

3741
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,150
is there some core truths there
that we should stick by

3742
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:04,160
that we should stick by
 

3743
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,710
that we should stick by

beautiful mess of a space that we call

01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
beautiful mess of a space that we call
 

3747
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,470
beautiful mess of a space that we call
string theory that people call string

3748
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:10,480
string theory that people call string
 

3749
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,270
string theory that people call string
theory

3750
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:11,280
theory
 

3751
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,750
theory
you're right it is kind of a common

3752
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:13,760
you're right it is kind of a common
 

3753
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,309
you're right it is kind of a common
problem that you know how what your what

3754
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
problem that you know how what your what
 

3755
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,230
problem that you know how what your what
you call some field

3756
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
you call some field
 

3757
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,630
you call some field
changes and evolves in

3758
01:01:20,630 --> 01:01:20,640
changes and evolves in
 

3759
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,549
changes and evolves in
interesting ways as the field changes

3760
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:22,559
interesting ways as the field changes
 

3761
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,910
interesting ways as the field changes
but

3762
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:23,920
but
 

3763
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,829
but
i mean

3764
01:01:25,829 --> 01:01:25,839
i mean
 

3765
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:26,950
i mean
i guess

3766
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:26,960
i guess
 

3767
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,789
i guess
what i would argue is the you know the

3768
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:28,799
what i would argue is the you know the
 

3769
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,309
what i would argue is the you know the
initial understanding of string theory

3770
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:30,319
initial understanding of string theory
 

3771
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:31,910
initial understanding of string theory
that was quite specific we're talking

3772
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
that was quite specific we're talking
 

3773
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,750
that was quite specific we're talking
about a specific idea 10-dimensional

3774
01:01:33,750 --> 01:01:33,760
about a specific idea 10-dimensional
 

3775
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,670
about a specific idea 10-dimensional
super strings compactified in six

3776
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
super strings compactified in six
 

3777
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,829
super strings compactified in six
dimensions

3778
01:01:37,829 --> 01:01:37,839
dimensions
 

3779
01:01:37,839 --> 01:01:39,670
dimensions
to my mind the

3780
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
to my mind the
 

3781
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,190
to my mind the
the really bad thing that's happened to

3782
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:41,200
the really bad thing that's happened to
 

3783
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:42,950
the really bad thing that's happened to
the subject is that

3784
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
the subject is that
 

3785
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,750
the subject is that
you it's hard to get people to admit at

3786
01:01:45,750 --> 01:01:45,760
you it's hard to get people to admit at
 

3787
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,910
you it's hard to get people to admit at
least publicly that that was a failure

3788
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:47,920
least publicly that that was a failure
 

3789
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:49,670
least publicly that that was a failure
that this really didn't work

3790
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:49,680
that this really didn't work
 

3791
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,710
that this really didn't work
and so

3792
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
and so
 

3793
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,390
and so
the fact facto what people do is people

3794
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:52,400
the fact facto what people do is people
 

3795
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,670
the fact facto what people do is people
stop doing that and they start doing

3796
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
stop doing that and they start doing
 

3797
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,990
stop doing that and they start doing
more interesting things but they keep

3798
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
more interesting things but they keep
 

3799
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,430
more interesting things but they keep
telling talking to the public about

3800
01:01:59,430 --> 01:01:59,440
telling talking to the public about
 

3801
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,670
telling talking to the public about
about string theory and

3802
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:01,680
about string theory and
 

3803
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,589
about string theory and
referring back to that idea and using

3804
01:02:03,589 --> 01:02:03,599
referring back to that idea and using
 

3805
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:05,270
referring back to that idea and using
that as kind of the starting point and

3806
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
that as kind of the starting point and
 

3807
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,190
that as kind of the starting point and
this kind of the

3808
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,200
this kind of the
 

3809
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,270
this kind of the
the place where the

3810
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
the place where the
 

3811
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,309
the place where the
the whole

3812
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
the whole
 

3813
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:11,670
the whole
where the whole tribe starts and

3814
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:11,680
where the whole tribe starts and
 

3815
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,670
where the whole tribe starts and
everything else comes from and so the

3816
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:13,680
everything else comes from and so the
 

3817
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,710
everything else comes from and so the
problem with this is that having as your

3818
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
problem with this is that having as your
 

3819
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,630
problem with this is that having as your
as your initial name and what what

3820
01:02:18,630 --> 01:02:18,640
as your initial name and what what
 

3821
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:20,470
as your initial name and what what
everything points back to

3822
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:20,480
everything points back to
 

3823
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,230
everything points back to
something which

3824
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
something which
 

3825
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:23,750
something which
um

3826
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:23,760
um
 

3827
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,309
um
which really didn't work out it kind of

3828
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:26,319
which really didn't work out it kind of
 

3829
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:28,390
which really didn't work out it kind of
makes everybody makes everything you've

3830
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:28,400
makes everybody makes everything you've
 

3831
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,150
makes everybody makes everything you've
created this potentially very very

3832
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
created this potentially very very
 

3833
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,270
created this potentially very very
interesting field with interesting

3834
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
interesting field with interesting
 

3835
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,870
interesting field with interesting
things happening but

3836
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
things happening but
 

3837
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,670
things happening but
you know

3838
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:33,680
you know
 

3839
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,390
you know
people

3840
01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:34,400
people
 

3841
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:35,670
people
in

3842
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
in
 

3843
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,270
in
graduate school take courses on string

3844
01:02:37,270 --> 01:02:37,280
graduate school take courses on string
 

3845
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:38,950
graduate school take courses on string
theory and everything kind of and this

3846
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
theory and everything kind of and this
 

3847
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,390
theory and everything kind of and this
is what you tell the public in which you

3848
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
is what you tell the public in which you
 

3849
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,750
is what you tell the public in which you
continually pointing back so you're

3850
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760
continually pointing back so you're
 

3851
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,349
continually pointing back so you're
continually pointing back to this idea

3852
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
continually pointing back to this idea
 

3853
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,390
continually pointing back to this idea
which never worked out as you're

3854
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
which never worked out as you're
 

3855
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,670
which never worked out as you're
guiding

3856
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:47,680
guiding
 

3857
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,750
guiding
inspiration and it really kind of

3858
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:49,760
inspiration and it really kind of
 

3859
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,309
inspiration and it really kind of
deforms the whole your whole way of um

3860
01:02:52,309 --> 01:02:52,319
deforms the whole your whole way of um
 

3861
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,789
deforms the whole your whole way of um
your your hopes of making progress and

3862
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
your your hopes of making progress and
 

3863
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:56,710
your your hopes of making progress and
that's to me i think you know the kind

3864
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
that's to me i think you know the kind
 

3865
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,710
that's to me i think you know the kind
of worst thing that has happened in this

3866
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
of worst thing that has happened in this
 

3867
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,230
of worst thing that has happened in this
field okay so there's a lack of

3868
01:03:00,230 --> 01:03:00,240
field okay so there's a lack of
 

3869
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:02,390
field okay so there's a lack of
transparency and sort of authenticity

3870
01:03:02,390 --> 01:03:02,400
transparency and sort of authenticity
 

3871
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,390
transparency and sort of authenticity
about communicating the things that

3872
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:04,400
about communicating the things that
 

3873
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,430
about communicating the things that
failed

3874
01:03:05,430 --> 01:03:05,440
failed
 

3875
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,829
failed
uh in the past and so you don't have a

3876
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
uh in the past and so you don't have a
 

3877
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,750
uh in the past and so you don't have a
clear picture of

3878
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
clear picture of
 

3879
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,990
clear picture of
like firm ground that you're standing on

3880
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:12,000
like firm ground that you're standing on
 

3881
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,910
like firm ground that you're standing on
again those are sociological things and

3882
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:13,920
again those are sociological things and
 

3883
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,950
again those are sociological things and
yeah

3884
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:14,960
yeah
 

3885
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,109
yeah
i i

3886
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:17,119
i i
 

3887
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:18,309
i i
there's a bunch of questions i want to

3888
01:03:18,309 --> 01:03:18,319
there's a bunch of questions i want to
 

3889
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:20,390
there's a bunch of questions i want to
ask you so one

3890
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
ask you so one
 

3891
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,670
ask you so one
what's your intuition about

3892
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:23,680
what's your intuition about
 

3893
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:24,470
what's your intuition about
um

3894
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:24,480
um
 

3895
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,270
um
why the original idea failed so what can

3896
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:27,280
why the original idea failed so what can
 

3897
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,630
why the original idea failed so what can
you say about

3898
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:28,640
you say about
 

3899
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:32,309
you say about
why you're pretty sure has it has failed

3900
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:32,319
why you're pretty sure has it has failed
 

3901
01:03:32,319 --> 01:03:34,549
why you're pretty sure has it has failed
you know and the initial idea was as i

3902
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:34,559
you know and the initial idea was as i
 

3903
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:35,990
you know and the initial idea was as i
tried to explain it it was quite

3904
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
tried to explain it it was quite
 

3905
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,150
tried to explain it it was quite
seductive in that that you you could see

3906
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
seductive in that that you you could see
 

3907
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,309
seductive in that that you you could see
why whitton and others got excited by it

3908
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:40,319
why whitton and others got excited by it
 

3909
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,150
why whitton and others got excited by it
it was um

3910
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,160
it was um
 

3911
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,349
it was um
you know

3912
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
you know
 

3913
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,549
you know
at the time it looked like there were

3914
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
at the time it looked like there were
 

3915
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,950
at the time it looked like there were
only a few these possible claudios that

3916
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:46,960
only a few these possible claudios that
 

3917
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,950
only a few these possible claudios that
would work and it looked like okay we

3918
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:48,960
would work and it looked like okay we
 

3919
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,309
would work and it looked like okay we
just have to understand this very

3920
01:03:50,309 --> 01:03:50,319
just have to understand this very
 

3921
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:51,670
just have to understand this very
specific

3922
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:51,680
specific
 

3923
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,510
specific
model in these very specific six-special

3924
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
model in these very specific six-special
 

3925
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,589
model in these very specific six-special
spaces and we're going to get everything

3926
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
spaces and we're going to get everything
 

3927
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,750
spaces and we're going to get everything
and so it was a very subjective idea but

3928
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:57,760
and so it was a very subjective idea but
 

3929
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,870
and so it was a very subjective idea but
it just

3930
01:03:58,870 --> 01:03:58,880
it just
 

3931
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:01,430
it just
you know as people

3932
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:01,440
you know as people
 

3933
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,270
you know as people
learn worked more and more about it it

3934
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:03,280
learn worked more and more about it it
 

3935
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:05,670
learn worked more and more about it it
just didn't um

3936
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:05,680
just didn't um
 

3937
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,950
just didn't um
they just kind of realized that they're

3938
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:06,960
they just kind of realized that they're
 

3939
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,150
they just kind of realized that they're
just more and more things you can do

3940
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:08,160
just more and more things you can do
 

3941
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,069
just more and more things you can do
with these six dimensions and you can't

3942
01:04:10,069 --> 01:04:10,079
with these six dimensions and you can't
 

3943
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,710
with these six dimensions and you can't
and this this is just not going to work

3944
01:04:12,710 --> 01:04:12,720
and this this is just not going to work
 

3945
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:15,270
and this this is just not going to work
meaning like it's

3946
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:15,280
meaning like it's
 

3947
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:16,710
meaning like it's
i mean

3948
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:16,720
i mean
 

3949
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,829
i mean
what was the failure um

3950
01:04:19,829 --> 01:04:19,839
what was the failure um
 

3951
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:22,789
what was the failure um
mode here is is you could just have an

3952
01:04:22,789 --> 01:04:22,799
mode here is is you could just have an
 

3953
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:24,150
mode here is is you could just have an
infinite number of possibilities that

3954
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:24,160
infinite number of possibilities that
 

3955
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,829
infinite number of possibilities that
you could do so it's you can come up

3956
01:04:25,829 --> 01:04:25,839
you could do so it's you can come up
 

3957
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:27,510
you could do so it's you can come up
with any theory you want you can fit

3958
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:27,520
with any theory you want you can fit
 

3959
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,510
with any theory you want you can fit
quantum mechanics you can

3960
01:04:29,510 --> 01:04:29,520
quantum mechanics you can
 

3961
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,109
quantum mechanics you can
you can explain gravity you can explain

3962
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
you can explain gravity you can explain
 

3963
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,029
you can explain gravity you can explain
anything you want with it right is that

3964
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
anything you want with it right is that
 

3965
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,710
anything you want with it right is that
the basic failure mode yeah so it's a

3966
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:34,720
the basic failure mode yeah so it's a
 

3967
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,029
the basic failure mode yeah so it's a
failure mode of kind of that this idea

3968
01:04:37,029 --> 01:04:37,039
failure mode of kind of that this idea
 

3969
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,309
failure mode of kind of that this idea
ended up

3970
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
ended up
 

3971
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:39,750
ended up
being kind of being essentially empty

3972
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:39,760
being kind of being essentially empty
 

3973
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,510
being kind of being essentially empty
that it it just didn't

3974
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:41,520
that it it just didn't
 

3975
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,109
that it it just didn't
doesn't ends up not telling you anything

3976
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
doesn't ends up not telling you anything
 

3977
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:45,029
doesn't ends up not telling you anything
because it's consistent with

3978
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
because it's consistent with
 

3979
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:47,190
because it's consistent with
just about just about anything

3980
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
just about just about anything
 

3981
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,270
just about just about anything
and so i mean there's a complex if you

3982
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:49,280
and so i mean there's a complex if you
 

3983
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,390
and so i mean there's a complex if you
try and

3984
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:50,400
try and
 

3985
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,910
try and
talk with strengtheners about this now i

3986
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
talk with strengtheners about this now i
 

3987
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:53,270
talk with strengtheners about this now i
mean there's a there's an argument

3988
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
mean there's a there's an argument
 

3989
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:54,870
mean there's a there's an argument
there's a long argument over this about

3990
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
there's a long argument over this about
 

3991
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,069
there's a long argument over this about
whether um

3992
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:56,079
whether um
 

3993
01:04:56,079 --> 01:04:57,029
whether um
you know

3994
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
you know
 

3995
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,870
you know
oh no no no maybe there still are

3996
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:58,880
oh no no no maybe there still are
 

3997
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:00,390
oh no no no maybe there still are
constraints coming coming out of this

3998
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:00,400
constraints coming coming out of this
 

3999
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,870
constraints coming coming out of this
idea or not and or maybe we live in a

4000
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:02,880
idea or not and or maybe we live in a
 

4001
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,470
idea or not and or maybe we live in a
multiverse and

4002
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
multiverse and
 

4003
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:07,349
multiverse and
you know everything is true anyway so

4004
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
you know everything is true anyway so
 

4005
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,029
you know everything is true anyway so
you can there are various ways you can

4006
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:09,039
you can there are various ways you can
 

4007
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:10,950
you can there are various ways you can
kind of the strength here as i kind of

4008
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
kind of the strength here as i kind of
 

4009
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,789
kind of the strength here as i kind of
react react to this kind of argument

4010
01:05:12,789 --> 01:05:12,799
react react to this kind of argument
 

4011
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:14,390
react react to this kind of argument
that i'm making but

4012
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
that i'm making but
 

4013
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,230
that i'm making but
try to hold on to it

4014
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:16,240
try to hold on to it
 

4015
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,950
try to hold on to it
um what about experimental validation is

4016
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
um what about experimental validation is
 

4017
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,390
um what about experimental validation is
that uh

4018
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
that uh
 

4019
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:22,710
that uh
is that a fair

4020
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
is that a fair
 

4021
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,430
is that a fair
standard to hold before

4022
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:25,440
standard to hold before
 

4023
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:26,789
standard to hold before
a theory of everything that's trying to

4024
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
a theory of everything that's trying to
 

4025
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,029
a theory of everything that's trying to
unify quantum mechanics and gravity yeah

4026
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:29,039
unify quantum mechanics and gravity yeah
 

4027
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,390
unify quantum mechanics and gravity yeah
i mean ultimately to be really convinced

4028
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:32,400
i mean ultimately to be really convinced
 

4029
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:35,109
i mean ultimately to be really convinced
that you know that on some new you know

4030
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
that you know that on some new you know
 

4031
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:36,710
that you know that on some new you know
idea but unification really works you

4032
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
idea but unification really works you
 

4033
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,950
idea but unification really works you
need some kind of uh you need to look at

4034
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
need some kind of uh you need to look at
 

4035
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,470
need some kind of uh you need to look at
the real world and see that this is

4036
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:40,480
the real world and see that this is
 

4037
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:43,109
the real world and see that this is
telling you something

4038
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:43,119
telling you something
 

4039
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:44,870
telling you something
something true about it i mean you know

4040
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:44,880
something true about it i mean you know
 

4041
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,589
something true about it i mean you know
either either

4042
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599

 

4043
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:49,190

telling you that if you do some

4044
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
telling you that if you do some
 

4045
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,789
telling you that if you do some
experiment and go out and do it you'll

4046
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
experiment and go out and do it you'll
 

4047
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:53,029
experiment and go out and do it you'll
get some unexpected result and

4048
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:53,039
get some unexpected result and
 

4049
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,349
get some unexpected result and
that's the kind of gold standard or it

4050
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:55,359
that's the kind of gold standard or it
 

4051
01:05:55,359 --> 01:05:56,549
that's the kind of gold standard or it
may be

4052
01:05:56,549 --> 01:05:56,559
may be
 

4053
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,309
may be
just that like all those numbers that

4054
01:05:58,309 --> 01:05:58,319
just that like all those numbers that
 

4055
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:00,150
just that like all those numbers that
are we don't know how to explain it it

4056
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:00,160
are we don't know how to explain it it
 

4057
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,150
are we don't know how to explain it it
will show you how to calculate them i

4058
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:02,160
will show you how to calculate them i
 

4059
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,069
will show you how to calculate them i
mean you can it can be various kinds of

4060
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:04,079
mean you can it can be various kinds of
 

4061
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,390
mean you can it can be various kinds of
experimental validation but that that's

4062
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:06,400
experimental validation but that that's
 

4063
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:07,670
experimental validation but that that's
certainly ideally what you're looking

4064
01:06:07,670 --> 01:06:07,680
certainly ideally what you're looking
 

4065
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,470
certainly ideally what you're looking
for

4066
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:08,480
for
 

4067
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,069
for
how tough is this do you think for a

4068
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:10,079
how tough is this do you think for a
 

4069
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:11,670
how tough is this do you think for a
theory of everything not just string

4070
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
theory of everything not just string
 

4071
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,750
theory of everything not just string
theory so for something that unifies

4072
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:13,760
theory so for something that unifies
 

4073
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,270
theory so for something that unifies
gravity in quantum mechanics so the the

4074
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:15,280
gravity in quantum mechanics so the the
 

4075
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,349
gravity in quantum mechanics so the the
very big and the very small

4076
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
very big and the very small
 

4077
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:18,950
very big and the very small
is this uh

4078
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
is this uh
 

4079
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,950
is this uh
let me ask it one way is is it a

4080
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:22,960
let me ask it one way is is it a
 

4081
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,750
let me ask it one way is is it a
physics problem a math problem or an

4082
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:25,760
physics problem a math problem or an
 

4083
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:28,069
physics problem a math problem or an
engineering problem

4084
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
engineering problem
 

4085
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,910
engineering problem
my guess is it's a combination of a

4086
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:29,920
my guess is it's a combination of a
 

4087
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,670
my guess is it's a combination of a
physics and a math problem that you

4088
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
physics and a math problem that you
 

4089
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,670
physics and a math problem that you
really need

4090
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:33,680
really need
 

4091
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:35,270
really need
it's it's not really interesting it's

4092
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
it's it's not really interesting it's
 

4093
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,589
it's it's not really interesting it's
not like there's some kind of

4094
01:06:37,589 --> 01:06:37,599
not like there's some kind of
 

4095
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,270
not like there's some kind of
well-defined thing you can write down

4096
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:39,280
well-defined thing you can write down
 

4097
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,029
well-defined thing you can write down
and we just don't have enough computer

4098
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:41,039
and we just don't have enough computer
 

4099
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:43,510
and we just don't have enough computer
power to do the calculation that's not

4100
01:06:43,510 --> 01:06:43,520
power to do the calculation that's not
 

4101
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:46,069
power to do the calculation that's not
the kind of problem it is at all

4102
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:46,079
the kind of problem it is at all
 

4103
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,829
the kind of problem it is at all
but the question is you know what

4104
01:06:47,829 --> 01:06:47,839
but the question is you know what
 

4105
01:06:47,839 --> 01:06:49,910
but the question is you know what
mathematical tools you need to properly

4106
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:49,920
mathematical tools you need to properly
 

4107
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,230
mathematical tools you need to properly
formulate the problem

4108
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,240
formulate the problem
 

4109
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,109
formulate the problem
is unclear so one reasonable conjecture

4110
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:55,119
is unclear so one reasonable conjecture
 

4111
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,510
is unclear so one reasonable conjecture
is the way the reason that we haven't

4112
01:06:57,510 --> 01:06:57,520
is the way the reason that we haven't
 

4113
01:06:57,520 --> 01:07:00,150
is the way the reason that we haven't
had any success yet is just that um

4114
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:00,160
had any success yet is just that um
 

4115
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,430
had any success yet is just that um
we're missing

4116
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:01,440
we're missing
 

4117
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,270
we're missing
either we're missing certain

either we're missing certain
 

4119
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,029
either we're missing certain

physical ideas or we're missing certain
 

4121
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,870
physical ideas or we're missing certain
mathematical tools which

4122
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:06,880
mathematical tools which
 

4123
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,150
mathematical tools which
or some combination of them which would

4124
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:10,160
or some combination of them which would
 

4125
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,670
or some combination of them which would
which we need to kind of properly

4126
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680
which we need to kind of properly
 

4127
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,589
which we need to kind of properly
formulate the problem and see and and

4128
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
formulate the problem and see and and
 

4129
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:14,710
formulate the problem and see and and
see that it

4130
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:14,720
see that it
 

4131
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,069
see that it
it has a solution that looks like the

4132
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:16,079
it has a solution that looks like the
 

4133
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:18,870
it has a solution that looks like the
real world but those you need uh i guess

4134
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
real world but those you need uh i guess
 

4135
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,069
real world but those you need uh i guess
you don't but

4136
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
you don't but
 

4137
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,270
you don't but
there's a sense that uh you need both

4138
01:07:23,270 --> 01:07:23,280
there's a sense that uh you need both
 

4139
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,470
there's a sense that uh you need both
gravity

4140
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:24,480
gravity
 

4141
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:26,710

01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,630
like all the laws of physics to be
operating on the same level so this

4144
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:28,640
operating on the same level so this
 

4145
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,549
operating on the same level so this
isn't it feels like you need an object

isn't it feels like you need an object
 

4147
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,789
isn't it feels like you need an object

well your theory should i mean if your

01:07:50,710 --> 01:07:50,720
well your theory should i mean if your
 

4165
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:52,150
well your theory should i mean if your

current understanding of gravity is that
 

4169
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,150
current understanding of gravity is that
you should have um

4170
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
you should have um
 

4171
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:57,670
you should have um
there should be black hole states in it

4172
01:07:57,670 --> 01:07:57,680
there should be black hole states in it
 

4173
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:58,870
there should be black hole states in it
you should be able to describe black

4174
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
you should be able to describe black
 

4175
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,349
you should be able to describe black
holes in this theory and um and just one

4176
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:01,359
holes in this theory and um and just one
 

4177
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:04,150
holes in this theory and um and just one
aspect that people concentrate a lot on

4178
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:04,160
aspect that people concentrate a lot on
 

4179
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:05,510
aspect that people concentrate a lot on
is just this

4180
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
is just this
 

4181
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,510
is just this
kind of questions about if your

4182
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:07,520
kind of questions about if your
 

4183
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,270
kind of questions about if your
theory includes black holes like it's

4184
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
theory includes black holes like it's
 

4185
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,109
theory includes black holes like it's
supposed to and it includes quantum

4186
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119
supposed to and it includes quantum
 

4187
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,470
supposed to and it includes quantum
mechanics then there's certain kind of

4188
01:08:12,470 --> 01:08:12,480
mechanics then there's certain kind of
 

4189
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,470
mechanics then there's certain kind of
paradoxes which come up and so that's

4190
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:14,480
paradoxes which come up and so that's
 

4191
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,990
paradoxes which come up and so that's
that's been a huge focus of kind of

4192
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,000
that's been a huge focus of kind of
 

4193
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,229
that's been a huge focus of kind of
quantum gravity work work has been just

4194
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
quantum gravity work work has been just
 

4195
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,149
quantum gravity work work has been just
those paradoxes

4196
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
those paradoxes
 

4197
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,110
those paradoxes
so stepping outside of string theory uh

4198
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
so stepping outside of string theory uh
 

4199
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:26,550
so stepping outside of string theory uh
can you just say first at a high level

4200
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:26,560
can you just say first at a high level
 

4201
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,550
can you just say first at a high level
what is the theory of everything what

4202
01:08:28,550 --> 01:08:28,560
what is the theory of everything what
 

4203
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,309
what is the theory of everything what
does the theory of everything seek to

4204
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:30,319
does the theory of everything seek to
 

4205
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:31,910
does the theory of everything seek to
accomplish

4206
01:08:31,910 --> 01:08:31,920
accomplish
 

4207
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,910
accomplish
well i mean this is very much a kind of

4208
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:33,920
well i mean this is very much a kind of
 

4209
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:36,149
well i mean this is very much a kind of
reductionist point of view in the sense

4210
01:08:36,149 --> 01:08:36,159
reductionist point of view in the sense
 

4211
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:38,390
reductionist point of view in the sense
that so it's not a theory this is not

4212
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
that so it's not a theory this is not
 

4213
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:39,829
that so it's not a theory this is not
going to explain

4214
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
going to explain
 

4215
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,669
going to explain
to you you know

4216
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:41,679
to you you know
 

4217
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:43,430
to you you know
anything it doesn't really this kind of

4218
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:43,440
anything it doesn't really this kind of
 

4219
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:45,189
anything it doesn't really this kind of
theory the theory this kind of theory of

4220
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
theory the theory this kind of theory of
 

4221
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:46,709
theory the theory this kind of theory of
everything we're talking about doesn't

4222
01:08:46,709 --> 01:08:46,719
everything we're talking about doesn't
 

4223
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:48,470
everything we're talking about doesn't
say anything interesting particularly

4224
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:48,480
say anything interesting particularly
 

4225
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:50,709
say anything interesting particularly
about like macroscopic objects about

4226
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:50,719
about like macroscopic objects about
 

4227
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,229
about like macroscopic objects about
what the weather is going to be tomorrow

4228
01:08:52,229 --> 01:08:52,239
what the weather is going to be tomorrow
 

4229
01:08:52,239 --> 01:08:53,030
what the weather is going to be tomorrow
or

4230
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:53,040
or
 

4231
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:54,229
or
you know things are happening at this

4232
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
you know things are happening at this
 

4233
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:55,749
you know things are happening at this
scale but

4234
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:55,759
scale but
 

4235
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:57,430
scale but
just what we've discovered is that as

4236
01:08:57,430 --> 01:08:57,440
just what we've discovered is that as
 

4237
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,749
just what we've discovered is that as
you look at um

4238
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
you look at um
 

4239
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,669
you look at um
the universe that kind of

4240
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
the universe that kind of
 

4241
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,510
the universe that kind of
you know if you

4242
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
you know if you
 

4243
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:04,709
you know if you
kind of start brit you can start

4244
01:09:04,709 --> 01:09:04,719
kind of start brit you can start
 

4245
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:06,870
kind of start brit you can start
breaking it apart into and you end up

4246
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:06,880
breaking it apart into and you end up
 

4247
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,950
breaking it apart into and you end up
with some fairly simple pieces quanta if

4248
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
with some fairly simple pieces quanta if
 

4249
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,349
with some fairly simple pieces quanta if
you like and which are doing which are

4250
01:09:11,349 --> 01:09:11,359
you like and which are doing which are
 

4251
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:13,189
you like and which are doing which are
interacting in some fair in some fairly

4252
01:09:13,189 --> 01:09:13,199
interacting in some fair in some fairly
 

4253
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:14,309
interacting in some fair in some fairly
simple way

4254
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:14,319
simple way
 

4255
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:16,070
simple way
and it's um

4256
01:09:16,070 --> 01:09:16,080
and it's um
 

4257
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,829
and it's um
it's good so what we mean by the theory

4258
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:17,839
it's good so what we mean by the theory
 

4259
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:19,669
it's good so what we mean by the theory
of everything is

4260
01:09:19,669 --> 01:09:19,679
of everything is
 

4261
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,349
of everything is
a theory that describes all

4262
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
a theory that describes all
 

4263
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,269
a theory that describes all
all the objects all the correct objects

4264
01:09:25,269 --> 01:09:25,279
all the objects all the correct objects
 

4265
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:27,189
all the objects all the correct objects
you need to describe what's happening in

4266
01:09:27,189 --> 01:09:27,199
you need to describe what's happening in
 

4267
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,110
you need to describe what's happening in
the world and describes how they're

4268
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
the world and describes how they're
 

4269
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,470
the world and describes how they're
interacting with each other at a most

4270
01:09:30,470 --> 01:09:30,480
interacting with each other at a most
 

4271
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:33,430
interacting with each other at a most
fundamental level how you get from that

4272
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:33,440
fundamental level how you get from that
 

4273
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:34,470
fundamental level how you get from that
theory to

4274
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
theory to
 

4275
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,189
theory to
describing some macroscopic incredibly

4276
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
describing some macroscopic incredibly
 

4277
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,590
describing some macroscopic incredibly
complicated thing is there that becomes

4278
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
complicated thing is there that becomes
 

4279
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,430
complicated thing is there that becomes
again more of an engineering problem and

4280
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
again more of an engineering problem and
 

4281
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,709
again more of an engineering problem and
you may need machine learning or you

4282
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
you may need machine learning or you
 

4283
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,309
you may need machine learning or you
made you know a lot of very different

4284
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:44,319
made you know a lot of very different
 

4285
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,709
made you know a lot of very different
things to do it but i don't even

4286
01:09:46,709 --> 01:09:46,719
things to do it but i don't even
 

4287
01:09:46,719 --> 01:09:49,110
things to do it but i don't even
think it's uh just engineering it's also

4288
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
think it's uh just engineering it's also
 

4289
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:53,030
think it's uh just engineering it's also
science it one thing that i find

4290
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
science it one thing that i find
 

4291
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:53,990
science it one thing that i find
um

4292
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
um
 

4293
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,390
um
kind of interesting

4294
01:09:56,390 --> 01:09:56,400
kind of interesting
 

4295
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:02,950
kind of interesting
talking to physicists is is a little bit

4296
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:02,960

 

4297
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,189

there's a

4298
01:10:05,189 --> 01:10:05,199
there's a
 

4299
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:07,430
there's a
a little bit of hubris so some of the

4300
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
a little bit of hubris so some of the
 

4301
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,709
a little bit of hubris so some of the
most brilliant people i know are

4302
01:10:08,709 --> 01:10:08,719
most brilliant people i know are
 

4303
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,270
most brilliant people i know are
physicists both philosophy and just in

4304
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
physicists both philosophy and just in
 

4305
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,709
physicists both philosophy and just in
terms of mathematics in terms of

4306
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:12,719
terms of mathematics in terms of
 

4307
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:14,630
terms of mathematics in terms of
understanding the world but there's a

4308
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:14,640
understanding the world but there's a
 

4309
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,189
understanding the world but there's a
kind of uh either a hubris or what would

4310
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:17,199
kind of uh either a hubris or what would
 

4311
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:18,470
kind of uh either a hubris or what would
i call it

4312
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:18,480
i call it
 

4313
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,430
i call it
uh

4314
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:19,440
uh
 

4315
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:21,669
uh
like a confidence that if we have a

4316
01:10:21,669 --> 01:10:21,679
like a confidence that if we have a
 

4317
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:23,590
like a confidence that if we have a
theory of everything we will understand

4318
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:23,600
theory of everything we will understand
 

4319
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,750
theory of everything we will understand
everything like this is the deepest

4320
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:25,760
everything like this is the deepest
 

4321
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,910
everything like this is the deepest
thing to understand and i would say

4322
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
thing to understand and i would say
 

4323
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:29,669
thing to understand and i would say
and like the rest is details right

4324
01:10:29,669 --> 01:10:29,679
and like the rest is details right
 

4325
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,110
and like the rest is details right
that's the the old rutherford thing uh

4326
01:10:33,110 --> 01:10:33,120
that's the the old rutherford thing uh
 

4327
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:33,910
that's the the old rutherford thing uh
but

4328
01:10:33,910 --> 01:10:33,920
but
 

4329
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:35,350
but
to me

4330
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:35,360
to me
 

4331
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,110
to me
there's like this is like a cake or

4332
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:37,120
there's like this is like a cake or
 

4333
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,030
there's like this is like a cake or
something there's layers to this thing

4334
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
something there's layers to this thing
 

4335
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,350
something there's layers to this thing
and each one has a theory of everything

4336
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:41,360
and each one has a theory of everything
 

4337
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,550
and each one has a theory of everything
yeah like at every level

4338
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:44,560
yeah like at every level
 

4339
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,590
yeah like at every level
from biology like how life originates

4340
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
from biology like how life originates
 

4341
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,550
from biology like how life originates
that itself like complex systems yeah

4342
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
that itself like complex systems yeah
 

4343
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,030
that itself like complex systems yeah
like that in itself is like this

4344
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:55,040
like that in itself is like this
 

4345
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,149
like that in itself is like this
gigantic thing that requires a theory of

4346
01:10:58,149 --> 01:10:58,159
gigantic thing that requires a theory of
 

4347
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,149
gigantic thing that requires a theory of
everything and then there's the in the

4348
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:00,159
everything and then there's the in the
 

4349
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:02,950
everything and then there's the in the
space of humans psychology like

4350
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:02,960
space of humans psychology like
 

4351
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,630
space of humans psychology like
intelligence collective intelligence the

4352
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:04,640
intelligence collective intelligence the
 

4353
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,110
intelligence collective intelligence the
way it emerges among species

4354
01:11:07,110 --> 01:11:07,120
way it emerges among species
 

4355
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:09,189
way it emerges among species
that feels like a complex system that

4356
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
that feels like a complex system that
 

4357
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,430
that feels like a complex system that
requires its own theory of everything

4358
01:11:11,430 --> 01:11:11,440
requires its own theory of everything
 

4359
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:12,870
requires its own theory of everything
on top of that

4360
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:12,880
on top of that
 

4361
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:13,590
on top of that
is

4362
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,600
is
 

4363
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,270
is
things like in the computing space

4364
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:15,280
things like in the computing space
 

4365
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,790
things like in the computing space
artificial intelligence systems like

4366
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
artificial intelligence systems like
 

4367
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,470
artificial intelligence systems like
that feels like it is a theory of

4368
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:18,480
that feels like it is a theory of
 

4369
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:21,990
that feels like it is a theory of
everything and it's almost like

4370
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:22,000
everything and it's almost like
 

4371
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,870
everything and it's almost like
once we solve

4372
01:11:24,870 --> 01:11:24,880
once we solve
 

4373
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:26,149
once we solve
once we come up with the theory of

4374
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
once we come up with the theory of
 

4375
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,830
once we come up with the theory of
everything that explains the basic laws

4376
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
everything that explains the basic laws
 

4377
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,229
everything that explains the basic laws
of physics that gave us the universe

4378
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:30,239
of physics that gave us the universe
 

4379
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,189
of physics that gave us the universe
even stuff that's super complex like uh

4380
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:33,199
even stuff that's super complex like uh
 

4381
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,110
even stuff that's super complex like uh
how like how the

4382
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
how like how the
 

4383
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,350
how like how the
universe might be able to originate even

4384
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
universe might be able to originate even
 

4385
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,790
universe might be able to originate even
explaining something that you're not a

4386
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,800
explaining something that you're not a
 

4387
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,790
explaining something that you're not a
big fan of like multiverses or stuff

4388
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
big fan of like multiverses or stuff
 

4389
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,870
big fan of like multiverses or stuff
that we don't have any evidence of yet

4390
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:42,880
that we don't have any evidence of yet
 

4391
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:44,229
that we don't have any evidence of yet
still we won't

4392
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
still we won't
 

4393
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,669
still we won't
be able to

4394
01:11:45,669 --> 01:11:45,679
be able to
 

4395
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:48,630
be able to
have a strong explanation

4396
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
have a strong explanation
 

4397
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,910
have a strong explanation
of uh

4398
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
of uh
 

4399
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:50,950
of uh
why

4400
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
why
 

4401
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,110
why
food tastes delicious oh yeah yeah i

4402
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:53,120
food tastes delicious oh yeah yeah i
 

4403
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,430
food tastes delicious oh yeah yeah i
know no anyway i yeah i agree completely

4404
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
know no anyway i yeah i agree completely
 

4405
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,470
know no anyway i yeah i agree completely
i mean this

4406
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
i mean this
 

4407
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,229
i mean this
there is something kind of completely

4408
01:11:58,229 --> 01:11:58,239
there is something kind of completely
 

4409
01:11:58,239 --> 01:12:00,310
there is something kind of completely
wrong with this terminology or theory of

wrong with this terminology or theory of
 

4411
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,390
wrong with this terminology or theory of
everything that it's not um it's really

everything that it's not um it's really
 

4413
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,149
everything that it's not um it's really
in some sense very bad term very

in some sense very bad term very
 

4415
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:05,590
in some sense very bad term very
hubristic and bad

hubristic and bad
 

4417
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,070
hubristic and bad
terminology because it's not um this is

01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:08,080
terminology because it's not um this is
 

4419
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:10,870

this is a purely kind of reductionist

to actually understand how anything

01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:26,560
to actually understand how anything
 

4439
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,189
to actually understand how anything
emerges from this is it's hope it can't

4440
01:12:29,189 --> 01:12:29,199
emerges from this is it's hope it can't
 

4441
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,070
emerges from this is it's hope it can't
be understood in terms of

be understood in terms of
 

4443
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,590
be understood in terms of
this this underlying fundamental theory

4444
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:33,600
this this underlying fundamental theory
 

4445
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,030
this this underlying fundamental theory
is going to be

4446
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:35,040
is going to be
 

4447
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,030
is going to be
hopeless in terms of kind of telling you

4448
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:37,040
hopeless in terms of kind of telling you
 

4449
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,350
hopeless in terms of kind of telling you
what about this um

4450
01:12:39,350 --> 01:12:39,360
what about this um
 

4451
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,110
what about this um
this various emergent behavior and as

4452
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:41,120
this various emergent behavior and as
 

4453
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,229
this various emergent behavior and as
you go to different levels of

4454
01:12:42,229 --> 01:12:42,239
you go to different levels of
 

4455
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,510
you go to different levels of
explanation you're going to need to

4456
01:12:43,510 --> 01:12:43,520
explanation you're going to need to
 

4457
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:44,870
explanation you're going to need to
develop new you know different

4458
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:44,880
develop new you know different
 

4459
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,229
develop new you know different
completely different ideas completely

4460
01:12:46,229 --> 01:12:46,239
completely different ideas completely
 

4461
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,229
completely different ideas completely
different ways of thinking and

4462
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:48,239
different ways of thinking and
 

4463
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:50,390
different ways of thinking and
i guess there's a famous kind of um

4464
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:50,400
i guess there's a famous kind of um
 

4465
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,830

slogan is that you know more is

different
and then yeah so it and

4472
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
and then yeah so it and
 

4473
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:57,669
and then yeah so it and
it's just it's just

4474
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
it's just it's just
 

4475
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,350
it's just it's just
even once you understand how what a

4476
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,360
even once you understand how what a
 

4477
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:00,950
even once you understand how what a
couple things well if you have a

4478
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
couple things well if you have a
 

4479
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,310
couple things well if you have a
collection of stuff and you understand

4480
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:02,320
collection of stuff and you understand
 

4481
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:04,070
collection of stuff and you understand
perfectly well how each thing is

4482
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
perfectly well how each thing is
 

4483
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,470
perfectly well how each thing is
interacting with it

4484
01:13:06,470 --> 01:13:06,480
interacting with it
 

4485
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,990
interacting with it
with the others what the whole thing is

4486
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:08,000
with the others what the whole thing is
 

4487
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,270
with the others what the whole thing is
going to do is just a completely

4488
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
going to do is just a completely
 

4489
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,189
going to do is just a completely
different problem it's just not and you

4490
01:13:11,189 --> 01:13:11,199
different problem it's just not and you
 

4491
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:12,229
different problem it's just not and you
need completely different ways of

4492
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
need completely different ways of
 

4493
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,830
need completely different ways of
thinking about it what do you think

4494
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:13,840
thinking about it what do you think
 

4495
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:14,870
thinking about it what do you think
about this

4496
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
about this
 

4497
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,790
about this
i got to ask you at a few different

4498
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:16,800
i got to ask you at a few different
 

4499
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,390
i got to ask you at a few different
attempts at the theory of everything

4500
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
attempts at the theory of everything
 

4501
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,950
attempts at the theory of everything
especially recently uh so

4502
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
especially recently uh so
 

4503
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,229
especially recently uh so
i've been

4504
01:13:22,229 --> 01:13:22,239
i've been
 

4505
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:23,990
i've been
for many years a big fan of cellular

4506
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:24,000
for many years a big fan of cellular
 

4507
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,990
for many years a big fan of cellular
automata of complex systems and

4508
01:13:25,990 --> 01:13:26,000
automata of complex systems and
 

4509
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,550
automata of complex systems and
obviously if because of that a fan of

4510
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
obviously if because of that a fan of
 

4511
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,270
obviously if because of that a fan of
stephen wolfram's work on in that space

4512
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:31,280
stephen wolfram's work on in that space
 

4513
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,030
stephen wolfram's work on in that space
but he's recently been talking about a

4514
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
but he's recently been talking about a
 

4515
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,229
but he's recently been talking about a
theory

4516
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:34,239
theory
 

4517
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,830

4521
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:39,189
project essentially
uh what do you think about this kind of

4522
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
uh what do you think about this kind of
 

4523
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:42,310
uh what do you think about this kind of
discrete

4524
01:13:42,310 --> 01:13:42,320

 

4525
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:43,990

theory of everything for like from

4527
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,310

where time and space are emergent
 

4533
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:52,950
where time and space are emergent
basically everything we see around us is

01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,790
basically everything we see around us is
immersed yeah yeah i i have to say

4536
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:54,800
immersed yeah yeah i i have to say
 

4537
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,189
immersed yeah yeah i i have to say
unfortunately i have kind of pretty much

4538
01:13:57,189 --> 01:13:57,199
unfortunately i have kind of pretty much
 

4539
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:00,149
unfortunately i have kind of pretty much
zero sympathy for that i mean i don't um

4540
01:14:00,149 --> 01:14:00,159
zero sympathy for that i mean i don't um
 

4541
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,590
zero sympathy for that i mean i don't um
i spend a little time looking at it and

4542
01:14:01,590 --> 01:14:01,600
i spend a little time looking at it and
 

4543
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:02,870
i spend a little time looking at it and
i just don't see

4544
01:14:02,870 --> 01:14:02,880
i just don't see
 

4545
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,790
i just don't see
it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere

4546
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere
 

4547
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,669
it doesn't seem to me to get anywhere
and it really is just really really

4548
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
and it really is just really really
 

4549
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:09,669
and it really is just really really
doesn't agree at all with what what with

4550
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
doesn't agree at all with what what with
 

4551
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,510
doesn't agree at all with what what with
what i'm seeing this the kind of

4552
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:11,520
what i'm seeing this the kind of
 

4553
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,430
what i'm seeing this the kind of
unification of math and physics that i'm

4554
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
unification of math and physics that i'm
 

4555
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,030
unification of math and physics that i'm
kind of talking about around certain

4556
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
kind of talking about around certain
 

4557
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,350
kind of talking about around certain
kinds of very deep ideas about geometry

4558
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
kinds of very deep ideas about geometry
 

4559
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,030
kinds of very deep ideas about geometry
and stuff this

4560
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
and stuff this
 

4561
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,430
and stuff this
if you want to believe that

4562
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
if you want to believe that
 

4563
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,350
if you want to believe that
that your things are really coming out

4564
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
that your things are really coming out
 

4565
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,990
that your things are really coming out
of cellular automata at the most um

4566
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,000
of cellular automata at the most um
 

4567
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,270
of cellular automata at the most um
fundamental level you have to believe

4568
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
fundamental level you have to believe
 

4569
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,070
fundamental level you have to believe
that everything that i've

4570
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:30,080
that everything that i've
 

4571
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,709
that everything that i've
seen my whole career and as

4572
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:32,719
seen my whole career and as
 

4573
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,470
seen my whole career and as
as beautiful powerful ideas that that's

4574
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:34,480
as beautiful powerful ideas that that's
 

4575
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:35,990
as beautiful powerful ideas that that's
all just kind of a mirage which just

4576
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
all just kind of a mirage which just
 

4577
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,950
all just kind of a mirage which just
kind of randomly is emerging from these

4578
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
kind of randomly is emerging from these
 

4579
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,950
kind of randomly is emerging from these
more basic very very simple-minded

4580
01:14:40,950 --> 01:14:40,960
more basic very very simple-minded
 

4581
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:42,870
more basic very very simple-minded
things and i

4582
01:14:42,870 --> 01:14:42,880
things and i
 

4583
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,149
things and i
you have to give me some serious

4584
01:14:44,149 --> 01:14:44,159
you have to give me some serious
 

4585
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,070
you have to give me some serious
evidence for that and i'm saying nothing

4586
01:14:46,070 --> 01:14:46,080
evidence for that and i'm saying nothing
 

4587
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:48,550
evidence for that and i'm saying nothing
so mirage you don't think there could be

4588
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:48,560
so mirage you don't think there could be
 

4589
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,310
so mirage you don't think there could be
a consistency

4590
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
a consistency
 

4591
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,350
a consistency
where

4592
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,360
where
 

4593
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,669
where
things like quantum mechanics

4594
01:14:53,669 --> 01:14:53,679
things like quantum mechanics
 

4595
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:56,630
things like quantum mechanics
could emerge from much much much smaller

4596
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:56,640
could emerge from much much much smaller
 

4597
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:58,310
could emerge from much much much smaller
discrete

4598
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:58,320
discrete
 

4599
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,310
discrete
like computational type systems i think

4600
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:00,320
like computational type systems i think
 

4601
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,830
like computational type systems i think
from the point of view of certain

4602
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
from the point of view of certain
 

4603
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,350
from the point of view of certain
mathematical point of view quantum

4604
01:15:03,350 --> 01:15:03,360
mathematical point of view quantum
 

4605
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:05,590
mathematical point of view quantum
mechanics is already

4606
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
mechanics is already
 

4607
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,430
mechanics is already
mathematically as simple as it gets it

4608
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
mathematically as simple as it gets it
 

4609
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,830
mathematically as simple as it gets it
really

4610
01:15:08,830 --> 01:15:08,840
really
 

4611
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:12,550
really
is a story about really

4612
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:12,560
is a story about really
 

4613
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,310
is a story about really
the fundamental objects that you work

4614
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
the fundamental objects that you work
 

4615
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,910
the fundamental objects that you work
with in when you write down a quantum

4616
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
with in when you write down a quantum
 

4617
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,390
with in when you write down a quantum
theory are in some in some point of view

4618
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
theory are in some in some point of view
 

4619
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:21,030
theory are in some in some point of view
precisely the fundamental objects

4620
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
precisely the fundamental objects
 

4621
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,709
precisely the fundamental objects
at the deepest levels of mathematics

4622
01:15:22,709 --> 01:15:22,719
at the deepest levels of mathematics
 

4623
01:15:22,719 --> 01:15:23,910
at the deepest levels of mathematics
that you're working with they're exactly

4624
01:15:23,910 --> 01:15:23,920
that you're working with they're exactly
 

4625
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:24,950
that you're working with they're exactly
the same

4626
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
the same
 

4627
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,229
the same
so

4628
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
so
 

4629
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,669
so
and cellular automata are something

4630
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
and cellular automata are something
 

4631
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,870
and cellular automata are something
completely different which don't fit

4632
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
completely different which don't fit
 

4633
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,950
completely different which don't fit
into these structures and so i just

4634
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:30,960
into these structures and so i just
 

4635
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,430
into these structures and so i just
don't see why anyway i don't see it as a

4636
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:33,440
don't see why anyway i don't see it as a
 

4637
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:35,189
don't see why anyway i don't see it as a
promising

4638
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:35,199
promising
 

4639
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:36,070
promising
uh

4640
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:36,080
uh
 

4641
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,430
uh
you know promising thing to do and then

4642
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:37,440
you know promising thing to do and then
 

4643
01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:38,790
you know promising thing to do and then
just looking at it and saying does this

4644
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:38,800
just looking at it and saying does this
 

4645
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,870
just looking at it and saying does this
go anywhere does this solve any problem

4646
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
go anywhere does this solve any problem
 

4647
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,229
go anywhere does this solve any problem
that i've ever

4648
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:42,239
that i've ever
 

4649
01:15:42,239 --> 01:15:44,070
that i've ever
that i didn't does this solve any

4650
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:44,080
that i didn't does this solve any
 

4651
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,550
that i didn't does this solve any
problem of any kind i just don't see it

4652
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:46,560
problem of any kind i just don't see it
 

4653
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:48,790
problem of any kind i just don't see it
yeah to me cellular automata and these

4654
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:48,800
yeah to me cellular automata and these
 

4655
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,470
yeah to me cellular automata and these
hypographs

4656
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:50,480
hypographs
 

4657
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:53,669
hypographs
i'm not sure solving a problem

4658
01:15:53,669 --> 01:15:53,679
i'm not sure solving a problem
 

4659
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:56,310
i'm not sure solving a problem
is even the standard to apply here at

4660
01:15:56,310 --> 01:15:56,320
is even the standard to apply here at
 

4661
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:58,390
is even the standard to apply here at
this moment to me

4662
01:15:58,390 --> 01:15:58,400
this moment to me
 

4663
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,590
this moment to me
the fascinating thing is that the

4664
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
the fascinating thing is that the
 

4665
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,390
the fascinating thing is that the
question it asks have no good answers so

4666
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
question it asks have no good answers so
 

4667
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,709
question it asks have no good answers so
there's not good math explaining forget

4668
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
there's not good math explaining forget
 

4669
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,790
there's not good math explaining forget
the physics of it math explaining the

4670
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:06,800
the physics of it math explaining the
 

4671
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,110
the physics of it math explaining the
behavior of complex systems yeah and

4672
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120
behavior of complex systems yeah and
 

4673
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:10,630
behavior of complex systems yeah and
that to me is

4674
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
that to me is
 

4675
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,870
that to me is
both exciting and paralyzing like we're

4676
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:12,880
both exciting and paralyzing like we're
 

4677
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,070
both exciting and paralyzing like we're
at very early days of understanding

4678
01:16:16,070 --> 01:16:16,080
at very early days of understanding
 

4679
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,030
at very early days of understanding
you know

4680
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
you know
 

4681
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:19,350
you know
how complicated and fascinating things

4682
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:19,360
how complicated and fascinating things
 

4683
01:16:19,360 --> 01:16:22,310
how complicated and fascinating things
emerge from simple rules yeah you know i

4684
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:22,320
emerge from simple rules yeah you know i
 

4685
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,310
emerge from simple rules yeah you know i
agree i think that is a

4686
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:24,320
agree i think that is a
 

4687
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:25,990
agree i think that is a
truly great problem and

4688
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
truly great problem and
 

4689
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,510
truly great problem and
depending where it goes it may be um

4690
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
depending where it goes it may be um
 

4691
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,790
depending where it goes it may be um
you know

4692
01:16:30,790 --> 01:16:30,800
you know
 

4693
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,669
you know
it may

4694
01:16:31,669 --> 01:16:31,679
it may
 

4695
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:32,870
it may
start to develop some kind of

4696
01:16:32,870 --> 01:16:32,880
start to develop some kind of
 

4697
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,390
start to develop some kind of
connections to the

4698
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:34,400
connections to the
 

4699
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,070
connections to the
the things that i've kind of found more

4700
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
the things that i've kind of found more
 

4701
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:37,990
the things that i've kind of found more
fruitful and

4702
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,000
fruitful and
 

4703
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,310
fruitful and
hard to know it just i think

4704
01:16:40,310 --> 01:16:40,320
hard to know it just i think
 

4705
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:42,310
hard to know it just i think
a lot of that area i i kind of strongly

4706
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
a lot of that area i i kind of strongly
 

4707
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,430
a lot of that area i i kind of strongly
feel i

4708
01:16:43,430 --> 01:16:43,440
feel i
 

4709
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:44,550
feel i
best

4710
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:44,560
best
 

4711
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,709
best
not say too much about it because i just

4712
01:16:46,709 --> 01:16:46,719
not say too much about it because i just
 

4713
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,790
not say too much about it because i just
i don't know too much about it and uh i

4714
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:48,800
i don't know too much about it and uh i
 

4715
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,189
i don't know too much about it and uh i
mean again we're back to this original

4716
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:51,199
mean again we're back to this original
 

4717
01:16:51,199 --> 01:16:52,550
mean again we're back to this original
problem that you know your time in life

4718
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:52,560
problem that you know your time in life
 

4719
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:53,510
problem that you know your time in life
is uh

4720
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
is uh
 

4721
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:55,030
is uh
is limited you have to figure out what

4722
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:55,040
is limited you have to figure out what
 

4723
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,310
is limited you have to figure out what
you're going to spend your time thinking

4724
01:16:56,310 --> 01:16:56,320
you're going to spend your time thinking
 

4725
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,990
you're going to spend your time thinking
about and that that's something i've

4726
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
about and that that's something i've
 

4727
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,070
about and that that's something i've
just never seen enough to convince me to

4728
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:00,080
just never seen enough to convince me to
 

4729
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,510
just never seen enough to convince me to
spend more time thinking about it well

4730
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:01,520
spend more time thinking about it well
 

4731
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:03,350
spend more time thinking about it well
also timing it's not just that our time

4732
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:03,360
also timing it's not just that our time
 

4733
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,709
also timing it's not just that our time
is limited but

4734
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
is limited but
 

4735
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,310
is limited but
the timing of the kind of things you

4736
01:17:06,310 --> 01:17:06,320
the timing of the kind of things you
 

4737
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:08,149
the timing of the kind of things you
think about there there's some

4738
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
think about there there's some
 

4739
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,070
think about there there's some
aspect to cellular autonomy these kinds

4740
01:17:10,070 --> 01:17:10,080
aspect to cellular autonomy these kinds
 

4741
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,709
aspect to cellular autonomy these kinds
of objects that it feels like

4742
01:17:12,709 --> 01:17:12,719
of objects that it feels like
 

4743
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,310
of objects that it feels like
we're very many years away from having

4744
01:17:16,310 --> 01:17:16,320
we're very many years away from having
 

4745
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,149
we're very many years away from having
big breakthroughs on

4746
01:17:18,149 --> 01:17:18,159
big breakthroughs on
 

4747
01:17:18,159 --> 01:17:19,750
big breakthroughs on
and so it's like you have to pick the

4748
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
and so it's like you have to pick the
 

4749
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,990
and so it's like you have to pick the
problems that are solvable today in fact

4750
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:22,000
problems that are solvable today in fact
 

4751
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,669
problems that are solvable today in fact

01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:26,310
my intuition
again not perhaps biased

01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
again not perhaps biased
 

4755
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,950
again not perhaps biased
is it feels like the kind of systems

would not be solved by human brains
 

4763
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,790
would not be solved by human brains
it feels like well like it feels like

01:17:38,790 --> 01:17:38,800
it feels like well like it feels like
 

4765
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,709
it feels like well like it feels like
something post-human that will solve

4766
01:17:40,709 --> 01:17:40,719
something post-human that will solve
 

4767
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,350
something post-human that will solve
that problem or like significantly

01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,390
to us to to crack these problems open
um

4778
01:17:54,390 --> 01:17:54,400
um
 

4779
01:17:54,400 --> 01:17:57,110
um
that's that's if our

4780
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:57,120
that's that's if our

assists us
 

4799
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,510
assists us
in um

4800
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:13,520
in um
 

4801
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,110
in um
understanding science the way we've been

4802
01:18:15,110 --> 01:18:15,120
understanding science the way we've been
 

4803
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,110
understanding science the way we've been
doing it all along but if there's a

4804
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,120
doing it all along but if there's a
 

4805
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:18,790
doing it all along but if there's a
whole new i mean that

4806
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:18,800
whole new i mean that
 

4807
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,390
whole new i mean that
world from new kind of science right

4808
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
world from new kind of science right
 

4809
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,990
world from new kind of science right
it's a little bit dramatic but you know

4810
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:24,000
it's a little bit dramatic but you know
 

4811
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,350
it's a little bit dramatic but you know
this

4812
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:25,360
this
 

4813
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:28,070
this
if computers could do science on their

4814
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,080
if computers could do science on their
 

4815
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,950
if computers could do science on their
own computational systems

4816
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
own computational systems
 

4817
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,149
own computational systems
perhaps

4818
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
perhaps
 

4819
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:33,750
perhaps
um

4820
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
um
 

4821
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:35,430
um
that's the way they would do the science

4822
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:35,440
that's the way they would do the science
 

4823
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,630
that's the way they would do the science
they would try to understand the

4824
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:36,640
they would try to understand the
 

4825
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:38,390
they would try to understand the
cellular automata and that feels like

4826
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:38,400
cellular automata and that feels like
 

4827
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,870
cellular automata and that feels like
we're decades away so

4828
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:40,880
we're decades away so
 

4829
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,790
we're decades away so
perhaps he'll crack open some

4830
01:18:42,790 --> 01:18:42,800
perhaps he'll crack open some
 

4831
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,550
perhaps he'll crack open some
interesting facets of this physics

4832
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:44,560
interesting facets of this physics
 

4833
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:46,390
interesting facets of this physics
problem but it's it's very far away so

4834
01:18:46,390 --> 01:18:46,400
problem but it's it's very far away so
 

4835
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:48,709
problem but it's it's very far away so
timing is everything that that's

4836
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
timing is everything that that's
 

4837
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,630
timing is everything that that's
perfectly possible yeah

4838
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,640
perfectly possible yeah
 

4839
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:52,229
perfectly possible yeah
uh well let me ask you then in the space

4840
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
uh well let me ask you then in the space
 

4841
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,030
uh well let me ask you then in the space
of geometry

4847
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:02,070

what are your thoughts about

01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:02,080
what are your thoughts about
 

4849
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:04,070
what are your thoughts about

01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:14,719
he fundamentally has i think the same
 

4861
01:19:14,719 --> 01:19:16,550
he fundamentally has i think the same
problems that everybody

4862
01:19:16,550 --> 01:19:16,560
problems that everybody
 

4863
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,669
problems that everybody
has had

4864
01:19:17,669 --> 01:19:17,679
has had
 

4865
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:19,270
has had
trying to do this and you know they're

4866
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:19,280
trying to do this and you know they're
 

4867
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,950
trying to do this and you know they're
various they're really versions of the

4868
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
various they're really versions of the
 

4869
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,709
various they're really versions of the
same problem that you try to um

4870
01:19:24,709 --> 01:19:24,719

 

4871
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:26,870

you try to get unity by put it putting

4872
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:26,880
you try to get unity by put it putting
 

4873
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:28,870
you try to get unity by put it putting
everything into some bigger structure so

4874
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:28,880
everything into some bigger structure so
 

4875
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:29,910
everything into some bigger structure so
he's

4876
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
he's
 

4877
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,149
he's
has has has some other ones that he that

are not so conventional that he's trying

4880
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:33,920
are not so conventional that he's trying
 

4881
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:36,630
are not so conventional that he's trying
to work with but um

4882
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:36,640
to work with but um
 

4883
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,390
to work with but um
he has that he has the same problem that

4884
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:38,400
he has that he has the same problem that
 

4885
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:41,510
he has that he has the same problem that
even if he can

4886
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:41,520

 

4887
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,110

if he can get a lot farther in terms of

4888
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:43,120
if he can get a lot farther in terms of
 

4889
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,550
if he can get a lot farther in terms of
having a really well-defined

01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
having a really well-defined

well-understood clear picture of this
 

4893
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,430
well-understood clear picture of this
these large these things he's working

4894
01:19:49,430 --> 01:19:49,440
these large these things he's working
 

4895
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:51,990
these large these things he's working
with they're really kind of large

4896
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
with they're really kind of large
 

4897
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,350
with they're really kind of large
geometrical structures with many

4898
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,360
geometrical structures with many
 

4899
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:55,750
geometrical structures with many
dimensions many kinds and i just don't

4900
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:55,760
dimensions many kinds and i just don't
 

4901
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,189
dimensions many kinds and i just don't
see any way

4902
01:19:57,189 --> 01:19:57,199
see any way
 

4903
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,550
see any way
he's going to have the same problem the

4904
01:19:58,550 --> 01:19:58,560
he's going to have the same problem the
 

4905
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,149
he's going to have the same problem the
string leaders have how do you get back

4906
01:20:00,149 --> 01:20:00,159
string leaders have how do you get back
 

4907
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,910
string leaders have how do you get back
down to

4908
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
down to
 

4909
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,070
down to
the structures of the standard model and

4910
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,080
the structures of the standard model and
 

4911
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,070
the structures of the standard model and
how do you um

4912
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:06,080
how do you um
 

4913
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:08,229
how do you um
yeah so i i just

4914
01:20:08,229 --> 01:20:08,239
yeah so i i just
 

4915
01:20:08,239 --> 01:20:09,350
yeah so i i just
anyway

4916
01:20:09,350 --> 01:20:09,360
anyway
 

4917
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,550
anyway
it's the same

4918
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:10,560
it's the same
 

4919
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:13,030
it's the same
and there's another interesting example

4920
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
and there's another interesting example
 

4921
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,790
and there's another interesting example
of some similar kind of thing is um

4922
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:14,800
of some similar kind of thing is um
 

4923
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,310
of some similar kind of thing is um
garrett lucy's

4924
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
garrett lucy's
 

4925
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,229
garrett lucy's
theory of everything again you know he's

4926
01:20:18,229 --> 01:20:18,239
theory of everything again you know he's
 

4927
01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:19,830
theory of everything again you know he's
there it's a little bit more specific

4928
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
there it's a little bit more specific
 

4929
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,350
there it's a little bit more specific
than eric's he's

4930
01:20:21,350 --> 01:20:21,360
than eric's he's
 

4931
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:23,669
than eric's he's
working with this e8 but it um

4932
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
working with this e8 but it um
 

4933
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:24,470
working with this e8 but it um
again

4934
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:24,480
again
 

4935
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:26,070
again
i think all these things found her at

4936
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
i think all these things found her at
 

4937
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:29,350
i think all these things found her at
the same point that you don't

4938
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:29,360

 

4939
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,510

you know you create this unity but then

4940
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:31,520
you know you create this unity but then
 

4941
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,350
you know you create this unity but then
you have no

4942
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
you have no
 

4943
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,870
you have no
you don't actually have a good idea how

4944
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
you don't actually have a good idea how
 

4945
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,950
you don't actually have a good idea how
you're going to get back to the to the

4946
01:20:36,950 --> 01:20:36,960
you're going to get back to the to the
 

4947
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,629
you're going to get back to the to the
actual

4948
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639

 

4949
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,229

to the objects we're seeing how are you

4950
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
to the objects we're seeing how are you
 

4951
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:43,750
to the objects we're seeing how are you
going to you create these big symmetries

4952
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
going to you create these big symmetries
 

4953
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,750
going to you create these big symmetries
how are you going to break them and and

4954
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,760
how are you going to break them and and
 

4955
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,870
how are you going to break them and and
because because we don't see those

4956
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:46,880
because because we don't see those
 

4957
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,110
because because we don't see those
imageries in in the real world and um so

4958
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
imageries in in the real world and um so
 

4959
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,030
imageries in in the real world and um so
ultimately there would need to be a a

4960
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:51,040
ultimately there would need to be a a
 

4961
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,470
ultimately there would need to be a a
simple

4962
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:52,480
simple
 

4963
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,750
simple
process

4964
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:53,760
process
 

4965
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,070
process
for collapsing it to four dimensions

4966
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:56,080
for collapsing it to four dimensions
 

4967
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,390
for collapsing it to four dimensions
you'd have to explain well yeah and i

4968
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:58,400
you'd have to explain well yeah and i
 

4969
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,229
you'd have to explain well yeah and i
forget in his case but it's not just

4970
01:21:00,229 --> 01:21:00,239
forget in his case but it's not just
 

4971
01:21:00,239 --> 01:21:03,350
forget in his case but it's not just
four dimensions it's also these um

4972
01:21:03,350 --> 01:21:03,360
four dimensions it's also these um
 

4973
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:04,870
four dimensions it's also these um
these structures you see in the standard

4974
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
these structures you see in the standard
 

4975
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:06,229
these structures you see in the standard
model there's a

4976
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:06,239
model there's a
 

4977
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:07,510
model there's a
you know there's certain very small

4978
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:07,520
you know there's certain very small
 

4979
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,350
you know there's certain very small
dimensional groups of symmetry so called

4980
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
dimensional groups of symmetry so called
 

4981
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,990
dimensional groups of symmetry so called
u1 su-2 and su-3 and

4982
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
u1 su-2 and su-3 and
 

4983
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,669
u1 su-2 and su-3 and
the problem with

4984
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
the problem with
 

4985
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:14,709
the problem with
and this has been the problem since the

4986
01:21:14,709 --> 01:21:14,719
and this has been the problem since the
 

4987
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:17,750
and this has been the problem since the
beginning almost immediately after 1973

4988
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,760
beginning almost immediately after 1973
 

4989
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,350
beginning almost immediately after 1973
about a year later two years later

4990
01:21:19,350 --> 01:21:19,360
about a year later two years later
 

4991
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,790
about a year later two years later
people started talking about grand

4992
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
people started talking about grand
 

4993
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,430
people started talking about grand
unified theories so you take

4994
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
unified theories so you take
 

4995
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,310
unified theories so you take
the u1 the su-2 and the su-3 and you put

4996
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,320
the u1 the su-2 and the su-3 and you put
 

4997
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,590
the u1 the su-2 and the su-3 and you put
them in together into this bigger

4998
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:27,600
them in together into this bigger
 

4999
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:31,350
them in together into this bigger
structure called the su5 or so10

5000
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:31,360
structure called the su5 or so10
 

5001
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:32,390
structure called the su5 or so10
but then

5002
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
but then
 

5003
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,510
but then
you're stuck with this problem that wait

5004
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
you're stuck with this problem that wait
 

5005
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,030
you're stuck with this problem that wait
a minute now how

5006
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
a minute now how
 

5007
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,189
a minute now how
why does the world not look why do i not

5008
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
why does the world not look why do i not
 

5009
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,790
why does the world not look why do i not
see

5010
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
see
 

5011
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,950
see
the these su5 symmetries in the world i

5012
01:21:40,950 --> 01:21:40,960
the these su5 symmetries in the world i
 

5013
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:44,550
the these su5 symmetries in the world i
only see these and so

5014
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:44,560
only see these and so
 

5015
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,030
only see these and so
and and i think you know those id

5016
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
and and i think you know those id
 

5017
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,790

and all sudden garrett and lots of
 

5021
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:51,830
and all sudden garrett and lots of
people try to do they all kind of found

5022
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:51,840
people try to do they all kind of found
 

5023
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,990
people try to do they all kind of found
her in that same

5024
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
her in that same
 

5025
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,990
her in that same
in that same way that they don't have

5026
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
in that same way that they don't have
 

5027
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,390
in that same way that they don't have
they don't have a good answer to that

5028
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
they don't have a good answer to that
 

5029
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,110
they don't have a good answer to that
are there lessons ideas to be learned

5030
01:22:01,110 --> 01:22:01,120
are there lessons ideas to be learned
 

5031
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,950
are there lessons ideas to be learned
from theories like that from gary leases

5032
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:02,960
from theories like that from gary leases
 

5033
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,550
from theories like that from gary leases
from eric's

5034
01:22:04,550 --> 01:22:04,560
from eric's
 

5035
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,550
from eric's
um i don't know it depends i have to

5036
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:06,560
um i don't know it depends i have to
 

5037
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:08,629
um i don't know it depends i have to
confess i haven't looked that closely at

5038
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
confess i haven't looked that closely at
 

5039
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:09,270
confess i haven't looked that closely at
a

5040
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:09,280
a
 

5041
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:11,669
a
at uh at eric's i mean he explained to

5042
01:22:11,669 --> 01:22:11,679
at uh at eric's i mean he explained to
 

5043
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:14,070
at uh at eric's i mean he explained to
this to me um personally uh a few times

5044
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,080
this to me um personally uh a few times
 

5045
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:15,669
this to me um personally uh a few times
i've looked a bit at his paper but it's

5046
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:15,679
i've looked a bit at his paper but it's
 

5047
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,430
i've looked a bit at his paper but it's
um

5048
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
um
 

5049
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,350
um
again we're back to the problem of a

5050
01:22:19,350 --> 01:22:19,360
again we're back to the problem of a
 

5051
01:22:19,360 --> 01:22:22,229
again we're back to the problem of a
limited amount of time in life and

5052
01:22:22,229 --> 01:22:22,239
limited amount of time in life and
 

5053
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:23,910
limited amount of time in life and
yeah i mean it's an interesting effect

5054
01:22:23,910 --> 01:22:23,920
yeah i mean it's an interesting effect
 

5055
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,550
yeah i mean it's an interesting effect
right

5056
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:26,560

 

5057
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:29,830

why don't more physicists look at it

5058
01:22:29,830 --> 01:22:29,840
why don't more physicists look at it
 

5059
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,950
why don't more physicists look at it
there

5060
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:32,960

 

5061
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,950

i mean i i'm in this position that

5062
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:34,960
i mean i i'm in this position that
 

5063
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,350
i mean i i'm in this position that
somehow

5064
01:22:37,350 --> 01:22:37,360
somehow
 

5065
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,110
somehow
you know

5066
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:39,120
you know
 

5067
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,990
you know
uh

5068
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:40,000
uh
 

5069
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,149
uh
i've of uh

5070
01:22:42,149 --> 01:22:42,159
i've of uh
 

5071
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,149
i've of uh
people write me emails for whatever

5072
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:44,159
people write me emails for whatever
 

5073
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:45,510
people write me emails for whatever
reason

5074
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
reason
 

5075
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,750
reason
and i'd work in the space of ai and so

5076
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:47,760
and i'd work in the space of ai and so
 

5077
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,750
and i'd work in the space of ai and so
there's a lot of people perhaps ai is

5078
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:49,760
there's a lot of people perhaps ai is
 

5079
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,229
there's a lot of people perhaps ai is
even way more accessible than physics in

5080
01:22:52,229 --> 01:22:52,239
even way more accessible than physics in
 

5081
01:22:52,239 --> 01:22:54,149
even way more accessible than physics in
a certain sense it's a lot of people

5082
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:54,159
a certain sense it's a lot of people
 

5083
01:22:54,159 --> 01:22:55,750
a certain sense it's a lot of people
write to me with different theories

5084
01:22:55,750 --> 01:22:55,760
write to me with different theories
 

5085
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,830
write to me with different theories
about they have for how to create uh

5086
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
about they have for how to create uh
 

5087
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,830
about they have for how to create uh
general intelligence

5088
01:22:59,830 --> 01:22:59,840
general intelligence
 

5089
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,310
general intelligence
and it's again a little bit of an excuse

5090
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:02,320
and it's again a little bit of an excuse
 

5091
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,229
and it's again a little bit of an excuse
i say to myself like well i only have a

5092
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:04,239
i say to myself like well i only have a
 

5093
01:23:04,239 --> 01:23:06,470
i say to myself like well i only have a
limited amount of time so that's why i'm

5094
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
limited amount of time so that's why i'm
 

5095
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:09,750
limited amount of time so that's why i'm
not investigating it but i wonder if um

5096
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
not investigating it but i wonder if um
 

5097
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,510
not investigating it but i wonder if um
there's ideas out there

5098
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
there's ideas out there
 

5099
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,510
there's ideas out there
that are still powerful they're still

5100
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:13,520
that are still powerful they're still
 

5101
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,750
that are still powerful they're still
fascinating and that i'm missing because

5102
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
fascinating and that i'm missing because
 

5103
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:17,910
fascinating and that i'm missing because
i'm

5104
01:23:17,910 --> 01:23:17,920
i'm
 

5105
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,189
i'm
because i'm dismissing them

5106
01:23:21,189 --> 01:23:21,199
because i'm dismissing them
 

5107
01:23:21,199 --> 01:23:23,590
because i'm dismissing them
because they're outside of the sort of

5108
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:23,600
because they're outside of the sort of
 

5109
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,550
because they're outside of the sort of
the usual process of academic research

5110
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:26,560
the usual process of academic research
 

5111
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,310
the usual process of academic research
yeah well i mean the same thing and

5112
01:23:28,310 --> 01:23:28,320
yeah well i mean the same thing and
 

5113
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,830
yeah well i mean the same thing and
pretty much every day in my email

5114
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
pretty much every day in my email
 

5115
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,149
pretty much every day in my email
there's a somebody's got a

5116
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:32,159
there's a somebody's got a
 

5117
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,590
there's a somebody's got a
theory of everything about why all of

5118
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:33,600
theory of everything about why all of
 

5119
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,030
theory of everything about why all of
what physicists are doing

5120
01:23:37,030 --> 01:23:37,040

 

5121
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,470

perhaps the most disturbing thing i

5122
01:23:38,470 --> 01:23:38,480
perhaps the most disturbing thing i
 

5123
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,629
perhaps the most disturbing thing i
should say about my uh critique being a

5124
01:23:40,629 --> 01:23:40,639
should say about my uh critique being a
 

5125
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:42,149
should say about my uh critique being a
critic of string theory is is that when

5126
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:42,159
critic of string theory is is that when
 

5127
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:44,070
critic of string theory is is that when
you realize who your fans are

5128
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
you realize who your fans are
 

5129
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,590
you realize who your fans are
um that they

5130
01:23:45,590 --> 01:23:45,600
um that they
 

5131
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,189
um that they
every day i hear from somebody that oh

5132
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:47,199
every day i hear from somebody that oh
 

5133
01:23:47,199 --> 01:23:48,550
every day i hear from somebody that oh
well since you don't like string theory

5134
01:23:48,550 --> 01:23:48,560
well since you don't like string theory
 

5135
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:49,990
well since you don't like string theory
you must of course agree with me that

5136
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,000
you must of course agree with me that
 

5137
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:51,270
you must of course agree with me that
this is the right way to think about

5138
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
this is the right way to think about
 

5139
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,149
this is the right way to think about
everything

5140
01:23:52,149 --> 01:23:52,159
everything
 

5141
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:53,830
everything
oh no oh no

5142
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
oh no oh no
 

5143
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:55,189
oh no oh no
and you know

5144
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
and you know
 

5145
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:56,629
and you know
most of these

5146
01:23:56,629 --> 01:23:56,639
most of these
 

5147
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,390
most of these
are you know you quickly you can see

5148
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:58,400
are you know you quickly you can see
 

5149
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:00,629
are you know you quickly you can see
this is person doesn't know very much

5150
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:00,639
this is person doesn't know very much
 

5151
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:02,229
this is person doesn't know very much
and doesn't know what they're doing you

5152
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:02,239
and doesn't know what they're doing you
 

5153
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,709
and doesn't know what they're doing you
know but there's a whole continuum to

5154
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:04,719
know but there's a whole continuum to
 

5155
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:06,550
know but there's a whole continuum to
you know people who are quite serious

5156
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:06,560
you know people who are quite serious
 

5157
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:08,070
you know people who are quite serious
physicists and mathematicians who are

5158
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,080
physicists and mathematicians who are
 

5159
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,550
physicists and mathematicians who are
making a fairly serious attempt to try

5160
01:24:10,550 --> 01:24:10,560
making a fairly serious attempt to try
 

5161
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,110
making a fairly serious attempt to try
to to do something and like like eric

5162
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
to to do something and like like eric
 

5163
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,510
to to do something and like like eric
and uh and eric and then

5164
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
and uh and eric and then
 

5165
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,590
and uh and eric and then
then your your problem is

5166
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:17,600
then your your problem is
 

5167
01:24:17,600 --> 01:24:19,110
then your your problem is
you know you spent you

5168
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:19,120
you know you spent you
 

5169
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:21,189
you know you spent you
you do so won't try to spend more time

5170
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:21,199
you do so won't try to spend more time
 

5171
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:22,550
you do so won't try to spend more time
looking at it and try to figure out what

5172
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
looking at it and try to figure out what
 

5173
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:24,709
looking at it and try to figure out what
they're really doing but

5174
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
they're really doing but
 

5175
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,149
they're really doing but
then at some point you just realize wait

5176
01:24:26,149 --> 01:24:26,159
then at some point you just realize wait
 

5177
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,510
then at some point you just realize wait
a minute you know for me to really

5178
01:24:27,510 --> 01:24:27,520
a minute you know for me to really
 

5179
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,790
a minute you know for me to really
really understand exactly what's going

5180
01:24:28,790 --> 01:24:28,800
really understand exactly what's going
 

5181
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,870
really understand exactly what's going
on here would just

5182
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:30,880
on here would just
 

5183
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,910
on here would just
take

5184
01:24:31,910 --> 01:24:31,920
take
 

5185
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:33,430
take
time i just don't have

5186
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:33,440
time i just don't have
 

5187
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,950
time i just don't have
yeah it takes a long time which is the

5188
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,960
yeah it takes a long time which is the
 

5189
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,030
yeah it takes a long time which is the
nice thing about ai

5190
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
nice thing about ai
 

5191
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,669
nice thing about ai
is unlike the kind of physics we're

5192
01:24:39,669 --> 01:24:39,679
is unlike the kind of physics we're
 

5193
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:40,950
is unlike the kind of physics we're
talking about

5194
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
talking about
 

5195
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,110
talking about
if your idea is good

5196
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
if your idea is good
 

5197
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,470
if your idea is good
that should

5198
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
that should
 

5199
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,350
that should
quite naturally lead to you being able

5200
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:47,360
quite naturally lead to you being able
 

5201
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,669
quite naturally lead to you being able
to build a system that's intelligent

5202
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:49,679
to build a system that's intelligent
 

5203
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:51,750
to build a system that's intelligent
so you don't need to get approval from

5204
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:51,760
so you don't need to get approval from
 

5205
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,350
so you don't need to get approval from
somebody that's saying you have a good

5206
01:24:53,350 --> 01:24:53,360
somebody that's saying you have a good
 

5207
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:55,590
somebody that's saying you have a good
idea here you can just utilize that idea

5208
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
idea here you can just utilize that idea
 

5209
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,430
idea here you can just utilize that idea
and engineer a system like naturally

5210
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:57,440
and engineer a system like naturally
 

5211
01:24:57,440 --> 01:24:59,830
and engineer a system like naturally
leads to engineering with physics here

5212
01:24:59,830 --> 01:24:59,840
leads to engineering with physics here
 

5213
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,110
leads to engineering with physics here
if you have a

5214
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:01,120
if you have a
 

5215
01:25:01,120 --> 01:25:03,990
if you have a
perfect theory that explains everything

5216
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
perfect theory that explains everything
 

5217
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,790
perfect theory that explains everything
that still doesn't obviously lead one to

5218
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
that still doesn't obviously lead one to
 

5219
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:09,669
that still doesn't obviously lead one to
um

5220
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679

 

5221
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,430

to scientific experiments that can

5222
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:11,440
to scientific experiments that can
 

5223
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,390
to scientific experiments that can
validate that theory and two to like uh

5224
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:14,400
validate that theory and two to like uh
 

5225
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,390
validate that theory and two to like uh
trinkets you can build and sell right

5226
01:25:16,390 --> 01:25:16,400
trinkets you can build and sell right
 

5227
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,390

well let me also ask you about something

5238
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,600
well let me also ask you about something
 

5239
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:29,830
well let me also ask you about something
that you found especially recently

5240
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:29,840
that you found especially recently
 

5241
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,669
that you found especially recently

twister theory
 

5245
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:35,990
twister theory
what is it what kind of questions might

5246
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:36,000
what is it what kind of questions might
 

5247
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,830
what is it what kind of questions might
it allow us to answer

5248
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
it allow us to answer
 

5249
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,990
it allow us to answer
what will the answers look like it's

5250
01:25:39,990 --> 01:25:40,000
what will the answers look like it's
 

5251
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,070
what will the answers look like it's
only in the last couple years i really

5252
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
only in the last couple years i really
 

5253
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:43,990
only in the last couple years i really
really kind of come to really i think to

5254
01:25:43,990 --> 01:25:44,000
really kind of come to really i think to
 

5255
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,669
really kind of come to really i think to
appreciate it and to see how to really

5256
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:45,679
appreciate it and to see how to really
 

5257
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:47,350
appreciate it and to see how to really
what i i believe to see how to really do

5258
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:47,360
what i i believe to see how to really do
 

5259
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,030
what i i believe to see how to really do
something with it and i've gotten very

5260
01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,040
something with it and i've gotten very
 

5261
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,430
something with it and i've gotten very
excited about that last year too i mean

5262
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:51,440
excited about that last year too i mean
 

5263
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,430
excited about that last year too i mean
one way of saying

5264
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:53,440
one way of saying
 

5265
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,110
one way of saying
one idea of twister theory is that what

5266
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,120
one idea of twister theory is that what
 

5267
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,270
one idea of twister theory is that what
it's it's it's a different

it's it's it's a different
 

5269
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,950
it's it's it's a different
way of thinking about

01:25:58,950 --> 01:25:58,960
way of thinking about
 

5271
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:01,189
way of thinking about
what space and time are and about what

5272
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
what space and time are and about what
 

5273
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,110
what space and time are and about what
points in space and time are

5274
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,120
points in space and time are
 

5275
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,550
points in space and time are
but but which only which is very

5276
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
but but which only which is very
 

5277
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,149
but but which only which is very
interesting that it only really works in

5278
01:26:06,149 --> 01:26:06,159
interesting that it only really works in
 

5279
01:26:06,159 --> 01:26:08,310
interesting that it only really works in
four dimensions so four dimensions

5280
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:08,320
four dimensions so four dimensions
 

5281
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,070
four dimensions so four dimensions
behaves very very specially unlike other

5282
01:26:10,070 --> 01:26:10,080
behaves very very specially unlike other
 

5283
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:12,149
behaves very very specially unlike other
dimensions and in four dimensions

5284
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
dimensions and in four dimensions
 

5285
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:13,189
dimensions and in four dimensions
there's certain

5286
01:26:13,189 --> 01:26:13,199
there's certain
 

5287
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:15,270
there's certain
there is a way of thinking about

5288
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:15,280
there is a way of thinking about
 

5289
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:17,430
there is a way of thinking about
space and time geometry where you know

5290
01:26:17,430 --> 01:26:17,440
space and time geometry where you know
 

5291
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:19,189
space and time geometry where you know
as well as just thinking about

5292
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
as well as just thinking about
 

5293
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:21,110
as well as just thinking about
points in space and time

5294
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,120
points in space and time
 

5295
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:22,709
points in space and time
you can also

5296
01:26:22,709 --> 01:26:22,719
you can also
 

5297
01:26:22,719 --> 01:26:23,910
you can also
um

5298
01:26:23,910 --> 01:26:23,920
um
 

5299
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:25,270
um
think about different objects it's all

5300
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:25,280
think about different objects it's all
 

5301
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,270
think about different objects it's all
called twisters and then when you do

5302
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
called twisters and then when you do
 

5303
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,669
called twisters and then when you do
that you end up with a um kind of a

5304
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
that you end up with a um kind of a
 

5305
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:32,470
that you end up with a um kind of a
really interesting insight that the um

5306
01:26:32,470 --> 01:26:32,480
really interesting insight that the um
 

5307
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:33,590
really interesting insight that the um
that

5308
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
that
 

5309
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,070
that
you can formulate a theory and you can

5310
01:26:36,070 --> 01:26:36,080
you can formulate a theory and you can
 

5311
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:38,229
you can formulate a theory and you can
formulate a very take a standard theory

5312
01:26:38,229 --> 01:26:38,239
formulate a very take a standard theory
 

5313
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,229
formulate a very take a standard theory
that we formulated in terms of points of

5314
01:26:40,229 --> 01:26:40,239
that we formulated in terms of points of
 

5315
01:26:40,239 --> 01:26:43,030
that we formulated in terms of points of
space and time and you can reformulate

5316
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,040
space and time and you can reformulate
 

5317
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,790
space and time and you can reformulate
in this twister language and in this

5318
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
in this twister language and in this
 

5319
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:47,669
in this twister language and in this
twister language it's the um

5320
01:26:47,669 --> 01:26:47,679
twister language it's the um
 

5321
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:49,189
twister language it's the um
the fundamental objects actually are

5322
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
the fundamental objects actually are
 

5323
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:51,430
the fundamental objects actually are
more kind of the

5324
01:26:51,430 --> 01:26:51,440
more kind of the
 

5325
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,189
more kind of the
are actually spheres in some sense kind

5326
01:26:53,189 --> 01:26:53,199
are actually spheres in some sense kind
 

5327
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:56,070
are actually spheres in some sense kind
of the light cone so maybe one

5328
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
of the light cone so maybe one
 

5329
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,229
of the light cone so maybe one
way to say it which actually i think is

5330
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
way to say it which actually i think is
 

5331
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,790
way to say it which actually i think is
is really

5332
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800

 

5333
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,870

is quite amazing is if you ask yourself

5334
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:02,880
is quite amazing is if you ask yourself
 

5335
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,629
is quite amazing is if you ask yourself
you know what do we know about about the

5336
01:27:04,629 --> 01:27:04,639
you know what do we know about about the
 

5337
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:06,870
you know what do we know about about the
world we have this idea that

5338
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:06,880
world we have this idea that
 

5339
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,950
world we have this idea that
the world out there is this all these

5340
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
the world out there is this all these
 

5341
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,189
the world out there is this all these
different points in these points

5342
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
different points in these points
 

5343
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,030
different points in these points
well that's kind of a derived quantity

5344
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:13,040
well that's kind of a derived quantity
 

5345
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:14,390
well that's kind of a derived quantity
what really really know about the world

5346
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
what really really know about the world
 

5347
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:17,590
what really really know about the world
is when we open our eyes what do you see

5348
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
is when we open our eyes what do you see
 

5349
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,430
is when we open our eyes what do you see
you see a sphere

5350
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
you see a sphere
 

5351
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,950
you see a sphere
and you and that what you're looking at

5352
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:20,960
and you and that what you're looking at
 

5353
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:23,110
and you and that what you're looking at
is you're looking at this you know a

5354
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,120
is you're looking at this you know a
 

5355
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,350
is you're looking at this you know a
sphere is worth a light rays coming into

5356
01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:25,360
sphere is worth a light rays coming into
 

5357
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,830
sphere is worth a light rays coming into
into your eyes and what penrose says is

5358
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
into your eyes and what penrose says is
 

5359
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,030
into your eyes and what penrose says is
that

5360
01:27:29,030 --> 01:27:29,040
that
 

5361
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:32,070
that
well what what a point in space-time is

5362
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:32,080
well what what a point in space-time is
 

5363
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,669
well what what a point in space-time is
is that sphere

5364
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
is that sphere
 

5365
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,830
is that sphere
that sphere of all the light rays coming

5366
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,840
that sphere of all the light rays coming
 

5367
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:37,750
that sphere of all the light rays coming
in and and he says and you should

5368
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:37,760
in and and he says and you should
 

5369
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,750
in and and he says and you should
formulate your um instead of thinking

5370
01:27:39,750 --> 01:27:39,760
formulate your um instead of thinking
 

5371
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,910
formulate your um instead of thinking
about points you should think about the

5372
01:27:41,910 --> 01:27:41,920
about points you should think about the
 

5373
01:27:41,920 --> 01:27:44,870
about points you should think about the
space of those spheres if you like and

5374
01:27:44,870 --> 01:27:44,880
space of those spheres if you like and
 

5375
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:46,790
space of those spheres if you like and
formulate the degrees of freedom as

5376
01:27:46,790 --> 01:27:46,800
formulate the degrees of freedom as
 

5377
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:49,270
formulate the degrees of freedom as
physics that's living on those fears

5378
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:49,280
physics that's living on those fears
 

5379
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,030
physics that's living on those fears
living on so you're kind of you're kind

5380
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:51,040
living on so you're kind of you're kind
 

5381
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,629
living on so you're kind of you're kind
of living on your degrees of freedom are

5382
01:27:52,629 --> 01:27:52,639
of living on your degrees of freedom are
 

5383
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:55,030
of living on your degrees of freedom are
living on light rays not on points

5384
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:55,040
living on light rays not on points
 

5385
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,390
living on light rays not on points
and it's a very different way of

5386
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
and it's a very different way of
 

5387
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,430
and it's a very different way of
thinking about um

5388
01:27:59,430 --> 01:27:59,440

 

5389
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,750

about about physics and you know he and

5390
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:01,760
about about physics and you know he and
 

5391
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,790
about about physics and you know he and
others working with him developed a

5392
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:04,800
others working with him developed a
 

5393
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,950
others working with him developed a
you know a beautiful mathematical this

5394
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:06,960
you know a beautiful mathematical this
 

5395
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:08,470
you know a beautiful mathematical this
beautiful mathematical formalism and a

5396
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
beautiful mathematical formalism and a
 

5397
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,149
beautiful mathematical formalism and a
way to go back and forth between our

5398
01:28:10,149 --> 01:28:10,159
way to go back and forth between our
 

5399
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:12,629
way to go back and forth between our
kind of some aspects of our standard way

5400
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
kind of some aspects of our standard way
 

5401
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:15,350
kind of some aspects of our standard way
we write these things down and

5402
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:15,360
we write these things down and
 

5403
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,590
we write these things down and
work on the so-called twister space and

5404
01:28:17,590 --> 01:28:17,600
work on the so-called twister space and
 

5405
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:19,030
work on the so-called twister space and
you know they

5406
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,040
you know they
 

5407
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:20,390
you know they
certain things worked out very well but

5408
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
certain things worked out very well but
 

5409
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:21,590
certain things worked out very well but
they ended up

5410
01:28:21,590 --> 01:28:21,600
they ended up
 

5411
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,470
they ended up
you know

5412
01:28:22,470 --> 01:28:22,480
you know
 

5413
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,870
you know
i think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s

5414
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:24,880
i think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s
 

5415
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:26,709
i think kind of stuck by the 80s or 90s
that they weren't

5416
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:26,719
that they weren't
 

5417
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:27,990
that they weren't
a little bit like string theory that

5418
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,000
a little bit like string theory that
 

5419
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,590
a little bit like string theory that
they they um

5420
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:29,600
they they um
 

5421
01:28:29,600 --> 01:28:31,270
they they um
by using these ideas about twisters they

5422
01:28:31,270 --> 01:28:31,280
by using these ideas about twisters they
 

5423
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,310
by using these ideas about twisters they
could develop them in different

5424
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:32,320
could develop them in different
 

5425
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:33,990
could develop them in different
directions and find all sorts of other

5426
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
directions and find all sorts of other
 

5427
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,830
directions and find all sorts of other
interesting things but they were they

5428
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
interesting things but they were they
 

5429
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,590
interesting things but they were they
were getting they weren't finding any

5430
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
were getting they weren't finding any
 

5431
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,750
were getting they weren't finding any
way of doing that that brought them back

5432
01:28:39,750 --> 01:28:39,760
way of doing that that brought them back
 

5433
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:43,030
way of doing that that brought them back
to kind of new insights into physics

5434
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,040
to kind of new insights into physics
 

5435
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,950
to kind of new insights into physics
and um my own i mean what's kind of

5436
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:44,960
and um my own i mean what's kind of
 

5437
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:47,110
and um my own i mean what's kind of
gotten me excited really is is that what

5438
01:28:47,110 --> 01:28:47,120
gotten me excited really is is that what
 

5439
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,590
gotten me excited really is is that what
i think i have an idea about

5440
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:49,600
i think i have an idea about
 

5441
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,990
i think i have an idea about
that i think does actually does actually

5442
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:52,000
that i think does actually does actually
 

5443
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,070
that i think does actually does actually
work that goes more in that direction

5444
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,080
work that goes more in that direction
 

5445
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,629
work that goes more in that direction
and um i can go on about that endlessly

5446
01:28:56,629 --> 01:28:56,639
and um i can go on about that endlessly
 

5447
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,070
and um i can go on about that endlessly
or talk a little bit about it but that's

5448
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
or talk a little bit about it but that's
 

5449
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,390
or talk a little bit about it but that's
the um

5450
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:00,400
the um
 

5451
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:02,470
the um
i think that that's the one kind of easy

5452
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:02,480
i think that that's the one kind of easy
 

5453
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:05,110
i think that that's the one kind of easy
to explain insight about twister theory

5454
01:29:05,110 --> 01:29:05,120
to explain insight about twister theory
 

5455
01:29:05,120 --> 01:29:06,870
to explain insight about twister theory
there are some more technical ones i

5456
01:29:06,870 --> 01:29:06,880
there are some more technical ones i
 

5457
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:08,709
there are some more technical ones i
should mean i think it's also very

5458
01:29:08,709 --> 01:29:08,719
should mean i think it's also very
 

5459
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:10,070
should mean i think it's also very
convincing what it tells you about

5460
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:10,080
convincing what it tells you about
 

5461
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:12,149
convincing what it tells you about
spinners for instance but that's more

5462
01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:12,159
spinners for instance but that's more
 

5463
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:14,149
spinners for instance but that's more
technical well first let's like linger

5464
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
technical well first let's like linger
 

5465
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:17,590
technical well first let's like linger
on the spheres and the light cones

5466
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:17,600
on the spheres and the light cones
 

5467
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,510
on the spheres and the light cones
you're saying twisted theory allows you

5468
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:19,520
you're saying twisted theory allows you
 

5469
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:20,390
you're saying twisted theory allows you
to

5470
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:20,400
to
 

5471
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:22,310
to
make that the fundamental object with

5472
01:29:22,310 --> 01:29:22,320
make that the fundamental object with
 

5473
01:29:22,320 --> 01:29:24,550
make that the fundamental object with
which you're operating yeah

5474
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:24,560
which you're operating yeah
 

5475
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,550
which you're operating yeah
how that i mean first of all like

5476
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
how that i mean first of all like
 

5477
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,709
how that i mean first of all like
philosophically that's

5478
01:29:28,709 --> 01:29:28,719
philosophically that's
 

5479
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:29,750
philosophically that's
weird

5480
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:29,760
weird
 

5481
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,470
weird
and beautiful

5482
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:32,480

 

5483
01:29:32,480 --> 01:29:34,390

maybe because it maps

5484
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:34,400
maybe because it maps
 

5485
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,950
maybe because it maps
it feels like it moves us so much closer

5486
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:36,960
it feels like it moves us so much closer
 

5487
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:37,669
it feels like it moves us so much closer
to

5488
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
to
 

5489
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:40,310
to
the way human brains perceive reality

5490
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
the way human brains perceive reality
 

5491
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,709
the way human brains perceive reality
yeah so it's almost like um

5492
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719

 

5493
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,830

our perception is

5494
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:47,840
our perception is
 

5495
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:51,430
our perception is
like the the content of our perception

5496
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
like the the content of our perception
 

5497
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:54,390
like the the content of our perception
is the fundamental object of reality

5498
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:54,400
is the fundamental object of reality
 

5499
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:57,110
is the fundamental object of reality
that's very appealing yeah

5500
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
that's very appealing yeah
 

5501
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:59,669
that's very appealing yeah
is it mathematically

5502
01:29:59,669 --> 01:29:59,679
is it mathematically
 

5503
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:01,669
is it mathematically
powerful

5504
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
powerful
 

5505
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,350
powerful
is there something you can

5506
01:30:03,350 --> 01:30:03,360
is there something you can
 

5507
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:04,550
is there something you can
say

5508
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:04,560
say
 

5509
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,070
say
can you say a little bit more about what

5510
01:30:06,070 --> 01:30:06,080
can you say a little bit more about what
 

5511
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,189
can you say a little bit more about what
the heck that even means uh for because

5512
01:30:09,189 --> 01:30:09,199
the heck that even means uh for because
 

5513
01:30:09,199 --> 01:30:10,470
the heck that even means uh for because
it's much easier to think about

5514
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:10,480
it's much easier to think about
 

5515
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,310
it's much easier to think about
mathematically like a point

5516
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
mathematically like a point
 

5517
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,390
mathematically like a point
in space time like what does it mean to

5518
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:14,400
in space time like what does it mean to
 

5519
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:16,709
in space time like what does it mean to
be operating on the light cone

5520
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:16,719
be operating on the light cone
 

5521
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:18,709
be operating on the light cone
it uses a kind of mathematics that's

5522
01:30:18,709 --> 01:30:18,719
it uses a kind of mathematics that's
 

5523
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,629
it uses a kind of mathematics that's
relative that you know what was kind of

5524
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:20,639
relative that you know what was kind of
 

5525
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,149
relative that you know what was kind of
goes back to the 19th century among

5526
01:30:22,149 --> 01:30:22,159
goes back to the 19th century among
 

5527
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:24,550
goes back to the 19th century among
mathematicians it's not um

5528
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
mathematicians it's not um
 

5529
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,550
mathematicians it's not um
anyway it's a bit of a long story but

5530
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:26,560
anyway it's a bit of a long story but
 

5531
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,709
anyway it's a bit of a long story but
one problem is that you have to start

5532
01:30:28,709 --> 01:30:28,719
one problem is that you have to start
 

5533
01:30:28,719 --> 01:30:30,229
one problem is that you have to start
it's crucial that you think in terms of

5534
01:30:30,229 --> 01:30:30,239
it's crucial that you think in terms of
 

5535
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:32,310
it's crucial that you think in terms of
complex numbers and not just real

5536
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:32,320
complex numbers and not just real
 

5537
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,590
complex numbers and not just real
numbers and

5538
01:30:33,590 --> 01:30:33,600
numbers and
 

5539
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,350
numbers and
this for most people that makes it

5540
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
this for most people that makes it
 

5541
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:37,430
this for most people that makes it
harder to for mathematicians that's fine

5542
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:37,440
harder to for mathematicians that's fine
 

5543
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,270
harder to for mathematicians that's fine
we love doing that but for most people

5544
01:30:39,270 --> 01:30:39,280
we love doing that but for most people
 

5545
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:40,950
we love doing that but for most people
that makes it harder to think about but

5546
01:30:40,950 --> 01:30:40,960
that makes it harder to think about but
 

5547
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,270
that makes it harder to think about but
um i i think perhaps the most the way

5548
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:43,280
um i i think perhaps the most the way
 

5549
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,430
um i i think perhaps the most the way
that there is a uh something you can say

5550
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:45,440
that there is a uh something you can say
 

5551
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,669
that there is a uh something you can say
very specifically about it

5552
01:30:47,669 --> 01:30:47,679
very specifically about it
 

5553
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:49,189
very specifically about it
you know in terms of spinners which i

5554
01:30:49,189 --> 01:30:49,199
you know in terms of spinners which i
 

5555
01:30:49,199 --> 01:30:50,470
you know in terms of spinners which i
don't know if you want to i think at

5556
01:30:50,470 --> 01:30:50,480
don't know if you want to i think at
 

5557
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:51,590
don't know if you want to i think at
some point yeah

5558
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
some point yeah
 

5559
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,510
some point yeah
so maybe what are spinners let's start

5560
01:30:53,510 --> 01:30:53,520
so maybe what are spinners let's start
 

5561
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,110
so maybe what are spinners let's start
with spinner because i think that if we

5562
01:30:55,110 --> 01:30:55,120
with spinner because i think that if we
 

5563
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,110
with spinner because i think that if we
can introduce that then i can

5564
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,120
can introduce that then i can
 

5565
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,390
can introduce that then i can
by the way

5566
01:30:58,390 --> 01:30:58,400
by the way
 

5567
01:30:58,400 --> 01:31:00,870
by the way
twister spell with an o

5568
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:00,880
twister spell with an o
 

5569
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:03,669
twister spell with an o
and spinner is spelled with an o as well

5570
01:31:03,669 --> 01:31:03,679
and spinner is spelled with an o as well
 

5571
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,110
and spinner is spelled with an o as well
yes okay

5572
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:05,120
yes okay
 

5573
01:31:05,120 --> 01:31:06,790
yes okay
so in case you want to google it and

5574
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:06,800
so in case you want to google it and
 

5575
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:08,709
so in case you want to google it and
look it up that's very nice wikipedia

5576
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
look it up that's very nice wikipedia
 

5577
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:11,110
look it up that's very nice wikipedia
pages as a starting point i don't know

5578
01:31:11,110 --> 01:31:11,120
pages as a starting point i don't know
 

5579
01:31:11,120 --> 01:31:12,390
pages as a starting point i don't know
what is a good starting point for

5580
01:31:12,390 --> 01:31:12,400
what is a good starting point for
 

5581
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:14,709
what is a good starting point for
twister theory

5582
01:31:14,709 --> 01:31:14,719
twister theory
 

5583
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,390
twister theory
one thing you say about penrose i mean

5584
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:16,400
one thing you say about penrose i mean
 

5585
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:17,990
one thing you say about penrose i mean
penrose is actually a very good writer

5586
01:31:17,990 --> 01:31:18,000
penrose is actually a very good writer
 

5587
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,590
penrose is actually a very good writer
and also very good draftsman he's on

5588
01:31:19,590 --> 01:31:19,600
and also very good draftsman he's on
 

5589
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:21,110
and also very good draftsman he's on
drafts he to the extent this is

5590
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:21,120
drafts he to the extent this is
 

5591
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:22,709
drafts he to the extent this is
visualizable he actually has done some

5592
01:31:22,709 --> 01:31:22,719
visualizable he actually has done some
 

5593
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:25,270
visualizable he actually has done some
very nice drawings so i mean almost any

5594
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:25,280
very nice drawings so i mean almost any
 

5595
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:26,870
very nice drawings so i mean almost any
kind of expository thing you can find

5596
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
kind of expository thing you can find
 

5597
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,870
kind of expository thing you can find
him writing is is a very good a good

5598
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:28,880
him writing is is a very good a good
 

5599
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:30,629
him writing is is a very good a good
place to start he's a

5600
01:31:30,629 --> 01:31:30,639
place to start he's a
 

5601
01:31:30,639 --> 01:31:34,229
place to start he's a
he's a remarkable person but the um

5602
01:31:34,229 --> 01:31:34,239
he's a remarkable person but the um
 

5603
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,110
he's a remarkable person but the um
so

5604
01:31:35,110 --> 01:31:35,120
so
 

5605
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,149
so
spinners are something that

5606
01:31:36,149 --> 01:31:36,159
spinners are something that
 

5607
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:38,229
spinners are something that
independently came out of mathematics

5608
01:31:38,229 --> 01:31:38,239
independently came out of mathematics
 

5609
01:31:38,239 --> 01:31:39,990
independently came out of mathematics
and out of physics

5610
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:40,000
and out of physics
 

5611
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,830
and out of physics
and um to say where they came out of

5612
01:31:41,830 --> 01:31:41,840
and um to say where they came out of
 

5613
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:43,750
and um to say where they came out of
physics i mean what people realized when

5614
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:43,760
physics i mean what people realized when
 

5615
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,030
physics i mean what people realized when
they started looking at elementary

5616
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:45,040
they started looking at elementary
 

5617
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,950
they started looking at elementary
particles like electrons

5618
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:46,960
particles like electrons
 

5619
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,550
particles like electrons
or whatever that there there seemed to

5620
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
or whatever that there there seemed to
 

5621
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,149
or whatever that there there seemed to
be

5622
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:50,159
be
 

5623
01:31:50,159 --> 01:31:51,510
be
there seemed to be some kind of doubling

5624
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,520
there seemed to be some kind of doubling
 

5625
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,189
there seemed to be some kind of doubling
of the degrees of freedom going on if

5626
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:53,199
of the degrees of freedom going on if
 

5627
01:31:53,199 --> 01:31:53,910
of the degrees of freedom going on if
you

5628
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:53,920
you
 

5629
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:55,270
you
counted

5630
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:55,280
counted
 

5631
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:57,270
counted
what was there in some sense in the way

5632
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:57,280
what was there in some sense in the way
 

5633
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,030
what was there in some sense in the way
you would expect it and when you started

5634
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,040
you would expect it and when you started
 

5635
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:00,229
you would expect it and when you started
doing quantum mechanics and started

5636
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:00,239
doing quantum mechanics and started
 

5637
01:32:00,239 --> 01:32:01,750
doing quantum mechanics and started
looking at elementary particles there

5638
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:01,760
looking at elementary particles there
 

5639
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,590
looking at elementary particles there
were seem to be two degrees of freedom

5640
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:03,600
were seem to be two degrees of freedom
 

5641
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:04,790
were seem to be two degrees of freedom
they're not one

5642
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:04,800
they're not one
 

5643
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,910
they're not one
and one way of seeing it was that if you

5644
01:32:07,910 --> 01:32:07,920
and one way of seeing it was that if you
 

5645
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:10,310
and one way of seeing it was that if you
if you put your electron in a strong

5646
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,320
if you put your electron in a strong
 

5647
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:11,750
if you put your electron in a strong
magnetic field

5648
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:11,760
magnetic field
 

5649
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,669
magnetic field
and asked and asked what was the energy

5650
01:32:13,669 --> 01:32:13,679
and asked and asked what was the energy
 

5651
01:32:13,679 --> 01:32:15,430
and asked and asked what was the energy
of it instead of it having one energy it

5652
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:15,440
of it instead of it having one energy it
 

5653
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:16,950
of it instead of it having one energy it
would have two energies there'd be two

5654
01:32:16,950 --> 01:32:16,960
would have two energies there'd be two
 

5655
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:19,350
would have two energies there'd be two
energy levels and as you

5656
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:19,360
energy levels and as you
 

5657
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:20,709
energy levels and as you
increase magnetic field the splitting

5658
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:20,719
increase magnetic field the splitting
 

5659
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,350
increase magnetic field the splitting
would increase so

5660
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:23,360
would increase so
 

5661
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:24,629
would increase so

01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
mechanics that the way to describe
 

5669
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,390
mechanics that the way to describe
particles was in terms of wave functions

5670
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:32,400
particles was in terms of wave functions
 

5671
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:34,470
particles was in terms of wave functions
and these wave functions were complex to

01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:34,480
and these wave functions were complex to
 

5673
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,629
and these wave functions were complex to
complex values well

complex values well
 

5675
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:37,990

can't get spinners
 

5825
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,310
can't get spinners
so there in some sense at there's some

5826
01:34:58,310 --> 01:34:58,320
so there in some sense at there's some
 

5827
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:00,870
so there in some sense at there's some
kind of level of lower level of geometry

5828
01:35:00,870 --> 01:35:00,880
kind of level of lower level of geometry
 

5829
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,310
kind of level of lower level of geometry
beyond what we thought it was which was

5830
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
beyond what we thought it was which was
 

5831
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,149
beyond what we thought it was which was
kind of spinner geometry

5832
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
kind of spinner geometry
 

5833
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,390
kind of spinner geometry
and this is something which

5834
01:35:06,390 --> 01:35:06,400
and this is something which
 

5835
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,149
and this is something which
even to this day when we teach graduate

5836
01:35:08,149 --> 01:35:08,159
even to this day when we teach graduate
 

5837
01:35:08,159 --> 01:35:10,629
even to this day when we teach graduate
courses in geometry we mostly

5838
01:35:10,629 --> 01:35:10,639
courses in geometry we mostly
 

5839
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:13,270
courses in geometry we mostly
don't talk about this because it's a bit

5840
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:13,280
don't talk about this because it's a bit
 

5841
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,189
don't talk about this because it's a bit
it's a bit hard to hard to do correctly

5842
01:35:15,189 --> 01:35:15,199
it's a bit hard to hard to do correctly
 

5843
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:16,870
it's a bit hard to hard to do correctly
if you start if you start with your

01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:16,880
if you start if you start with your
 

5845
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,510
if you start if you start with your
whole setup is in terms of vectors

5846
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
whole setup is in terms of vectors
 

5847
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,350
whole setup is in terms of vectors
getting describing things in terms of

5848
01:35:21,350 --> 01:35:21,360
getting describing things in terms of
 

5849
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:24,709
getting describing things in terms of
spinners is a whole different ball game

5850
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:24,719
spinners is a whole different ball game
 

5851
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,590
spinners is a whole different ball game
but um the but so but anyway it was just

5852
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
but um the but so but anyway it was just
 

5853
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,229
but um the but so but anyway it was just
this amazing fact that this

5854
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
this amazing fact that this
 

5855
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:32,310
this amazing fact that this
this kind of more fundamental piece of

5856
01:35:32,310 --> 01:35:32,320
this kind of more fundamental piece of
 

5857
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:34,629
this kind of more fundamental piece of
geometry spinners and what we were

5858
01:35:34,629 --> 01:35:34,639
geometry spinners and what we were
 

5859
01:35:34,639 --> 01:35:36,229
geometry spinners and what we were
actually seeing if you look at electron

5860
01:35:36,229 --> 01:35:36,239
actually seeing if you look at electron
 

5861
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,750
actually seeing if you look at electron
are one in the same

5862
01:35:37,750 --> 01:35:37,760
are one in the same
 

5863
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:39,510
are one in the same
so it's a

5864
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:39,520
so it's a
 

5865
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,470
so it's a
i think it's kind of kind of a

5866
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:40,480
i think it's kind of kind of a
 

5867
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,709
i think it's kind of kind of a
mind-blowing thing but it it's very uh

5868
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
mind-blowing thing but it it's very uh
 

5869
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,790
mind-blowing thing but it it's very uh
un counter-intuitive

5870
01:35:44,790 --> 01:35:44,800
un counter-intuitive
 

5871
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:46,229
un counter-intuitive
what are some weird properties of

5872
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:46,239
what are some weird properties of
 

5873
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:48,470
what are some weird properties of
spinners that are currently

5874
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:48,480
spinners that are currently
 

5875
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,229
spinners that are currently
counter-intuitive

5876
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:50,239
counter-intuitive
 

5877
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,510
counter-intuitive
there are some things that they do for

5878
01:35:51,510 --> 01:35:51,520
there are some things that they do for
 

5879
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,550
there are some things that they do for
instance if you rotate a spinner around

5880
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:54,560
instance if you rotate a spinner around
 

5881
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:57,430
instance if you rotate a spinner around
360 degrees it doesn't come back to

5882
01:35:57,430 --> 01:35:57,440
360 degrees it doesn't come back to
 

5883
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,430
360 degrees it doesn't come back to
where it's it it becomes minus what it

5884
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
where it's it it becomes minus what it
 

5885
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,189
where it's it it becomes minus what it
was

5886
01:36:01,189 --> 01:36:01,199
was
 

5887
01:36:01,199 --> 01:36:02,550
was
so it's

5888
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:02,560
so it's
 

5889
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,470
so it's
anyway so so the way rotations work

5890
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
anyway so so the way rotations work
 

5891
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,990
anyway so so the way rotations work
there's a kind of a funny sign you have

5892
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
there's a kind of a funny sign you have
 

5893
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,149
there's a kind of a funny sign you have
to keep track of in some sense um so

5894
01:36:08,149 --> 01:36:08,159
to keep track of in some sense um so
 

5895
01:36:08,159 --> 01:36:09,750
to keep track of in some sense um so
they're kind of too valued in a way

5896
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:09,760
they're kind of too valued in a way
 

5897
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:11,750
they're kind of too valued in a way
another weird way but there's but but

5898
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
another weird way but there's but but
 

5899
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,109
another weird way but there's but but
the fundamental problem is that it's

5900
01:36:13,109 --> 01:36:13,119
the fundamental problem is that it's
 

5901
01:36:13,119 --> 01:36:14,550
the fundamental problem is that it's
just not

5902
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
just not
 

5903
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,790
just not
if you're used to visualizing

5904
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
if you're used to visualizing
 

5905
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,109
if you're used to visualizing
vectors you just there's nothing you can

5906
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:19,119
vectors you just there's nothing you can
 

5907
01:36:19,119 --> 01:36:20,550
vectors you just there's nothing you can
do visualize in terms of vectors that

5908
01:36:20,550 --> 01:36:20,560
do visualize in terms of vectors that
 

5909
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,149
do visualize in terms of vectors that
will ever give you a spinner it just is

5910
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:22,159
will ever give you a spinner it just is
 

5911
01:36:22,159 --> 01:36:23,669
will ever give you a spinner it just is
not going to ever work

5912
01:36:23,669 --> 01:36:23,679
not going to ever work
 

5913
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:24,950
not going to ever work
as you were saying that i was

5914
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
as you were saying that i was
 

5915
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,350
as you were saying that i was
visualizing a vector walking along a

5916
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
visualizing a vector walking along a
 

5917
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,709
visualizing a vector walking along a
mobius strip

5918
01:36:28,709 --> 01:36:28,719
mobius strip
 

5919
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:31,590
mobius strip
yeah and it ends up being upside down

5920
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:31,600
yeah and it ends up being upside down
 

5921
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:33,669
yeah and it ends up being upside down
um but you're saying that doesn't really

5922
01:36:33,669 --> 01:36:33,679
um but you're saying that doesn't really
 

5923
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:34,629
um but you're saying that doesn't really
capture

5924
01:36:34,629 --> 01:36:34,639
capture
 

5925
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,550
capture
so i mean what really captures it the

5926
01:36:36,550 --> 01:36:36,560
so i mean what really captures it the
 

5927
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,510
so i mean what really captures it the
pro the problem is that it's really

5928
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:39,520
pro the problem is that it's really
 

5929
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,270
pro the problem is that it's really
the simplest way to describe it is in

5930
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
the simplest way to describe it is in
 

5931
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,669
the simplest way to describe it is in
terms of two complex numbers and your

5932
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
terms of two complex numbers and your
 

5933
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,030
terms of two complex numbers and your
problem with two complex numbers is

5934
01:36:45,030 --> 01:36:45,040
problem with two complex numbers is
 

5935
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,830
problem with two complex numbers is
that's four real numbers so

5936
01:36:47,830 --> 01:36:47,840
that's four real numbers so
 

5937
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,510
that's four real numbers so
your spinner kind of lies in a four

5938
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:49,520
your spinner kind of lies in a four
 

5939
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:52,550
your spinner kind of lies in a four
dimensional space so you that makes it

5940
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:52,560
dimensional space so you that makes it
 

5941
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,470
dimensional space so you that makes it
hard to visualize and

5942
01:36:54,470 --> 01:36:54,480
hard to visualize and
 

5943
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:56,709
hard to visualize and
it's crucial that it's not just any four

5944
01:36:56,709 --> 01:36:56,719
it's crucial that it's not just any four
 

5945
01:36:56,719 --> 01:36:58,390
it's crucial that it's not just any four
dimensions it's just it's actually

5946
01:36:58,390 --> 01:36:58,400
dimensions it's just it's actually
 

5947
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,830
dimensions it's just it's actually
complex numbers you're really going to

5948
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840
complex numbers you're really going to
 

5949
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,590
complex numbers you're really going to
use the fact that

5950
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:01,600
use the fact that
 

5951
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,629
use the fact that
these are the complex numbers so it um

5952
01:37:04,629 --> 01:37:04,639
these are the complex numbers so it um
 

5953
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:06,790
these are the complex numbers so it um
it's very hard to visualize but but to

5954
01:37:06,790 --> 01:37:06,800
it's very hard to visualize but but to
 

5955
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,189
it's very hard to visualize but but to
get back to what i think is mind-blowing

5956
01:37:09,189 --> 01:37:09,199
get back to what i think is mind-blowing
 

5957
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,470
get back to what i think is mind-blowing
about twisters

5958
01:37:10,470 --> 01:37:10,480
about twisters
 

5959
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,830
about twisters
is that the

5960
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:11,840
is that the
 

5961
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:13,830
is that the
another way of saying this this idea

5962
01:37:13,830 --> 01:37:13,840
another way of saying this this idea
 

5963
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:16,070
another way of saying this this idea
about talking about spheres another way

5964
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
about talking about spheres another way
 

5965
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,270
about talking about spheres another way
of saying the fundamental idea of

5966
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:17,280
of saying the fundamental idea of
 

5967
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,270
of saying the fundamental idea of
twister theory is

5968
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,280
twister theory is
 

5969
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,709
twister theory is
in some sense the fundamental idea of

5970
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
in some sense the fundamental idea of
 

5971
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:23,350
in some sense the fundamental idea of
twister theory is that a point

5972
01:37:23,350 --> 01:37:23,360
twister theory is that a point
 

5973
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,109
twister theory is that a point
is a two

5974
01:37:25,109 --> 01:37:25,119
is a two
 

5975
01:37:25,119 --> 01:37:26,229
is a two
is a two

5976
01:37:26,229 --> 01:37:26,239
is a two
 

5977
01:37:26,239 --> 01:37:28,709
is a two
is a two complex dimensional space so

5978
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:28,719
is a two complex dimensional space so
 

5979
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:30,310
is a two complex dimensional space so
that every

5980
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,320
that every
 

5981
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:32,470
that every
and that it lives inside the space that

5982
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:32,480
and that it lives inside the space that
 

5983
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:34,390
and that it lives inside the space that
it lies inside is twister space

5984
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:34,400
it lies inside is twister space
 

5985
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,229
it lies inside is twister space
so in the simplest case it's

5986
01:37:36,229 --> 01:37:36,239
so in the simplest case it's
 

5987
01:37:36,239 --> 01:37:38,390
so in the simplest case it's
for twister space is four dimensional

5988
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400
for twister space is four dimensional
 

5989
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,350
for twister space is four dimensional
and

5990
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
and
 

5991
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,070
and
a point in space time is a two complex

5992
01:37:42,070 --> 01:37:42,080
a point in space time is a two complex
 

5993
01:37:42,080 --> 01:37:43,270
a point in space time is a two complex
dimensional

5994
01:37:43,270 --> 01:37:43,280
dimensional
 

5995
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:44,070
dimensional
um

5996
01:37:44,070 --> 01:37:44,080
um
 

5997
01:37:44,080 --> 01:37:46,229
um
subspace of the f of all the four

5998
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
subspace of the f of all the four
 

5999
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:47,990
subspace of the f of all the four
complex dimensions and as you move

6000
01:37:47,990 --> 01:37:48,000
complex dimensions and as you move
 

6001
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,510
complex dimensions and as you move
around in space time you're just moving

6002
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:49,520
around in space time you're just moving
 

6003
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:52,229
around in space time you're just moving
your planes are just moving around okay

6004
01:37:52,229 --> 01:37:52,239
your planes are just moving around okay
 

6005
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:53,109
your planes are just moving around okay
and that

6006
01:37:53,109 --> 01:37:53,119
and that
 

6007
01:37:53,119 --> 01:37:55,590
and that
and but but then the it's a plane in a

6008
01:37:55,590 --> 01:37:55,600
and but but then the it's a plane in a
 

6009
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,910
and but but then the it's a plane in a
four-dimensional space it's a yeah it

6010
01:37:57,910 --> 01:37:57,920
four-dimensional space it's a yeah it
 

6011
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:00,390
four-dimensional space it's a yeah it
plays complex complex planes so it's two

6012
01:38:00,390 --> 01:38:00,400
plays complex complex planes so it's two
 

6013
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,790
plays complex complex planes so it's two
complex dimensions in four comics

6014
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:02,800
complex dimensions in four comics
 

6015
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,030
complex dimensions in four comics
okay but then to me the mind-blowing

6016
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
okay but then to me the mind-blowing
 

6017
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:07,030
okay but then to me the mind-blowing
thing about this is this then

6018
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
thing about this is this then
 

6019
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,790
thing about this is this then
kind of tautologically answers the

6020
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:08,800
kind of tautologically answers the
 

6021
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:12,310
kind of tautologically answers the
question is what is a spinner well

6022
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,320
question is what is a spinner well
 

6023
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,870
question is what is a spinner well
a spinner is a point i mean the space of

6024
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:14,880
a spinner is a point i mean the space of
 

6025
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,990
a spinner is a point i mean the space of
spinners at a point is the point in

6026
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
spinners at a point is the point in
 

6027
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,350
spinners at a point is the point in
twister theory

6028
01:38:19,350 --> 01:38:19,360
twister theory
 

6029
01:38:19,360 --> 01:38:21,350
twister theory
the points are the complex two planes

6030
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:21,360
the points are the complex two planes
 

6031
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:23,030
the points are the complex two planes
and and you want me to and you're asking

6032
01:38:23,030 --> 01:38:23,040
and and you want me to and you're asking
 

6033
01:38:23,040 --> 01:38:24,470
and and you want me to and you're asking
what a spinner is

6034
01:38:24,470 --> 01:38:24,480
what a spinner is
 

6035
01:38:24,480 --> 01:38:26,790
what a spinner is
well a spinner the space of spinners is

6036
01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:26,800
well a spinner the space of spinners is
 

6037
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,149
well a spinner the space of spinners is
that two plane

6038
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:28,159
that two plane
 

6039
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:31,030
that two plane
so it's you know just your whole

6040
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:31,040
so it's you know just your whole
 

6041
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,950
so it's you know just your whole
definition of what a pointed space time

6042
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
definition of what a pointed space time
 

6043
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:33,990
definition of what a pointed space time
was just

6044
01:38:33,990 --> 01:38:34,000
was just
 

6045
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,510
was just
told you what a spinner was it's they're

6046
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:35,520
told you what a spinner was it's they're
 

6047
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,189
told you what a spinner was it's they're
they're just it's the same thing yeah

6048
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
they're just it's the same thing yeah
 

6049
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,709
they're just it's the same thing yeah
we're trying to project that into a

6050
01:38:38,709 --> 01:38:38,719
we're trying to project that into a
 

6051
01:38:38,719 --> 01:38:40,550
we're trying to project that into a
three-dimensional space and trying to

6052
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:40,560
three-dimensional space and trying to
 

6053
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:42,149
three-dimensional space and trying to
intuit but yeah

6054
01:38:42,149 --> 01:38:42,159
intuit but yeah
 

6055
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:43,510
intuit but yeah
yeah so the intuition becomes very

6056
01:38:43,510 --> 01:38:43,520
yeah so the intuition becomes very
 

6057
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,990
yeah so the intuition becomes very
difficult but um but

6058
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
difficult but um but
 

6059
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,390
difficult but um but
from if you don't you not using twister

6060
01:38:48,390 --> 01:38:48,400
from if you don't you not using twister
 

6061
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:49,590
from if you don't you not using twister
theory

6062
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:49,600
theory
 

6063
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:51,189
theory
you have to kind of go through a certain

6064
01:38:51,189 --> 01:38:51,199
you have to kind of go through a certain
 

6065
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,350
you have to kind of go through a certain
fairly complicated rigor role to even

6066
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
fairly complicated rigor role to even
 

6067
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,750
fairly complicated rigor role to even
describe spinners to describe electrons

6068
01:38:55,750 --> 01:38:55,760
describe spinners to describe electrons
 

6069
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:57,430
describe spinners to describe electrons
whereas using twister theory it's just

6070
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:57,440
whereas using twister theory it's just
 

6071
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,910
whereas using twister theory it's just
completely tautological they're just

6072
01:38:59,910 --> 01:38:59,920
completely tautological they're just
 

6073
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:01,510
completely tautological they're just
what you want

6074
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
what you want
 

6075
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,950
what you want
to describe

6076
01:39:02,950 --> 01:39:02,960
to describe
 

6077
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:05,030
to describe
the electron is

6078
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040
the electron is
 

6079
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,709
the electron is
fundamentally the way you're describing

6080
01:39:06,709 --> 01:39:06,719
fundamentally the way you're describing
 

6081
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:08,229
fundamentally the way you're describing
the point in space-time already it's

6082
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:08,239
the point in space-time already it's
 

6083
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:09,350
the point in space-time already it's
just there

6084
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:09,360
just there
 

6085
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:10,550
just there
so

6086
01:39:10,550 --> 01:39:10,560
so
 

6087
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,229
so
do you have a hope you mentioned that

6088
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:12,239
do you have a hope you mentioned that
 

6089
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:14,149
do you have a hope you mentioned that
you've been uh you found it appealing

6090
01:39:14,149 --> 01:39:14,159
you've been uh you found it appealing
 

6091
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:16,629
you've been uh you found it appealing
recently is it just because of certain

6092
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
recently is it just because of certain
 

6093
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,629
recently is it just because of certain
aspects of its mathematical beauty or do

6094
01:39:18,629 --> 01:39:18,639
aspects of its mathematical beauty or do
 

6095
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,070
aspects of its mathematical beauty or do
you actually have a hope that this might

6096
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
you actually have a hope that this might
 

6097
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,390
you actually have a hope that this might
lead to a theory of everything

6098
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
lead to a theory of everything
 

6099
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,470
lead to a theory of everything
yeah i mean i certainly do have

6100
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:24,480
yeah i mean i certainly do have
 

6101
01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:26,470
yeah i mean i certainly do have
such a hope because what i've found i

6102
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:26,480
such a hope because what i've found i
 

6103
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:27,830
such a hope because what i've found i
think the thing which which i've done

6104
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
think the thing which which i've done
 

6105
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,430
think the thing which which i've done
which i i don't think as far as i can

6106
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
which i i don't think as far as i can
 

6107
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:31,350
which i i don't think as far as i can
tell no one had really looked at

6108
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:31,360
tell no one had really looked at
 

6109
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,350
tell no one had really looked at
from this point of view before

6110
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,360
from this point of view before
 

6111
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,910
from this point of view before
is

6112
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920

 

6113
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,510

has to do with it this question of how

6114
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:37,520
has to do with it this question of how
 

6115
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,270
has to do with it this question of how
do you how do you treat time in your in

6116
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,280
do you how do you treat time in your in
 

6117
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,990
do you how do you treat time in your in
your quantum theory and um

6118
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
your quantum theory and um
 

6119
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:42,870
your quantum theory and um
so

6120
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:42,880
so
 

6121
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,030
so
there's another long story about how we

6122
01:39:45,030 --> 01:39:45,040
there's another long story about how we
 

6123
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:45,750
there's another long story about how we
do

6124
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:45,760
do
 

6125
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,430
do
quantum theories and about how we treat

6126
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:47,440
quantum theories and about how we treat
 

6127
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,390
quantum theories and about how we treat
time and quantum theories which um

6128
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
time and quantum theories which um
 

6129
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,550
time and quantum theories which um
it is a long story but

6130
01:39:52,550 --> 01:39:52,560
it is a long story but
 

6131
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,310
it is a long story but
to me the short version of it is that

6132
01:39:54,310 --> 01:39:54,320
to me the short version of it is that
 

6133
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:55,830
to me the short version of it is that
what what people have found when you try

6134
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
what what people have found when you try
 

6135
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,310
what what people have found when you try
and write down a quantum theory

6136
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:58,320
and write down a quantum theory
 

6137
01:39:58,320 --> 01:39:59,590
and write down a quantum theory
that

6138
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
that
 

6139
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,189
that
it's often

6140
01:40:01,189 --> 01:40:01,199
it's often
 

6141
01:40:01,199 --> 01:40:03,990
it's often
it's often a good idea to take

6142
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,000
it's often a good idea to take
 

6143
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,590
it's often a good idea to take
your time coordinate whenever you're

6144
01:40:05,590 --> 01:40:05,600
your time coordinate whenever you're
 

6145
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:07,669
your time coordinate whenever you're
using your time coordinate and then

6146
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:07,679
using your time coordinate and then
 

6147
01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:09,510
using your time coordinate and then
multiply it by the square root of minus

6148
01:40:09,510 --> 01:40:09,520
multiply it by the square root of minus
 

6149
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:11,990
multiply it by the square root of minus
one and to make it purely imaginary and

6150
01:40:11,990 --> 01:40:12,000
one and to make it purely imaginary and
 

6151
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,510
one and to make it purely imaginary and
so you all these formulas which you have

6152
01:40:15,510 --> 01:40:15,520
so you all these formulas which you have
 

6153
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:16,870
so you all these formulas which you have
um

6154
01:40:16,870 --> 01:40:16,880
um
 

6155
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,030
um
in your standard theory if you do that

6156
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:19,040
in your standard theory if you do that
 

6157
01:40:19,040 --> 01:40:20,950
in your standard theory if you do that
to those i mean those those formulas

6158
01:40:20,950 --> 01:40:20,960
to those i mean those those formulas
 

6159
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:22,550
to those i mean those those formulas
have some very strange

6160
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:22,560
have some very strange
 

6161
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,070
have some very strange
strange behavior and they're kind of

6162
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:24,080
strange behavior and they're kind of
 

6163
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:25,189
strange behavior and they're kind of
singular

6164
01:40:25,189 --> 01:40:25,199
singular
 

6165
01:40:25,199 --> 01:40:27,590
singular
if you ask even some simple questions

6166
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:27,600
if you ask even some simple questions
 

6167
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,109
if you ask even some simple questions
you have to very

6168
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
you have to very
 

6169
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,950
you have to very
take very delicate singular limits in

6170
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
take very delicate singular limits in
 

6171
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,350
take very delicate singular limits in
order to get the correct answer and you

6172
01:40:33,350 --> 01:40:33,360
order to get the correct answer and you
 

6173
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,310
order to get the correct answer and you
have to take them from the right

6174
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:34,320
have to take them from the right
 

6175
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:36,790
have to take them from the right
direction otherwise it doesn't work

6176
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:36,800
direction otherwise it doesn't work
 

6177
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:39,430
direction otherwise it doesn't work
whereas if you just take time

6178
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:39,440
whereas if you just take time
 

6179
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:41,270
whereas if you just take time
and if you just put a factor of square

6180
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
and if you just put a factor of square
 

6181
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,629
and if you just put a factor of square
root of minus one wherever you see the

6182
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
root of minus one wherever you see the
 

6183
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:44,070
root of minus one wherever you see the
time coordinate

6184
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080
time coordinate
 

6185
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,990
time coordinate
you end up with

6186
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
you end up with
 

6187
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:47,669
you end up with
much simpler formulas which are much

6188
01:40:47,669 --> 01:40:47,679
much simpler formulas which are much
 

6189
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:49,750
much simpler formulas which are much
better behaved mathematically

6190
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:49,760
better behaved mathematically
 

6191
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,270
better behaved mathematically
and what i what i hadn't really

01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:51,280
and what i what i hadn't really
 

6193

appreciated until fairly recently is
 

6195
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,430
appreciated until fairly recently is
also how dramatically that changes the

6196
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,440
also how dramatically that changes the
 

6197
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,510
also how dramatically that changes the
whole structure of the theory you end up

6198
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:57,520
whole structure of the theory you end up
 

6199
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,070
whole structure of the theory you end up
with a consistent way of talking about

6200
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,080
with a consistent way of talking about
 

6201
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,109
with a consistent way of talking about
these quantum theories but it has very

6202
01:41:03,109 --> 01:41:03,119
these quantum theories but it has very
 

6203
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:04,390
these quantum theories but it has very
some very different flavor and very

6204
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,400
some very different flavor and very
 

6205
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,310
some very different flavor and very
different aspects that i hadn't really

6206
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
different aspects that i hadn't really
 

6207
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,189
different aspects that i hadn't really
appreciated and in particular the way

6208
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
appreciated and in particular the way
 

6209
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,750
appreciated and in particular the way
the way symmetries act on it is is not

6210
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:11,760
the way symmetries act on it is is not
 

6211
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,870
the way symmetries act on it is is not
at all what i originally had expected

6212
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:14,880
at all what i originally had expected
 

6213
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:15,830
at all what i originally had expected
and so

6214
01:41:15,830 --> 01:41:15,840
and so
 

6215
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:17,830
and so
that's the new thing that i've where i

6216
01:41:17,830 --> 01:41:17,840
that's the new thing that i've where i
 

6217
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,830
that's the new thing that i've where i
think i think gives you something is to

6218
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
think i think gives you something is to
 

6219
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:20,709
think i think gives you something is to
um

6220
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:20,719
um
 

6221
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,950
um
to do this move which people often think

6222
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:22,960
to do this move which people often think
 

6223
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,189
to do this move which people often think
of as just kind of a

6224
01:41:25,189 --> 01:41:25,199
of as just kind of a
 

6225
01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:26,870
of as just kind of a
kind of a mathematical trick that you're

6226
01:41:26,870 --> 01:41:26,880
kind of a mathematical trick that you're
 

6227
01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:28,870
kind of a mathematical trick that you're
doing to make some formulas work out

6228
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:28,880
doing to make some formulas work out
 

6229
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:31,030
doing to make some formulas work out
nicely but to take that mathematical

6230
01:41:31,030 --> 01:41:31,040
nicely but to take that mathematical
 

6231
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:33,030
nicely but to take that mathematical
trick as really fundamental

6232
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,040
trick as really fundamental
 

6233
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,750
trick as really fundamental
and um turns out in twister theory

6234
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
and um turns out in twister theory
 

6235
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,229
and um turns out in twister theory
allows you to simultaneously talk about

6236
01:41:38,229 --> 01:41:38,239
allows you to simultaneously talk about
 

6237
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:40,470
allows you to simultaneously talk about
your usual time and the time times the

6238
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:40,480
your usual time and the time times the
 

6239
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:42,709
your usual time and the time times the
square root of minus one they both

6240
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
square root of minus one they both
 

6241
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:44,550
square root of minus one they both
fit they both fit very nicely into

6242
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,560
fit they both fit very nicely into
 

6243
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:47,510
fit they both fit very nicely into
twister theory and um you end up with a

6244
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
twister theory and um you end up with a
 

6245
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,189
twister theory and um you end up with a
some structures which look a lot like

6246
01:41:49,189 --> 01:41:49,199
some structures which look a lot like
 

6247
01:41:49,199 --> 01:41:51,750
some structures which look a lot like
the standard model

6248
01:41:51,750 --> 01:41:51,760

of interesting bets on there yeah i
 

6277
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:22,629
of interesting bets on there yeah i
would love to participate but it's

6278
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
would love to participate but it's
 

6279
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:25,030
would love to participate but it's
interesting to see you know time flies

6280
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:25,040
interesting to see you know time flies
 

6281
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:25,990
interesting to see you know time flies
yeah

6282
01:42:25,990 --> 01:42:26,000
yeah
 

6283
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:27,830
yeah
and you make a bet about what's going to

6284
01:42:27,830 --> 01:42:27,840
and you make a bet about what's going to
 

6285
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,510
and you make a bet about what's going to
happen 20 years you don't realize 20

6286
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
happen 20 years you don't realize 20
 

6287
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:31,910
happen 20 years you don't realize 20
years just goes like this yeah yeah and

6288
01:42:31,910 --> 01:42:31,920
years just goes like this yeah yeah and
 

6289
01:42:31,920 --> 01:42:33,830
years just goes like this yeah yeah and
then and then you get to face oh and you

6290
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
then and then you get to face oh and you
 

6291
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:35,430
then and then you get to face oh and you
get to wonder

6292
01:42:35,430 --> 01:42:35,440
get to wonder
 

6293
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,350
get to wonder
like

6294
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
like
 

6295
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,229
like
what

6296
01:42:38,229 --> 01:42:38,239
what
 

6297
01:42:38,239 --> 01:42:41,189
what
was that person what was i thinking that

6298
01:42:41,189 --> 01:42:41,199
was that person what was i thinking that
 

6299
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:43,189
was that person what was i thinking that
person 20 years ago is almost like a

6300
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
person 20 years ago is almost like a
 

6301
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,390
person 20 years ago is almost like a
different person what was i thinking

6302
01:42:44,390 --> 01:42:44,400
different person what was i thinking
 

6303
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,229
different person what was i thinking
back then to think that

6304
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
back then to think that
 

6305
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:48,070
back then to think that
is interesting but so let me ask you

6306
01:42:48,070 --> 01:42:48,080
is interesting but so let me ask you
 

6307
01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:50,470
is interesting but so let me ask you
this on record

6308
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
this on record
 

6309
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,870
this on record
uh you know 20 years from now or some

6310
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:52,880
uh you know 20 years from now or some
 

6311
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:54,149
uh you know 20 years from now or some
number of years from now do you think

6312
01:42:54,149 --> 01:42:54,159
number of years from now do you think
 

6313
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,950
number of years from now do you think
there will be a nobel prize given for

6314
01:42:56,950 --> 01:42:56,960
there will be a nobel prize given for
 

6315
01:42:56,960 --> 01:42:59,430
there will be a nobel prize given for
something directly connected to a first

6316
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
something directly connected to a first
 

6317
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:01,669
something directly connected to a first
broadly theory of everything

6318
01:43:01,669 --> 01:43:01,679
broadly theory of everything
 

6319
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,109
broadly theory of everything
and second

6320
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
and second
 

6321
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:06,070
and second
of course one of the possibilities one

6322
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
of course one of the possibilities one
 

6323
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,270
of course one of the possibilities one
of them

6324
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:07,280
of them
 

6325
01:43:07,280 --> 01:43:08,629
of them
string theory

6326
01:43:08,629 --> 01:43:08,639
string theory
 

6327
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:10,870
string theory
um

6328
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
um
 

6329
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,229
um
strength

6330
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:12,239
strength
 

6331
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,189
strength
definitely not that uh things have gone

6332
01:43:15,189 --> 01:43:15,199
definitely not that uh things have gone
 

6333
01:43:15,199 --> 01:43:15,990
definitely not that uh things have gone
yeah

6334
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:16,000
yeah
 

6335
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,669
yeah
so fine if you were giving financial

6336
01:43:17,669 --> 01:43:17,679
so fine if you were giving financial
 

6337
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:19,350
so fine if you were giving financial
advice you would say not to bet no do

6338
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:19,360
advice you would say not to bet no do
 

6339
01:43:19,360 --> 01:43:20,229
advice you would say not to bet no do
not but

6340
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:20,239
not but
 

6341
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,709
not but
and and even i actually suspect if you

6342
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:22,719
and and even i actually suspect if you
 

6343
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:24,550
and and even i actually suspect if you
ask strength here is that question these

6344
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:24,560
ask strength here is that question these
 

6345
01:43:24,560 --> 01:43:26,870
ask strength here is that question these
as you you're going to get a few of them

6346
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
as you you're going to get a few of them
 

6347
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,550
as you you're going to get a few of them
saying i mean if you'd asked them that

6348
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:28,560
saying i mean if you'd asked them that
 

6349
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,629
saying i mean if you'd asked them that
question 20 years ago again when

6350
01:43:30,629 --> 01:43:30,639
question 20 years ago again when
 

6351
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:32,070
question 20 years ago again when
kaku was making this better whatever i

6352
01:43:32,070 --> 01:43:32,080
kaku was making this better whatever i
 

6353
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:33,750
kaku was making this better whatever i
think some some of them would have taken

6354
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760
think some some of them would have taken
 

6355
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:35,270
think some some of them would have taken
you up on it but um

6356
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
you up on it but um
 

6357
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:37,109
you up on it but um
and certainly back in 1984 a bunch of

6358
01:43:37,109 --> 01:43:37,119
and certainly back in 1984 a bunch of
 

6359
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,109
and certainly back in 1984 a bunch of
them would have said oh sure yeah but

6360
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:39,119
them would have said oh sure yeah but
 

6361
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:42,149
them would have said oh sure yeah but
now i get the impression that

6362
01:43:42,149 --> 01:43:42,159
now i get the impression that
 

6363
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:42,950
now i get the impression that
they've

6364
01:43:42,950 --> 01:43:42,960
they've
 

6365
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,550
they've
even they realized that things are not

6366
01:43:44,550 --> 01:43:44,560
even they realized that things are not
 

6367
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,709
even they realized that things are not
looking good for that particular idea

6368
01:43:46,709 --> 01:43:46,719
looking good for that particular idea
 

6369
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:48,229
looking good for that particular idea
again it depends what you mean by string

6370
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:48,239
again it depends what you mean by string
 

6371
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,550
again it depends what you mean by string
theory whether maybe the term will

6372
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:50,560
theory whether maybe the term will
 

6373
01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:52,390
theory whether maybe the term will
evolve to mean something else which

6374
01:43:52,390 --> 01:43:52,400
evolve to mean something else which
 

6375
01:43:52,400 --> 01:43:54,950
evolve to mean something else which
which will work out but i don't yeah i

6376
01:43:54,950 --> 01:43:54,960
which will work out but i don't yeah i
 

6377
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:56,470
which will work out but i don't yeah i
don't think that's not gonna

6378
01:43:56,470 --> 01:43:56,480
don't think that's not gonna
 

6379
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,390
don't think that's not gonna
likely to work out whether um

6380
01:43:58,390 --> 01:43:58,400
likely to work out whether um
 

6381
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,910
likely to work out whether um
something else i mean i i still think

6382
01:43:59,910 --> 01:43:59,920
something else i mean i i still think
 

6383
01:43:59,920 --> 01:44:01,430
something else i mean i i still think
it's relatively unlikely that you'll

6384
01:44:01,430 --> 01:44:01,440
it's relatively unlikely that you'll
 

6385
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:03,109
it's relatively unlikely that you'll
have any

6386
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:03,119
have any
 

6387
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,790
have any

01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
really successful theory of everything
 

6389
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,109
really successful theory of everything
and and the main problem is is just the

6390
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
and and the main problem is is just the
 

6391
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:08,709
and and the main problem is is just the

6392
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:08,719
um
 

6393
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:10,310
um
it's become so difficult to do

6394
01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:10,320
it's become so difficult to do
 

6395
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,149
it's become so difficult to do
experiments at higher energy that we've

6396
01:44:12,149 --> 01:44:12,159
experiments at higher energy that we've
 

6397
01:44:12,159 --> 01:44:15,109
experiments at higher energy that we've
really lost this ability to kind of get

6398
01:44:15,109 --> 01:44:15,119
really lost this ability to kind of get
 

6399
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:17,590
really lost this ability to kind of get

01:44:17,590 --> 01:44:17,600
unexpected input from
 

6401
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,229
unexpected input from
from experiment and and you can you know

6402
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
from experiment and and you can you know
 

6403
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:22,229
from experiment and and you can you know
while it's maybe hard to figure out what

6404
01:44:22,229 --> 01:44:22,239
while it's maybe hard to figure out what
 

6405
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:23,669
while it's maybe hard to figure out what
people's thinking is going to be 20

01:44:23,669 --> 01:44:23,679
people's thinking is going to be 20
 

6407
01:44:23,679 --> 01:44:26,709
people's thinking is going to be 20
years from now looking at um

6408
01:44:26,709 --> 01:44:26,719
years from now looking at um
 

6409
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:29,109
years from now looking at um
you know energy particle energy

6410
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:29,119
you know energy particle energy
 

6411
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:31,030
you know energy particle energy
colliders and their technology it's

01:44:31,030 --> 01:44:31,040
colliders and their technology it's
 

6413
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:32,709
colliders and their technology it's
actually pretty easy to make a pretty

01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:32,719
actually pretty easy to make a pretty
 

6415
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:34,229
actually pretty easy to make a pretty

what

6418
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
what
 

6419
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,550
what
except what you're going to be doing 20

6420
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:36,560
except what you're going to be doing 20
 

6421
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:38,950
except what you're going to be doing 20

01:44:38,950 --> 01:44:38,960
years from now and um
 

6423
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,629

i think actually i

6424
01:44:40,629 --> 01:44:40,639
i think actually i
 

6425
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:42,229
i think actually i
i would actually claim that

6426
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
i would actually claim that
 

6427
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:43,510
i would actually claim that
it's pretty clear where you're going to

6428
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:43,520
it's pretty clear where you're going to
 

6429
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:45,030
it's pretty clear where you're going to
be 20 years from now and what it's going

6430
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,040
be 20 years from now and what it's going
 

6431
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,830
be 20 years from now and what it's going
to be is you're going to have the

6432
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:46,840
to be is you're going to have the
 

6433
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:49,910
to be is you're going to have the
um you're going to have the the lhc

um you're going to have the the lhc
 

6435
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,590
um you're going to have the the lhc
you're going to have a lot more data an

01:44:51,590 --> 01:44:51,600
you're going to have a lot more data an
 

6437
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:53,350
you're going to have a lot more data an

think so i mean i think that that that

6464
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:21,520
think so i mean i think that that that
 

6465
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,550
think so i mean i think that that that
feel that my understanding is that they

6466
01:45:24,550 --> 01:45:24,560
feel that my understanding is that they
 

6467
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:26,149
feel that my understanding is that they
they're starting to make a great use of

6468
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
they're starting to make a great use of
 

6469
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:27,669
they're starting to make a great use of
those techniques but but it seems to

6470
01:45:27,669 --> 01:45:27,679
those techniques but but it seems to
 

6471
01:45:27,679 --> 01:45:29,750
those techniques but but it seems to
look like it it will help them solve

6472
01:45:29,750 --> 01:45:29,760
look like it it will help them solve
 

6473
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,189
look like it it will help them solve
certain technical problems and be able

6474
01:45:31,189 --> 01:45:31,199
certain technical problems and be able
 

6475
01:45:31,199 --> 01:45:33,750
certain technical problems and be able
to do things somewhat better but not

6476
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:33,760
to do things somewhat better but not
 

6477
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:35,189
to do things somewhat better but not
completely change

6478
01:45:35,189 --> 01:45:35,199
completely change
 

6479
01:45:35,199 --> 01:45:36,629
completely change
the way they're looking at things what

6480
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:36,639
the way they're looking at things what
 

6481
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:37,910
the way they're looking at things what
do you think about

6482
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:37,920
do you think about
 

6483
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:39,430
do you think about
the potential quantum computers

6484
01:45:39,430 --> 01:45:39,440
the potential quantum computers
 

6485
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,109
the potential quantum computers
simulating quantum mechanical systems

6486
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
simulating quantum mechanical systems
 

6487
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,510
simulating quantum mechanical systems
and through that sneak up

6488
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:43,520
and through that sneak up
 

6489
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:46,470
and through that sneak up
to sort of simu through simulation

6490
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:46,480
to sort of simu through simulation
 

6491
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:49,590
to sort of simu through simulation
sneak up to a deep understanding of um

01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:49,600
sneak up to a deep understanding of um
 

6493
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,350
sneak up to a deep understanding of um
the fundamental physics

6494
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:51,360
the fundamental physics
 

6495
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:53,030
the fundamental physics
the problem there is

01:45:53,030 --> 01:45:53,040
the problem there is
 

6497
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:56,550
the problem there is
that that's promising more for this um

01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,950
that that's promising more for this um
for uh you know for phil anderson's

problem that you know if you want to
 

6503
01:46:01,440 --> 01:46:03,270
problem that you know if you want to
there there's lots and lots of if you

you start putting together
 

6511
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,950
you start putting together
lots and lots of things and we think we

6512
01:46:08,950 --> 01:46:08,960
lots and lots of things and we think we
 

6513
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:10,870
lots and lots of things and we think we
know they're pair by pair interactions

6514
01:46:10,870 --> 01:46:10,880
know they're pair by pair interactions
 

6515
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:13,270
know they're pair by pair interactions
but what this thing is going to do we

but what this thing is going to do we
 

6517
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:14,629
but what this thing is going to do we
don't have any good calculational

you know quantum computers may very well
 

6523
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:20,790
you know quantum computers may very well
give you those and so they may

6524
01:46:20,790 --> 01:46:20,800
give you those and so they may
 

6525
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:22,229
give you those and so they may

computers may solve that problem but the
 

6541
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,550
computers may solve that problem but the
problem is that they i don't think that

6542
01:46:36,550 --> 01:46:36,560
problem is that they i don't think that
 

6543

they're going to solve the problem that
they help you with the problem of not

ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding

6558
01:46:51,109 --> 01:46:51,119
ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding
 

6559
01:46:51,119 --> 01:46:52,229
ask you the perhaps ridiculous sounding
but i don't think it's actually a

6560
01:46:52,229 --> 01:46:52,239
but i don't think it's actually a
 

6561
01:46:52,239 --> 01:46:54,470
but i don't think it's actually a
ridiculous question of

6562
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
ridiculous question of
 

6563
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,550
ridiculous question of
do you think we live in a simulation

6564
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:56,560
do you think we live in a simulation
 

6565
01:46:56,560 --> 01:46:58,390
do you think we live in a simulation
do you find that thought experiment at

6566
01:46:58,390 --> 01:46:58,400
do you find that thought experiment at
 

6567
01:46:58,400 --> 01:47:00,310
do you find that thought experiment at
all useful or interesting

6568
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
all useful or interesting
 

6569
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,790
all useful or interesting
not really not not really i don't uh it

6570
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:02,800
not really not not really i don't uh it
 

6571
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,590
not really not not really i don't uh it
just doesn't uh

6572
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:05,600
just doesn't uh
 

6573
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,990
just doesn't uh
yeah and anyway to me it doesn't

6574
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,000
yeah and anyway to me it doesn't
 

6575
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,229
yeah and anyway to me it doesn't
actually lead to any kind of interesting

6576
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:10,239
actually lead to any kind of interesting
 

6577
01:47:10,239 --> 01:47:12,550
actually lead to any kind of interesting
lead anywhere interesting and yeah to me

6578
01:47:12,550 --> 01:47:12,560
lead anywhere interesting and yeah to me
 

6579
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:14,870
lead anywhere interesting and yeah to me
so maybe i'll i'll throw a wrench into

6580
01:47:14,870 --> 01:47:14,880
so maybe i'll i'll throw a wrench into
 

6581
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:16,550
so maybe i'll i'll throw a wrench into
your thing uh

6582
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:16,560
your thing uh
 

6583
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:17,990
your thing uh
to me it's super interesting from an

6584
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,000
to me it's super interesting from an
 

6585
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,070
to me it's super interesting from an
engineering perspective so if you look

6586
01:47:20,070 --> 01:47:20,080
engineering perspective so if you look
 

6587
01:47:20,080 --> 01:47:23,189
engineering perspective so if you look
at virtual reality systems

6588
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
at virtual reality systems
 

6589
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:26,629
at virtual reality systems
the the actual question is

6590
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
the the actual question is
 

6591
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,350
the the actual question is
how much computation and how difficult

6592
01:47:29,350 --> 01:47:29,360
how much computation and how difficult
 

6593
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:30,390
how much computation and how difficult
is it

6594
01:47:30,390 --> 01:47:30,400
is it
 

6595
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:32,870
is it
to construct a world

6596
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
to construct a world
 

6597
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,109
to construct a world
that uh like there are several levels

6598
01:47:35,109 --> 01:47:35,119
that uh like there are several levels
 

6599
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:36,629
that uh like there are several levels
here

6600
01:47:36,629 --> 01:47:36,639
here
 

6601
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:37,910
here
one

6602
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:37,920
one
 

6603
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,830
one
is you won't know the difference our

6604
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:39,840
is you won't know the difference our
 

6605
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,750
is you won't know the difference our
human perception systems and maybe even

6606
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:41,760
human perception systems and maybe even
 

6607
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,109
human perception systems and maybe even
the tools of physics won't know the

6608
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119
the tools of physics won't know the
 

6609
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:44,790
the tools of physics won't know the
difference between the simulated world

6610
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:44,800
difference between the simulated world
 

6611
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:47,270
difference between the simulated world
and the real world

6612
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:47,280
and the real world
 

6613
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:49,430
and the real world
that's sort of more of a

6614
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:49,440
that's sort of more of a
 

6615
01:47:49,440 --> 01:47:50,950
that's sort of more of a
physics question

6616
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:50,960
physics question
 

6617
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:52,950
physics question
the the most interesting question to me

6618
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
the the most interesting question to me
 

6619
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:54,629
the the most interesting question to me
has more to do with why food tastes

6620
01:47:54,629 --> 01:47:54,639
has more to do with why food tastes
 

6621
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:58,629
has more to do with why food tastes
delicious which is create how difficult

6622
01:47:58,629 --> 01:47:58,639
delicious which is create how difficult
 

6623
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:00,390
delicious which is create how difficult
and how much computation is required to

6624
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:00,400
and how much computation is required to
 

6625
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:02,790
and how much computation is required to
construct a simulation

6626
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
construct a simulation
 

6627
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,709
construct a simulation
where you kind of know it's a simulation

6628
01:48:04,709 --> 01:48:04,719
where you kind of know it's a simulation
 

6629
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:05,990
where you kind of know it's a simulation
at first

6630
01:48:05,990 --> 01:48:06,000
at first
 

6631
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:07,990
at first
but you want to stay there anyway and

6632
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:08,000
but you want to stay there anyway and
 

6633
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:09,750
but you want to stay there anyway and
over time

6634
01:48:09,750 --> 01:48:09,760
over time
 

6635
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:11,830
over time
you don't

6636
01:48:11,830 --> 01:48:11,840
you don't
 

6637
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:14,149
you don't
even remember yeah

6638
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
even remember yeah
 

6639
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,149
even remember yeah
well yeah anyway i agree these are kind

6640
01:48:16,149 --> 01:48:16,159
well yeah anyway i agree these are kind
 

6641
01:48:16,159 --> 01:48:17,189
well yeah anyway i agree these are kind
of

6642
01:48:17,189 --> 01:48:17,199
of
 

6643
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:18,870
of
fascinating questions and they may be

6644
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:18,880
fascinating questions and they may be
 

6645
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:21,189
fascinating questions and they may be
very very relevant to our future as a

6646
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
very very relevant to our future as a
 

6647
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:22,790
very very relevant to our future as a
species but um

6648
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:22,800
species but um
 

6649
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,070
species but um
yeah they're just very far from anything

6650
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
yeah they're just very far from anything
 

6651
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,669
yeah they're just very far from anything
so from a physics perspective it's not

6652
01:48:27,669 --> 01:48:27,679
so from a physics perspective it's not
 

6653
01:48:27,679 --> 01:48:29,270
so from a physics perspective it's not
useful to you to think

6654
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
useful to you to think
 

6655
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:31,590
useful to you to think
taking a computational perspective to

6656
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:31,600
taking a computational perspective to
 

6657
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:32,950
taking a computational perspective to
our universe think of it as an

6658
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:32,960
our universe think of it as an
 

6659
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:34,950
our universe think of it as an
information processing system

6660
01:48:34,950 --> 01:48:34,960
information processing system
 

6661
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,550
information processing system
and then think of it as doing

6662
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:36,560
and then think of it as doing
 

6663
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:38,229
and then think of it as doing
computation and then you think about the

6664
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:38,239
computation and then you think about the
 

6665
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:39,830
computation and then you think about the
resources required to do that kind of

6666
01:48:39,830 --> 01:48:39,840
resources required to do that kind of
 

6667
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:42,070
resources required to do that kind of
computation and all that kind of stuff

6668
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
computation and all that kind of stuff
 

6669
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,590
computation and all that kind of stuff
you could just look at the basic physics

6670
01:48:43,590 --> 01:48:43,600
you could just look at the basic physics
 

6671
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:45,910
you could just look at the basic physics
and who cares what the the computer it's

6672
01:48:45,910 --> 01:48:45,920
and who cares what the the computer it's
 

6673
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:47,430
and who cares what the the computer it's
running on us yeah it just i mean the

6674
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:47,440
running on us yeah it just i mean the
 

6675
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:48,709
running on us yeah it just i mean the
kinds of i mean

6676
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
kinds of i mean
 

6677
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,390
kinds of i mean
i'm willing to agree that you can get

6678
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:50,400
i'm willing to agree that you can get
 

6679
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,750
i'm willing to agree that you can get
into interesting kinds of questions

6680
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:51,760
into interesting kinds of questions
 

6681
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,590
into interesting kinds of questions
going down that road but they're just so

6682
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:53,600
going down that road but they're just so
 

6683
01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:55,430
going down that road but they're just so
different from anything from what i

6684
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,440
different from anything from what i
 

6685
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:57,189
different from anything from what i
found interesting that i just

6686
01:48:57,189 --> 01:48:57,199
found interesting that i just
 

6687
01:48:57,199 --> 01:48:58,870
found interesting that i just
again i just have to

6688
01:48:58,870 --> 01:48:58,880
again i just have to
 

6689
01:48:58,880 --> 01:49:01,350
again i just have to
kind of go back to life is too short and

6690
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
kind of go back to life is too short and
 

6691
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,030
kind of go back to life is too short and
i'm very glad other people are thinking

6692
01:49:03,030 --> 01:49:03,040
i'm very glad other people are thinking
 

6693
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:05,030
i'm very glad other people are thinking
about this but

6694
01:49:05,030 --> 01:49:05,040
about this but
 

6695
01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:06,870
about this but
i just don't see any anything i can do

6696
01:49:06,870 --> 01:49:06,880
i just don't see any anything i can do
 

6697
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:08,629
i just don't see any anything i can do
with it

6698
01:49:08,629 --> 01:49:08,639
with it
 

6699
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:09,910
with it
what about

6700
01:49:09,910 --> 01:49:09,920
what about
 

6701
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,310
what about
space itself so i have to ask you about

6702
01:49:12,310 --> 01:49:12,320
space itself so i have to ask you about
 

6703
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,149
space itself so i have to ask you about
aliens

6704
01:49:14,149 --> 01:49:14,159
aliens
 

6705
01:49:14,159 --> 01:49:16,709
aliens
again something uh since you emphasize

6706
01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:16,719
again something uh since you emphasize
 

6707
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:18,629
again something uh since you emphasize
evidence

6708
01:49:18,629 --> 01:49:18,639
evidence
 

6709
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:20,790
evidence
do you think there is how many do you

6710
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
do you think there is how many do you
 

6711
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,870
do you think there is how many do you
think there are and how many

6712
01:49:22,870 --> 01:49:22,880
think there are and how many
 

6713
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,709
think there are and how many
intelligent alien civilizations are out

6714
01:49:24,709 --> 01:49:24,719
intelligent alien civilizations are out
 

6715
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:25,750
intelligent alien civilizations are out
there

6716
01:49:25,750 --> 01:49:25,760
there
 

6717
01:49:25,760 --> 01:49:27,830
there
yeah i have i have no idea i have

6718
01:49:27,830 --> 01:49:27,840
yeah i have i have no idea i have
 

6719
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,510
yeah i have i have no idea i have
certainly as far as i know unless the

6720
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
certainly as far as i know unless the
 

6721
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,950
certainly as far as i know unless the
government's covering it up or something

6722
01:49:30,950 --> 01:49:30,960
government's covering it up or something
 

6723
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,709
government's covering it up or something
we haven't heard from uh

6724
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:32,719
we haven't heard from uh
 

6725
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:34,790
we haven't heard from uh
we don't have any evidence for

6726
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:34,800
we don't have any evidence for
 

6727
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:36,470
we don't have any evidence for
such things yet but there's there seems

6728
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
such things yet but there's there seems
 

6729
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,470
such things yet but there's there seems
to be no

6730
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
to be no
 

6731
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,870
to be no
there's no particular obstruction

6732
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:40,880
there's no particular obstruction
 

6733
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,030
there's no particular obstruction
why there shouldn't be so

6734
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,040
why there shouldn't be so
 

6735
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,550
why there shouldn't be so
i mean do you

6736
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:44,560
i mean do you
 

6737
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:45,990
i mean do you
you work on some

6738
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
you work on some
 

6739
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,149
you work on some
fundamental questions about the physics

6740
01:49:48,149 --> 01:49:48,159
fundamental questions about the physics
 

6741
01:49:48,159 --> 01:49:51,430
fundamental questions about the physics
of reality when you look up to the stars

6742
01:49:51,430 --> 01:49:51,440
of reality when you look up to the stars
 

6743
01:49:51,440 --> 01:49:53,270
of reality when you look up to the stars
do you think about whether somebody's

6744
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
do you think about whether somebody's
 

6745
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,669
do you think about whether somebody's
looking back at us

6746
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:55,679
looking back at us
 

6747
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:57,589
looking back at us
actually i originally got interested in

6748
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
actually i originally got interested in
 

6749
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,109
actually i originally got interested in
physics i actually started out as a kid

6750
01:49:59,109 --> 01:49:59,119
physics i actually started out as a kid
 

6751
01:49:59,119 --> 01:50:00,870
physics i actually started out as a kid
interested in astronomy exactly that and

6752
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
interested in astronomy exactly that and
 

6753
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,629
interested in astronomy exactly that and
a telescope and whatever that and

6754
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
a telescope and whatever that and
 

6755
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,709
a telescope and whatever that and
certainly read a lot of

6756
01:50:04,709 --> 01:50:04,719
certainly read a lot of
 

6757
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:07,430
certainly read a lot of
science fiction and

6758
01:50:07,430 --> 01:50:07,440
science fiction and
 

6759
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,109
science fiction and
thought about that i i find over the

6760
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:09,119
thought about that i i find over the
 

6761
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:11,830
thought about that i i find over the
years i find myself kind of less

6762
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:11,840
years i find myself kind of less
 

6763
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,950
years i find myself kind of less
anyway

6764
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:12,960
anyway
 

6765
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:14,950
anyway
less and less interested in that well

6766
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:14,960
less and less interested in that well
 

6767
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:16,629
less and less interested in that well
just because i don't i don't really know

6768
01:50:16,629 --> 01:50:16,639
just because i don't i don't really know
 

6769
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:18,870
just because i don't i don't really know
what to do with them

6770
01:50:18,870 --> 01:50:18,880
what to do with them
 

6771
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:20,229
what to do with them
i've also kind of kind of at some point

6772
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
i've also kind of kind of at some point
 

6773
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,470
i've also kind of kind of at some point
kind of stopped reading science fiction

6774
01:50:22,470 --> 01:50:22,480
kind of stopped reading science fiction
 

6775
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,149
kind of stopped reading science fiction
that much kind of feeling that there was

6776
01:50:24,149 --> 01:50:24,159
that much kind of feeling that there was
 

6777
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:26,229
that much kind of feeling that there was
just two that the actual science i was

6778
01:50:26,229 --> 01:50:26,239
just two that the actual science i was
 

6779
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:28,070
just two that the actual science i was
kind of learning about was

6780
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
kind of learning about was
 

6781
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,750
kind of learning about was
perfectly kind of weird and fascinating

6782
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
perfectly kind of weird and fascinating
 

6783
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,390
perfectly kind of weird and fascinating
and unusual enough but and better than

6784
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:32,400
and unusual enough but and better than
 

6785
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,750
and unusual enough but and better than
any of the stuff that

6786
01:50:33,750 --> 01:50:33,760
any of the stuff that
 

6787
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,470
any of the stuff that
and isaac asimov so why should i

yeah
 

6791
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,669
yeah
and you can mess with the science

6792
01:50:39,669 --> 01:50:39,679
and you can mess with the science
 

6793
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:41,510
and you can mess with the science
much more than the the distant science

6794
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
much more than the the distant science

there among the stars yeah
 

6803
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,030
there among the stars yeah
well you mentioned science fiction

6804
01:50:51,030 --> 01:50:51,040
well you mentioned science fiction
 

6805
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:53,830
well you mentioned science fiction
you've written quite a few book reviews

6806
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:53,840
you've written quite a few book reviews
 

6807
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:56,310
you've written quite a few book reviews
i gotta ask you about some books perhaps

6808
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:56,320
i gotta ask you about some books perhaps
 

6809
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,709

as you can tell from my views about
 

6837
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,350
as you can tell from my views about
string theory i'm not a fan of a lot of

6838
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:29,360
string theory i'm not a fan of a lot of
 

6839

6849
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:41,189
a lot of things of that kind can ask you
a quick question on this a small tangent

6850
01:51:41,189 --> 01:51:41,199
a quick question on this a small tangent
 

6851
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:44,070
a quick question on this a small tangent
are you a fan

6852
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
are you a fan
 

6853
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,390
are you a fan
okay can you explore the pros and cons

6854
01:51:46,390 --> 01:51:46,400
okay can you explore the pros and cons
 

6855
01:51:46,400 --> 01:51:48,709
okay can you explore the pros and cons
of forget string theory

6856
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
of forget string theory
 

6857
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:51,589

01:52:10,159 --> 01:52:12,550
range of mysteries in our universe
that's a complicated issue i think

6874
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:12,560
that's a complicated issue i think
 

6875
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:13,910
that's a complicated issue i think
you know i certainly go back and go back

6889
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:25,669
remember reading when i was a kid were
about the early history of quant

6890
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
about the early history of quant
 

6891
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,350
about the early history of quant
mechanics like heisenberg's books that

6892
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
mechanics like heisenberg's books that
 

6893
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:29,510
mechanics like heisenberg's books that
he wrote about you know kind of looking

6894
01:52:29,510 --> 01:52:29,520
he wrote about you know kind of looking
 

6895
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:31,189
he wrote about you know kind of looking
back at telling the history of what

6896
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:31,199
back at telling the history of what
 

6897
01:52:31,199 --> 01:52:32,390
back at telling the history of what
happened when he developed climate

6898
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:32,400
happened when he developed climate
 

6899
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,310
happened when he developed climate
change it's just kind of a

6900
01:52:34,310 --> 01:52:34,320
change it's just kind of a
 

6901
01:52:34,320 --> 01:52:36,470
change it's just kind of a
totally fascinating romantic

6902
01:52:36,470 --> 01:52:36,480
totally fascinating romantic
 

6903
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:38,310
totally fascinating romantic
great story and uh those were very

6904
01:52:38,310 --> 01:52:38,320
great story and uh those were very
 

6905
01:52:38,320 --> 01:52:39,910
great story and uh those were very
inspirational to me

6906
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:39,920
inspirational to me
 

6907
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,669
inspirational to me
and um i would think maybe other people

6908
01:52:41,669 --> 01:52:41,679
and um i would think maybe other people
 

6909
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:42,709
and um i would think maybe other people
might also

6910
01:52:42,709 --> 01:52:42,719
might also
 

6911
01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:45,109
might also
also find them that but the um and

6912
01:52:45,109 --> 01:52:45,119
also find them that but the um and
 

6913
01:52:45,119 --> 01:52:46,709
also find them that but the um and
that's that's almost like the human

6914
01:52:46,709 --> 01:52:46,719
that's that's almost like the human
 

6915
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:48,950
that's that's almost like the human
story of the development of the ideas

6916
01:52:48,950 --> 01:52:48,960
story of the development of the ideas
 

6917
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:50,950
story of the development of the ideas
yeah the human story but yeah just also

6918
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:50,960
yeah the human story but yeah just also
 

6919
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,550
yeah the human story but yeah just also
how you know they they're these very

6920
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
how you know they they're these very
 

6921
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:54,070
how you know they they're these very
very weird ideas that didn't seem to

6922
01:52:54,070 --> 01:52:54,080
very weird ideas that didn't seem to
 

6923
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:55,750
very weird ideas that didn't seem to
make sense that how they were struggling

6924
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:55,760
make sense that how they were struggling
 

6925
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:58,149
make sense that how they were struggling
with them and how you know they actually

6926
01:52:58,149 --> 01:52:58,159
with them and how you know they actually
 

6927
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,550
with them and how you know they actually
anyway it's it's it's it's i think it's

6928
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:00,560
anyway it's it's it's it's i think it's
 

6929
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:03,430
anyway it's it's it's it's i think it's
the period of physics kind of beginning

6930
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
the period of physics kind of beginning

in 1905 plank and einstein and
 

6933
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:09,189
in 1905 plank and einstein and
ending up with the war when these things

6934
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:09,199
ending up with the war when these things
 

6935
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,470
ending up with the war when these things
are get used to you know make massively

6936
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
are get used to you know make massively
 

6937
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,470
are get used to you know make massively
destructive weapons is it's just that

6938
01:53:14,470 --> 01:53:14,480
destructive weapons is it's just that
 

6939
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:17,350
destructive weapons is it's just that
truly amazing so many so many new ideas

6940
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:17,360
truly amazing so many so many new ideas

6945
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,629
change on top of a tangent ask
if we didn't have einstein

6946
01:53:24,629 --> 01:53:24,639
if we didn't have einstein
 

6947
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:26,550
if we didn't have einstein
so how does science progress

6948
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:26,560
so how does science progress
 

6949
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:28,790
so how does science progress
is it the long geniuses

6950
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800
is it the long geniuses
 

6951
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,229
is it the long geniuses
or is it uh some kind of weird network

6952
01:53:32,229 --> 01:53:32,239
or is it uh some kind of weird network
 

6953
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:34,229
or is it uh some kind of weird network
of ideas swimming in the air and just

6954
01:53:34,229 --> 01:53:34,239
of ideas swimming in the air and just
 

6955
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:37,350
of ideas swimming in the air and just
kind of the the geniuses pop up to catch

6956
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:37,360
kind of the the geniuses pop up to catch
 

6957
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,350
kind of the the geniuses pop up to catch
them and others would anyway without

6958
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:39,360
them and others would anyway without
 

6959
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:41,109
them and others would anyway without
einstein would we have

6960
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
einstein would we have
 

6961
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:44,470
einstein would we have
uh special relativity general relativity

6962
01:53:44,470 --> 01:53:44,480
uh special relativity general relativity
 

6963
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,629
uh special relativity general relativity
i mean it it's an interesting case to

6964
01:53:46,629 --> 01:53:46,639
i mean it it's an interesting case to
 

6965
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:48,229
i mean it it's an interesting case to
case based i mean i mean especially

6966
01:53:48,229 --> 01:53:48,239
case based i mean i mean especially
 

6967
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:50,470
case based i mean i mean especially
special relativity i think we would have

6968
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,480
special relativity i think we would have
 

6969
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,589
special relativity i think we would have
had

6970
01:53:51,589 --> 01:53:51,599
had
 

6971
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:53,750
had
i mean there are other people

6972
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:53,760
i mean there are other people
 

6973
01:53:53,760 --> 01:53:54,790
i mean there are other people
anyway

6974
01:53:54,790 --> 01:53:54,800
anyway
 

6975
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:56,310
anyway
you could even argue that it was already

6976
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
you could even argue that it was already
 

6977
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,310
you could even argue that it was already
there in some form in some ways but i

6978
01:53:58,310 --> 01:53:58,320
there in some form in some ways but i
 

6979
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:00,149
there in some form in some ways but i
think special relativity would have had

6980
01:54:00,149 --> 01:54:00,159
think special relativity would have had
 

6981
01:54:00,159 --> 01:54:02,149
think special relativity would have had
without einstein fairly

6982
01:54:02,149 --> 01:54:02,159
without einstein fairly
 

6983
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:05,109
without einstein fairly
fairly quickly general relativity

6984
01:54:05,109 --> 01:54:05,119
fairly quickly general relativity
 

6985
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:07,430
fairly quickly general relativity
that was a much much harder thing to do

6986
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:07,440
that was a much much harder thing to do
 

6987
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,189
that was a much much harder thing to do
and um

6988
01:54:09,189 --> 01:54:09,199
and um
 

6989
01:54:09,199 --> 01:54:11,109
and um
required a much more effort much more

6990
01:54:11,109 --> 01:54:11,119
required a much more effort much more
 

6991
01:54:11,119 --> 01:54:12,550
required a much more effort much more
certificate that

6992
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
certificate that
 

6993
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,589
certificate that
i think he would have had sooner or

6994
01:54:13,589 --> 01:54:13,599
i think he would have had sooner or
 

6995
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:15,189
i think he would have had sooner or
later but it would have taken taken

6996
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:15,199
later but it would have taken taken
 

6997
01:54:15,199 --> 01:54:16,629
later but it would have taken taken
quite a bit longer

6998
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
quite a bit longer
 

6999
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:18,149
quite a bit longer
another thing that took a bunch of years

7000
01:54:18,149 --> 01:54:18,159
another thing that took a bunch of years
 

7001
01:54:18,159 --> 01:54:20,870
another thing that took a bunch of years
to validate scientifically the general

01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
to validate scientifically the general
 

7003
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,030
to validate scientifically the general
relativity but even for einstein from

7004
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:23,040
relativity but even for einstein from
 

7005
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:24,709
relativity but even for einstein from
you know the point which he had kind of

7006
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
you know the point which he had kind of
 

7007
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:26,390
you know the point which he had kind of
a general idea of what he was trying to

7008
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,400
a general idea of what he was trying to
 

7009
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:28,870
a general idea of what he was trying to
do to the point where he actually had a

7010
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
do to the point where he actually had a
 

7011
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,149
do to the point where he actually had a
well-defined theory that you could

7012
01:54:30,149 --> 01:54:30,159
well-defined theory that you could
 

7013
01:54:30,159 --> 01:54:31,910
well-defined theory that you could
actually compare to the real world that

7014
01:54:31,910 --> 01:54:31,920
actually compare to the real world that
 

7015
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:33,669
actually compare to the real world that
was you know i kind of forget the

7016
01:54:33,669 --> 01:54:33,679
was you know i kind of forget the
 

7017
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:35,350
was you know i kind of forget the
numbers of the order of magnitude 10

years of very serious work and um if he

7020
01:54:37,589 --> 01:54:37,599
years of very serious work and um if he
 

7021
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:38,629
years of very serious work and um if he
hadn't been

hadn't been
 

7023
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:40,229
hadn't been
around to do that it would have taken a

7024
01:54:40,229 --> 01:54:40,239
around to do that it would have taken a
 

7025
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:41,750
around to do that it would have taken a
while before anyone else

7026
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:41,760
while before anyone else
 

7027
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,589
while before anyone else
got around to it on the other hand there

7028
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:43,599
got around to it on the other hand there
 

7029
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:44,870
got around to it on the other hand there
are things like

7030
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:44,880
are things like
 

7031
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,270
are things like
with quant mechanics you have um

7032
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:47,280
with quant mechanics you have um
 

7033
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:51,189
with quant mechanics you have um
you know heisenberg and um schrodinger

7034
01:54:51,189 --> 01:54:51,199
you know heisenberg and um schrodinger
 

7035
01:54:51,199 --> 01:54:53,669
you know heisenberg and um schrodinger
came up with two

7036
01:54:53,669 --> 01:54:53,679
came up with two
 

7037
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:55,350
came up with two
which ultimately equivalent but two

7038
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:55,360
which ultimately equivalent but two
 

7039
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,550
which ultimately equivalent but two
different

7040
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,560
different
 

7041
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,550
different
approaches to it you know within months

7042
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
approaches to it you know within months
 

7043
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,870
approaches to it you know within months
of each other and you know so if

7044
01:55:00,870 --> 01:55:00,880
of each other and you know so if
 

7045
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,629
of each other and you know so if
heisenberg hadn't been there he already

7046
01:55:02,629 --> 01:55:02,639
heisenberg hadn't been there he already
 

7047
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:04,070
heisenberg hadn't been there he already
what about schrodinger or whatever and

7048
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:04,080
what about schrodinger or whatever and
 

7049
01:55:04,080 --> 01:55:05,189
what about schrodinger or whatever and
if neither of them been there it would

7050
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:05,199
if neither of them been there it would
 

7051
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,109
if neither of them been there it would
have been somebody else a few months

7052
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
have been somebody else a few months
 

7053
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:08,310
have been somebody else a few months
later so

7054
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:08,320
later so
 

7055
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,790
later so
there are times when the um

7056
01:55:10,790 --> 01:55:10,800
there are times when the um
 

7057
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,229
there are times when the um
you know just the

7058
01:55:12,229 --> 01:55:12,239
you know just the
 

7059
01:55:12,239 --> 01:55:13,910
you know just the
a lot often is

7060
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
a lot often is
 

7061
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,589
a lot often is
the combination of

7062
01:55:15,589 --> 01:55:15,599
the combination of
 

7063
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:17,589
the combination of
the right ideas are in place and the

7064
01:55:17,589 --> 01:55:17,599
the right ideas are in place and the
 

7065
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:19,589
the right ideas are in place and the
right experimental data is in place to

7066
01:55:19,589 --> 01:55:19,599
right experimental data is in place to
 

7067
01:55:19,599 --> 01:55:21,189
right experimental data is in place to
point in the right direction and it's

7068
01:55:21,189 --> 01:55:21,199
point in the right direction and it's
 

7069
01:55:21,199 --> 01:55:22,709
point in the right direction and it's
just waiting for

7070
01:55:22,709 --> 01:55:22,719
just waiting for
 

7071
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:25,430
just waiting for
somebody's going to find it um

7072
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440
somebody's going to find it um
 

7073
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,669
somebody's going to find it um
maybe maybe to go back to your uh to

7074
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:27,679
maybe maybe to go back to your uh to
 

7075
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:29,189
maybe maybe to go back to your uh to
your aliens i guess the one thing i

7076
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
your aliens i guess the one thing i
 

7077
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:30,950
your aliens i guess the one thing i
often wonder about aliens is would they

7078
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
often wonder about aliens is would they
 

7079
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,470
often wonder about aliens is would they
have the same

7080
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
have the same
 

7081
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,550
have the same
fundamental physics ideas as we if we

7082
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
fundamental physics ideas as we if we
 

7083
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,149
fundamental physics ideas as we if we
have in mathematics would their mouth

7084
01:55:36,149 --> 01:55:36,159
have in mathematics would their mouth
 

7085
01:55:36,159 --> 01:55:37,990
have in mathematics would their mouth
you know would they

7086
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:38,000
you know would they
 

7087
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,510
you know would they
you know

7088
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:39,520
you know
 

7089
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:41,589
you know
how much is this really intrinsic to our

7090
01:55:41,589 --> 01:55:41,599
how much is this really intrinsic to our
 

7091
01:55:41,599 --> 01:55:43,109
how much is this really intrinsic to our
minds if you start out with a different

7092
01:55:43,109 --> 01:55:43,119
minds if you start out with a different
 

7093
01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:44,470
minds if you start out with a different
kind of mind when you end up with a

7094
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
kind of mind when you end up with a
 

7095
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:45,589
kind of mind when you end up with a
different

7096
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599
different
 

7097
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:47,350
different
ideas of what fundamental physics is or

7098
01:55:47,350 --> 01:55:47,360
ideas of what fundamental physics is or
 

7099
01:55:47,360 --> 01:55:48,470
ideas of what fundamental physics is or
what or what the structure of

7100
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
what or what the structure of
 

7101
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:51,750
what or what the structure of
mathematics is so this is why like if i

7102
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:51,760
mathematics is so this is why like if i
 

7103
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:53,830
mathematics is so this is why like if i
was uh

7104
01:55:53,830 --> 01:55:53,840
was uh
 

7105
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:55,589
was uh
you know i like video games the way i

7106
01:55:55,589 --> 01:55:55,599
you know i like video games the way i
 

7107
01:55:55,599 --> 01:55:58,390
you know i like video games the way i
would do it as a curious being so first

7108
01:55:58,390 --> 01:55:58,400
would do it as a curious being so first
 

7109
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,310
would do it as a curious being so first
experiment i'd like to do is run earth

7110
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:00,320
experiment i'd like to do is run earth
 

7111
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:01,189
experiment i'd like to do is run earth
over

7112
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:01,199
over
 

7113
01:56:01,199 --> 01:56:03,189
over
many thousands of times and see if our

7114
01:56:03,189 --> 01:56:03,199
many thousands of times and see if our
 

7115
01:56:03,199 --> 01:56:04,790
many thousands of times and see if our
particular

7116
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:04,800
particular
 

7117
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:07,270
particular
um no you know what i wouldn't do the

7118
01:56:07,270 --> 01:56:07,280
um no you know what i wouldn't do the
 

7119
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:09,030
um no you know what i wouldn't do the
full evolution i would start at homo

7120
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040
full evolution i would start at homo
 

7121
01:56:09,040 --> 01:56:11,270
full evolution i would start at homo
sapiens first and then see the evolution

7122
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
sapiens first and then see the evolution
 

7123
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:13,990
sapiens first and then see the evolution
of homo sapiens millions of times and

7124
01:56:13,990 --> 01:56:14,000
of homo sapiens millions of times and
 

7125
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,070
of homo sapiens millions of times and
see how the the ideas of science would

7126
01:56:16,070 --> 01:56:16,080
see how the the ideas of science would
 

7127
01:56:16,080 --> 01:56:17,109
see how the the ideas of science would
evolve like

7128
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,119
evolve like
 

7129
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:18,310
evolve like
would you get

7130
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:18,320
would you get
 

7131
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:19,990
would you get
like how would physics evolve how would

7132
01:56:19,990 --> 01:56:20,000
like how would physics evolve how would
 

7133
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,070
like how would physics evolve how would
math evolves i would particularly just

7134
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
math evolves i would particularly just
 

7135
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,070
math evolves i would particularly just
be curious about the notation they come

7136
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
be curious about the notation they come
 

7137
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:25,350
be curious about the notation they come
up with

7138
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,360
up with
 

7139
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:27,510
up with
um every once in a while i would like

7140
01:56:27,510 --> 01:56:27,520
um every once in a while i would like
 

7141
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,910
um every once in a while i would like
throw miracles at them to like to mess

7142
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:29,920
throw miracles at them to like to mess
 

7143
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,830
throw miracles at them to like to mess
with them and stuff and then i would

7144
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:31,840
with them and stuff and then i would
 

7145
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,589
with them and stuff and then i would
also like to run earth from the very

7146
01:56:33,589 --> 01:56:33,599
also like to run earth from the very
 

7147
01:56:33,599 --> 01:56:35,430
also like to run earth from the very
beginning to see if evolution would

7148
01:56:35,430 --> 01:56:35,440
beginning to see if evolution would
 

7149
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,189
beginning to see if evolution would
produce different kinds of brains that

7150
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
produce different kinds of brains that
 

7151
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:38,709
produce different kinds of brains that
would then produce different kinds of

7152
01:56:38,709 --> 01:56:38,719
would then produce different kinds of
 

7153
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:41,350
would then produce different kinds of
mathematics and physics and then finally

7154
01:56:41,350 --> 01:56:41,360
mathematics and physics and then finally
 

7155
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:43,669
mathematics and physics and then finally
i would probably millions of times run

7156
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:43,679
i would probably millions of times run
 

7157
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:48,310
i would probably millions of times run
the universe over to see what kind of um

7158
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:48,320
the universe over to see what kind of um
 

7159
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,470
the universe over to see what kind of um
what kind of environments

7160

what kind of environments
 

7161
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,550
what kind of environments
and what kind of uh life would be

7162
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
and what kind of uh life would be
 

7163
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,189
and what kind of uh life would be
created to then lead to intelligent life

7164
01:56:55,189 --> 01:56:55,199
created to then lead to intelligent life

i would just like keep noting how long

7184
01:57:15,189 --> 01:57:15,199
i would just like keep noting how long
 

7185
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,750
i would just like keep noting how long
it does and get an average and see see

7186
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
it does and get an average and see see
 

7187
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:19,589
it does and get an average and see see
which ideas are difficult which are not

and and then and then conclusively
 

7191
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:25,510
and and then and then conclusively
sort of figure out if it's uh

7192
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
sort of figure out if it's uh
 

7193
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,350
sort of figure out if it's uh
if it's more collective intelligence or

7194
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:27,360
if it's more collective intelligence or
 

7195
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,430
if it's more collective intelligence or
singular intelligence that's responsible

7196
01:57:29,430 --> 01:57:29,440
singular intelligence that's responsible

if i was playing a video game and

7202
01:57:36,149 --> 01:57:36,159
if i was playing a video game and
 

7203
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,070
if i was playing a video game and
i got a chance to run this whole thing

7204
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
i got a chance to run this whole thing
 

7205
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,109
i got a chance to run this whole thing
yeah

7206
01:57:39,109 --> 01:57:39,119
yeah
 

7207
01:57:39,119 --> 01:57:40,149
yeah
but um

7208
01:57:40,149 --> 01:57:40,159
but um
 

7209
01:57:40,159 --> 01:57:41,830
but um
we were talking about books before i

7210
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:41,840
we were talking about books before i
 

7211
01:57:41,840 --> 01:57:43,510
we were talking about books before i
distracted okay of course yeah go back

7212
01:57:43,510 --> 01:57:43,520
distracted okay of course yeah go back
 

7213
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:46,070
distracted okay of course yeah go back
books and yeah so and then yeah so

7214
01:57:46,070 --> 01:57:46,080
books and yeah so and then yeah so
 

7215
01:57:46,080 --> 01:57:47,669
books and yeah so and then yeah so
that's one thing i recommend is the

7216
01:57:47,669 --> 01:57:47,679
that's one thing i recommend is the
 

7217
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:49,589
that's one thing i recommend is the
books books about the

7218
01:57:49,589 --> 01:57:49,599
books books about the
 

7219
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:50,790
books books about the
from the original people especially

7220
01:57:50,790 --> 01:57:50,800
from the original people especially
 

7221
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,709
from the original people especially
heisenberg about the

7222
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
heisenberg about the
 

7223
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,310
heisenberg about the
how that happened and there's also a

7224
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:54,320
how that happened and there's also a
 

7225
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:57,109
how that happened and there's also a
very very good kind of history of

7226
01:57:57,109 --> 01:57:57,119
very very good kind of history of
 

7227
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,270
very very good kind of history of
of the kind of what happened during this

7228
01:57:59,270 --> 01:57:59,280
of the kind of what happened during this
 

7229
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,270
of the kind of what happened during this
20th century

7230
01:58:01,270 --> 01:58:01,280
20th century
 

7231
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:03,350
20th century
in physics and you know up to the time

7232
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:03,360
in physics and you know up to the time
 

7233
01:58:03,360 --> 01:58:05,350
in physics and you know up to the time
of the standard model in 1973 it's

7234
01:58:05,350 --> 01:58:05,360
of the standard model in 1973 it's
 

7235
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:07,990
of the standard model in 1973 it's
called the um the second creation by um

7236
01:58:07,990 --> 01:58:08,000
called the um the second creation by um
 

7237
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:10,709
called the um the second creation by um
pop crease and uh and man that's one of

7238
01:58:10,709 --> 01:58:10,719
pop crease and uh and man that's one of
 

7239
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:12,709
pop crease and uh and man that's one of
the best ones i know that's

7240
01:58:12,709 --> 01:58:12,719
the best ones i know that's
 

7241
01:58:12,719 --> 01:58:14,550
the best ones i know that's
but the one thing that i can say is that

7242
01:58:14,550 --> 01:58:14,560
but the one thing that i can say is that
 

7243
01:58:14,560 --> 01:58:16,070
but the one thing that i can say is that
so that book i think

7244
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,080
so that book i think
 

7245
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:20,149
so that book i think
forget when it was late 80s 90s

7246
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
forget when it was late 80s 90s
 

7247
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:21,510
forget when it was late 80s 90s
the problem is that there just hasn't

7248
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:21,520
the problem is that there just hasn't
 

7249
01:58:21,520 --> 01:58:22,950
the problem is that there just hasn't
been much that's actually worked out

7250
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:22,960
been much that's actually worked out
 

7251
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,709
been much that's actually worked out
since then so

7252
01:58:24,709 --> 01:58:24,719
since then so
 

7253
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:25,830
since then so
most of the books that are kind of

7254
01:58:25,830 --> 01:58:25,840
most of the books that are kind of
 

7255
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:26,950
most of the books that are kind of
trying to tell you about all the

7256
01:58:26,950 --> 01:58:26,960
trying to tell you about all the
 

7257
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:29,070
trying to tell you about all the
glorious things that have happened since

7258
01:58:29,070 --> 01:58:29,080
glorious things that have happened since
 

7259
01:58:29,080 --> 01:58:31,510
glorious things that have happened since
1973 are

7260
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:31,520
1973 are
 

7261
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:32,870
1973 are
they're mostly telling you about how

7262
01:58:32,870 --> 01:58:32,880
they're mostly telling you about how
 

7263
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:34,470
they're mostly telling you about how
glorious things are which actually don't

7264
01:58:34,470 --> 01:58:34,480
glorious things are which actually don't
 

7265
01:58:34,480 --> 01:58:36,870
glorious things are which actually don't
really work it's really

7266
01:58:36,870 --> 01:58:36,880
really work it's really
 

7267
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:38,470
really work it's really
the argument people sometimes make in

7268
01:58:38,470 --> 01:58:38,480
the argument people sometimes make in
 

7269
01:58:38,480 --> 01:58:40,229
the argument people sometimes make in
terms in favor of these books as well oh

7270
01:58:40,229 --> 01:58:40,239
terms in favor of these books as well oh
 

7271
01:58:40,239 --> 01:58:41,510
terms in favor of these books as well oh
you know they're really great because

7272
01:58:41,510 --> 01:58:41,520
you know they're really great because
 

7273
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:42,790
you know they're really great because
you want to do something that will get

7274
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
you want to do something that will get
 

7275
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,470
you want to do something that will get
kids excited and then you know so

7276
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:44,480
kids excited and then you know so
 

7277
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:45,589
kids excited and then you know so
they're getting excited about things

7278
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
they're getting excited about things
 

7279
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:47,109
they're getting excited about things
something that's not really quite

7280
01:58:47,109 --> 01:58:47,119
something that's not really quite
 

7281
01:58:47,119 --> 01:58:48,629
something that's not really quite
working it's doesn't really matter the

7282
01:58:48,629 --> 01:58:48,639
working it's doesn't really matter the
 

7283
01:58:48,639 --> 01:58:50,629
working it's doesn't really matter the
main thing is get them excited yeah the

7284
01:58:50,629 --> 01:58:50,639
main thing is get them excited yeah the
 

7285
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:52,550
main thing is get them excited yeah the
other argument is

7286
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
other argument is
 

7287
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:53,669
other argument is
you know wait a minute when if you're

7288
01:58:53,669 --> 01:58:53,679
you know wait a minute when if you're
 

7289
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:54,790
you know wait a minute when if you're
getting

7290
01:58:54,790 --> 01:58:54,800
getting
 

7291
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:56,229
getting
people excited about ideas that are

7292
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
people excited about ideas that are
 

7293
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,669
people excited about ideas that are
wrong you're really kind of you're

7294
01:58:57,669 --> 01:58:57,679
wrong you're really kind of you're
 

7295
01:58:57,679 --> 01:58:59,510
wrong you're really kind of you're
actually kind of discrediting the whole

7296
01:58:59,510 --> 01:58:59,520
actually kind of discrediting the whole
 

7297
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:01,510
actually kind of discrediting the whole
scientific enterprise in a not really

7298
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:01,520
scientific enterprise in a not really
 

7299
01:59:01,520 --> 01:59:03,990
scientific enterprise in a not really
good way so there's

7300
01:59:03,990 --> 01:59:04,000
good way so there's
 

7301
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,750
good way so there's
these problems so my uh

7302
01:59:05,750 --> 01:59:05,760
these problems so my uh
 

7303
01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:07,270
these problems so my uh
my general feeling about expository

7304
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:07,280
my general feeling about expository
 

7305
01:59:07,280 --> 01:59:09,350
my general feeling about expository
stuff is yeah it's to the extent you can

7306
01:59:09,350 --> 01:59:09,360
stuff is yeah it's to the extent you can
 

7307
01:59:09,360 --> 01:59:11,990
stuff is yeah it's to the extent you can
do it kind of honestly and and and well

7308
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:12,000
do it kind of honestly and and and well
 

7309
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,830
do it kind of honestly and and and well
that's great there are a lot of people

7310
01:59:13,830 --> 01:59:13,840
that's great there are a lot of people
 

7311
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,350
that's great there are a lot of people
doing that now but

7312
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:15,360
doing that now but
 

7313
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:17,669
doing that now but
to the extent that you're

7314
01:59:17,669 --> 01:59:17,679
to the extent that you're
 

7315
01:59:17,679 --> 01:59:20,229
to the extent that you're
just trying to get people

7316
01:59:20,229 --> 01:59:20,239
just trying to get people
 

7317
01:59:20,239 --> 01:59:22,149
just trying to get people
excited and enthusiastic by kind of

7318
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:22,159
excited and enthusiastic by kind of
 

7319
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:23,430
excited and enthusiastic by kind of
telling them stuff which isn't really

7320
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:23,440
telling them stuff which isn't really
 

7321
01:59:23,440 --> 01:59:25,109
telling them stuff which isn't really
true this is you really shouldn't be

7322
01:59:25,109 --> 01:59:25,119
true this is you really shouldn't be
 

7323
01:59:25,119 --> 01:59:26,629
true this is you really shouldn't be
doing that

7324
01:59:26,629 --> 01:59:26,639
doing that
 

7325
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:27,830
doing that
you obviously have a much better

7326
01:59:27,830 --> 01:59:27,840
you obviously have a much better
 

7327
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,950
you obviously have a much better
intuition about physics i i tend to um

7328
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
intuition about physics i i tend to um
 

7329
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:35,030
intuition about physics i i tend to um
in the space of ai for example you could

7330
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,040

 

7331
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:37,510

you could use certain kinds of language

7332
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:37,520
you could use certain kinds of language
 

7333
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:41,189
you could use certain kinds of language
like calling things um intelligent

7334
01:59:41,189 --> 01:59:41,199
like calling things um intelligent
 

7335
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,510
like calling things um intelligent
that could rub people the wrong way but

7336
01:59:43,510 --> 01:59:43,520
that could rub people the wrong way but
 

7337
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:44,950
that could rub people the wrong way but
i never had a problem with that kind of

7338
01:59:44,950 --> 01:59:44,960
i never had a problem with that kind of
 

7339
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:47,350
i never had a problem with that kind of
thing you know saying that a program can

7340
01:59:47,350 --> 01:59:47,360
thing you know saying that a program can
 

7341
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,189
thing you know saying that a program can
learn its way without any human

7342
01:59:49,189 --> 01:59:49,199
learn its way without any human
 

7343
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:50,870
learn its way without any human
supervision as

7344
01:59:50,870 --> 01:59:50,880
supervision as
 

7345
01:59:50,880 --> 01:59:53,510
supervision as
alpha zero does to play chess

7346
01:59:53,510 --> 01:59:53,520
alpha zero does to play chess
 

7347
01:59:53,520 --> 01:59:56,229
alpha zero does to play chess
to me that

7348
01:59:56,229 --> 01:59:56,239
to me that
 

7349
01:59:56,239 --> 01:59:58,310
to me that
may not be intelligence but it's sure

7350
01:59:58,310 --> 01:59:58,320
may not be intelligence but it's sure
 

7351
01:59:58,320 --> 02:00:00,390
may not be intelligence but it's sure
that as heck seems like

7352
02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:00,400
that as heck seems like
 

7353
02:00:00,400 --> 02:00:02,950
that as heck seems like
a few steps down the path towards

7354
02:00:02,950 --> 02:00:02,960
a few steps down the path towards
 

7355
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:05,910
a few steps down the path towards
intelligence yeah and so like i think

7356
02:00:05,910 --> 02:00:05,920
intelligence yeah and so like i think
 

7357
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:08,149
intelligence yeah and so like i think
that's a very peculiar

7358
02:00:08,149 --> 02:00:08,159
that's a very peculiar
 

7359
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:09,750
that's a very peculiar
uh property of systems that can be

7360
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:09,760
uh property of systems that can be
 

7361
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,310
uh property of systems that can be
engineered so even if the idea is fuzzy

7362
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,320
engineered so even if the idea is fuzzy
 

7363
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:13,589
engineered so even if the idea is fuzzy
even if you're not really sure what

7364
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:13,599
even if you're not really sure what
 

7365
02:00:13,599 --> 02:00:15,109
even if you're not really sure what
intelligence is

7366
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
intelligence is
 

7367
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:16,310
intelligence is
or um

7368
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:16,320
or um
 

7369
02:00:16,320 --> 02:00:18,229
or um
like if you don't have a deep

7370
02:00:18,229 --> 02:00:18,239
like if you don't have a deep
 

7371
02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:19,830
like if you don't have a deep
fundamental understanding or even a

7372
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:19,840
fundamental understanding or even a
 

7373
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,990
fundamental understanding or even a
model what intelligence is if you build

7374
02:00:21,990 --> 02:00:22,000
model what intelligence is if you build
 

7375
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,390
model what intelligence is if you build
a system that sure as heck is impressive

7376
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:24,400
a system that sure as heck is impressive
 

7377
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:27,109
a system that sure as heck is impressive
and showing some of the signs of what

7378
02:00:27,109 --> 02:00:27,119
and showing some of the signs of what
 

7379
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,669
and showing some of the signs of what
previously thought impossible

7380
02:00:29,669 --> 02:00:29,679
previously thought impossible
 

7381
02:00:29,679 --> 02:00:31,669
previously thought impossible
for a non-intelligent

7382
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:31,679
for a non-intelligent
 

7383
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:33,830
for a non-intelligent
uh system then that's impressive and

7384
02:00:33,830 --> 02:00:33,840
uh system then that's impressive and
 

7385
02:00:33,840 --> 02:00:35,750
uh system then that's impressive and
that's inspiring and that's okay to

7386
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:35,760
that's inspiring and that's okay to
 

7387
02:00:35,760 --> 02:00:37,830
that's inspiring and that's okay to
celebrate in physics

7388
02:00:37,830 --> 02:00:37,840
celebrate in physics
 

7389
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:39,750
celebrate in physics
because you're not engineering anything

7390
02:00:39,750 --> 02:00:39,760
because you're not engineering anything
 

7391
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:41,669
because you're not engineering anything
you're just now swimming in the space

7392
02:00:41,669 --> 02:00:41,679
you're just now swimming in the space
 

7393
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:43,750
you're just now swimming in the space
directly when you do theoretical physics

7394
02:00:43,750 --> 02:00:43,760
directly when you do theoretical physics
 

7395
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:45,430
directly when you do theoretical physics
that it could be more dangerous you

7396
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:45,440
that it could be more dangerous you
 

7397
02:00:45,440 --> 02:00:47,030
that it could be more dangerous you
could be out

7398
02:00:47,030 --> 02:00:47,040
could be out
 

7399
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:49,430
could be out
too far away from shore yeah well the

7400
02:00:49,430 --> 02:00:49,440
too far away from shore yeah well the
 

7401
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:50,629
too far away from shore yeah well the
problem

7402
02:00:50,629 --> 02:00:50,639
problem
 

7403
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:53,030
problem
i think if physics is it in a i think

7404
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
i think if physics is it in a i think
 

7405
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,629
i think if physics is it in a i think
it's actually hard for people even to

7406
02:00:54,629 --> 02:00:54,639
it's actually hard for people even to
 

7407
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:57,109
it's actually hard for people even to
believe or really understand

how
 

7411
02:00:58,480 --> 02:01:00,470
how
that this particular kind of physicist

02:01:00,470 --> 02:01:00,480
that this particular kind of physicist
 

7413
02:01:00,480 --> 02:01:02,709
that this particular kind of physicist
has gotten itself into a really unusual

7414
02:01:02,709 --> 02:01:02,719
has gotten itself into a really unusual
 

7415
02:01:02,719 --> 02:01:04,790
has gotten itself into a really unusual

02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,189
usual problems but also
so you could have a

7430
02:01:19,189 --> 02:01:19,199
so you could have a
 

7431
02:01:19,199 --> 02:01:21,109
so you could have a
but but you i just i don't know i've

7432
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
but but you i just i don't know i've
 

7433
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,950
but but you i just i don't know i've
never seen anything at all happening in

7434
02:01:22,950 --> 02:01:22,960
never seen anything at all happening in
 

7435
02:01:22,960 --> 02:01:24,709
never seen anything at all happening in
mathematics like what's happened in the

7436
02:01:24,709 --> 02:01:24,719
mathematics like what's happened in the
 

7437
02:01:24,719 --> 02:01:27,589
mathematics like what's happened in the
specific area in physics it's just

7438
02:01:27,589 --> 02:01:27,599
specific area in physics it's just
 

7439
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,070
specific area in physics it's just
the kind of sociology of this the way

02:01:30,070 --> 02:01:30,080
the kind of sociology of this the way
 

7441
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,430
the kind of sociology of this the way
this field

7442
02:01:31,430 --> 02:01:31,440
this field
 

7443
02:01:31,440 --> 02:01:32,870
this field
works

7444
02:01:32,870 --> 02:01:32,880
works
 

7445
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:35,189
works

02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:38,719
anything from experiment to help it it's
 

7451
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,229
anything from experiment to help it it's

02:01:40,229 --> 02:01:40,239
really
 

7453
02:01:40,239 --> 02:01:41,750
really
it's led to some really kind of

7454
02:01:41,750 --> 02:01:41,760
it's led to some really kind of
 

7455
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:44,790
it's led to some really kind of
problematic things and those so it's one

7456
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:44,800
problematic things and those so it's one
 

7457
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:46,470
problematic things and those so it's one
thing to kind of

7458
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:46,480
thing to kind of
 

7459
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:48,790
thing to kind of
you know oversimplify or to slightly

7460
02:01:48,790 --> 02:01:48,800
you know oversimplify or to slightly
 

7461
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,950
you know oversimplify or to slightly
misrepresent to try to explain things in

7462
02:01:50,950 --> 02:01:50,960
misrepresent to try to explain things in
 

7463
02:01:50,960 --> 02:01:53,109
misrepresent to try to explain things in
a way that's not quite right but it's

7464
02:01:53,109 --> 02:01:53,119
a way that's not quite right but it's
 

7465
02:01:53,119 --> 02:01:55,030
a way that's not quite right but it's
another thing to start promoting to

7466
02:01:55,030 --> 02:01:55,040
another thing to start promoting to
 

7467
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,629
another thing to start promoting to
people

7468
02:01:56,629 --> 02:01:56,639
people
 

7469
02:01:56,639 --> 02:01:58,870
people
as a successes ideas which which really

7470
02:01:58,870 --> 02:01:58,880
as a successes ideas which which really
 

7471
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:01,589
as a successes ideas which which really
completely failed and um so i mean i'm

7472
02:02:01,589 --> 02:02:01,599
completely failed and um so i mean i'm
 

7473
02:02:01,599 --> 02:02:03,510
completely failed and um so i mean i'm
i've kind of a very very specific

7474
02:02:03,510 --> 02:02:03,520
i've kind of a very very specific
 

7475
02:02:03,520 --> 02:02:06,390
i've kind of a very very specific
if you so have people

7476
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,400
if you so have people
 

7477
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,990
if you so have people
won't name any names for instance coming

02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:09,679
on certain podcasts like you're telling
 

7481
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,910
on certain podcasts like you're telling
the world you know this is a huge

the world you know this is a huge
 

7483
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:14,790
the world you know this is a huge
success and this is really wonderful and

7484
02:02:14,790 --> 02:02:14,800
success and this is really wonderful and
 

7485
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:16,390
success and this is really wonderful and
it's just not true

7486
02:02:16,390 --> 02:02:16,400
it's just not true
 

7487
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,950
it's just not true
and and this is this this is really

7488
02:02:18,950 --> 02:02:18,960
and and this is this this is really
 

7489
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:20,790
and and this is this this is really
problematic and it carries a serious

7490
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:20,800
problematic and it carries a serious
 

7491
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,310
problematic and it carries a serious
danger of um you know once

7492
02:02:24,310 --> 02:02:24,320
danger of um you know once
 

7493
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,229
danger of um you know once
when people realize that this is what's

7494
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
when people realize that this is what's
 

7495
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:28,390
when people realize that this is what's
going on you know they

7496
02:02:28,390 --> 02:02:28,400
going on you know they
 

7497
02:02:28,400 --> 02:02:31,589
going on you know they
you know the the loss of credibility of

7498
02:02:31,589 --> 02:02:31,599
you know the the loss of credibility of
 

7499
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:33,830
you know the the loss of credibility of
of science is is a real real problem for

7500
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:33,840
of science is is a real real problem for
 

7501
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,870
of science is is a real real problem for
our society and and you don't want

7502
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:36,880
our society and and you don't want
 

7503
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,270
our society and and you don't want
you don't want people to have an all too

7504
02:02:39,270 --> 02:02:39,280
you don't want people to have an all too
 

7505
02:02:39,280 --> 02:02:40,629
you don't want people to have an all too
good reason to

7506
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639
good reason to
 

7507
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:43,510
good reason to
to think that what they're being

7508
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:43,520
to think that what they're being
 

7509
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:44,790
to think that what they're being
what they're being told by kind of some

7510
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:44,800
what they're being told by kind of some
 

7511
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:46,870
what they're being told by kind of some
of the best uh institutions in our

7512
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:46,880
of the best uh institutions in our
 

7513
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,109
of the best uh institutions in our
country or authorities is is not true

7514
02:02:49,109 --> 02:02:49,119
country or authorities is is not true
 

7515
02:02:49,119 --> 02:02:50,390
country or authorities is is not true
you know it is

7516
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
you know it is
 

7517
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,149
you know it is
it's not true it's a problem

7518
02:02:52,149 --> 02:02:52,159
it's not true it's a problem
 

7519
02:02:52,159 --> 02:02:53,990
it's not true it's a problem
that's it's obviously a characteristic

7520
02:02:53,990 --> 02:02:54,000
that's it's obviously a characteristic
 

7521
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:57,589
that's it's obviously a characteristic
of not just physics it's uh

7522
02:02:57,589 --> 02:02:57,599
of not just physics it's uh
 

7523
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:00,390
of not just physics it's uh
it's sociology yeah

7524
02:03:00,390 --> 02:03:00,400
it's sociology yeah
 

7525
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:01,830
it's sociology yeah
and it's uh i mean obviously in the

7526
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:01,840
and it's uh i mean obviously in the
 

7527
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,070
and it's uh i mean obviously in the
space of politics it's the the history

7528
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
space of politics it's the the history
 

7529
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:06,310
space of politics it's the the history
of politics is uh

7530
02:03:06,310 --> 02:03:06,320
of politics is uh
 

7531
02:03:06,320 --> 02:03:08,229
of politics is uh
you um

7532
02:03:08,229 --> 02:03:08,239
you um
 

7533
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:11,910
you um
you you sell ideas to people

7534
02:03:11,910 --> 02:03:11,920
you you sell ideas to people
 

7535
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,990
you you sell ideas to people
even when you don't have any proof that

7536
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:14,000
even when you don't have any proof that
 

7537
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:16,149
even when you don't have any proof that
those ideas actually work if you speak

7538
02:03:16,149 --> 02:03:16,159
those ideas actually work if you speak
 

7539
02:03:16,159 --> 02:03:18,070
those ideas actually work if you speak
as if they've have worked and that that

7540
02:03:18,070 --> 02:03:18,080
as if they've have worked and that that
 

7541
02:03:18,080 --> 02:03:23,589
as if they've have worked and that that
seems to be the case throughout history

7542
02:03:23,589 --> 02:03:23,599

 

7543
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:25,910

and just like you said it's human beings

7544
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
and just like you said it's human beings
 

7545
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:30,149
and just like you said it's human beings
running up against a really hard problem

7546
02:03:30,149 --> 02:03:30,159

 

7547
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:31,350

i'm not sure if this is like a

7548
02:03:31,350 --> 02:03:31,360
i'm not sure if this is like a
 

7549
02:03:31,360 --> 02:03:33,109
i'm not sure if this is like a
particular

7550
02:03:33,109 --> 02:03:33,119
particular
 

7551
02:03:33,119 --> 02:03:36,229
particular
uh like trajectory through the progress

7552
02:03:36,229 --> 02:03:36,239
uh like trajectory through the progress
 

7553
02:03:36,239 --> 02:03:38,070
uh like trajectory through the progress
of physics that we're dealing with

7554
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:38,080
of physics that we're dealing with
 

7555
02:03:38,080 --> 02:03:39,589
of physics that we're dealing with
knowledge it's just the natural progress

7556
02:03:39,589 --> 02:03:39,599
knowledge it's just the natural progress
 

7557
02:03:39,599 --> 02:03:41,270
knowledge it's just the natural progress
of science you run up against a really

7558
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
of science you run up against a really
 

7559
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:42,709
of science you run up against a really
difficult

7560
02:03:42,709 --> 02:03:42,719
difficult
 

7561
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:44,709
difficult
stage of a field

7562
02:03:44,709 --> 02:03:44,719
stage of a field
 

7563
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:45,990
stage of a field
and

7564
02:03:45,990 --> 02:03:46,000
and
 

7565
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:49,430
and
uh

7566
02:03:49,430 --> 02:03:49,440

 

7567
02:03:49,440 --> 02:03:51,510

different people that behave differently

7568
02:03:51,510 --> 02:03:51,520
different people that behave differently
 

7569
02:03:51,520 --> 02:03:52,950
different people that behave differently
in the face of that

7570
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:52,960
in the face of that
 

7571
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,270
in the face of that
some sell books and sort of

7572
02:03:55,270 --> 02:03:55,280
some sell books and sort of
 

7573
02:03:55,280 --> 02:03:56,790
some sell books and sort of
tell narratives that are beautiful and

7574
02:03:56,790 --> 02:03:56,800
tell narratives that are beautiful and
 

7575
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:59,350
tell narratives that are beautiful and
so on they're not necessarily grounded

7576
02:03:59,350 --> 02:03:59,360
so on they're not necessarily grounded
 

7577
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:01,430
so on they're not necessarily grounded
in um solutions that have proven

7578
02:04:01,430 --> 02:04:01,440
in um solutions that have proven
 

7579
02:04:01,440 --> 02:04:02,629
in um solutions that have proven
themselves

7580
02:04:02,629 --> 02:04:02,639
themselves
 

7581
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:04,790
themselves
others kind of uh put their head down

7582
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:04,800
others kind of uh put their head down
 

7583
02:04:04,800 --> 02:04:06,709
others kind of uh put their head down
quietly keep doing the work others sort

7584
02:04:06,709 --> 02:04:06,719
quietly keep doing the work others sort
 

7585
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:08,709
quietly keep doing the work others sort
of pivot to different fields and that's

7586
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
of pivot to different fields and that's
 

7587
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,589
of pivot to different fields and that's
kind of like yeah ants scattering and

7588
02:04:11,589 --> 02:04:11,599
kind of like yeah ants scattering and
 

7589
02:04:11,599 --> 02:04:13,430
kind of like yeah ants scattering and
then you have feels like machine

7590
02:04:13,430 --> 02:04:13,440
then you have feels like machine
 

7591
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:15,910
then you have feels like machine
learning which is there's a few folks

7592
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:15,920
learning which is there's a few folks
 

7593
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:17,430
learning which is there's a few folks
mostly scattered away from machine

7594
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:17,440
mostly scattered away from machine
 

7595
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:19,910
mostly scattered away from machine
learning in the in the 90s in the winter

7596
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:19,920
learning in the in the 90s in the winter
 

7597
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:23,109
learning in the in the 90s in the winter
of ai ai winter as they call it but a

7598
02:04:23,109 --> 02:04:23,119
of ai ai winter as they call it but a
 

7599
02:04:23,119 --> 02:04:24,950
of ai ai winter as they call it but a
few people kept their head down and now

7600
02:04:24,950 --> 02:04:24,960
few people kept their head down and now
 

7601
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,229
few people kept their head down and now
they're called the fathers of deep

7602
02:04:26,229 --> 02:04:26,239
they're called the fathers of deep
 

7603
02:04:26,239 --> 02:04:27,990
they're called the fathers of deep
learning yeah

7604
02:04:27,990 --> 02:04:28,000
learning yeah
 

7605
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,390
learning yeah
and and they didn't think of it that way

7606
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:30,400
and and they didn't think of it that way
 

7607
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,270
and and they didn't think of it that way
um

7608
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
um
 

7609
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:32,790
um
and in fact if there's another yeah i

7610
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
and in fact if there's another yeah i
 

7611
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:34,069
and in fact if there's another yeah i
went to they'll just probably keep

7612
02:04:34,069 --> 02:04:34,079
went to they'll just probably keep
 

7613
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:36,709
went to they'll just probably keep
working on it anyway sort of like loyal

7614
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
working on it anyway sort of like loyal
 

7615
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:37,669
working on it anyway sort of like loyal
ants

7616
02:04:37,669 --> 02:04:37,679
ants
 

7617
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:39,189
ants
to a particular

7618
02:04:39,189 --> 02:04:39,199
to a particular
 

7619
02:04:39,199 --> 02:04:40,310
to a particular
sure yeah

7620
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
sure yeah
 

7621
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,229
sure yeah
so it's it's it's interesting but you're

7622
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:42,239
so it's it's it's interesting but you're
 

7623
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:44,229
so it's it's it's interesting but you're
sort of saying that um

7624
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
sort of saying that um
 

7625
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,470
sort of saying that um
we should be careful over hyping things

7626
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:46,480
we should be careful over hyping things
 

7627
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:48,310
we should be careful over hyping things
that have not proven themselves

7628
02:04:48,310 --> 02:04:48,320
that have not proven themselves
 

7629
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:49,990
that have not proven themselves
because people will

7630
02:04:49,990 --> 02:04:50,000
because people will
 

7631
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,350
because people will
lose

7632
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:51,360
lose
 

7633
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:54,950
lose
trust in the scientific process yeah but

7634
02:04:54,950 --> 02:04:54,960
trust in the scientific process yeah but
 

7635
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:57,270
trust in the scientific process yeah but
unfortunately there's been other

7636
02:04:57,270 --> 02:04:57,280
unfortunately there's been other
 

7637
02:04:57,280 --> 02:04:59,109
unfortunately there's been other
ways in which people have lost trust in

7638
02:04:59,109 --> 02:04:59,119
ways in which people have lost trust in
 

7639
02:04:59,119 --> 02:05:01,270
ways in which people have lost trust in
the scientific process that ultimately

7640
02:05:01,270 --> 02:05:01,280
the scientific process that ultimately
 

7641
02:05:01,280 --> 02:05:02,709
the scientific process that ultimately
has to do actually with all the same

7642
02:05:02,709 --> 02:05:02,719
has to do actually with all the same
 

7643
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:04,950
has to do actually with all the same
kind of behavior as you're highlighting

7644
02:05:04,950 --> 02:05:04,960
kind of behavior as you're highlighting
 

7645
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,390
kind of behavior as you're highlighting
which is

7646
02:05:06,390 --> 02:05:06,400
which is
 

7647
02:05:06,400 --> 02:05:08,470
which is
not being honest and transparent about

7648
02:05:08,470 --> 02:05:08,480
not being honest and transparent about
 

7649
02:05:08,480 --> 02:05:09,750
not being honest and transparent about
the flaws

7650
02:05:09,750 --> 02:05:09,760
the flaws
 

7651
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:11,910
the flaws
of mistakes of the past yeah i mean

7652
02:05:11,910 --> 02:05:11,920
of mistakes of the past yeah i mean
 

7653
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:14,069
of mistakes of the past yeah i mean
that's always a problem but um this

7654
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:14,079
that's always a problem but um this
 

7655
02:05:14,079 --> 02:05:15,910
that's always a problem but um this
particular field is kind of fun mostly

7656
02:05:15,910 --> 02:05:15,920
particular field is kind of fun mostly
 

7657
02:05:15,920 --> 02:05:17,350
particular field is kind of fun mostly
it it's a

7658
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
it it's a
 

7659
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,270
it it's a
it's always a strange one i mean i think

7660
02:05:19,270 --> 02:05:19,280
it's always a strange one i mean i think
 

7661
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:21,270
it's always a strange one i mean i think
in the sense that

7662
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,280
in the sense that
 

7663
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:22,950
in the sense that
there's a lot of public fascination with

7664
02:05:22,950 --> 02:05:22,960
there's a lot of public fascination with
 

7665
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:24,550
there's a lot of public fascination with
it that it seems to speak to kind of our

7666
02:05:24,550 --> 02:05:24,560
it that it seems to speak to kind of our
 

7667
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:26,950
it that it seems to speak to kind of our
deepest questions about you know

7668
02:05:26,950 --> 02:05:26,960
deepest questions about you know
 

7669
02:05:26,960 --> 02:05:28,629
deepest questions about you know
what is this physical reality where do

7670
02:05:28,629 --> 02:05:28,639
what is this physical reality where do
 

7671
02:05:28,639 --> 02:05:30,390
what is this physical reality where do
we come from and what and these kind of

7672
02:05:30,390 --> 02:05:30,400
we come from and what and these kind of
 

7673
02:05:30,400 --> 02:05:32,310
we come from and what and these kind of
deep issues so there's there's this

7674
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:32,320
deep issues so there's there's this
 

7675
02:05:32,320 --> 02:05:34,390
deep issues so there's there's this
unusual fascination with it mathematics

7676
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,400
unusual fascination with it mathematics
 

7677
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:36,149
unusual fascination with it mathematics
is versus very different nobody nobody's

7678
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
is versus very different nobody nobody's
 

7679
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,069
is versus very different nobody nobody's
that interested in mathematics nobody

7680
02:05:38,069 --> 02:05:38,079
that interested in mathematics nobody
 

7681
02:05:38,079 --> 02:05:39,750
that interested in mathematics nobody
really kind of expects to

7682
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:39,760
really kind of expects to
 

7683
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:41,430
really kind of expects to
learn really great

7684
02:05:41,430 --> 02:05:41,440
learn really great
 

7685
02:05:41,440 --> 02:05:42,470
learn really great
deep things about the world from

7686
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:42,480
deep things about the world from
 

7687
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:43,910
deep things about the world from
mathematics that much they don't ask

7688
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:43,920
mathematics that much they don't ask
 

7689
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,750
mathematics that much they don't ask
mathematicians that so

7690
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:45,760
mathematicians that so
 

7691
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,550
mathematicians that so
so so it's a very unusual it it draws

7692
02:05:48,550 --> 02:05:48,560
so so it's a very unusual it it draws
 

7693
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,030
so so it's a very unusual it it draws
this kind of unusual amount of attention

7694
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:51,040
this kind of unusual amount of attention
 

7695
02:05:51,040 --> 02:05:53,589
this kind of unusual amount of attention
and it really is historically in a

7696
02:05:53,589 --> 02:05:53,599
and it really is historically in a
 

7697
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:55,910
and it really is historically in a
really unusual state it's kind of it's

7698
02:05:55,910 --> 02:05:55,920
really unusual state it's kind of it's
 

7699
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:57,430
really unusual state it's kind of it's
gotten itself

7700
02:05:57,430 --> 02:05:57,440
gotten itself
 

7701
02:05:57,440 --> 02:06:00,069
gotten itself
way kind of down uh

7702
02:06:00,069 --> 02:06:00,079
way kind of down uh
 

7703
02:06:00,079 --> 02:06:03,430
way kind of down uh
down a blind alley in in in a way which

7704
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:03,440
down a blind alley in in in a way which
 

7705
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,270
down a blind alley in in in a way which
it it's hard to find other historical

7706
02:06:05,270 --> 02:06:05,280
it it's hard to find other historical
 

7707
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:07,750
it it's hard to find other historical
parallels but sort of push back a little

7708
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:07,760
parallels but sort of push back a little
 

7709
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:10,550
parallels but sort of push back a little
bit there's power to inspiring people

7710
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
bit there's power to inspiring people
 

7711
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:14,069
bit there's power to inspiring people
and if i just empirically look

7712
02:06:14,069 --> 02:06:14,079
and if i just empirically look
 

7713
02:06:14,079 --> 02:06:15,510

and communicating it like there's
 

7725
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:26,470
and communicating it like there's
something about physics often that

7726
02:06:26,470 --> 02:06:26,480
something about physics often that
 

7727
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:28,790
something about physics often that
forces you to build a strong intuition

7728
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
forces you to build a strong intuition
 

7729
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:30,790
forces you to build a strong intuition
about the way reality works

7730
02:06:30,790 --> 02:06:30,800
about the way reality works
 

7731
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,709
about the way reality works
right and that allows you to think

02:06:32,709 --> 02:06:32,719
right and that allows you to think
 

7733

02:06:36,629 --> 02:06:36,639
sort of and communicate about all kinds
 

7737
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:38,629
sort of and communicate about all kinds
of questions like if you see physicists

7738
02:06:38,629 --> 02:06:38,639
of questions like if you see physicists
 

7739
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:40,470
of questions like if you see physicists
it's always fascinating to take on

7740
02:06:40,470 --> 02:06:40,480
it's always fascinating to take on
 

7741
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:41,990
it's always fascinating to take on
problems that have nothing to do with

7742
02:06:41,990 --> 02:06:42,000
problems that have nothing to do with
 

7743
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,310
problems that have nothing to do with
their particular discipline they think

7744
02:06:44,310 --> 02:06:44,320
their particular discipline they think

02:06:44,320 --> 02:06:46,069
their particular discipline they think
interest in interesting ways and they're

7746
02:06:46,069 --> 02:06:46,079
interest in interesting ways and they're
 

7747
02:06:46,079 --> 02:06:47,589
interest in interesting ways and they're
able to communicate their thinking

7748
02:06:47,589 --> 02:06:47,599
able to communicate their thinking
 

7749
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:50,550
able to communicate their thinking
interesting ways and so in some sense

7750
02:06:50,550 --> 02:06:50,560
interesting ways and so in some sense
 

7751
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:52,709
interesting ways and so in some sense
they have a responsibility not just to

7752
02:06:52,709 --> 02:06:52,719
they have a responsibility not just to
 

7753
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:55,350
they have a responsibility not just to
do science but to inspire

7754
02:06:55,350 --> 02:06:55,360
do science but to inspire
 

7755
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:56,870
do science but to inspire
and not responsibility but the

7756
02:06:56,870 --> 02:06:56,880
and not responsibility but the
 

7757
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,149
and not responsibility but the
opportunity and thereby i would say

7758
02:07:00,149 --> 02:07:00,159
opportunity and thereby i would say
 

7759
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,470
opportunity and thereby i would say
a little bit of a responsibility

7760
02:07:02,470 --> 02:07:02,480
a little bit of a responsibility
 

7761
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:04,870
a little bit of a responsibility
yeah yeah and sometimes but um i know

7762
02:07:04,870 --> 02:07:04,880
yeah yeah and sometimes but um i know
 

7763
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:06,950
yeah yeah and sometimes but um i know
anyway it's hard to say because because

7764
02:07:06,950 --> 02:07:06,960
anyway it's hard to say because because
 

7765
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,510
anyway it's hard to say because because
different um there's many many people

7766
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:09,520
different um there's many many people
 

7767
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:10,870
different um there's many many people
doing this kind of thing with different

7768
02:07:10,870 --> 02:07:10,880
doing this kind of thing with different
 

7769
02:07:10,880 --> 02:07:12,790
doing this kind of thing with different
degrees of

7770
02:07:12,790 --> 02:07:12,800
degrees of
 

7771
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:14,790
degrees of
of success and

7772
02:07:14,790 --> 02:07:14,800
of success and
 

7773
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,310
of success and
whatever i i guess one thing um

7774
02:07:18,310 --> 02:07:18,320
whatever i i guess one thing um
 

7775
02:07:18,320 --> 02:07:20,229
whatever i i guess one thing um
but but i mean my what's kind of front

7776
02:07:20,229 --> 02:07:20,239
but but i mean my what's kind of front
 

7777
02:07:20,239 --> 02:07:21,669
but but i mean my what's kind of front
and center for me is kind of a more

7778
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
and center for me is kind of a more
 

7779
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:25,750
and center for me is kind of a more
parochial interest is just kind of what

7780
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:25,760

 

7781
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:27,990

7782
02:07:27,990 --> 02:07:28,000
what damage do you do to the subject
 

7783
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,030

school students think about string
 

7791
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:36,069

this is what i got to do um is it is
 

7845
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:30,069
this is what i got to do um is it is
that's important to me well in general

7846
02:08:30,069 --> 02:08:30,079
that's important to me well in general
 

7847
02:08:30,079 --> 02:08:32,870
that's important to me well in general
for graduate students for uh people who

7848
02:08:32,870 --> 02:08:32,880
for graduate students for uh people who
 

7849
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:34,149
for graduate students for uh people who
seek to be experts in the field

diversity of ideas is really powerful

7852
02:08:36,390 --> 02:08:36,400
diversity of ideas is really powerful
 

7853
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:40,149
diversity of ideas is really powerful
and is getting into this local pocket of

7854
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
and is getting into this local pocket of
 

7855
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:42,069
and is getting into this local pocket of
ideas that people hold on to for several

7856
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079
ideas that people hold on to for several
 

7857
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:44,790
ideas that people hold on to for several
decades is not good no matter what idea

7858
02:08:44,790 --> 02:08:44,800
decades is not good no matter what idea
 

7859
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,390
decades is not good no matter what idea
i would say no matter if the idea is

7860
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,400
i would say no matter if the idea is
 

7861
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:47,750
i would say no matter if the idea is
right or wrong

7862
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:47,760
right or wrong
 

7863
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:50,229
right or wrong
because there's no such thing as right

7864
02:08:50,229 --> 02:08:50,239
because there's no such thing as right
 

7865
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:54,149
because there's no such thing as right
in the long term like it's right for now

7866
02:08:54,149 --> 02:08:54,159
in the long term like it's right for now
 

7867
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:56,310
in the long term like it's right for now
until somebody builds on

7868
02:08:56,310 --> 02:08:56,320
until somebody builds on
 

7869
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:58,149
until somebody builds on
something much bigger on top of it it

7870
02:08:58,149 --> 02:08:58,159
something much bigger on top of it it
 

7871
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:01,109
something much bigger on top of it it
might end up being ripe but being a a

7872
02:09:01,109 --> 02:09:01,119
might end up being ripe but being a a
 

7873
02:09:01,119 --> 02:09:03,430
might end up being ripe but being a a
tiny subset of a much bigger thing

7874
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:03,440
tiny subset of a much bigger thing
 

7875
02:09:03,440 --> 02:09:05,270
tiny subset of a much bigger thing
so there you always should question sort

7876
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,280
so there you always should question sort
 

7877
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,350
so there you always should question sort
of the uh the ways of the past

7878
02:09:07,350 --> 02:09:07,360
of the uh the ways of the past
 

7879
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:10,149
of the uh the ways of the past
yeah yeah so so how to kind of achieve

7880
02:09:10,149 --> 02:09:10,159
yeah yeah so so how to kind of achieve
 

7881
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:11,669
yeah yeah so so how to kind of achieve
that kind of

7882
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
that kind of
 

7883
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:13,990
that kind of
diversity of thought and uh within kind

7884
02:09:13,990 --> 02:09:14,000
diversity of thought and uh within kind
 

7885
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,310
diversity of thought and uh within kind
of the sociology of how we organize

7886
02:09:16,310 --> 02:09:16,320
of the sociology of how we organize
 

7887
02:09:16,320 --> 02:09:17,750
of the sociology of how we organize
scientific research researches i know

7888
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:17,760
scientific research researches i know
 

7889
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:18,950
scientific research researches i know
this is one thing that i think it's very

7890
02:09:18,950 --> 02:09:18,960
this is one thing that i think it's very
 

7891
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:21,030
this is one thing that i think it's very
interesting that uh sabine hassenfelder

7892
02:09:21,030 --> 02:09:21,040
interesting that uh sabine hassenfelder
 

7893
02:09:21,040 --> 02:09:22,870
interesting that uh sabine hassenfelder
is very it's interesting things to say

7894
02:09:22,870 --> 02:09:22,880
is very it's interesting things to say
 

7895
02:09:22,880 --> 02:09:24,950
is very it's interesting things to say
about it and i think also at least mohan

7896
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:24,960
about it and i think also at least mohan
 

7897
02:09:24,960 --> 02:09:26,950
about it and i think also at least mohan
in his book which is also about that

7898
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:26,960
in his book which is also about that
 

7899
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,550
in his book which is also about that
very

7900
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:28,560
very
 

7901
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:29,990
very
very much in agreement with them that

7902
02:09:29,990 --> 02:09:30,000
very much in agreement with them that
 

7903
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:32,470
very much in agreement with them that
there's

7904
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:32,480
there's
 

7905
02:09:32,480 --> 02:09:33,830
there's
anyway there's a really kind of

7906
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:33,840
anyway there's a really kind of
 

7907
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:36,149
anyway there's a really kind of
important

7908
02:09:36,149 --> 02:09:36,159
important
 

7909
02:09:36,159 --> 02:09:38,790
important
questions about you know how

7910
02:09:38,790 --> 02:09:38,800
questions about you know how
 

7911
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,870
questions about you know how
how how research in this field is

7912
02:09:40,870 --> 02:09:40,880
how how research in this field is
 

7913
02:09:40,880 --> 02:09:42,790
how how research in this field is
organized and how people

7914
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:42,800
organized and how people
 

7915
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,589
organized and how people
you know

7916
02:09:43,589 --> 02:09:43,599
you know
 

7917
02:09:43,599 --> 02:09:45,350
you know
what can you do to kind of get and get

7918
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:45,360
what can you do to kind of get and get
 

7919
02:09:45,360 --> 02:09:46,790
what can you do to kind of get and get
more diversity of thought and get more

7920
02:09:46,790 --> 02:09:46,800
more diversity of thought and get more
 

7921
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:49,430
more diversity of thought and get more
to and get people thinking about um

7922
02:09:49,430 --> 02:09:49,440
to and get people thinking about um
 

7923
02:09:49,440 --> 02:09:53,030
to and get people thinking about um
about a wider range of ideas

7924
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040

 

7925
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:55,270

at the bottom i think humility always

7926
02:09:55,270 --> 02:09:55,280
at the bottom i think humility always
 

7927
02:09:55,280 --> 02:09:57,109
at the bottom i think humility always
helps

7928
02:09:57,109 --> 02:09:57,119
helps
 

7929
02:09:57,119 --> 02:09:58,149
helps
well

7930
02:09:58,149 --> 02:09:58,159
well
 

7931
02:09:58,159 --> 02:09:59,990
well
but the problem is that it's also it's a

7932
02:09:59,990 --> 02:10:00,000
but the problem is that it's also it's a
 

7933
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:01,910
but the problem is that it's also it's a
combination of humility to know when

7934
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
combination of humility to know when
 

7935
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,669
combination of humility to know when
when you're wrong and also

7936
02:10:03,669 --> 02:10:03,679
when you're wrong and also
 

7937
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,750
when you're wrong and also
but also you have to have a you have to

7938
02:10:05,750 --> 02:10:05,760
but also you have to have a you have to
 

7939
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:07,510
but also you have to have a you have to
have a certain very serious lack of

7940
02:10:07,510 --> 02:10:07,520
have a certain very serious lack of
 

7941
02:10:07,520 --> 02:10:08,870
have a certain very serious lack of
humility to believe that you're going to

7942
02:10:08,870 --> 02:10:08,880
humility to believe that you're going to
 

7943
02:10:08,880 --> 02:10:11,109
humility to believe that you're going to
make progress on some of these problems

7944
02:10:11,109 --> 02:10:11,119
make progress on some of these problems
 

7945
02:10:11,119 --> 02:10:13,109
make progress on some of these problems
i think you have to have like both modes

7946
02:10:13,109 --> 02:10:13,119
i think you have to have like both modes
 

7947
02:10:13,119 --> 02:10:18,310
i think you have to have like both modes
and switch between them when needed

7948
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:18,320

 

7949
02:10:18,320 --> 02:10:19,510

let me ask you a question you're

7950
02:10:19,510 --> 02:10:19,520
let me ask you a question you're
 

7951
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,109
let me ask you a question you're
probably not going to want to answer

7952
02:10:21,109 --> 02:10:21,119
probably not going to want to answer
 

7953
02:10:21,119 --> 02:10:23,189
probably not going to want to answer
because uh

7954
02:10:23,189 --> 02:10:23,199
because uh
 

7955
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:24,790
because uh
you're focused on the mathematics of

7956
02:10:24,790 --> 02:10:24,800
you're focused on the mathematics of
 

7957
02:10:24,800 --> 02:10:26,790
you're focused on the mathematics of
things and mathematics can't answer the

7958
02:10:26,790 --> 02:10:26,800
things and mathematics can't answer the
 

7959
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:28,390
things and mathematics can't answer the
why questions but

7960
02:10:28,390 --> 02:10:28,400
why questions but
 

7961
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:30,470
why questions but
let me ask you anyway

7962
02:10:30,470 --> 02:10:30,480
let me ask you anyway
 

7963
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:31,750
let me ask you anyway
do you think there's meaning to this

7964
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
do you think there's meaning to this
 

7965
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:33,189
do you think there's meaning to this
whole thing

7966
02:10:33,189 --> 02:10:33,199
whole thing
 

7967
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,950
whole thing
what do you think is the meaning of life

7968
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:34,960
what do you think is the meaning of life
 

7969
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,709
what do you think is the meaning of life
why are we here

7970
02:10:36,709 --> 02:10:36,719
why are we here
 

7971
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:38,470
why are we here
i don't i don't know yeah i

7972
02:10:38,470 --> 02:10:38,480
i don't i don't know yeah i
 

7973
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:41,350
i don't i don't know yeah i
was thinking about this so the um

7974
02:10:41,350 --> 02:10:41,360
was thinking about this so the um
 

7975
02:10:41,360 --> 02:10:42,390
was thinking about this so the um
it did occur

7976
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,400
it did occur
 

7977
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,550
it did occur
one interesting

7978
02:10:44,550 --> 02:10:44,560
one interesting
 

7979
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,149
one interesting
thing about that question is that you

7980
02:10:46,149 --> 02:10:46,159
thing about that question is that you
 

7981
02:10:46,159 --> 02:10:49,589
thing about that question is that you
don't you know so i have

7982
02:10:49,589 --> 02:10:49,599
don't you know so i have
 

7983
02:10:49,599 --> 02:10:51,350
don't you know so i have
this life in mathematics and this life

7984
02:10:51,350 --> 02:10:51,360
this life in mathematics and this life
 

7985
02:10:51,360 --> 02:10:53,669
this life in mathematics and this life
in physics and and i see

7986
02:10:53,669 --> 02:10:53,679
in physics and and i see
 

7987
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,750
in physics and and i see
some of my physicist colleagues you know

7988
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,760
some of my physicist colleagues you know
 

7989
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,990
some of my physicist colleagues you know
kind of

7990
02:10:57,990 --> 02:10:58,000
kind of
 

7991
02:10:58,000 --> 02:10:59,589
kind of
seem to be people are often asking them

7992
02:10:59,589 --> 02:10:59,599
seem to be people are often asking them
 

7993
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:00,709
seem to be people are often asking them
what's the meaning of life and they're

7994
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
what's the meaning of life and they're
 

7995
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:02,149
what's the meaning of life and they're
writing books about the meaning of life

7996
02:11:02,149 --> 02:11:02,159
writing books about the meaning of life
 

7997
02:11:02,159 --> 02:11:03,430
writing books about the meaning of life
and teaching courses about the meaning

7998
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:03,440
and teaching courses about the meaning
 

7999
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,470
and teaching courses about the meaning
of life and

8000
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:04,480
of life and
 

8001
02:11:04,480 --> 02:11:06,149
of life and
but then i realized that no one ever

8002
02:11:06,149 --> 02:11:06,159
but then i realized that no one ever
 

8003
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:08,790
but then i realized that no one ever
asked my mathematician colleagues

8004
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:08,800
asked my mathematician colleagues
 

8005
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:10,709
asked my mathematician colleagues
nobody ever asks mathematicians yeah

8006
02:11:10,709 --> 02:11:10,719
nobody ever asks mathematicians yeah
 

8007
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:11,550
nobody ever asks mathematicians yeah
that's funny so

8008
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:11,560
that's funny so
 

8009
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:13,189
that's funny so
[Laughter]

8010
02:11:13,189 --> 02:11:13,199
[Laughter]
 

8011
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:13,910
[Laughter]
yeah

8012
02:11:13,910 --> 02:11:13,920
yeah
 

8013
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,189
yeah
everybody just kind of assumes okay well

8014
02:11:15,189 --> 02:11:15,199
everybody just kind of assumes okay well
 

8015
02:11:15,199 --> 02:11:16,229
everybody just kind of assumes okay well
you people are studying about that

8016
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
you people are studying about that
 

8017
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:18,390
you people are studying about that
actually whatever you're doing it's

8018
02:11:18,390 --> 02:11:18,400
actually whatever you're doing it's
 

8019
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,750
actually whatever you're doing it's
maybe very interesting but it's clearly

8020
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:19,760
maybe very interesting but it's clearly
 

8021
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:21,030
maybe very interesting but it's clearly
not going to tell me anything useful

8022
02:11:21,030 --> 02:11:21,040
not going to tell me anything useful
 

8023
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,109
not going to tell me anything useful
about the meaning of my life and i'm

8024
02:11:23,109 --> 02:11:23,119
about the meaning of my life and i'm
 

8025
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:25,589
about the meaning of my life and i'm
afraid a lot of my point of view is that

8026
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:25,599
afraid a lot of my point of view is that
 

8027
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:27,669
afraid a lot of my point of view is that
if people realized how little difference

8028
02:11:27,669 --> 02:11:27,679
if people realized how little difference
 

8029
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:28,550
if people realized how little difference
there was between what the

8030
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:28,560
there was between what the
 

8031
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:29,990
there was between what the
mathematicians are doing and what a lot

8032
02:11:29,990 --> 02:11:30,000
mathematicians are doing and what a lot
 

8033
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:31,109
mathematicians are doing and what a lot
of these theoretical physicists are

8034
02:11:31,109 --> 02:11:31,119
of these theoretical physicists are
 

8035
02:11:31,119 --> 02:11:33,030
of these theoretical physicists are
doing they would they might understand

8036
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
doing they would they might understand
 

8037
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:33,990
doing they would they might understand
that

8038
02:11:33,990 --> 02:11:34,000
that
 

8039
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:37,430
that
it's a bit misguided to look for

8040
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
it's a bit misguided to look for
 

8041
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:38,870
it's a bit misguided to look for
deep insight into the meaning of life

8042
02:11:38,870 --> 02:11:38,880
deep insight into the meaning of life
 

8043
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:40,470
deep insight into the meaning of life
from from

8044
02:11:40,470 --> 02:11:40,480
from from
 

8045
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,629
from from
from many theoretical physicists it's

8046
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
from many theoretical physicists it's
 

8047
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:43,589
from many theoretical physicists it's
not uh

8048
02:11:43,589 --> 02:11:43,599
not uh
 

8049
02:11:43,599 --> 02:11:45,030
not uh
they you know they're they're people

8050
02:11:45,030 --> 02:11:45,040
they you know they're they're people
 

8051
02:11:45,040 --> 02:11:46,149
they you know they're they're people
they have they may have interesting

8052
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
they have they may have interesting
 

8053
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:47,510
they have they may have interesting
things to say about this you're right

8054
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:47,520
things to say about this you're right
 

8055
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,430
things to say about this you're right
they have they know a lot about physical

8056
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,440
they have they know a lot about physical
 

8057
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,430
they have they know a lot about physical
reality and about

8058
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:51,440
reality and about
 

8059
02:11:51,440 --> 02:11:52,390
reality and about
about

8060
02:11:52,390 --> 02:11:52,400
about
 

8061
02:11:52,400 --> 02:11:54,149
about
and sometimes about metaphysics about

8062
02:11:54,149 --> 02:11:54,159
and sometimes about metaphysics about
 

8063
02:11:54,159 --> 02:11:55,030
and sometimes about metaphysics about
what

8064
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:55,040
what
 

8065
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:59,830
what
is is real of this kind but um

8066
02:11:59,830 --> 02:11:59,840

 

8067
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,589

you're also

8068
02:12:01,589 --> 02:12:01,599
you're also
 

8069
02:12:01,599 --> 02:12:02,950
you're also
to my mind i think you're also making a

8070
02:12:02,950 --> 02:12:02,960
to my mind i think you're also making a
 

8071
02:12:02,960 --> 02:12:04,390
to my mind i think you're also making a
bit of a mistake that you're you're

8072
02:12:04,390 --> 02:12:04,400
bit of a mistake that you're you're
 

8073
02:12:04,400 --> 02:12:06,390
bit of a mistake that you're you're
looking to uh

8074
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,400
looking to uh
 

8075
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,229
looking to uh
i mean i'm very very aware that you know

8076
02:12:08,229 --> 02:12:08,239
i mean i'm very very aware that you know
 

8077
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:09,990
i mean i'm very very aware that you know
i've led a very

8078
02:12:09,990 --> 02:12:10,000
i've led a very
 

8079
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:11,830
i've led a very
pleasant and fairly privileged existence

8080
02:12:11,830 --> 02:12:11,840
pleasant and fairly privileged existence
 

8081
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,109
pleasant and fairly privileged existence
of a fairly

8082
02:12:13,109 --> 02:12:13,119
of a fairly
 

8083
02:12:13,119 --> 02:12:14,709
of a fairly
without many challenges of different

8084
02:12:14,709 --> 02:12:14,719
without many challenges of different
 

8085
02:12:14,719 --> 02:12:18,470
without many challenges of different
kinds of a certain kind and and um

8086
02:12:18,470 --> 02:12:18,480
kinds of a certain kind and and um
 

8087
02:12:18,480 --> 02:12:20,870
kinds of a certain kind and and um
i i'm really not in no way the kind of

8088
02:12:20,870 --> 02:12:20,880
i i'm really not in no way the kind of
 

8089
02:12:20,880 --> 02:12:22,310
i i'm really not in no way the kind of
person that

8090
02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:22,320
person that
 

8091
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,390
person that
a lot of people who are looking for to

8092
02:12:24,390 --> 02:12:24,400
a lot of people who are looking for to
 

8093
02:12:24,400 --> 02:12:26,149
a lot of people who are looking for to
try and understand

8094
02:12:26,149 --> 02:12:26,159
try and understand
 

8095
02:12:26,159 --> 02:12:27,990
try and understand
in some meaning of life in the sense of

8096
02:12:27,990 --> 02:12:28,000
in some meaning of life in the sense of
 

8097
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,350
in some meaning of life in the sense of
the challenges that they're facing in

8098
02:12:29,350 --> 02:12:29,360
the challenges that they're facing in
 

8099
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,910
the challenges that they're facing in
life uh i can't really i'm really the

8100
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:31,920
life uh i can't really i'm really the
 

8101
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:33,510
life uh i can't really i'm really the
wrong person for you to be asking about

8102
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,520
wrong person for you to be asking about
 

8103
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:35,030
wrong person for you to be asking about
this well

8104
02:12:35,030 --> 02:12:35,040
this well
 

8105
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:38,069
this well
if struggle is somehow a thing that's

8106
02:12:38,069 --> 02:12:38,079
if struggle is somehow a thing that's
 

8107
02:12:38,079 --> 02:12:40,069
if struggle is somehow a thing that's
core to meaning yeah perhaps

8108
02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:40,079
core to meaning yeah perhaps
 

8109
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:42,310
core to meaning yeah perhaps
mathematicians are just quality the ones

8110
02:12:42,310 --> 02:12:42,320
mathematicians are just quality the ones
 

8111
02:12:42,320 --> 02:12:43,350
mathematicians are just quality the ones
who are

8112
02:12:43,350 --> 02:12:43,360
who are
 

8113
02:12:43,360 --> 02:12:45,270
who are
most equipped to answer that question if

8114
02:12:45,270 --> 02:12:45,280
most equipped to answer that question if
 

8115
02:12:45,280 --> 02:12:48,229
most equipped to answer that question if
in fact the creation or at least

8116
02:12:48,229 --> 02:12:48,239
in fact the creation or at least
 

8117
02:12:48,239 --> 02:12:50,870
in fact the creation or at least
experiencing beauty

8118
02:12:50,870 --> 02:12:50,880
experiencing beauty
 

8119
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:52,310
experiencing beauty
is uh

8120
02:12:52,310 --> 02:12:52,320
is uh
 

8121
02:12:52,320 --> 02:12:53,270
is uh
is

8122
02:12:53,270 --> 02:12:53,280
is
 

8123
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:55,669
is
is at the core of the meaning of life

8124
02:12:55,669 --> 02:12:55,679
is at the core of the meaning of life
 

8125
02:12:55,679 --> 02:12:58,550
is at the core of the meaning of life
because it seems like mathematics is the

8126
02:12:58,550 --> 02:12:58,560
because it seems like mathematics is the
 

8127
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,390
because it seems like mathematics is the
methodology but which you can most

8128
02:13:00,390 --> 02:13:00,400
methodology but which you can most
 

8129
02:13:00,400 --> 02:13:03,510
methodology but which you can most
purely explore beautiful things

8130
02:13:03,510 --> 02:13:03,520
purely explore beautiful things
 

8131
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:05,109
purely explore beautiful things
right yeah

8132
02:13:05,109 --> 02:13:05,119
right yeah
 

8133
02:13:05,119 --> 02:13:06,950
right yeah
so in some sense maybe we should talk to

8134
02:13:06,950 --> 02:13:06,960
so in some sense maybe we should talk to
 

8135
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:08,790
so in some sense maybe we should talk to
mathematicians more

8136
02:13:08,790 --> 02:13:08,800
mathematicians more
 

8137
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:11,669
mathematicians more
yeah yeah maybe but but the uh

8138
02:13:11,669 --> 02:13:11,679
yeah yeah maybe but but the uh
 

8139
02:13:11,679 --> 02:13:13,350
yeah yeah maybe but but the uh
unfortunately you know people do have a

8140
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:13,360
unfortunately you know people do have a
 

8141
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:15,750
unfortunately you know people do have a
somewhat correct perception that what

8142
02:13:15,750 --> 02:13:15,760
somewhat correct perception that what
 

8143
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:16,870
somewhat correct perception that what
these people are doing every day

8144
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:16,880
these people are doing every day
 

8145
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:18,870
these people are doing every day
whatever is is pretty far removed from

whatever is is pretty far removed from

02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:21,910

02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:24,069

yeah from from what's kind of close to

8150
02:13:24,069 --> 02:13:24,079
yeah from from what's kind of close to
 

8151
02:13:24,079 --> 02:13:25,030
yeah from from what's kind of close to
what i'm

8152
02:13:25,030 --> 02:13:25,040
what i'm
 

8153
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:27,189

concerns are so you may learn something

8156
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:28,960
concerns are so you may learn something
 

8157
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:30,149
concerns are so you may learn something
very interesting by talking to

8158
02:13:30,149 --> 02:13:30,159
very interesting by talking to
 

8159
02:13:30,159 --> 02:13:32,629
very interesting by talking to
mathematicians but it's uh

8160
02:13:32,629 --> 02:13:32,639
mathematicians but it's uh
 

8161
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:33,910
mathematicians but it's uh
it's probably not going to be you're

8162
02:13:33,910 --> 02:13:33,920
it's probably not going to be you're
 

8163
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:35,109
it's probably not going to be you're
probably not going to get what you were

8164
02:13:35,109 --> 02:13:35,119
probably not going to get what you were
 

8165
02:13:35,119 --> 02:13:36,870
probably not going to get what you were
hoping

8166
02:13:36,870 --> 02:13:36,880
hoping
 

8167
02:13:36,880 --> 02:13:39,350
hoping
so when you put the pen and paper down

8168
02:13:39,350 --> 02:13:39,360
so when you put the pen and paper down
 

8169
02:13:39,360 --> 02:13:41,270
so when you put the pen and paper down
and you're not thinking about physics

8170
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:41,280
and you're not thinking about physics
 

8171
02:13:41,280 --> 02:13:42,390
and you're not thinking about physics
and you're not thinking about

8172
02:13:42,390 --> 02:13:42,400
and you're not thinking about
 

8173
02:13:42,400 --> 02:13:44,310
and you're not thinking about
mathematics and you just get to breathe

8174
02:13:44,310 --> 02:13:44,320
mathematics and you just get to breathe
 

8175
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,870
mathematics and you just get to breathe
in the air and look around you and

8176
02:13:46,870 --> 02:13:46,880
in the air and look around you and
 

8177
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,109
in the air and look around you and
realize that you're going to die one day

8178
02:13:49,109 --> 02:13:49,119
realize that you're going to die one day
 

8179
02:13:49,119 --> 02:13:52,310
realize that you're going to die one day
you know you think about that

8180
02:13:52,310 --> 02:13:52,320
you know you think about that
 

8181
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:55,750
you know you think about that
um your ideas will live on but you the

8182
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:55,760
um your ideas will live on but you the
 

8183
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:57,030
um your ideas will live on but you the
human

8184
02:13:57,030 --> 02:13:57,040
human
 

8185
02:13:57,040 --> 02:13:58,629
human
not not especially much but certainly

8186
02:13:58,629 --> 02:13:58,639
not not especially much but certainly
 

8187
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:00,790
not not especially much but certainly
i've been getting getting older i'm now

8188
02:14:00,790 --> 02:14:00,800
i've been getting getting older i'm now
 

8189
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:02,629
i've been getting getting older i'm now
64 years old you start to realize well

8190
02:14:02,629 --> 02:14:02,639
64 years old you start to realize well
 

8191
02:14:02,639 --> 02:14:03,589
64 years old you start to realize well
there's

8192
02:14:03,589 --> 02:14:03,599
there's
 

8193
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:05,030
there's
probably less ahead than there was

8194
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:05,040
probably less ahead than there was
 

8195
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:07,510
probably less ahead than there was
behind and so you start to

8196
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:07,520
behind and so you start to
 

8197
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,510
behind and so you start to
that starts to become you know wait what

8198
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:09,520
that starts to become you know wait what
 

8199
02:14:09,520 --> 02:14:10,870
that starts to become you know wait what
do i think about that maybe i should

8200
02:14:10,870 --> 02:14:10,880
do i think about that maybe i should
 

8201
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:12,629
do i think about that maybe i should
actually

8202
02:14:12,629 --> 02:14:12,639
actually
 

8203
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:13,990
actually
get serious about some getting some

8204
02:14:13,990 --> 02:14:14,000
get serious about some getting some
 

8205
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:15,750
get serious about some getting some
things done which i

8206
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:15,760
things done which i
 

8207
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:17,270
things done which i
which i may not have which i may

8208
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
which i may not have which i may
 

8209
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:19,669
which i may not have which i may
otherwise not have time to do which i

8210
02:14:19,669 --> 02:14:19,679
otherwise not have time to do which i
 

8211
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:20,950
otherwise not have time to do which i
didn't see this didn't seem to be a

8212
02:14:20,950 --> 02:14:20,960
didn't see this didn't seem to be a
 

8213
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:23,189
didn't see this didn't seem to be a
problem when i was younger but um

8214
02:14:23,189 --> 02:14:23,199
problem when i was younger but um
 

8215
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:24,629
problem when i was younger but um
that's the main i think the main way in

8216
02:14:24,629 --> 02:14:24,639
that's the main i think the main way in
 

8217
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:26,629
that's the main i think the main way in
which that thought occurs

8218
02:14:26,629 --> 02:14:26,639
which that thought occurs
 

8219
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:29,109
which that thought occurs
but it doesn't uh you know the stoics

8220
02:14:29,109 --> 02:14:29,119
but it doesn't uh you know the stoics
 

8221
02:14:29,119 --> 02:14:31,990
but it doesn't uh you know the stoics
are big on this meditating on mortality

8222
02:14:31,990 --> 02:14:32,000
are big on this meditating on mortality
 

8223
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,350
are big on this meditating on mortality
helps you

8224
02:14:33,350 --> 02:14:33,360
helps you
 

8225
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:36,390
helps you
more intensely appreciate the beauty

8226
02:14:36,390 --> 02:14:36,400
more intensely appreciate the beauty
 

8227
02:14:36,400 --> 02:14:39,350
more intensely appreciate the beauty
when you do experience it

8228
02:14:39,350 --> 02:14:39,360
when you do experience it
 

8229
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:41,430
when you do experience it
i suppose that's true but it's not yeah

8230
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:41,440
i suppose that's true but it's not yeah
 

8231
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:42,950
i suppose that's true but it's not yeah
it's not

8232
02:14:42,950 --> 02:14:42,960
it's not
 

8233
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,470
it's not
not something i've spent

8234
