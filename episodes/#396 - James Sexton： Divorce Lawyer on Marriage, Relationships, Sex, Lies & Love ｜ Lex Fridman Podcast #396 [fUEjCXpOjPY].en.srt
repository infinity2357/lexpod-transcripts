small things but they're not small
 

451
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,510
small things but they're not small
they're kind of everything do you think

452
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:29,520
they're kind of everything do you think
 

453
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,909
they're kind of everything do you think
it's good to communicate that stuff what

454
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
it's good to communicate that stuff what
 

455
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,649
it's good to communicate that stuff what
100

456
00:08:33,649 --> 00:08:33,659
100
 

457
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:35,449
100
it takes away some of the power of it

458
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:35,459
it takes away some of the power of it
 

459
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:38,389
it takes away some of the power of it
right when you point it out

460
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:38,399
right when you point it out
 

461
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,730
right when you point it out
then the person realizes oh okay he

462
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:40,740
then the person realizes oh okay he
 

463
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,709
then the person realizes oh okay he
likes this or dislikes this so yes it

464
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:42,719
likes this or dislikes this so yes it
 

465
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,690
likes this or dislikes this so yes it
becomes a deliberateness to it you know

466
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:44,700
becomes a deliberateness to it you know
 

467
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,010
becomes a deliberateness to it you know
a conscious

468
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,020
a conscious
 

469
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,949
a conscious
so I understand not pointing that out

470
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:48,959
so I understand not pointing that out
 

471
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,769
so I understand not pointing that out
when it's a good thing

472
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:51,779
when it's a good thing
 

473
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:54,590
when it's a good thing
I think when it's a negative thing like

474
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:54,600

1065
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,950

if it didn't have to be a conscious

1072
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:56,520
if it didn't have to be a conscious
 

1073

if it didn't have to be a conscious
practice but I wonder if like anything

1074
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:58,440
practice but I wonder if like anything
 

1075
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,950
practice but I wonder if like anything
in meditation or mindfulness

1076
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
in meditation or mindfulness
 

1077
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,549
in meditation or mindfulness
it's a matter of exercising that way of

1078
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
it's a matter of exercising that way of
 

1079
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,510
it's a matter of exercising that way of
seeing yeah and then once you've come to

1080
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:08,520
seeing yeah and then once you've come to
 

1081
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,710
seeing yeah and then once you've come to
that

1082
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:09,720
that
 

1083
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,470
that
it becomes it does itself right like it

1084
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:12,480
it becomes it does itself right like it
 

1085
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,810
it becomes it does itself right like it
it really does like your

1086
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:14,820
it really does like your
 

1087
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,870
it really does like your
I think it's it initially has to be a

1088
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:17,880
I think it's it initially has to be a
 

1089
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,310
I think it's it initially has to be a
conscious practice

1090
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:19,320
conscious practice
 

1091
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,090
conscious practice
and and by the way it's easier to make

1092
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,100
and and by the way it's easier to make
 

1093
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,810
and and by the way it's easier to make
it a conscious practice before it

1094
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:26,820
it a conscious practice before it
 

1095
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:30,049
it a conscious practice before it
started to fade right like the I mean

1541
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:39,669
just in delicate it's rude you know so
so I don't think it's a matter of like

1550
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,380
I just think if if that is a proclivity
 

1551
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,710
I just think if if that is a proclivity
that is anything other than a passing

1552
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:54,720
that is anything other than a passing
 

1553
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,210
that is anything other than a passing
thought like it's something that you

1554
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:56,220
thought like it's something that you
 

1555
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,669
thought like it's something that you
just keep coming back to

1556
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:58,679
just keep coming back to
 

1557
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,950
just keep coming back to
then you're making a conscious decision

1558
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:00,960
then you're making a conscious decision
 

1559
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,830
then you're making a conscious decision
to withhold it from your partner and

1560
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
to withhold it from your partner and
 

1561
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,750
to withhold it from your partner and
what is that out of I mean I would say

1563
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,549
what is that out of I mean I would say
it's probably out of fear I'm not a

1564
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:07,559
it's probably out of fear I'm not a
 

1565
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,350
it's probably out of fear I'm not a
psychologist but probably out of fear

1566
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
psychologist but probably out of fear
 

1567
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,810
psychologist but probably out of fear
fear that they would reject you that

1568
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:11,820
fear that they would reject you that
 

1569
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,549

1572
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:18,120

 

1573
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,690

this

1574
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:20,700
this
 

1575
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,830
this
you know

1576
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
you know
 

1577
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,590
you know
I I'm I'm very conflicted in my

1578
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:24,600
I I'm I'm very conflicted in my
 

1579
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,990
I I'm I'm very conflicted in my
religious Faith but I

1580
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,000
religious Faith but I

1583
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,430
I don't know that I believe in the devil
but if there was a devil

1584
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
but if there was a devil
 

1585
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,649
but if there was a devil
I think his principal function would be

1586
00:29:33,649 --> 00:29:33,659
I think his principal function would be
 

1587
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,870
I think his principal function would be
to convince us that we are so beastial

1588
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:35,880
to convince us that we are so beastial
 

1589
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,149
to convince us that we are so beastial
that God couldn't love us

1590
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:38,159
that God couldn't love us
 

1591
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,950
that God couldn't love us
it would be to convince us that we're

1592
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:39,960
it would be to convince us that we're
 

1593
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,970
it would be to convince us that we're
awful

awful
 

1595
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,769

you can't do that a lesson I learned

2046
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:15,420
you can't do that a lesson I learned
 

2047
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,750
you can't do that a lesson I learned
when my mother passed away of a very

2048
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:17,760
when my mother passed away of a very
 

2049
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,510
when my mother passed away of a very
two-year terrible battle with cancer and

2050
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,520
two-year terrible battle with cancer and
 

2051
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:23,390
two-year terrible battle with cancer and
was on hospice and was very very sick

2052
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:23,400
was on hospice and was very very sick
 

2053
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,930
was on hospice and was very very sick
and it was a very slow and awful end

2054
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:26,940
and it was a very slow and awful end
 

2055
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,690
and it was a very slow and awful end
and I remember one of my worst fears was

2056
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:29,700
and I remember one of my worst fears was
 

2057
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,790
and I remember one of my worst fears was
that this is how I would remember my

2058
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:31,800
that this is how I would remember my
 

2059
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,430
that this is how I would remember my
mother for the rest of my life that I

2060
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:34,440
mother for the rest of my life that I
 

2061
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,710
mother for the rest of my life that I
would never be able to think of her that

2062
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:36,720
would never be able to think of her that
 

2063
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,410
would never be able to think of her that
I didn't think of what she had become in

2064
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:39,420
I didn't think of what she had become in
 

2065
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,510
I didn't think of what she had become in
the last months where she was withered

2066
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:41,520
the last months where she was withered
 

2067
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,630
the last months where she was withered
away to nothing in this bed you know

2068
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:44,640
away to nothing in this bed you know
 

2069
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,089
away to nothing in this bed you know
and I learned over time that memory is

2070
00:38:47,089 --> 00:38:47,099
and I learned over time that memory is
 

2071
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:50,450
and I learned over time that memory is
very kind that like that faded somehow

2072
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:50,460
very kind that like that faded somehow
 

2073
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,329
very kind that like that faded somehow
and that now like when I remember her I

2074
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:53,339
and that now like when I remember her I
 

2075
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,250
and that now like when I remember her I
remember her healthy and vibrant I

2076
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:55,260
remember her healthy and vibrant I
 

2077
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,510
remember her healthy and vibrant I
remember her laughter I remember

2078
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:56,520
remember her laughter I remember
 

2079
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,490
remember her laughter I remember
positive things some of that is I like

2080
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:58,500
positive things some of that is I like
 

2081
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,770
positive things some of that is I like
to look at photos of that or but some of

2082
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:00,780
to look at photos of that or but some of
 

2083
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,770
to look at photos of that or but some of
it is just how I think memory works and

2084
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:03,780
it is just how I think memory works and
 

2085
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:07,190
it is just how I think memory works and
I I don't know why we don't apply that

2086
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
I I don't know why we don't apply that
 

2087
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,370
I I don't know why we don't apply that
to relationships and I think part of it

2088
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:10,380
to relationships and I think part of it
 

2089
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,530
to relationships and I think part of it
is because we have this binary view of

2090
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:12,540
is because we have this binary view of
 

2091
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,690
is because we have this binary view of
relationships that it's either success

2092
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:14,700
relationships that it's either success
 

2093
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,069
relationships that it's either success
which means you live happily ever after

2094
00:39:16,069 --> 00:39:16,079
which means you live happily ever after
 

2095
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,569
which means you live happily ever after
for the rest of your lives and die

2096
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:17,579
for the rest of your lives and die
 

2097
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:18,890
for the rest of your lives and die
together

2098
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:18,900
together
 

2099
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,410
together
or like in short succession

2100
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:21,420
or like in short succession
 

2101
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,589
or like in short succession
or it was wrong it was awful and I I

2102
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:24,599
or it was wrong it was awful and I I
 

2103
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,230
or it was wrong it was awful and I I
don't understand why that would have to

2104
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,240
don't understand why that would have to
 

2105
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,569
don't understand why that would have to
be how we do it I think we could look at

2106
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:29,579
be how we do it I think we could look at
 

2107
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:31,430
be how we do it I think we could look at
relationships like what they are which

2108
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:31,440
relationships like what they are which
 

2109
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,870
relationships like what they are which
is Chapters

2110
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:32,880
is Chapters
 

2111
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,670
is Chapters
in a book

2112
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:34,680
in a book
 

2113
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,650
in a book
and that book is our life

2114
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:36,660
and that book is our life
 

2115
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,829
and that book is our life
and those chapters all have significance

2116
00:39:39,829 --> 00:39:39,839
and those chapters all have significance
 

2117
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,510
and those chapters all have significance
and none of them would have the later

2118
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
and none of them would have the later
 

2119
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,589
and none of them would have the later
chapters none of them would happen

2120
00:39:42,589 --> 00:39:42,599
chapters none of them would happen
 

2121
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:45,109
chapters none of them would happen
without the prior ones so there's this

2122
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:45,119
without the prior ones so there's this
 

2123
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,210
without the prior ones so there's this
beauty of me of that and it's I don't

2124
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:47,220
beauty of me of that and it's I don't
 

2125
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,670
beauty of me of that and it's I don't
know if that it's a choice

2126
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:49,680
know if that it's a choice
 

2127
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,589
know if that it's a choice
or if that is how it is and the rest is

2128
00:39:54,589 --> 00:39:54,599
or if that is how it is and the rest is
 

2129
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,569
or if that is how it is and the rest is
just narrative that we've put on top of

2130
00:39:56,569 --> 00:39:56,579
just narrative that we've put on top of
 

2131
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,690
just narrative that we've put on top of
it culturally for some reason well I

2132
00:39:59,690 --> 00:39:59,700
it culturally for some reason well I
 

2133
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,430
it culturally for some reason well I
think to push back a little bit I think

2134
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
think to push back a little bit I think
 

2135
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,230
think to push back a little bit I think
memory

2136
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:03,240
memory
 

2137
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,270
memory
can also I think it is a deliberate

2138
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,280
can also I think it is a deliberate
 

2139
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,690
can also I think it is a deliberate
choice because I think memory can

2140
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:07,700
choice because I think memory can
 

2141
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:10,370
choice because I think memory can
basically that's how trauma works it can

2142
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:10,380
basically that's how trauma works it can
 

2143
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:13,250
basically that's how trauma works it can
Surface the negative stuff and the

2144
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:13,260
Surface the negative stuff and the
 

2145
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,770
Surface the negative stuff and the
negative stuff completely drowns out all

2146
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:15,780
negative stuff completely drowns out all
 

2147
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,190
negative stuff completely drowns out all
the positives so it's I think

2148
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:18,200
the positives so it's I think
 

2149
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:21,109
the positives so it's I think
uh uh it's a deliberate choice to make

2150
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:21,119
uh uh it's a deliberate choice to make
 

2151
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,390
uh uh it's a deliberate choice to make
your memory probably work that way you

2152
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:23,400
your memory probably work that way you
 

2153
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,970
your memory probably work that way you

infidelity
like one event

darkness of okay this what I believed

was true is totally untrue and started
 

2171
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,990
was true is totally untrue and started
to overcome that and still appreciate

to overcome that and still appreciate
 

2173

00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,849
but is there some if if you're looking
just at the texts like it begs the

2900
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:13,859
just at the texts like it begs the
 

2901

just at the texts like it begs the
question

2902
00:54:15,470 --> 00:54:15,480
question
 

2903
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,329
question
wouldn't you take the nap and then go

it turns out I was really tired like
 

2909
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:22,309

that's uh because sometimes it's hard to
 

2913
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,750

again about I don't know we just take
risks and we're vulnerable with each

2988

that for whatever reasons inspires a
 

2993
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:09,049
that for whatever reasons inspires a
kind of candor

2994
00:56:09,049 --> 00:56:09,059
kind of candor
 

2995
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:11,630
kind of candor
because I think it it is a new way to

2996
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:11,640
because I think it it is a new way to
 

2997
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:14,030
because I think it it is a new way to
communicate right in the scheme of

2998
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:14,040
communicate right in the scheme of
 

2999
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,730
communicate right in the scheme of
things and so sometimes you know we

3000
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:16,740
things and so sometimes you know we
 

3001
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:18,650
things and so sometimes you know we
don't know the thing until it's really

3002
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:18,660
don't know the thing until it's really
 

3003
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,010
don't know the thing until it's really
come into existence so I don't know I

3004
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:22,020
come into existence so I don't know I
 

3005
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,990
come into existence so I don't know I
think it started as something that we

3006
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:24,000
think it started as something that we
 

3007
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,750
think it started as something that we
just communicated in a very

3008
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
just communicated in a very
 

3009
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,670
just communicated in a very
extemporaneous unplanned way like texts

3010
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:28,680
extemporaneous unplanned way like texts
 

3011
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,650
extemporaneous unplanned way like texts
were meant to be I'm here I'm outside

3012
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:30,660
were meant to be I'm here I'm outside
 

3013
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,230
were meant to be I'm here I'm outside
whatever it might be

3014
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:33,240
whatever it might be
 

3015
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:36,290
whatever it might be
and so what happens when you

3016
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:36,300
and so what happens when you
 

3017
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,630
and so what happens when you
start to talk about more emotional

3018
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
start to talk about more emotional
 

3019
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,150
start to talk about more emotional
deeper bigger things or visceral things

3020
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:41,160
deeper bigger things or visceral things
 

3021
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,809
deeper bigger things or visceral things
or more emphatic passionate things using

00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,089
or more emphatic passionate things using
a technology that was originally just

forever and I I think I had a
 

3729
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:05,090
forever and I I think I had a
30-something year break from

30-something year break from
 

3731

antagonistic to it so I can Shore up
defenses

3770
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:51,060
defenses
 

3771
01:10:51,060 --> 01:10:54,649
defenses
so I have to I have to feel this

3772
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:54,659

person's story and feelings
from every possible angle because every

3776
01:10:59,930 --> 01:10:59,940
from every possible angle because every
 

3777
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:01,790
from every possible angle because every
one of them is a vulnerability and every

3778
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:01,800
one of them is a vulnerability and every
 

3779
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,350
one of them is a vulnerability and every
one of them is a potential strength and

one of them is a potential strength and
a potential defense and so I I actually

01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:06,540
a potential defense and so I I actually
 

3783
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,169
a potential defense and so I I actually
think it's my number one other than

extemporaneous speaking ability it is my
number one job tool is the ability to

3788
01:11:16,810 --> 01:11:16,820
number one job tool is the ability to
 

3789
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:20,930
number one job tool is the ability to
radically empathize and to put myself in

3790
01:11:20,930 --> 01:11:20,940
radically empathize and to put myself in
 

3791
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,910

the emotional state of someone in its

3792
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920

possible light
 

3797
01:11:26,219 --> 01:11:28,729
possible light
so that I can see again the defense and

01:11:28,729 --> 01:11:28,739
so that I can see again the defense and
 

3799
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:31,490
so that I can see again the defense and
I can see the vulnerability but I mean

3800
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:31,500
I can see the vulnerability but I mean
 

3801
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:33,649
I can see the vulnerability but I mean
so that's beautifully put but also just

it's all gone but the pain is actually a
 

4047
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,050
it's all gone but the pain is actually a
kind of celebration of the love you ask

01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:30,060
kind of celebration of the love you ask
 

4049
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,729
kind of celebration of the love you ask

4053
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,810
isn't hate the opposite of Love is
indifference yeah there's no question

4054
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:35,820
indifference yeah there's no question
 

4055
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,209
indifference yeah there's no question
about that I mean it hate is a

4056
01:16:38,209 --> 01:16:38,219
about that I mean it hate is a
 

4057
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:39,770
about that I mean it hate is a
passionate emotion love is a passionate

4058
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:39,780
passionate emotion love is a passionate
 

4059
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,229
passionate emotion love is a passionate
emotion but and and there is a school of

4060
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:42,239
emotion but and and there is a school of
 

4061
01:16:42,239 --> 01:16:44,149
emotion but and and there is a school of
thought that says that only unfulfilled

4062
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
thought that says that only unfulfilled
 

4063
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,610
thought that says that only unfulfilled
love can be truly romantic

4064
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:46,620
love can be truly romantic
 

4065
01:16:46,620 --> 01:16:50,209
love can be truly romantic
but I I believe that

4066
01:16:50,209 --> 01:16:50,219
but I I believe that
 

4067
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:52,250
but I I believe that
it's what I think I learned from hospice

4068
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:52,260
it's what I think I learned from hospice
 

4069
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:54,590
it's what I think I learned from hospice
is that I I think

4070
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:54,600
is that I I think
 

4071
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:55,870
is that I I think
for me

4072
01:16:55,870 --> 01:16:55,880
for me
 

4073
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:59,030
for me
knowing the impermanence

4074
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
knowing the impermanence
 

4075
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,970
knowing the impermanence
is is the thing you know it's the key

4076
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:01,980
is is the thing you know it's the key
 

4077
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:03,709
is is the thing you know it's the key
yeah it's finite as eventually it's

4078
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:03,719
yeah it's finite as eventually it's
 

4079
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,750
yeah it's finite as eventually it's
going to be over and so like that

4080
01:17:05,750 --> 01:17:05,760
going to be over and so like that
 

4081
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:07,850
going to be over and so like that
intensifies the feeling that that's when

4082
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:07,860
intensifies the feeling that that's when
 

4083
01:17:07,860 --> 01:17:08,990
intensifies the feeling that that's when
you can have

4084
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,000
you can have
 

4085
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,169
you can have
Pure Love without the drama dogs are for

4086
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:12,179
Pure Love without the drama dogs are for
 

4087
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:14,330
Pure Love without the drama dogs are for
me a great example

4088
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:14,340
me a great example
 

4089
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,250
me a great example
and again I don't know what it all means

4090
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:16,260
and again I don't know what it all means
 

4091
01:17:16,260 --> 01:17:19,310
and again I don't know what it all means
right existentially but I just feel like

4092
01:17:19,310 --> 01:17:19,320
right existentially but I just feel like
 

4093
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:23,090
right existentially but I just feel like
they have that that kind of love has to

4094
01:17:23,090 --> 01:17:23,100
they have that that kind of love has to
 

4095
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:25,189
they have that that kind of love has to
be here to teach us something

4096
01:17:25,189 --> 01:17:25,199
be here to teach us something
 

4097
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,590
be here to teach us something
and I I feel like the fact that they're

4098
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
and I I feel like the fact that they're
 

4099
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,110
and I I feel like the fact that they're
so amazing and just so loving and so

4100
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:30,120
so amazing and just so loving and so
 

4101
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:31,970
so amazing and just so loving and so
wonderful and the bond we feel is so

4102
01:17:31,970 --> 01:17:31,980
wonderful and the bond we feel is so
 

4103
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,370
wonderful and the bond we feel is so
amazing and deep and it doesn't require

4104
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:34,380
amazing and deep and it doesn't require
 

4105
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:36,350
amazing and deep and it doesn't require
a lot of maintenance

4106
01:17:36,350 --> 01:17:36,360
a lot of maintenance
 

4107
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,290
a lot of maintenance
and yet it's so finite like it's just

4108
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:39,300
and yet it's so finite like it's just
 

4109
01:17:39,300 --> 01:17:41,689
and yet it's so finite like it's just
this short little lifespan

4110
01:17:41,689 --> 01:17:41,699
this short little lifespan
 

4111
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,910
this short little lifespan
and I feel like that there's just such a

4112
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:43,920
and I feel like that there's just such a
 

4113
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,189
and I feel like that there's just such a
lesson there you know there's so much

4114
01:17:46,189 --> 01:17:46,199
lesson there you know there's so much
 

4115
01:17:46,199 --> 01:17:49,970
lesson there you know there's so much
there to unpack about the nature of

4116
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:49,980
there to unpack about the nature of
 

4117
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:54,350
there to unpack about the nature of
connection and loss and you know that

4118
01:17:54,350 --> 01:17:54,360
connection and loss and you know that
 

4119
01:17:54,360 --> 01:17:57,410
connection and loss and you know that
that that your heart has this infinite

4120
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:57,420
that that your heart has this infinite
 

4121
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,390
that that your heart has this infinite
capacity like when you're I'm telling

4122
01:17:59,390 --> 01:17:59,400
capacity like when you're I'm telling
 

4123
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,910
capacity like when you're I'm telling
you when when my dog died when Buster

4124
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:01,920
you when when my dog died when Buster
 

4125
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:04,310
you when when my dog died when Buster
died I remember I thinking with

4126
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
died I remember I thinking with
 

4127
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,130
died I remember I thinking with
certainty I will never do this again

4128
01:18:07,130 --> 01:18:07,140
certainty I will never do this again
 

4129
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:09,530
certainty I will never do this again
because I'll never love that way again

4130
01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:09,540
because I'll never love that way again
 

4131
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:12,229
because I'll never love that way again
I'll Never Love A dog the way I love

4132
01:18:12,229 --> 01:18:12,239
I'll Never Love A dog the way I love
 

4133
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:15,050
I'll Never Love A dog the way I love
this dog and it's just not true that's

4134
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:15,060
this dog and it's just not true that's
 

4135
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,410
this dog and it's just not true that's
just not true like you you have this

4136
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:18,420
just not true like you you have this
 

4137
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:21,110
just not true like you you have this
infinite capacity and and it's that

4138
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
infinite capacity and and it's that
 

4139
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:23,870
infinite capacity and and it's that
makes it scary actually because like

4140
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:23,880
makes it scary actually because like
 

4141
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,990
makes it scary actually because like
right now there's so many people you

4142
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,000
right now there's so many people you
 

4143
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:28,669
right now there's so many people you
could love there's so many dogs you

4144
01:18:28,669 --> 01:18:28,679
could love there's so many dogs you
 

4145
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:30,649
could love there's so many dogs you
could love like there's so much out

4146
01:18:30,649 --> 01:18:30,659
could love like there's so much out
 

4147
01:18:30,659 --> 01:18:34,490
could love like there's so much out
there and it requires a certain bravery

4148
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:34,500
there and it requires a certain bravery
 

4149
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,530
there and it requires a certain bravery
and tremendous amount of risk to do it

4150
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:36,540
and tremendous amount of risk to do it
 

4151
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:38,689
and tremendous amount of risk to do it
you know and

4152
01:18:38,689 --> 01:18:38,699
you know and
 

4153
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:41,630
you know and
um a commitment because I I think to

4154
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:41,640
um a commitment because I I think to
 

4155
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,910
um a commitment because I I think to
really experience love is you just dive

4156
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
really experience love is you just dive
 

4157
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,550
really experience love is you just dive
in because there is a huge number of

4158
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560
in because there is a huge number of
 

4159
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:49,910
in because there is a huge number of
people but to really like I mean you you

really
um

4166
01:18:54,649 --> 01:18:54,659
um
 

4167
01:18:54,659 --> 01:18:56,810
um
dive into the full complexity the full

4168
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:56,820
dive into the full complexity the full
 

4169
01:18:56,820 --> 01:18:59,270
dive into the full complexity the full
range of another human being yeah which

4170
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
range of another human being yeah which
 

4171
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,290
range of another human being yeah which
is hard

4172
01:19:00,290 --> 01:19:00,300
is hard
 

4173
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:01,790
is hard
because we don't even I don't know that

4174
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:01,800
because we don't even I don't know that
 

4175
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,590
because we don't even I don't know that
we even feel comfortable diving into the

4176

01:19:19,729 --> 01:19:19,739
let's go back to some cases perhaps that
 

4191
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:22,189
let's go back to some cases perhaps that
you've uh worked on just something that

4192
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:22,199
you've uh worked on just something that
 

4193
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:24,890
you've uh worked on just something that
stands out to you what's maybe

stands out to you what's maybe
um the craziest most complicated thing

4196
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,480
um the craziest most complicated thing
 

4197
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:28,970
um the craziest most complicated thing
you've worked on is there something that

4198
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:28,980
you've worked on is there something that
 

4199
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,649
you've worked on is there something that
pops to mind craziest would be different

4200
01:19:30,649 --> 01:19:30,659
pops to mind craziest would be different
 

4201
01:19:30,659 --> 01:19:32,330
pops to mind craziest would be different
than most complicated let's go craziest

4202
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:32,340
than most complicated let's go craziest
 

4203
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:35,930
than most complicated let's go craziest
yeah so craziest ah

um that you could fill 15 books
in terms of complexity you know I mean

4230
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:05,640
in terms of complexity you know I mean
 

4231
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,090

4247
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,970
and that is so loaded with subjective
you know

face to face with often well there was I
mean it was real it was the law there

4258

unfit mother
 

4273
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:57,229
unfit mother
so that's where the idea of like someone

4274
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:57,239
so that's where the idea of like someone
 

4275
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:59,510
so that's where the idea of like someone
has to be proven an unfit mother came

from now in the 80s 1980s
 

4279
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:06,350
from now in the 80s 1980s
that was changed but

4280
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:06,360
that was changed but
 

4281
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,790
that was changed but
you know

4282
01:21:07,790 --> 01:21:07,800
you know
 

4283
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:10,130
you know
under my skin is under my sovereignty I

mean you can't suggest that there isn't

4286
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:13,440
mean you can't suggest that there isn't
 

4287
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,830
mean you can't suggest that there isn't
in the in the world

4288
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:15,840
in the in the world
 

4289
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,669
in the in the world
a suggestion that a mother who births a

child and feeds a child with her body
 

4293
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:25,550
child and feeds a child with her body
doesn't have a particular bond with a

01:21:33,169 --> 01:21:33,179
so where do we put that how much
 

4301
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:35,630
so where do we put that how much
importance do we put on it now that

4302
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:35,640
importance do we put on it now that
 

4303
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:38,689
importance do we put on it now that
there's better and more research in the

4304
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:38,699
there's better and more research in the
 

4305
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:40,550
there's better and more research in the

4309
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:46,970
Theory and infants there's also a lot of
you know a lot of research on how is

4310
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:46,980
you know a lot of research on how is
 

4311
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:50,030
you know a lot of research on how is
attachment formed how should parenting

4312
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:50,040
attachment formed how should parenting
 

4313

but you know it there's conflicting
 

4319
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,090
but you know it there's conflicting
perspectives on that and so as judge to

4320
01:21:59,090 --> 01:21:59,100
perspectives on that and so as judge to
 

4321
01:21:59,100 --> 01:22:00,709
perspectives on that and so as judge to
judge you see like is there a lot of

4322
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
judge you see like is there a lot of
 

4323
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,510
judge you see like is there a lot of
variation yeah there is because there's

4324
01:22:02,510 --> 01:22:02,520
variation yeah there is because there's
 

4325
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,250
variation yeah there is because there's
lots of kinds of Judges like there's

so what is in general

4352
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:28,620
so what is in general

the process of these custody battles

4354

4357
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,590
like what what are the what's the
landscape well most the overwhelming

4358
01:22:36,590 --> 01:22:36,600

4361
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,030
majority of custody cases don't end up
in my office they they

4362
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:44,040
in my office they they
 

4363
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:47,030
in my office they they
are a negotiation between two people

4364
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:47,040
are a negotiation between two people
 

4365
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,890
are a negotiation between two people
that love their children more than they

4366
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:48,900
that love their children more than they

dislike their soon to be ex
 

4369
01:22:51,420 --> 01:22:54,250
dislike their soon to be ex
so the overwhelming majority of cases

4370
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:54,260
so the overwhelming majority of cases
 

4371
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:58,130
so the overwhelming majority of cases
are just two people going okay how are

4372
01:22:58,130 --> 01:22:58,140
are just two people going okay how are
 

4373
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,750
are just two people going okay how are
we going to make decisions together

4374
01:22:59,750 --> 01:22:59,760
we going to make decisions together
 

4375
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,490
we going to make decisions together
because there are decisions that have to

4376
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:01,500
because there are decisions that have to
 

4377
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:03,350
because there are decisions that have to
be made about kids will they go to

4378
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
be made about kids will they go to
 

4379
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,970
be made about kids will they go to
public or private school can they go on

4380
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:04,980

medication if they need it or not should

4382
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:06,900
medication if they need it or not should
 

4383
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,630
medication if they need it or not should
we change pediatricians you know all

4384
01:23:08,630 --> 01:23:08,640
we change pediatricians you know all
 

4385
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,310
we change pediatricians you know all
those kinds of things how do we make

4386
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:10,320
those kinds of things how do we make
 

4387
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,110
those kinds of things how do we make
decisions and when will we each spend

4388
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,120
decisions and when will we each spend
 

4389
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,669
decisions and when will we each spend
time with the kids

4390
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
time with the kids
 

4391
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:16,310
time with the kids
and so most custody cases are just that

4392
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:16,320
and so most custody cases are just that
 

4393
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,470
and so most custody cases are just that
most custody cases are just a discussion

4394
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
most custody cases are just a discussion
 

4395
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,770
most custody cases are just a discussion
a negotiation between Council about

4396
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:21,780
a negotiation between Council about
 

4397
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:24,290
a negotiation between Council about
those issues and and they're not

4398
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:24,300
those issues and and they're not
 

4399
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:26,510
those issues and and they're not
ugly and they're not anything they're

4400
01:23:26,510 --> 01:23:26,520
ugly and they're not anything they're
 

4401
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:28,370
ugly and they're not anything they're
just people again sometimes people have

4402
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:28,380
just people again sometimes people have
 

4403
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:30,649
just people again sometimes people have
differing perspectives you know but

4404
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:30,659
differing perspectives you know but
 

4405
01:23:30,659 --> 01:23:31,790
differing perspectives you know but
sometimes people haven't thought through

4406
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:31,800
sometimes people haven't thought through
 

4407
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,770
sometimes people haven't thought through
their perspective so as a divorce lawyer

4408
01:23:33,770 --> 01:23:33,780
their perspective so as a divorce lawyer
 

4409
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:36,110
their perspective so as a divorce lawyer
a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a

4410
01:23:36,110 --> 01:23:36,120
a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a
 

4411
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:39,590
a lot of what I'm doing is counseling a
person because they come in and say well

4412
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:39,600
person because they come in and say well
 

4413
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,510
person because they come in and say well
I've been the person who handles you

4414
01:23:41,510 --> 01:23:41,520
I've been the person who handles you
 

4415
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:43,610
I've been the person who handles you
know all of the homework and all of the

4416
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:43,620
know all of the homework and all of the
 

4417
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,350
know all of the homework and all of the
everything so he should only see the

4418
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
everything so he should only see the
 

4419
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,390
everything so he should only see the
kids on weekends

4420
01:23:47,390 --> 01:23:47,400
kids on weekends
 

4421
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,729
kids on weekends
and there's a logic to that like I've

4422
01:23:49,729 --> 01:23:49,739
and there's a logic to that like I've
 

4423
01:23:49,739 --> 01:23:50,930
and there's a logic to that like I've
always done the homework with the kids

4424
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:50,940
always done the homework with the kids
 

4425
01:23:50,940 --> 01:23:52,250
always done the homework with the kids
so I'm the parent who's in charge of the

4426
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:52,260
so I'm the parent who's in charge of the
 

4427
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:54,050
so I'm the parent who's in charge of the
homework and he's obviously not

4428
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:54,060
homework and he's obviously not
 

4429
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:56,090
homework and he's obviously not
done that before

4430
01:23:56,090 --> 01:23:56,100
done that before
 

4431
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:58,370
done that before
but there's also a logic that you can

4432
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:58,380
but there's also a logic that you can
 

4433
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,470
but there's also a logic that you can
then say right but then you're doing all

4434
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:00,480
then say right but then you're doing all
 

4435
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,030
then say right but then you're doing all
the heavy lifting of parenting and he's

4436
01:24:02,030 --> 01:24:02,040
the heavy lifting of parenting and he's
 

4437
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,890
the heavy lifting of parenting and he's
doing none of that and you were a

4438
01:24:03,890 --> 01:24:03,900
doing none of that and you were a
 

4439
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:05,750
doing none of that and you were a
married couple and living together so he

4440
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:05,760
married couple and living together so he
 

4441
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,189
married couple and living together so he
was trusting you to do that because

4442
01:24:07,189 --> 01:24:07,199
was trusting you to do that because
 

4443
01:24:07,199 --> 01:24:08,810
was trusting you to do that because
you're good at it and you you seem to

4444
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:08,820
you're good at it and you you seem to
 

4445
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:11,870
you're good at it and you you seem to
like it so maybe now we want him to have

4446
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:11,880
like it so maybe now we want him to have
 

4447
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:13,189
like it so maybe now we want him to have
to do some of the heavy lifting of

4448
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199
to do some of the heavy lifting of
 

4449
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:14,810
to do some of the heavy lifting of
parenting because we don't want the

4450
01:24:14,810 --> 01:24:14,820
parenting because we don't want the
 

4451
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:18,229
parenting because we don't want the
child when they're 13 to say I love Dad

4452
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
child when they're 13 to say I love Dad
 

4453
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,030
child when they're 13 to say I love Dad
we have nothing but a good time together

4454
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:20,040
we have nothing but a good time together
 

4455
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,350

want to be with the Wii like well no
it's not that

4802
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:46,500
it's not that
 

4803
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:47,510
it's not that
but

4804
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:47,520
but
 

4805
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:49,669
but
we only exist because there was you and

4806
01:30:49,669 --> 01:30:49,679
we only exist because there was you and
 

4807
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,890
we only exist because there was you and
there was me and I really like you and

4808
01:30:51,890 --> 01:30:51,900
there was me and I really like you and
 

4809
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:54,350
there was me and I really like you and
you really liked me and so we picked

4810
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:54,360
you really liked me and so we picked
 

4811
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:57,110
you really liked me and so we picked
each other out of lots of choices

4812
01:30:57,110 --> 01:30:57,120
each other out of lots of choices
 

4813
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,010
each other out of lots of choices
and now this we is so [\h__\h] big like

4814
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:01,020
and now this we is so [\h__\h] big like
 

4815
01:31:01,020 --> 01:31:03,410
and now this we is so [\h__\h] big like
it threatens to just consume all of it

4816
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:03,420
it threatens to just consume all of it
 

4817
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:08,090
it threatens to just consume all of it
you know and I I really think that

4818
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:08,100

 

4819
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,010

there's something there we have to look

4820
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:10,020
there's something there we have to look
 

4821
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:12,410
there's something there we have to look
at more honestly so we should not

4822
01:31:12,410 --> 01:31:12,420
at more honestly so we should not
 

4823
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,330
at more honestly so we should not
consume everything but it at the same

4824
01:31:14,330 --> 01:31:14,340
consume everything but it at the same
 

4825
01:31:14,340 --> 01:31:15,790
consume everything but it at the same
time

4826
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:15,800
time
 

4827
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:19,850
time
not be small well the we is the you and

4828
01:31:19,850 --> 01:31:19,860
not be small well the we is the you and
 

4829
01:31:19,860 --> 01:31:22,729
not be small well the we is the you and
the me and if you if you mix it

4830
01:31:22,729 --> 01:31:22,739
the me and if you if you mix it
 

4831
01:31:22,739 --> 01:31:25,550
the me and if you if you mix it
so much that you and me loses it's it's

4832
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:25,560

02:18:20,990 --> 02:18:21,000
then you know it really was a function
 

7391
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:23,270
then you know it really was a function
of the of the of the um the fact that

7392
02:18:23,270 --> 02:18:23,280
of the of the of the um the fact that

so how much attention do you spend to

7682
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:44,760
so how much attention do you spend to
 

7683
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:47,150
so how much attention do you spend to
the new novel exciting thing without

7684
02:23:47,150 --> 02:23:47,160
the new novel exciting thing without
 

7685
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,610
the new novel exciting thing without
creating the impression that you don't

7686
02:23:49,610 --> 02:23:49,620
creating the impression that you don't
 

7687
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,290
creating the impression that you don't
you're not interested in this because

7688
02:23:51,290 --> 02:23:51,300
you're not interested in this because
 

7689
02:23:51,300 --> 02:23:53,750
you're not interested in this because
you want you're my favorite person but

7690
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:53,760
you want you're my favorite person but
 

7691
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,309
you want you're my favorite person but
this is fun so I want to just try this

7692
02:23:55,309 --> 02:23:55,319
this is fun so I want to just try this
 

7693
02:23:55,319 --> 02:23:57,170
this is fun so I want to just try this
for a few but then also I don't want to

7694
02:23:57,170 --> 02:23:57,180
for a few but then also I don't want to
 

7695
02:23:57,180 --> 02:23:59,210
for a few but then also I don't want to
forget about that like it it just seems

7696
02:23:59,210 --> 02:23:59,220
forget about that like it it just seems
 

7697
02:23:59,220 --> 02:24:00,830
forget about that like it it just seems
tricky that analogy by the way is

7698
02:24:00,830 --> 02:24:00,840
tricky that analogy by the way is
 

7699
02:24:00,840 --> 02:24:03,050
tricky that analogy by the way is
brilliant and also I guess it's tricky

7700
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:03,060
brilliant and also I guess it's tricky
 

7701
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:05,150
brilliant and also I guess it's tricky
because the consequences of mistakes are

7702
02:24:05,150 --> 02:24:05,160
because the consequences of mistakes are
 

7703
02:24:05,160 --> 02:24:06,889
because the consequences of mistakes are
quite High because you're gonna have to

7704
02:24:06,889 --> 02:24:06,899
quite High because you're gonna have to
 

7705
02:24:06,899 --> 02:24:09,650
quite High because you're gonna have to
talk about it wait and there's a there's

7706
02:24:09,650 --> 02:24:09,660
talk about it wait and there's a there's
 

7707
02:24:09,660 --> 02:24:11,870
talk about it wait and there's a there's
an easy way to misinterpret the data

7708
02:24:11,870 --> 02:24:11,880
an easy way to misinterpret the data
 

7709
02:24:11,880 --> 02:24:13,849
an easy way to misinterpret the data
right like so if I'm

7710
02:24:13,849 --> 02:24:13,859
right like so if I'm
 

7711
02:24:13,859 --> 02:24:16,130
right like so if I'm
if I really like sleeping with my

7712
02:24:16,130 --> 02:24:16,140
if I really like sleeping with my
 

7713
02:24:16,140 --> 02:24:19,130
if I really like sleeping with my
partner but I get one chance to sleep

partner but I get one chance to sleep
with this other person like well of

7716
02:24:21,469 --> 02:24:21,479
with this other person like well of
 

7717
02:24:21,479 --> 02:24:23,090
with this other person like well of
course I should indulge in that because

7718
02:24:23,090 --> 02:24:23,100
course I should indulge in that because
 

7719
02:24:23,100 --> 02:24:25,130
course I should indulge in that because
I can do this anytime like what it you

7720
02:24:25,130 --> 02:24:25,140

who's this guy he didn't have a care in

7872
02:27:24,590 --> 02:27:24,600
who's this guy he didn't have a care in

who's this guy he didn't have a care in
the world just sitting down eating my

7874
02:27:25,969 --> 02:27:25,979
the world just sitting down eating my
 

7875
02:27:25,979 --> 02:27:28,370
the world just sitting down eating my
egg foo young but instead you tried to

7876
02:27:28,370 --> 02:27:28,380
egg foo young but instead you tried to
 

7877
02:27:28,380 --> 02:27:30,590
egg foo young but instead you tried to
be hard and now I know you're full of

[\h__\h] and so I think that scene
 

7881
02:27:33,979 --> 02:27:37,969

that way like it's saying you you just

how some people communicate perhaps I

8286
02:35:22,969 --> 02:35:22,979
how some people communicate perhaps I
 

8287
02:35:22,979 --> 02:35:25,910
how some people communicate perhaps I
guess the the question of how much

8288
02:35:25,910 --> 02:35:25,920
guess the the question of how much
 

8289
02:35:25,920 --> 02:35:27,650
guess the the question of how much
fighting

8290
02:35:27,650 --> 02:35:27,660
fighting
 

8291
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:30,050
fighting
is too much fighting in the relationship

8292
02:35:30,050 --> 02:35:30,060
is too much fighting in the relationship
 

8293
02:35:30,060 --> 02:35:32,870
is too much fighting in the relationship
is for me a bit like the question how

8294
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:32,880
is for me a bit like the question how
 

8295
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:35,330
is for me a bit like the question how
much sex is enough sex in the

8296
02:35:35,330 --> 02:35:35,340
much sex is enough sex in the
 

8297
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:38,570
much sex is enough sex in the
relationship yeah it it depends on the

8298
02:35:38,570 --> 02:35:38,580
relationship yeah it it depends on the
 

8299
02:35:38,580 --> 02:35:41,750
relationship yeah it it depends on the
two people and their individual tastes

8300
02:35:41,750 --> 02:35:41,760
two people and their individual tastes
 

8301
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:44,650
two people and their individual tastes
but what's

8302
02:35:44,650 --> 02:35:44,660
but what's
 

8303
02:35:44,660 --> 02:35:47,510
but what's
problematic is when there is a

8304
02:35:47,510 --> 02:35:47,520
problematic is when there is a
 

8305
02:35:47,520 --> 02:35:50,330
problematic is when there is a
disconnect between the two people

8306
02:35:50,330 --> 02:35:50,340
disconnect between the two people
 

8307
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:53,510
disconnect between the two people
like so if

02:35:53,510 --> 02:35:53,520

02:42:33,660 --> 02:42:35,630
and intelligence and strategy that
sometimes wasn't applicable like I've

8670
02:42:35,630 --> 02:42:35,640
sometimes wasn't applicable like I've
 

8671
02:42:35,640 --> 02:42:37,309
sometimes wasn't applicable like I've
learned like

8672
02:42:37,309 --> 02:42:37,319
learned like
 

8673
02:42:37,319 --> 02:42:39,530
learned like
you know there's like the simplest

8674
02:42:39,530 --> 02:42:39,540
you know there's like the simplest
 

8675
02:42:39,540 --> 02:42:41,809
you know there's like the simplest
explanation is the accurate one you know

8676
02:42:41,809 --> 02:42:41,819
explanation is the accurate one you know
 

8677
02:42:41,819 --> 02:42:43,490
explanation is the accurate one you know
the Occam's razor

8678
02:42:43,490 --> 02:42:43,500
the Occam's razor
 

8679
02:42:43,500 --> 02:42:46,550
the Occam's razor
I think like Sexton's you know would be

8680
02:42:46,550 --> 02:42:46,560
I think like Sexton's you know would be
 

8681
02:42:46,560 --> 02:42:48,590
I think like Sexton's you know would be
never a tribute to strategy that which

8682
02:42:48,590 --> 02:42:48,600
never a tribute to strategy that which
 

8683
02:42:48,600 --> 02:42:50,690
never a tribute to strategy that which
could be attributed to stupidity for

8684
02:42:50,690 --> 02:42:50,700
could be attributed to stupidity for
 

8685
02:42:50,700 --> 02:42:53,090
could be attributed to stupidity for
laziness yeah because I have lots of

8686
02:42:53,090 --> 02:42:53,100
laziness yeah because I have lots of
 

8687
02:42:53,100 --> 02:42:55,370
laziness yeah because I have lots of
adversaries that like they'll not file

8688
02:42:55,370 --> 02:42:55,380
adversaries that like they'll not file
 

8689
02:42:55,380 --> 02:42:56,870
adversaries that like they'll not file
emotion I thought they were going to

8690
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:56,880
emotion I thought they were going to
 

8691
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:58,550
emotion I thought they were going to
file and I'll go wait why didn't they

8692
02:42:58,550 --> 02:42:58,560
file and I'll go wait why didn't they
 

8693
02:42:58,560 --> 02:43:00,469
file and I'll go wait why didn't they
file that like tactically what are they

8694
02:43:00,469 --> 02:43:00,479
file that like tactically what are they
 

8695
02:43:00,479 --> 02:43:02,510
file that like tactically what are they
thinking I'm gonna do and what what is

8696
02:43:02,510 --> 02:43:02,520
thinking I'm gonna do and what what is
 

8697
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:04,130
thinking I'm gonna do and what what is
that about you know and I would go well

8698
02:43:04,130 --> 02:43:04,140
that about you know and I would go well
 

8699
02:43:04,140 --> 02:43:05,990
that about you know and I would go well
if I didn't file it why wouldn't I and

8700
02:43:05,990 --> 02:43:06,000
if I didn't file it why wouldn't I and
 

8701
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:07,190
if I didn't file it why wouldn't I and
the answer is like they just didn't

8703
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:08,870
the answer is like they just didn't
think to file it or like they were too

8704

11711
03:39:07,859 --> 03:39:10,370
know I wouldn't want that for but but
but it's born like all these wonderful

11712
03:39:10,370 --> 03:39:10,380
but it's born like all these wonderful
 

11713
03:39:10,380 --> 03:39:13,250
but it's born like all these wonderful
things were born of this awful situation

11714
03:39:13,250 --> 03:39:13,260
things were born of this awful situation
 

11715
03:39:13,260 --> 03:39:15,950
things were born of this awful situation
so I think divorce the same thing like I

11716
03:39:15,950 --> 03:39:15,960
so I think divorce the same thing like I
 

11717
03:39:15,960 --> 03:39:18,590
so I think divorce the same thing like I
I we make these mistakes right but

11718
03:39:18,590 --> 03:39:18,600
I we make these mistakes right but
 

11719
03:39:18,600 --> 03:39:20,929
I we make these mistakes right but
they're not really you know I often have

11720
03:39:20,929 --> 03:39:20,939
they're not really you know I often have
 

11721
03:39:20,939 --> 03:39:22,429
they're not really you know I often have
to say to my clients when they're like

11722
03:39:22,429 --> 03:39:22,439
to say to my clients when they're like
 

11723
03:39:22,439 --> 03:39:23,750
to say to my clients when they're like
oh I wish I'd never married this person

11724
03:39:23,750 --> 03:39:23,760
oh I wish I'd never married this person
 

11725
03:39:23,760 --> 03:39:26,330
oh I wish I'd never married this person
I'm like you love your kids right

11726
03:39:26,330 --> 03:39:26,340
I'm like you love your kids right
 

11727
03:39:26,340 --> 03:39:29,389
I'm like you love your kids right
like your kids are half that person they

11728
03:39:29,389 --> 03:39:29,399
like your kids are half that person they
 

11729
03:39:29,399 --> 03:39:32,290
like your kids are half that person they
would not be the organism they are

11730
03:39:32,290 --> 03:39:32,300
would not be the organism they are
 

11731
03:39:32,300 --> 03:39:36,830
would not be the organism they are
without that person's DNA so you can't

11732
03:39:36,830 --> 03:39:36,840
without that person's DNA so you can't
 

11733
03:39:36,840 --> 03:39:38,210
without that person's DNA so you can't
regret

11734
03:39:38,210 --> 03:39:38,220
regret
 

11735
03:39:38,220 --> 03:39:40,550
regret
being with that person if you love your

11736
03:39:40,550 --> 03:39:40,560
being with that person if you love your
 

11737
03:39:40,560 --> 03:39:42,950
being with that person if you love your
kids like if you love your kids those

11738
03:39:42,950 --> 03:39:42,960
kids like if you love your kids those
 

11739
03:39:42,960 --> 03:39:45,469
kids like if you love your kids those
kids don't exist without that person and

11740
03:39:45,469 --> 03:39:45,479
kids don't exist without that person and
 

11741
03:39:45,479 --> 03:39:48,830
kids don't exist without that person and
I I don't know how we refocus on that

11742
03:39:48,830 --> 03:39:48,840
I I don't know how we refocus on that
 

11743
03:39:48,840 --> 03:39:50,450
I I don't know how we refocus on that
you know I don't know maybe we give

11744
03:39:50,450 --> 03:39:50,460
you know I don't know maybe we give
 

11745
03:39:50,460 --> 03:39:52,309
you know I don't know maybe we give
anyone going through it I've actually

11746
03:39:52,309 --> 03:39:52,319
anyone going through it I've actually
 

11747
03:39:52,319 --> 03:39:54,110
anyone going through it I've actually
had a theory

11748
03:39:54,110 --> 03:39:54,120
had a theory
 

11749
03:39:54,120 --> 03:39:55,729
had a theory
which I've not said out loud but I'll

11750
03:39:55,729 --> 03:39:55,739
which I've not said out loud but I'll
 

11751
03:39:55,739 --> 03:39:57,590
which I've not said out loud but I'll
say it to you because it's just us

11752
03:39:57,590 --> 03:39:57,600
say it to you because it's just us
 

11753
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:58,550
say it to you because it's just us
talking

11754
03:39:58,550 --> 03:39:58,560
talking
 

11755
03:39:58,560 --> 03:40:00,769
talking
I I think

11756
03:40:00,769 --> 03:40:00,779
I I think
 

11757
03:40:00,779 --> 03:40:03,590
I I think
if we could figure out a way

11758
03:40:03,590 --> 03:40:03,600
if we could figure out a way
 

11759
03:40:03,600 --> 03:40:07,729
if we could figure out a way
to take a divorcing couple

11760
03:40:07,729 --> 03:40:07,739

 

11761
03:40:07,739 --> 03:40:09,830

that is interested in potentially

11762
03:40:09,830 --> 03:40:09,840
that is interested in potentially
 

11763
03:40:09,840 --> 03:40:11,690
that is interested in potentially
mediating

11764
03:40:11,690 --> 03:40:11,700
mediating
 

11765
03:40:11,700 --> 03:40:14,269
mediating
and put them in a setting

11766
03:40:14,269 --> 03:40:14,279
and put them in a setting
 

11767
03:40:14,279 --> 03:40:17,269
and put them in a setting
where we could give them both psilocybin

11768
03:40:17,269 --> 03:40:17,279
where we could give them both psilocybin
 

11769
03:40:17,279 --> 03:40:19,010
where we could give them both psilocybin
like a good dose like two and a half

11770
03:40:19,010 --> 03:40:19,020
like a good dose like two and a half
 

11771
03:40:19,020 --> 03:40:20,809
like a good dose like two and a half
three grams

11772
03:40:20,809 --> 03:40:20,819
three grams
 

11773
03:40:20,819 --> 03:40:23,330
three grams
and have them do individual sessions

11774
03:40:23,330 --> 03:40:23,340
and have them do individual sessions
 

11775
03:40:23,340 --> 03:40:26,030
and have them do individual sessions
with you know controlled setting with a

11776
03:40:26,030 --> 03:40:26,040
with you know controlled setting with a
 

11777
03:40:26,040 --> 03:40:28,849
with you know controlled setting with a
a a guide right

11778
03:40:28,849 --> 03:40:28,859
a a guide right
 

11779
03:40:28,859 --> 03:40:30,889
a a guide right
and and have them start to do that in

11780
03:40:30,889 --> 03:40:30,899
and and have them start to do that in
 

11781
03:40:30,899 --> 03:40:33,229
and and have them start to do that in
her work and then have them do some kind

11782
03:40:33,229 --> 03:40:33,239
her work and then have them do some kind
 

11783
03:40:33,239 --> 03:40:35,870
her work and then have them do some kind
of a of a session together

11784
03:40:35,870 --> 03:40:35,880
of a of a session together
 

11785
03:40:35,880 --> 03:40:37,729
of a of a session together
after they've had that experience that's

11786
03:40:37,729 --> 03:40:37,739
after they've had that experience that's
 

11787
03:40:37,739 --> 03:40:39,950
after they've had that experience that's
psychedelic experience I actually think

11788
03:40:39,950 --> 03:40:39,960
psychedelic experience I actually think
 

11789
03:40:39,960 --> 03:40:42,710
psychedelic experience I actually think
you could do transformative divorce work

11790
03:40:42,710 --> 03:40:42,720
you could do transformative divorce work
 

11791
03:40:42,720 --> 03:40:44,990
you could do transformative divorce work
because I I have found myself and

11792
03:40:44,990 --> 03:40:45,000
because I I have found myself and
 

11793
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:46,610
because I I have found myself and
certainly the many people that I've

11794
03:40:46,610 --> 03:40:46,620
certainly the many people that I've
 

11795
03:40:46,620 --> 03:40:48,410
certainly the many people that I've
talked to who've had

11796
03:40:48,410 --> 03:40:48,420
talked to who've had
 

11797
03:40:48,420 --> 03:40:50,809
talked to who've had
psilocybin experiences and in particular

11798
03:40:50,809 --> 03:40:50,819
psilocybin experiences and in particular
 

11799
03:40:50,819 --> 03:40:52,790
psilocybin experiences and in particular
but any psychedelic experience many of

11800
03:40:52,790 --> 03:40:52,800
but any psychedelic experience many of
 

11801
03:40:52,800 --> 03:40:55,490
but any psychedelic experience many of
the empathogens right

11802
03:40:55,490 --> 03:40:55,500
the empathogens right
 

11803
03:40:55,500 --> 03:40:56,450
the empathogens right
um

11804
03:40:56,450 --> 03:40:56,460
um
 

11805
03:40:56,460 --> 03:40:59,090
um
or even like MDMA you know like MDMA

11806
03:40:59,090 --> 03:40:59,100
or even like MDMA you know like MDMA
 

11807
03:40:59,100 --> 03:41:00,889
or even like MDMA you know like MDMA
which is you know it is an empathogen

11808
03:41:00,889 --> 03:41:00,899
which is you know it is an empathogen
 

11809
03:41:00,899 --> 03:41:05,090
which is you know it is an empathogen
and if if we brought that space and the

11810
03:41:05,090 --> 03:41:05,100
and if if we brought that space and the
 

11811
03:41:05,100 --> 03:41:06,889
and if if we brought that space and the
divorce and conflict resolution space

11812
03:41:06,889 --> 03:41:06,899
divorce and conflict resolution space
 

11813
03:41:06,899 --> 03:41:08,210
divorce and conflict resolution space
together

11814
03:41:08,210 --> 03:41:08,220
together
 

11815
03:41:08,220 --> 03:41:10,269
together
that sort of

11816
03:41:10,269 --> 03:41:10,279
that sort of
 

11817
03:41:10,279 --> 03:41:13,070
that sort of
psychopharmacological intervention on

11818
03:41:13,070 --> 03:41:13,080
psychopharmacological intervention on
 

11819
03:41:13,080 --> 03:41:16,490
psychopharmacological intervention on
empathy one's empathy receptors or one's

11820
03:41:16,490 --> 03:41:16,500
empathy one's empathy receptors or one's
 

11821
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:19,190
empathy one's empathy receptors or one's
connectivity I think that would could be

11822
03:41:19,190 --> 03:41:19,200
connectivity I think that would could be
 

11823
03:41:19,200 --> 03:41:21,650
connectivity I think that would could be
radically transforming it would be

11824
03:41:21,650 --> 03:41:21,660
radically transforming it would be
 

11825
03:41:21,660 --> 03:41:23,389
radically transforming it would be
logistically an absolute nightmare it

11826
03:41:23,389 --> 03:41:23,399
logistically an absolute nightmare it
 

11827
03:41:23,399 --> 03:41:24,950
logistically an absolute nightmare it
would never get done from a legal

11828
03:41:24,950 --> 03:41:24,960
would never get done from a legal
 

11829
03:41:24,960 --> 03:41:28,610
would never get done from a legal
standpoint but man like I I think

11830
03:41:28,610 --> 03:41:28,620
standpoint but man like I I think
 

11831
03:41:28,620 --> 03:41:32,030
standpoint but man like I I think
sometimes like that if because

11832
03:41:32,030 --> 03:41:32,040
sometimes like that if because
 

11833
03:41:32,040 --> 03:41:34,849
sometimes like that if because
I think the more that you can bring

11834
03:41:34,849 --> 03:41:34,859
I think the more that you can bring
 

11835
03:41:34,859 --> 03:41:39,170
I think the more that you can bring
people to the awareness of connection

11836
03:41:39,170 --> 03:41:39,180
people to the awareness of connection
 

11837
03:41:39,180 --> 03:41:41,450
people to the awareness of connection
that comes from

11838
03:41:41,450 --> 03:41:41,460
that comes from
 

11839
03:41:41,460 --> 03:41:44,389
that comes from
many people's psychedelic experiences I

11840
03:41:44,389 --> 03:41:44,399
many people's psychedelic experiences I
 

11841
03:41:44,399 --> 03:41:46,190
many people's psychedelic experiences I
think they could then extrapolate that

11842
03:41:46,190 --> 03:41:46,200
think they could then extrapolate that
 

11843
03:41:46,200 --> 03:41:47,450
think they could then extrapolate that
into

11844
03:41:47,450 --> 03:41:47,460
into
 

11845
03:41:47,460 --> 03:41:49,969
into
their understanding of the conflict and

11846
03:41:49,969 --> 03:41:49,979
their understanding of the conflict and
 

11847
03:41:49,979 --> 03:41:51,590
their understanding of the conflict and
disconnect they're having with their

11848
03:41:51,590 --> 03:41:51,600
disconnect they're having with their
 

11849
03:41:51,600 --> 03:41:55,309
disconnect they're having with their
partner so really lean into the like use

11850
03:41:55,309 --> 03:41:55,319
partner so really lean into the like use
 

11851
03:41:55,319 --> 03:41:59,030
partner so really lean into the like use
this brink of divorce as a kind of

11852
03:41:59,030 --> 03:41:59,040
this brink of divorce as a kind of
 

11853
03:41:59,040 --> 03:42:01,070
this brink of divorce as a kind of
catalyst for doing a lot of

11854
03:42:01,070 --> 03:42:01,080
catalyst for doing a lot of
 

11855
03:42:01,080 --> 03:42:02,990
catalyst for doing a lot of
soul-searching a lot of growth together

11856
03:42:02,990 --> 03:42:03,000
soul-searching a lot of growth together
 

11857
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:05,330
soul-searching a lot of growth together
that was what appealed to me about it I

11858
03:42:05,330 --> 03:42:05,340
that was what appealed to me about it I
 

11859
03:42:05,340 --> 03:42:07,610
that was what appealed to me about it I
mean before I started doing it is it was

11860
03:42:07,610 --> 03:42:07,620
mean before I started doing it is it was
 

11861
03:42:07,620 --> 03:42:11,229
mean before I started doing it is it was
this idea that this is a opportunity

11862
03:42:11,229 --> 03:42:11,239
this idea that this is a opportunity
 

11863
03:42:11,239 --> 03:42:15,290
this idea that this is a opportunity
to for radical reinvention yeah like it

11864
03:42:15,290 --> 03:42:15,300
to for radical reinvention yeah like it
 

11865
03:42:15,300 --> 03:42:17,530
to for radical reinvention yeah like it
was an opportunity for people to say
