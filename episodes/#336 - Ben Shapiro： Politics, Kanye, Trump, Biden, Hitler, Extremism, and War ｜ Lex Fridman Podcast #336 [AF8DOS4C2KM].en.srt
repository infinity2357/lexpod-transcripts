the kind of stuff that he's saying
 

261
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:44,150
the kind of stuff that he's saying
obviously debunking it

262
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,160
obviously debunking it
 

263
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,189
obviously debunking it
you know making clear that what he's

264
00:04:46,189 --> 00:04:46,199
you know making clear that what he's
 

265
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,469
you know making clear that what he's
saying is is garbage

266
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
saying is is garbage
 

267
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,270
saying is is garbage
but the reality is that I think that

268
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:50,280
but the reality is that I think that
 

269
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,770
but the reality is that I think that
that for

270
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:51,780
that for
 

271
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,950
that for
most people who are in any way engaged

272
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:54,960
most people who are in any way engaged
 

273
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,749
most people who are in any way engaged
with these issues

274
00:04:56,749 --> 00:04:56,759
with these issues
 

275
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,129
with these issues
I don't think they're being convinced to

276
00:04:58,129 --> 00:04:58,139
I don't think they're being convinced to
 

277
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,530
I don't think they're being convinced to
be anti-semitic by yay I mean I think

278
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:00,540
be anti-semitic by yay I mean I think
 

279
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,790
be anti-semitic by yay I mean I think
there's a group of people who may be

280
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
there's a group of people who may be
 

281
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,070
there's a group of people who may be
swayed that anti-Semitism is acceptable

282
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
swayed that anti-Semitism is acceptable
 

283
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,170
swayed that anti-Semitism is acceptable
because yay is saying what he's saying

284
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:06,180
because yay is saying what he's saying
 

285
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,170
because yay is saying what he's saying
and he's saying so very loudly and he's

286
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:09,180
and he's saying so very loudly and he's
 

287
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,430
and he's saying so very loudly and he's
saying it over and over

288
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:10,440
saying it over and over
 

289
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,189
saying it over and over
but yeah I think that for example there

290
00:05:13,189 --> 00:05:13,199
but yeah I think that for example there
 

291
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,930
but yeah I think that for example there
were these signs that were popping up in

sort of stuff it's just like latest
 

309
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,029
sort of stuff it's just like latest
opportunity to kind of jump on on that

310
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:29,039
opportunity to kind of jump on on that
 

311
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,129
opportunity to kind of jump on on that
particular bandwagon but

312
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:31,139
particular bandwagon but
 

313

moral duty to call that stuff out so
 

317
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,670
moral duty to call that stuff out so
there is a degree to which it normalizes

when you are attributing a bad

when you are attributing a bad

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,870
based on
the notion that that some members of

00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
the notion that that some members of

that population are doing bad things
 

391
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,770
that population are doing bad things
yeah there's a jump between it's also

392
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:00,780
yeah there's a jump between it's also
 

393
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,249
yeah there's a jump between it's also
possible to uh record label owners as a

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,450
possible to uh record label owners as a

397
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,510

have a kind of culture that F's over

artists sure doesn't treat artists

400
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,440
artists sure doesn't treat artists
 

401
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,710
artists sure doesn't treat artists
fairly and it's also possible that

402
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:12,720
fairly and it's also possible that
 

403
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,050
fairly and it's also possible that
there's a high representation of Jews

404
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:15,060
there's a high representation of Jews
 

405
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,689
there's a high representation of Jews
uh in in the group of people that own

406
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:17,699
uh in in the group of people that own
 

407
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,230
uh in in the group of people that own
record labels but it's that small but a

408
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:21,240
record labels but it's that small but a
 

409
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,990
record labels but it's that small but a
very big leap that people take from the

410
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:24,000
very big leap that people take from the
 

411
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,589
very big leap that people take from the
group that own record labels to all Jews

412
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
group that own record labels to all Jews
 

413
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,110
group that own record labels to all Jews
for sure and I think that one of the

414
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
for sure and I think that one of the
 

415
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,170
for sure and I think that one of the
other issues also is that

416
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,180
other issues also is that
 

417
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,029
other issues also is that
anti-Semitism is is fascinating because

418
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:35,039
anti-Semitism is is fascinating because
 

419
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,290
anti-Semitism is is fascinating because
it breaks down into so many different

420
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:36,300
it breaks down into so many different
 

421
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,330
it breaks down into so many different
parts meaning that if you look at sort

422
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:38,340
parts meaning that if you look at sort
 

423
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,430
parts meaning that if you look at sort
of different types of anti-Semitism if

424
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:40,440
of different types of anti-Semitism if
 

425
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,570
of different types of anti-Semitism if
you're a racist against black people

426
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:41,580
you're a racist against black people
 

427
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,830
you're a racist against black people
it's typically because you're racist

428
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:42,840
it's typically because you're racist
 

429
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,510
it's typically because you're racist
based on the color of their skin if

430
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,520
based on the color of their skin if
 

431
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,830
based on the color of their skin if
you're racist if you're racist against

432
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:45,840
you're racist if you're racist against
 

433
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,629
you're racist if you're racist against
the Jews you're anti-semitic then

434
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:47,639
the Jews you're anti-semitic then
 

435
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,770
the Jews you're anti-semitic then
they're actually a few different ways

436
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:48,780
they're actually a few different ways
 

437
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,969
they're actually a few different ways
that breaks down right you have

438
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:49,979
that breaks down right you have
 

439
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,710
that breaks down right you have
anti-Semitism in terms of ethnicity

440
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:51,720
anti-Semitism in terms of ethnicity
 

441
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,749
anti-Semitism in terms of ethnicity
which is like nazi-esque anti-Semitism

442
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:53,759
which is like nazi-esque anti-Semitism
 

443
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,089
which is like nazi-esque anti-Semitism
you have Jewish parentage you have a

444
00:07:56,089 --> 00:07:56,099
you have Jewish parentage you have a
 

445
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,309
you have Jewish parentage you have a
Jewish grandparent therefore you are

446
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:58,319
Jewish grandparent therefore you are
 

447
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,930
Jewish grandparent therefore you are
your blood is corrupt and you are

448
00:07:59,930 --> 00:07:59,940
your blood is corrupt and you are
 

449
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,249
your blood is corrupt and you are
inherently going to have bad properties

450
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:01,259
inherently going to have bad properties
 

451
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:02,809
inherently going to have bad properties
then there's sort of old school

452
00:08:02,809 --> 00:08:02,819
then there's sort of old school
 

453
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,089
then there's sort of old school
religious anti-Semitism which is that

00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:05,099
religious anti-Semitism which is that
 

455
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,490

00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:08,759
the Jews are the sons of pigs and
 

459
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:11,510
the Jews are the sons of pigs and
monkeys and therefore Judaism is bad and

the way that you get out of that

464
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:14,280
the way that you get out of that
 

465
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,070
the way that you get out of that
anti-Semitism historically speaking is

466
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
anti-Semitism historically speaking is
 

467
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,409
anti-Semitism historically speaking is
mass conversion which most anti-Semitism

468
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:18,419
mass conversion which most anti-Semitism
 

469
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,089
mass conversion which most anti-Semitism
for a couple thousand years actually was

470
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:20,099
for a couple thousand years actually was
 

471
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:21,890
for a couple thousand years actually was
not ethnic it was it was much more

472
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:21,900
not ethnic it was it was much more
 

473
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,570
not ethnic it was it was much more
rooted in in this sort of stuff right if

474
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:23,580
rooted in in this sort of stuff right if
 

475
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,510
rooted in in this sort of stuff right if
you convert it out of the faith then the

476
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,520
you convert it out of the faith then the
 

477
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,770
you convert it out of the faith then the
anti-Semitism was quote unquote

478
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,780
anti-Semitism was quote unquote
 

479
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,369
anti-Semitism was quote unquote
alleviated and then there's a sort of

00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:30,379
alleviated and then there's a sort of
 

481
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:32,930

behind every corner it's basically a big
 

511
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,009
behind every corner it's basically a big
conspiracy theory unlike a lot of other

512
00:09:01,009 --> 00:09:01,019
conspiracy theory unlike a lot of other
 

513
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:02,329
conspiracy theory unlike a lot of other
forms of racism which are not really

514
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:02,339

behind closed doors to control things
 

525
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,690
behind closed doors to control things

00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,430
yeah the most absurd illustration of
anti-Semitism and just like you said is

548
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:45,839
what is the fact that Hitler took power
 

549
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,410
what is the fact that Hitler took power
teach you about human nature when you

550
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:48,420
teach you about human nature when you
 

551
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,790
teach you about human nature when you
look back at the history of the 20th

552
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,800
look back at the history of the 20th
 

553
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,889
look back at the history of the 20th
century what what do you learn from that

554
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:51,899
century what what do you learn from that
 

555
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:52,730
century what what do you learn from that
time

556
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:52,740
time
 

557
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,290
time
I mean there are a bunch of lessons to

558
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:54,300
I mean there are a bunch of lessons to
 

559
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,329
I mean there are a bunch of lessons to
Hitler taking power the the first thing

560
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:56,339
Hitler taking power the the first thing
 

561
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,769
Hitler taking power the the first thing
I think people

562
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:57,779
I think people
 

563
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,329
I think people
ought to recognize about Hitler taking

564
00:09:59,329 --> 00:09:59,339
ought to recognize about Hitler taking
 

565
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,070
ought to recognize about Hitler taking
power is that the power had been

566
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,080
power is that the power had been
 

567
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,150
power is that the power had been
centralized in the government before

568
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,160
centralized in the government before
 

569
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,530
centralized in the government before
Hitler took it

570
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:03,540
Hitler took it
 

571
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,670
Hitler took it
so if you actually look at the history

572
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:04,680
so if you actually look at the history
 

573
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,769
so if you actually look at the history
of Nazi Germany the Weimar Republican

574
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:06,779
of Nazi Germany the Weimar Republican
 

575
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,290
of Nazi Germany the Weimar Republican
effectively collapsed the power had been

576
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,300
effectively collapsed the power had been
 

577
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,110
effectively collapsed the power had been
centralized in the chancellory uh and

578
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,120
centralized in the chancellory uh and
 

579
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,290
centralized in the chancellory uh and
and really under Hindenburg for a couple

580
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:15,300
and really under Hindenburg for a couple
 

581
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,630
and really under Hindenburg for a couple
of years before that and so it was only

582
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:17,640
of years before that and so it was only
 

583
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,970
of years before that and so it was only
a matter of time until someone who was

584
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:19,980
a matter of time until someone who was
 

585
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,009
a matter of time until someone who was
bad grabbed the power and so the

586
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:22,019
bad grabbed the power and so the
 

587
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:23,389
bad grabbed the power and so the
struggle between the Reds and the Browns

588
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:23,399
struggle between the Reds and the Browns
 

589
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:28,070
struggle between the Reds and the Browns
in Nazism in in pre-nazi Germany led to

590
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,080
in Nazism in in pre-nazi Germany led to
 

591
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,290
in Nazism in in pre-nazi Germany led to
this kind of up spiraling of radical

592
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:30,300
this kind of up spiraling of radical
 

593
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,990
this kind of up spiraling of radical
sentiment that allowed Hitler in through

594
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:33,000
sentiment that allowed Hitler in through
 

595
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,190
sentiment that allowed Hitler in through
the front door not through the back door

596
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,200
the front door not through the back door
 

597
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,050
the front door not through the back door
right he was elected so you think

598
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,060
right he was elected so you think
 

599
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,850
right he was elected so you think
Communists could have also taken power I

600
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:37,860
Communists could have also taken power I
 

601
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,870
Communists could have also taken power I
mean there's no question coming it's

602
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:38,880
mean there's no question coming it's
 

603
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,650
mean there's no question coming it's
going to take him power there were

604
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:39,660
going to take him power there were
 

605
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,110
going to take him power there were
serious force in pronouncing Germany do

606
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
serious force in pronouncing Germany do
 

607
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,190
serious force in pronouncing Germany do
you think there was an underlying

608
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:43,200
you think there was an underlying
 

609
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,329
you think there was an underlying
current that would have led to an

610
00:10:44,329 --> 00:10:44,339
current that would have led to an
 

611
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,730
current that would have led to an
atrocity if the Communists have taken

612
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:46,740
atrocity if the Communists have taken
 

613
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,569
atrocity if the Communists have taken
power wouldn't have been quite the same

614
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:47,579
power wouldn't have been quite the same
 

615
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,250
power wouldn't have been quite the same
atrocity but obviously the Communists in

616
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:49,260
atrocity but obviously the Communists in
 

617
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,710
atrocity but obviously the Communists in
Soviet Russia at exactly this time were

from the outside perspective I get why
 

977

offended by yay's comments in that way
though because if you're if you're a

the individual to the group I'd like to
 

1033
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,710
the individual to the group I'd like to
ask you you're one of the most effective

1034
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
ask you you're one of the most effective
 

1035
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,330
ask you you're one of the most effective
people in the world that attacking the

people in the world that attacking the

left
 

1039
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,750
left
and sometimes they can slip into attack

1040
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
and sometimes they can slip into attack
 

1041
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,390
and sometimes they can slip into attack
in the group

1042
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:55,400
in the group
 

1043
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,370
in the group
do you worry that there that's the same

1044
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,380
do you worry that there that's the same
 

1045
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,350
do you worry that there that's the same
kind of oversimplification that yay is

1046
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:00,360
kind of oversimplification that yay is
 

1047
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,909
kind of oversimplification that yay is
doing about Jewish people that you can

1048
00:18:01,909 --> 00:18:01,919
doing about Jewish people that you can
 

1049
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,690
doing about Jewish people that you can
sometimes do with the left as a group so

1050
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:05,700
sometimes do with the left as a group so
 

1051
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,310
sometimes do with the left as a group so
when I speak about the left I'm speaking

1052
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,320
when I speak about the left I'm speaking
 

1053
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,870
when I speak about the left I'm speaking
about a philosophy

1054
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:08,880
about a philosophy
 

1055
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,789
about a philosophy
I'm not really speaking about individual

1056
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:10,799
I'm not really speaking about individual
 

1057
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,470
I'm not really speaking about individual
human beings as

1058
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
human beings as
 

1059
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,110
human beings as
the leftists like group and then try to

1060
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,120
the leftists like group and then try to
 

1061
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,549
the leftists like group and then try to
name who the members of this individual

1062
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:16,559
name who the members of this individual
 

1063
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:17,750
name who the members of this individual
group are I also make a distinction

1064
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:17,760
group are I also make a distinction
 

1065
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,150
group are I also make a distinction
between the left and liberals there are

1066
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,160
between the left and liberals there are
 

1067
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,529
between the left and liberals there are
a lot of people who are liberal who

1068
00:18:21,529 --> 00:18:21,539
a lot of people who are liberal who
 

1069
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,510
a lot of people who are liberal who
disagree with me on taxes disagree on

1070
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:23,520
disagree with me on taxes disagree on
 

1071
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,950
disagree with me on taxes disagree on
foreign policy disagree with me on a lot

1072
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
foreign policy disagree with me on a lot
 

1073
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,570
foreign policy disagree with me on a lot
of things the people who I'm talking

1074
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:26,580
of things the people who I'm talking
 

1075
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,010
of things the people who I'm talking
about generally and I talk about the

1076
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:28,020
about generally and I talk about the
 

1077
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,169
about generally and I talk about the
left in the United States are people who

1078
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:30,179
left in the United States are people who
 

1079
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,970
left in the United States are people who
believe that alternative points of view

1080
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:31,980
believe that alternative points of view
 

1081
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,890
believe that alternative points of view
ought to be silenced because they are

1082
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:33,900
ought to be silenced because they are
 

1083
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,110
ought to be silenced because they are
damaging and harmful simply based on the

1084
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
damaging and harmful simply based on the
 

1085
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,330
damaging and harmful simply based on the
disagreement so that's one distinction

1086
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:38,340
disagreement so that's one distinction
 

1087
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,950
disagreement so that's one distinction
the second distinction again is when I

1088
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:39,960
the second distinction again is when I
 

1089
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,909
the second distinction again is when I
talk about the right versus the left

1090
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:40,919
talk about the right versus the left
 

1091
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,650
talk about the right versus the left
typically I'm talking about a battle of

1092
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:42,660
typically I'm talking about a battle of
 

1093
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,110
typically I'm talking about a battle of
competing philosophies and so I'm not

1094
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:45,120
competing philosophies and so I'm not
 

1095
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,029
competing philosophies and so I'm not
speaking about typically

1096
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
speaking about typically
 

1097
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,830
speaking about typically
it would be hard to if you put a person

1098
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:48,840
it would be hard to if you put a person
 

1099
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,029
it would be hard to if you put a person
in front of me and said is this person

1100
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:50,039
in front of me and said is this person
 

1101
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,830
in front of me and said is this person
of the left or of the right having just

1102
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
of the left or of the right having just
 

1103
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,810
of the left or of the right having just
met them I wouldn't be able to label

1104
00:18:53,810 --> 00:18:53,820
met them I wouldn't be able to label
 

1105
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,250
met them I wouldn't be able to label
them in the same way that if you met

1106
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:55,260
them in the same way that if you met
 

1107
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,810
them in the same way that if you met
somebody in the name of Greenstein you'd

1108
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:56,820
somebody in the name of Greenstein you'd
 

1109
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,610
somebody in the name of Greenstein you'd
immediately got you or you made a black

immediately got you or you made a black

immediately got you or you made a black
person's black person and the the

00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:00,720
person's black person and the the
 

1113
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,690
person's black person and the the
adherence to a philosophy makes you a

1114
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:02,700
adherence to a philosophy makes you a
 

1115
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,250
adherence to a philosophy makes you a
member of

1116
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
member of
 

1117
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:06,650
member of
a group if I think the philosophy is bad

1118
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,660
a group if I think the philosophy is bad
 

1119
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,150
a group if I think the philosophy is bad
that doesn't necessarily mean that you

1120
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:08,160
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
 

1121
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,010
that doesn't necessarily mean that you
as a person are bad but it does mean

1122
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:10,020
as a person are bad but it does mean
 

1123
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,630
as a person are bad but it does mean
that I think your philosophy is bad yeah

1124
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:11,640
that I think your philosophy is bad yeah
 

1125
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,070
that I think your philosophy is bad yeah
so the grouping is based on the

1126
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,080
so the grouping is based on the
 

1127
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,010
so the grouping is based on the
philosophy versus something

1128
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,020
philosophy versus something
 

1129
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,990
philosophy versus something
like a race like this the the color of

1130
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,000
like a race like this the the color of
 

1131
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,330
like a race like this the the color of
your skin or race is in the case of the

1132
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:20,340
your skin or race is in the case of the
 

1133
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,330
your skin or race is in the case of the
Jewish people so it's a different thing

1134
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:22,340
Jewish people so it's a different thing
 

1135
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,850
Jewish people so it's a different thing
you can be a little bit more nonchalant

1136
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:25,860
you can be a little bit more nonchalant
 

1137
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,409
you can be a little bit more nonchalant
and careless and attacking a group

1138
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:27,419
and careless and attacking a group
 

1139
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,090
and careless and attacking a group
because it's ultimately attacking a set

1140
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,100
because it's ultimately attacking a set
 

1141
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,590
because it's ultimately attacking a set
of ideas well I mean it's really

1142
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:30,600
of ideas well I mean it's really
 

1143
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,510
of ideas well I mean it's really
nonchalant in attacking the set of ideas

1144
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:32,520
nonchalant in attacking the set of ideas
 

1145
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,010
nonchalant in attacking the set of ideas
and I don't know that nonchalant would

1146
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,020
and I don't know that nonchalant would
 

1147
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,510
and I don't know that nonchalant would
be the way I'd put it I tried I tried to

1148
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
be the way I'd put it I tried I tried to
 

1149
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,190
be the way I'd put it I tried I tried to
be exact when you're you know you don't

1150
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
be exact when you're you know you don't
 

1151
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,289
be exact when you're you know you don't
you don't always hit but you know the if

1152
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:39,299
you don't always hit but you know the if
 

1153
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:41,930
you don't always hit but you know the if
I say that I oppose the Communists right

1154
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:41,940
I say that I oppose the Communists right
 

1155
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,750
I say that I oppose the Communists right
and and then presumably I'm speaking of

1156
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:44,760
and and then presumably I'm speaking of
 

1157
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,010
and and then presumably I'm speaking of
people who believe in the Communist

1158
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:46,020
people who believe in the Communist
 

1159
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,289
people who believe in the Communist
philosophy now the question is whether

1160
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:48,299
philosophy now the question is whether
 

1161
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:49,669
philosophy now the question is whether
I'm mislabeling right whether I'm taking

1162
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
I'm mislabeling right whether I'm taking
 

1163
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,990
I'm mislabeling right whether I'm taking
someone who's not actually a communist

1164
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,000
someone who's not actually a communist
 

1165
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,130
someone who's not actually a communist
and then shoving them in that group of

1166
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,140
and then shoving them in that group of
 

1167
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,970
and then shoving them in that group of
Communists right that would be

1168
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:52,980
Communists right that would be
 

1169
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,669
Communists right that would be

2269
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,109
and the most obvious example was
obviously leading up to 2020 the

freaking out is because one he's putting
his thumb on the scale by saying he is

2364
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:47,700
his thumb on the scale by saying he is
 

2365
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,089
his thumb on the scale by saying he is
more likely to vote Republican he's

2366
00:38:50,089 --> 00:38:50,099
more likely to vote Republican he's
 

2367
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,010
more likely to vote Republican he's
showing himself to be center right and

2368
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:52,020
showing himself to be center right and
 

2369
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,630
showing himself to be center right and
sort of just having a political opinion

2370
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
sort of just having a political opinion
 

2371
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,510
sort of just having a political opinion
versus being this amorphous thing that

2372
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:56,520
versus being this amorphous thing that
 

2373
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,670
versus being this amorphous thing that
doesn't have a political opinion

2374
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:58,680
doesn't have a political opinion
 

2375
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,290
doesn't have a political opinion
um I think if if I were to guess I

2376
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:00,300
um I think if if I were to guess I
 

2377
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,609
um I think if if I were to guess I
haven't talked to him about it but if I

2378
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:01,619
haven't talked to him about it but if I
 

2379
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:02,930
haven't talked to him about it but if I
were to guess he's sending a kind of

2380
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:02,940
were to guess he's sending a kind of
 

2381
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,150
were to guess he's sending a kind of
signal that's important for the Twitter

2382
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:05,160
signal that's important for the Twitter
 

2383
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,190
signal that's important for the Twitter
the company itself because if we're

2384
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
the company itself because if we're
 

2385
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,690
the company itself because if we're
being honest most of the employees are

2386
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:08,700
being honest most of the employees are
 

2387
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,550
being honest most of the employees are
left-leaning so you have to kind of send

2388
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:10,560
left-leaning so you have to kind of send
 

2389
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,310
left-leaning so you have to kind of send
a signal that like a resisting mechanism

2390
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:13,320
a signal that like a resisting mechanism
 

2391
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,370
a signal that like a resisting mechanism
to say like uh since most of the

2392
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:16,380
to say like uh since most of the
 

2393
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,089
to say like uh since most of the
employees are left is is good for uh for

2394
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:20,099
employees are left is is good for uh for
 

2395
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,790
employees are left is is good for uh for
Elon to be more right to balance out the

way the actual engineering is done to

2398
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:24,420
way the actual engineering is done to
 

2399
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,089
way the actual engineering is done to
say we're not going to do any kind of

2400
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:26,099
say we're not going to do any kind of
 

2401
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,130
say we're not going to do any kind of
activism activism inside the engineering

2402
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,140
activism activism inside the engineering
 

2403
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,870
activism activism inside the engineering
if if I were to guess that's kind of the

2404
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:29,880
if if I were to guess that's kind of the
 

2405
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,250
if if I were to guess that's kind of the

00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,260
um aspect of that of that mechanism and
 

2409
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,230
um aspect of that of that mechanism and
the other one by posting the Pelosi

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:36,240
the other one by posting the Pelosi
 

2411

00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:39,480
thing is probably to expand the Overton
 

2413
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,370

again like I say I mean I think that the

2422
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:50,220
again like I say I mean I think that the
 

2423
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,370
again like I say I mean I think that the
that is a better mechanism in action

2424
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:52,380
that is a better mechanism in action
 

2425
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,710
that is a better mechanism in action
than what it was before I just think it

2426
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
than what it was before I just think it
 

2427
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,450
than what it was before I just think it
gave people who hate his guts the

2428
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:56,460
gave people who hate his guts the
 

2429
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,550
gave people who hate his guts the
opening to to kind of slap him for for

2430
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
opening to to kind of slap him for for
 

2431
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,710
opening to to kind of slap him for for
no reason but I can see the strategy of

2432
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:00,720
no reason but I can see the strategy of
 

2433
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,349
no reason but I can see the strategy of
it for sure and I think that the you

2434
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:03,359
it for sure and I think that the you
 

2435
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,150
it for sure and I think that the you
know the the general idea that that he's

2436
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:05,160
know the the general idea that that he's
 

2437
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,550
know the the general idea that that he's
you know kind of pushing right where the

2438
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:07,560
you know kind of pushing right where the
 

2439
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,690
you know kind of pushing right where the
company had pushed left before I think

2440
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:08,700
company had pushed left before I think
 

2441
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,790
company had pushed left before I think
that there there is actually uh

2442
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:10,800
that there there is actually uh
 

2443
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,650
that there there is actually uh
unilateral polarization right now in

2444
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:12,660
unilateral polarization right now in
 

2445
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,910
unilateral polarization right now in

00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:13,920
politics at least with regard to social
 

2447
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,250
politics at least with regard to social

the solution to disinformation is to
 

2451
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,250
the solution to disinformation is to
shut down free speech from the other

shut down free speech from the other
 

2453

shut down free speech from the other

00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,240
side and the other side is basically
 

2455
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,849

like people like me are saying the
 

2457

stuff that I just agree with than for
 

2465
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,370

there to be anybody who's sort of in

2466
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:34,380
there to be anybody who's sort of in

and that's
um so if Alex Jones and Trump was

2638
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:25,920
um so if Alex Jones and Trump was
 

2639
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,950

00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:38,270
world in the long term I think that on
the principle that people should be

2650
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:38,280
the principle that people should be
 

2651

the principle that people should be
allowed to do this and the alternative

2652
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:39,540
allowed to do this and the alternative
 

2653
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,230
allowed to do this and the alternative
being a group of thought bosses telling

00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
being a group of thought bosses telling
 

2655
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,089
being a group of thought bosses telling
us what we can and cannot see yes so I

us what we can and cannot see yes so I
 

2657
00:43:44,099 --> 00:43:45,109
us what we can and cannot see yes so I
think in the short term it's going to

2658
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
think in the short term it's going to
 

2659
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,490
think in the short term it's going to
mean a lot of things that I I don't like

2663
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,230
very much sure I mean that's that's the
cost of doing business you know like I

of freedom is people doing things that I

really not genuine I think that that
sometimes

2980
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:09,480
sometimes
 

2981
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:10,790
sometimes
um you know I think that's his personal

2982
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:10,800
um you know I think that's his personal
 

2983
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,130
um you know I think that's his personal
tendency but I think sometimes he allows

2984
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:13,140
tendency but I think sometimes he allows
 

2985
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,530
tendency but I think sometimes he allows
the the prevailing winds of his party to

2986
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:15,540
the the prevailing winds of his party to
 

2987
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,970
the the prevailing winds of his party to
carry him to incredibly radical places

2988
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:16,980
carry him to incredibly radical places
 

2989
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:20,150
carry him to incredibly radical places
and then he just doubles down on the

2990
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,160
and then he just doubles down on the
 

2991
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,849
and then he just doubles down on the
radicalism in some pretty disingenuous

2992
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:22,859
radicalism in some pretty disingenuous
 

2993
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,190
radicalism in some pretty disingenuous
ways and and there I would cite the the

2994
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
ways and and there I would cite the the
 

2995
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,630
ways and and there I would cite the the
Independence Day speech with or the

2996
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:26,640
Independence Day speech with or the
 

2997
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,829
Independence Day speech with or the
Independence Hall speech which I thought

2998
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:27,839
Independence Hall speech which I thought
 

2999
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,270
Independence Hall speech which I thought
was truly one of the worst species I've

3000
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:29,280
was truly one of the worst species I've
 

3001
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,829
was truly one of the worst species I've
seen a president give so you don't think

3002
00:49:30,829 --> 00:49:30,839
seen a president give so you don't think
 

3003
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,329
seen a president give so you don't think
he's trying to be a unifier in general

guy right all these open questions that
 

3143
00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:43,010
guy right all these open questions that
obviously implicates you know the

3144
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:43,020
obviously implicates you know the
 

3145
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,410
obviously implicates you know the
questions to be asked and then the

3146
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:45,420
questions to be asked and then the
 

3147
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,609
questions to be asked and then the
secondary reason that the story is big

3148
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:46,619
secondary reason that the story is big
 

3149
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:47,750
secondary reason that the story is big
is actually because the reaction of the

3150
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:47,760
is actually because the reaction of the
 

3151
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,030
is actually because the reaction of the
story The Banning of the story is in and

story The Banning of the story is in and
 

3153
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,650
story The Banning of the story is in and
of itself a major story if there's if

3154
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:51,660
of itself a major story if there's if
 

3155
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,329
of itself a major story if there's if
there's any story that implicates a

3156
00:51:53,329 --> 00:51:53,339
there's any story that implicates a
 

3157
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,250
there's any story that implicates a
presidential candidate in the last month

3158
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:55,260
presidential candidate in the last month
 

3159
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,510
presidential candidate in the last month
of an election and there is a media

3160
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:56,520
of an election and there is a media
 

3161
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,589
of an election and there is a media
blackout

3162
00:51:57,589 --> 00:51:57,599
blackout
 

3163
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,510
blackout
including a social media blackout that

3164
00:51:59,510 --> 00:51:59,520
including a social media blackout that
 

3165
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:00,890
including a social media blackout that
obviously raises some very serious

3166
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:00,900
obviously raises some very serious
 

3167
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,390
obviously raises some very serious
questions about informational flow and

3168
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
questions about informational flow and
 

3169
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,190
questions about informational flow and
dissemination in the United States so no

3170
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:04,200
dissemination in the United States so no
 

3171
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,950
dissemination in the United States so no
matter how big of a deal the story is it

3172
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
matter how big of a deal the story is it
 

3173
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,390
matter how big of a deal the story is it
is a big deal that there's a censorship

3174
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:08,400
is a big deal that there's a censorship
 

3175
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,670
is a big deal that there's a censorship
of any relevance when there's a

3176
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:10,680
of any relevance when there's a
 

3177
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,109
of any relevance when there's a
coordinated collusive blackout yeah

3178
00:52:12,109 --> 00:52:12,119
coordinated collusive blackout yeah
 

3179
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,670
coordinated collusive blackout yeah
that's that's a serious and major

3180
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
that's that's a serious and major
 

3181
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,650
that's that's a serious and major
problem uh so those are the two reasons

3182
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:15,660
problem uh so those are the two reasons
 

3183
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,329
problem uh so those are the two reasons
why it would be a big story the two

3184
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:17,339
why it would be a big story the two
 

3185
00:52:17,339 --> 00:52:19,490
why it would be a big story the two
reasons a reason why it would not be a

3186
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:19,500
reasons a reason why it would not be a
 

3187
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,970
reasons a reason why it would not be a
big story perhaps uh is if it turns out

3188
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:22,980
big story perhaps uh is if it turns out
 

3189
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,770
big story perhaps uh is if it turns out
and we don't really know this yet but

3190
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:24,780
and we don't really know this yet but
 

3191
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,329
and we don't really know this yet but
let's say that Hunter Biden was

3192
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:26,339
let's say that Hunter Biden was
 

3193
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,730
let's say that Hunter Biden was
basically off on his own doing what he

3194
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:28,740
basically off on his own doing what he
 

3195
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,069
basically off on his own doing what he
was doing you know being a derelict or a

3196
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:31,079
was doing you know being a derelict or a
 

3197
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:33,890
was doing you know being a derelict or a
drug addict or acting badly uh and his

3198
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:33,900
drug addict or acting badly uh and his
 

3199
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,030
drug addict or acting badly uh and his
dad had nothing to do with it and Joe

3200
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,040
dad had nothing to do with it and Joe
 

3201
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,530
dad had nothing to do with it and Joe
was telling the truth and he really but

3202
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:36,540
was telling the truth and he really but
 

3203
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:37,670
was telling the truth and he really but
the problem is we never actually got

3204
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:37,680
the problem is we never actually got
 

3205
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,650
the problem is we never actually got
those questions answered so if it turned

thing about stories that turn out to be

3210
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:42,119
thing about stories that turn out to be
 

3211
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,790

3267
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,309
cycle of the story and then you know at
some point I would assume that there

3268
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:31,319
some point I would assume that there
 

3269
00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:32,569
some point I would assume that there
will be some follow-on questions that

3270
00:53:32,569 --> 00:53:32,579
will be some follow-on questions that
 

3271
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,829
will be some follow-on questions that
are actually answered I mean the house

00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,730
this is always the story with half the
scandals that you you see is that

3290
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:49,740
scandals that you you see is that
 

3291
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,170
scandals that you you see is that
everybody assumes that there's some sort

3292
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:51,180
everybody assumes that there's some sort
 

3293
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:54,470
everybody assumes that there's some sort
of deep and abiding clever plan that

3294
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
of deep and abiding clever plan that
 

3295
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,970
of deep and abiding clever plan that
some politician is implementing it and

3296
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:55,980
some politician is implementing it and
 

3297
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:57,410
some politician is implementing it and
then you look at it and it turns out now

3298
00:53:57,410 --> 00:53:57,420
then you look at it and it turns out now
 

3299
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,809
then you look at it and it turns out now
it's just something dumb right this sort

3300
00:53:59,809 --> 00:53:59,819
it's just something dumb right this sort
 

3301
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,370
it's just something dumb right this sort
of perfect example of this you know

3302
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:01,380
of perfect example of this you know
 

3303
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,569
of perfect example of this you know
president Trump with the classified

3304
00:54:02,569 --> 00:54:02,579
president Trump with the classified
 

3305
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:04,849
president Trump with the classified
documents in Mar-A-Lago so people on the

3306
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:04,859
documents in Mar-A-Lago so people on the
 

3307
00:54:04,859 --> 00:54:05,990
documents in Mar-A-Lago so people on the
left leg it's probably nuclear codes

3308
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
left leg it's probably nuclear codes
 

3309
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,490
left leg it's probably nuclear codes
probably he's taking secret documents

3310
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:07,500
probably he's taking secret documents
 

3311
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,690
probably he's taking secret documents
and selling them to the Russians or the

3312
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:08,700
and selling them to the Russians or the
 

3313
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:11,329
and selling them to the Russians or the
Chinese and the real most obvious

3314
00:54:11,329 --> 00:54:11,339
Chinese and the real most obvious
 

3315
00:54:11,339 --> 00:54:12,950
Chinese and the real most obvious
explanation is Trump looked at the

3316
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:12,960
explanation is Trump looked at the
 

3317
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,270
explanation is Trump looked at the
papers and he said I like these papers

3318
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:14,280
papers and he said I like these papers
 

3319
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,950
papers and he said I like these papers
and then he just decided to keep them

3320
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:15,960
and then he just decided to keep them
 

3321
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,270
and then he just decided to keep them
right and then people came in and said

3322
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:17,280
right and then people came in and said
 

3323
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,290
right and then people came in and said
Mr President you're not allowed to keep

3324
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:18,300
Mr President you're not allowed to keep
 

3325
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,370
Mr President you're not allowed to keep
those papers he said who are those

3326
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:19,380
those papers he said who are those
 

3327
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:20,329
those papers he said who are those

3333
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:27,410

it is highly likely that that is what

3334
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:27,420
it is highly likely that that is what
 

3335
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:28,790
it is highly likely that that is what
happened and it's very disappointing to

happened and it's very disappointing to
 

3337

out just to be people being dumb and

00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:14,150
out just to be people being dumb and
then other people reacting in Dumb Ways

00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:14,160
then other people reacting in Dumb Ways

corrupt I think the most obvious
 

3409
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,849

explanation there probably is that he

00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
then that was kind of the end of it they
 

3427
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,870
then that was kind of the end of it they
gave him a bag of cash hoping he would

quickly and so I'm deeply uncomfortable

3600
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:37,619
quickly and so I'm deeply uncomfortable

3617
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,750
disinformation so he basically shut it
down you know that that sort of stuff is

3618
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:53,760
down you know that that sort of stuff is
 

3619
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,890
down you know that that sort of stuff is
frightening especially because it wasn't

was real and so the the fact that you
 

3625
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,930
was real and so the the fact that you
have people who seemed to let's put this

hunter Biden thing so amazing is that it
 

3659
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:31,970
hunter Biden thing so amazing is that it
wasn't relieved in response to anything

3660
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:31,980
wasn't relieved in response to anything
 

3661
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:33,470
wasn't relieved in response to anything
it was like the story got posted there

3662
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:33,480
it was like the story got posted there
 

3663
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,690
it was like the story got posted there
were no actual doubts expressed

3664
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:35,700
were no actual doubts expressed
 

3665
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:38,450
were no actual doubts expressed
as to the verified falsity of the story

3666
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:38,460
as to the verified falsity of the story
 

3667
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,010
as to the verified falsity of the story
it was just supposition that it had to

3668
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:40,020
it was just supposition that it had to
 

3669
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,569
it was just supposition that it had to
be false and everybody jumped in so I

3670
00:59:41,569 --> 00:59:41,579
be false and everybody jumped in so I
 

3671
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:42,770
be false and everybody jumped in so I
think that confirmed a lot of the

3672
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:42,780
think that confirmed a lot of the
 

3673
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,150
think that confirmed a lot of the
conspiracy theories people had about

3674
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:44,160
conspiracy theories people had about
 

3675
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,670
conspiracy theories people had about
about social media and how it works yeah

about social media and how it works yeah
 

3677
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,970
about social media and how it works yeah
so if the reason you want to slow down

3678
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:49,980
so if the reason you want to slow down
 

3679
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,490
so if the reason you want to slow down
the viral spread of a thing is at all

3680
00:59:52,490 --> 00:59:52,500
the viral spread of a thing is at all
 

3681
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,970
the viral spread of a thing is at all
grounded in partisanship that's a

3682
00:59:55,970 --> 00:59:55,980
grounded in partisanship that's a
 

3683
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,950
grounded in partisanship that's a
problem like you should be very honest

3684
00:59:57,950 --> 00:59:57,960
problem like you should be very honest
 

3685
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,569
problem like you should be very honest
with yourself and ask yourself that

3686
00:59:59,569 --> 00:59:59,579
with yourself and ask yourself that
 

3687
00:59:59,579 --> 01:00:01,430
with yourself and ask yourself that
question is it because I'm on the left

3688
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
question is it because I'm on the left
 

3689
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,530
question is it because I'm on the left
or on the right that I want to slow this

3690
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:03,540
or on the right that I want to slow this
 

3691
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,609
or on the right that I want to slow this
down versus is it hate

3692
01:00:06,609 --> 01:00:06,619
down versus is it hate
 

3693
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:09,950
down versus is it hate
uh bipartisan hate speech

3694
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:09,960
uh bipartisan hate speech
 

3695
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:12,410
uh bipartisan hate speech
right so that that's but it's it's

3696
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:12,420
right so that that's but it's it's
 

3697
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,970
right so that that's but it's it's
really tricky

3698
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:13,980
really tricky
 

3699
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:15,349
really tricky
um but I I like you I'm very

3700
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:15,359
um but I I like you I'm very
 

3701
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:16,849
um but I I like you I'm very
uncomfortable in general but then you're

3702
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:16,859
uncomfortable in general but then you're
 

3703
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:18,049
uncomfortable in general but then you're
kind of slowing down with any kind of

3704
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:18,059
kind of slowing down with any kind of
 

3705
01:00:18,059 --> 01:00:20,210
kind of slowing down with any kind of
censorship but if if there's something

3706
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:20,220
censorship but if if there's something
 

3707
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,250
censorship but if if there's something
like a conspiracy theory that spreads

3708
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:22,260
like a conspiracy theory that spreads
 

3709
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,089
like a conspiracy theory that spreads
hate

3710
01:00:23,089 --> 01:00:23,099
hate
 

3711
01:00:23,099 --> 01:00:26,150
hate
that becomes viral

3712
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
that becomes viral
 

3713
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,089
that becomes viral
um I still lean to let that conspiracy

3714
01:00:29,089 --> 01:00:29,099
um I still lean to let that conspiracy
 

3715
01:00:29,099 --> 01:00:30,829
um I still lean to let that conspiracy
theory spread

3716
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:30,839
theory spread
 

3717
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:32,870
theory spread
because the alternative is dangerous and

3718
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:32,880
because the alternative is dangerous and
 

3719
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,730
because the alternative is dangerous and
more dangerous it's sort of like the

3720
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:34,740
more dangerous it's sort of like the
 

3721
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,170
more dangerous it's sort of like the
ring of power right like everybody wants

ring of power right like everybody wants
 

3723
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,490
ring of power right like everybody wants
the ring because with the ring you can

3724
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:37,500
the ring because with the ring you can
 

3725
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,230
the ring because with the ring you can
stop the bad guys from going forward but

3726
01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:39,240
stop the bad guys from going forward but

01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:42,599
enormous power and that power can be
 

3731
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:44,329
enormous power and that power can be
used in the wrong ways too

01:04:56,870 --> 01:04:56,880
policy even more somewhat uh I would say
 

3973
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:57,950

it's a deeply personal thing
um but I think you're able to look at it

4074
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:27,660
um but I think you're able to look at it
 

4075
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,450
um but I think you're able to look at it
from a geopolitics perspective what is

4076
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:29,460
from a geopolitics perspective what is
 

4077
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,309
from a geopolitics perspective what is
the role of the United States in this

4078
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:31,319
the role of the United States in this
 

4079
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,049
the role of the United States in this
conflict before the conflict during the

4080
01:06:33,049 --> 01:06:33,059
conflict before the conflict during the
 

4081
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:36,410
conflict before the conflict during the
conflict and right now in helping

4082
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:36,420
conflict and right now in helping
 

4083
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,809
conflict and right now in helping
achieve peace I think before the

4084
01:06:38,809 --> 01:06:38,819
achieve peace I think before the
 

4085
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:41,089
achieve peace I think before the
conflict the big problem is that the

4086
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:41,099
conflict the big problem is that the
 

4087
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:42,470
conflict the big problem is that the
West took

4088
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:42,480
West took
 

4089
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,210
West took
almost the worst possible view which was

4090
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:44,220
almost the worst possible view which was
 

4091
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:46,609
almost the worst possible view which was
encourage Ukraine to keep trying to join

4092
01:06:46,609 --> 01:06:46,619
encourage Ukraine to keep trying to join
 

4093
01:06:46,619 --> 01:06:48,529
encourage Ukraine to keep trying to join
NATO and the EU but don't let them in

4094
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:48,539
NATO and the EU but don't let them in
 

4095
01:06:48,539 --> 01:06:50,809
NATO and the EU but don't let them in
and so what that does is it achieves the

4096
01:06:50,809 --> 01:06:50,819
and so what that does is it achieves the
 

4097
01:06:50,819 --> 01:06:52,549
and so what that does is it achieves the
purpose of getting Russia really really

4098
01:06:52,549 --> 01:06:52,559
purpose of getting Russia really really
 

4099
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:54,650
purpose of getting Russia really really
ticked off and feeling threatened but

4100
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:54,660
ticked off and feeling threatened but
 

4101
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,390
ticked off and feeling threatened but
also does not give any of the

4102
01:06:56,390 --> 01:06:56,400
also does not give any of the
 

4103
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:58,910
also does not give any of the
protections of NATO or the EU to to

4104
01:06:58,910 --> 01:06:58,920
protections of NATO or the EU to to

failed signally to do that so that was

4130
01:07:24,349 --> 01:07:24,359
failed signally to do that so that was
 

4131
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:26,450
failed signally to do that so that was
mistakes in the run-up to the war once

the West began and became to give
Ukraine as much material as is necessary

to repel The Invasion uh and the West
did really well with that I think we

4142
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:39,599
did really well with that I think we
 

4143
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:40,910
did really well with that I think we
were late on the ball in the United

4144

were late on the ball in the United
 

4145
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,170
were late on the ball in the United
States it seemed like Europe led the way

4146
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:42,180
States it seemed like Europe led the way
 

4147
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:43,190
States it seemed like Europe led the way
a little bit more in the United States

4148
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:43,200
a little bit more in the United States
 

4149
01:07:43,200 --> 01:07:46,130
a little bit more in the United States
did there but in terms of effectuating

4150
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:46,140
did there but in terms of effectuating

4154
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:50,339
region which being an American is what
 

4155
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,490
region which being an American is what
I'm chiefly concerned about and the the

4156
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:52,500
I'm chiefly concerned about and the the
 

4157
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,770
I'm chiefly concerned about and the the
American interests were several fold one

4158
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:54,780
American interests were several fold one
 

4159
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:58,069
American interests were several fold one
is preserve borders two is degrade the

4160
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
is preserve borders two is degrade the
 

4161
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,569
is preserve borders two is degrade the
Russian aggressive military because

4162
01:07:59,569 --> 01:07:59,579
Russian aggressive military because
 

4163
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,970
Russian aggressive military because
Russia's military has been aggressive uh

4164
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:01,980
Russia's military has been aggressive uh
 

4165
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,470
Russia's military has been aggressive uh
and they are geopolitical rival of the

4166
01:08:03,470 --> 01:08:03,480
and they are geopolitical rival of the
 

4167
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,049
and they are geopolitical rival of the
United States three recalibrate the

4168
01:08:06,049 --> 01:08:06,059
United States three recalibrate the
 

4169
01:08:06,059 --> 01:08:08,210
United States three recalibrate the
European balance with China Europe was

4170
01:08:08,210 --> 01:08:08,220
European balance with China Europe was
 

4171
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:09,529
European balance with China Europe was
was sort of balancing with Russia and

4172
01:08:09,529 --> 01:08:09,539
was sort of balancing with Russia and
 

4173
01:08:09,539 --> 01:08:11,329
was sort of balancing with Russia and
China and then because of the war they

4174
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:11,339
China and then because of the war they
 

4175
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:13,370
China and then because of the war they
sort of rebalanced away from China and

4176
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:13,380
sort of rebalanced away from China and
 

4177
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:14,809
sort of rebalanced away from China and
Russia which is a real geostrategic

4178
01:08:14,809 --> 01:08:14,819
Russia which is a real geostrategic
 

4179
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:17,749
Russia which is a real geostrategic
opportunity for the United States

4180
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:17,759
opportunity for the United States
 

4181
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:19,550
opportunity for the United States
it seemed like most of those goals have

4182
01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:19,560
it seemed like most of those goals have
 

4183
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:20,749
it seemed like most of those goals have
already been achieved at this point for

4184
01:08:20,749 --> 01:08:20,759
already been achieved at this point for
 

4185
01:08:20,759 --> 01:08:22,010
already been achieved at this point for
the United States and so then the

4186
01:08:22,010 --> 01:08:22,020
the United States and so then the
 

4187
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:23,870
the United States and so then the
question becomes what's the off-ramp

4188
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:23,880
question becomes what's the off-ramp
 

4189
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:25,189
question becomes what's the off-ramp
here and what is the thing you're trying

4190
01:08:25,189 --> 01:08:25,199
here and what is the thing you're trying
 

4191
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:26,090
here and what is the thing you're trying
to prevent so what's the best

4192
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:26,100
to prevent so what's the best
 

4193
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:27,530
to prevent so what's the best
opportunity what's what's the best case

4194
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:27,540
opportunity what's what's the best case
 

4195
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:28,789
opportunity what's what's the best case
scenario what's the worst case scenario

4196
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
scenario what's the worst case scenario
 

4197
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,349
scenario what's the worst case scenario
and then what's realistic so best case

4198
01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:30,359
and then what's realistic so best case
 

4199
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:32,570
and then what's realistic so best case
scenario is Ukraine forces Russia

4200
01:08:32,570 --> 01:08:32,580
scenario is Ukraine forces Russia
 

4201
01:08:32,580 --> 01:08:34,010
scenario is Ukraine forces Russia
entirely out of Ukraine including

4202
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,020
entirely out of Ukraine including
 

4203
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,570
entirely out of Ukraine including
lohanesque and Crimea right that's the

4204
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:35,580
lohanesque and Crimea right that's the
 

4205
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,370
lohanesque and Crimea right that's the
best case scenario virtually no one

4206
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:37,380
best case scenario virtually no one
 

4207
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:38,870
best case scenario virtually no one
thinks that's accomplishable including

4208
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:38,880
thinks that's accomplishable including
 

4209
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,309
thinks that's accomplishable including
the United States right the White House

4210
01:08:40,309 --> 01:08:40,319
the United States right the White House
 

4211
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,990
the United States right the White House
has basically said as much it's

4212
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
has basically said as much it's
 

4213
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,669
has basically said as much it's
difficult to imagine particularly Crimea

4214
01:08:43,669 --> 01:08:43,679
difficult to imagine particularly Crimea
 

4215
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:45,650
difficult to imagine particularly Crimea
the Russians being forced out of out of

4216
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:45,660
the Russians being forced out of out of
 

4217
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,570
the Russians being forced out of out of
Crimea the ukrainians have been

4218
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:47,580
Crimea the ukrainians have been
 

4219
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,550
Crimea the ukrainians have been
successful in pushing the Russians out

4220
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:49,560
successful in pushing the Russians out
 

4221
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,349
successful in pushing the Russians out
of certain parts of johansenesque but

4222
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:51,359
of certain parts of johansenesque but
 

4223
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,309
of certain parts of johansenesque but
the idea they're going to be able to

4224
01:08:52,309 --> 01:08:52,319
the idea they're going to be able to
 

4225
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:54,470
the idea they're going to be able to
push the entire Russian army completely

4226
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:54,480
push the entire Russian army completely
 

4227
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:56,570
push the entire Russian army completely
back to the Russian borders that would

4228
01:08:56,570 --> 01:08:56,580
back to the Russian borders that would
 

4229
01:08:56,580 --> 01:08:58,130
back to the Russian borders that would
be at best a very very long and

4230
01:08:58,130 --> 01:08:58,140
be at best a very very long and
 

4231
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,169
be at best a very very long and
difficult slog in the middle of a

4232
01:09:00,169 --> 01:09:00,179
difficult slog in the middle of a
 

4233
01:09:00,179 --> 01:09:02,090
difficult slog in the middle of a
collapsing Ukrainian economy which is a

4234
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:02,100
collapsing Ukrainian economy which is a
 

4235
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:03,229
collapsing Ukrainian economy which is a
point that zielinski has made it's like

4236
01:09:03,229 --> 01:09:03,239
point that zielinski has made it's like
 

4237
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:04,490
point that zielinski has made it's like
it's not enough for you guys to give us

4238
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:04,500
it's not enough for you guys to give us
 

4239
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:05,630
it's not enough for you guys to give us
military aid we're in the middle of a

4240
01:09:05,630 --> 01:09:05,640
military aid we're in the middle of a
 

4241
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,890
military aid we're in the middle of a
war we're gonna need economic aid as

4242
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:06,900
war we're gonna need economic aid as
 

4243
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,570
war we're gonna need economic aid as
well so it's a pretty open-ended and

4244
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:08,580
well so it's a pretty open-ended and
 

4245
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:09,829
well so it's a pretty open-ended and
strong commitment can take a small

4246
01:09:09,829 --> 01:09:09,839
strong commitment can take a small
 

4247
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:11,390
strong commitment can take a small
attention on that and your best case

4248
01:09:11,390 --> 01:09:11,400
attention on that and your best case
 

4249
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,990
attention on that and your best case
scenario if that does militarily happen

4250
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:14,000
scenario if that does militarily happen
 

4251
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,570
scenario if that does militarily happen
including Crimea do you think there's a

4252
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:17,580
including Crimea do you think there's a
 

4253
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:21,470
including Crimea do you think there's a
world in which Vladimir Putin would

4254
01:09:21,470 --> 01:09:21,480
world in which Vladimir Putin would
 

4255
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:22,010
world in which Vladimir Putin would
um

4256
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:22,020
um
 

4257
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:23,809
um
be able to convince the Russian people

4258
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:23,819
be able to convince the Russian people
 

4259
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:26,390
be able to convince the Russian people
that this is this was a good conclusion

4260
01:09:26,390 --> 01:09:26,400
that this is this was a good conclusion
 

4261
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:28,370
that this is this was a good conclusion
to the war right so the problem is that

4262
01:09:28,370 --> 01:09:28,380
to the war right so the problem is that
 

4263
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:29,749
to the war right so the problem is that
the best case scenario might also be the

4264
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
the best case scenario might also be the
 

4265
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:31,789
the best case scenario might also be the
worst case scenario meaning that there

4266
01:09:31,789 --> 01:09:31,799
worst case scenario meaning that there
 

4267
01:09:31,799 --> 01:09:33,289
worst case scenario meaning that there
are a couple of scenarios that are sort

4268
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:33,299
are a couple of scenarios that are sort
 

4269
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:34,370
are a couple of scenarios that are sort
of the worst case scenario and this is

4270
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:34,380
of the worst case scenario and this is
 

4271
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,930
of the worst case scenario and this is
sort of the puzzlement of the situation

4272
01:09:35,930 --> 01:09:35,940
sort of the puzzlement of the situation
 

4273
01:09:35,940 --> 01:09:39,110
sort of the puzzlement of the situation
one is that Putin feels so boxed in so

4274
01:09:39,110 --> 01:09:39,120
one is that Putin feels so boxed in so
 

4275
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:40,490
one is that Putin feels so boxed in so
unable to go back to his own people and

4276
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:40,500
unable to go back to his own people and
 

4277
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:42,110
unable to go back to his own people and
say we just wasted tens of thousands of

4278
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:42,120
say we just wasted tens of thousands of
 

4279
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:43,669
say we just wasted tens of thousands of
lives here for no reason that he

4280
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
lives here for no reason that he
 

4281
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,189
lives here for no reason that he
unleashed the Tactical a tactical

4282
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
unleashed the Tactical a tactical
 

4283
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:47,510
unleashed the Tactical a tactical
nuclear weapon on the battlefield nobody

4284
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
nuclear weapon on the battlefield nobody
 

4285
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,890
nuclear weapon on the battlefield nobody
knows what happens after that so we put

4286
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:48,900
knows what happens after that so we put
 

4287
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,990
knows what happens after that so we put
NATO planes in the air to take out

4288
01:09:50,990 --> 01:09:51,000
NATO planes in the air to take out
 

4289
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,490
NATO planes in the air to take out
Russian assets do Russians start

4290
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:52,500
Russian assets do Russians start
 

4291
01:09:52,500 --> 01:09:54,950
Russian assets do Russians start
shooting down planes does Russia then

4292
01:09:54,950 --> 01:09:54,960
shooting down planes does Russia then
 

4293
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:56,450
shooting down planes does Russia then
threaten to escalate even further by

4294
01:09:56,450 --> 01:09:56,460
threaten to escalate even further by
 

4295
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,610
threaten to escalate even further by
attacking an actual NATO civilian Center

4296
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:58,620
attacking an actual NATO civilian Center
 

4297
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,590
attacking an actual NATO civilian Center
or or even a Ukrainian civilian center

4298
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:00,600
or or even a Ukrainian civilian center
 

4299
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,150
or or even a Ukrainian civilian center
with nuclear weapons like where it goes

4300
01:10:02,150 --> 01:10:02,160
with nuclear weapons like where it goes
 

4301
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:03,709
with nuclear weapons like where it goes
from there nobody knows because nuclear

4302
01:10:03,709 --> 01:10:03,719
from there nobody knows because nuclear
 

4303
01:10:03,719 --> 01:10:05,810
from there nobody knows because nuclear
weapons haven't been used since 1945. so

4304
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:05,820
weapons haven't been used since 1945. so
 

4305
01:10:05,820 --> 01:10:07,729
weapons haven't been used since 1945. so
that's you know that is a worst case

4306
01:10:07,729 --> 01:10:07,739
that's you know that is a worst case
 

4307
01:10:07,739 --> 01:10:09,350
that's you know that is a worst case
scenario it's an unpredictable scenario

4308
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
scenario it's an unpredictable scenario
 

4309
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,510
scenario it's an unpredictable scenario
that could devolve into really really

4310
01:10:11,510 --> 01:10:11,520
that could devolve into really really
 

4311
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,070
that could devolve into really really
significant problems the other worst

4312
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:13,080
significant problems the other worst
 

4313
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:14,810
significant problems the other worst
case scenario could be a best case

4314
01:10:14,810 --> 01:10:14,820
case scenario could be a best case
 

4315
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:15,770
case scenario could be a best case
scenario could be a worse we just don't

4316
01:10:15,770 --> 01:10:15,780
scenario could be a worse we just don't
 

4317
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,510
scenario could be a worse we just don't
know is Putin Falls

4318
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
know is Putin Falls
 

4319
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,910
know is Putin Falls
what happens after that who takes over

4320
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:19,920
what happens after that who takes over
 

4321
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,430
what happens after that who takes over
for Putin is that person more moderate

4322
01:10:22,430 --> 01:10:22,440
for Putin is that person more moderate
 

4323
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,169
for Putin is that person more moderate
than Putin is that personal liberalizer

4324
01:10:24,169 --> 01:10:24,179
than Putin is that personal liberalizer
 

4325
01:10:24,179 --> 01:10:26,390
than Putin is that personal liberalizer
it probably won't be novantly if he's

4326
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:26,400
it probably won't be novantly if he's
 

4327
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,350
it probably won't be novantly if he's
going to be

4328
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
going to be
 

4329
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,330
going to be
ousted or probably somebody who's a Top

4330
01:10:29,330 --> 01:10:29,340
ousted or probably somebody who's a Top
 

4331
01:10:29,340 --> 01:10:31,070
ousted or probably somebody who's a Top
member of Putin's brass right now and

4332
01:10:31,070 --> 01:10:31,080
member of Putin's brass right now and
 

4333
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,470
member of Putin's brass right now and
has capacity to control the military

4334
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:33,480
has capacity to control the military
 

4335
01:10:33,480 --> 01:10:35,149
has capacity to control the military
or it's possible that the entire regime

4336
01:10:35,149 --> 01:10:35,159
or it's possible that the entire regime
 

4337
01:10:35,159 --> 01:10:36,350
or it's possible that the entire regime
breaks down what you end up with is

4338
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,360
breaks down what you end up with is
 

4339
01:10:36,360 --> 01:10:38,750
breaks down what you end up with is
Syria and Russia right where where you

4340
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:38,760
Syria and Russia right where where you
 

4341
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,070
Syria and Russia right where where you
just have an entirely out of control

4342
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:40,080
just have an entirely out of control
 

4343
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:42,290
just have an entirely out of control
region with no centralizing power which

4344
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:42,300
region with no centralizing power which
 

4345
01:10:42,300 --> 01:10:45,890
region with no centralizing power which
is also a disaster area and so in the

4346
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:45,900
is also a disaster area and so in the
 

4347
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,410
is also a disaster area and so in the
nature of risk mitigation in in sort of

4348
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:48,420
nature of risk mitigation in in sort of
 

4349
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:49,850
nature of risk mitigation in in sort of
an attempt at risk mitigation what

4350
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:49,860
an attempt at risk mitigation what
 

4351
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:51,110
an attempt at risk mitigation what
actually should be happening right now

4352
01:10:51,110 --> 01:10:51,120
actually should be happening right now
 

4353
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:54,290
actually should be happening right now
is some off-ramp has to be offered to

4354
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:54,300
is some off-ramp has to be offered to
 

4355
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:56,450
is some off-ramp has to be offered to
Putin the OfferUp likely is going to be

4356
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:56,460
Putin the OfferUp likely is going to be
 

4357
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:58,130
Putin the OfferUp likely is going to be
him maintaining Crimea and parts of

4358
01:10:58,130 --> 01:10:58,140
him maintaining Crimea and parts of
 

4359
01:10:58,140 --> 01:10:59,870
him maintaining Crimea and parts of
luhanskin Dennis it's probably going to

4360
01:10:59,870 --> 01:10:59,880
luhanskin Dennis it's probably going to
 

4361
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,750
luhanskin Dennis it's probably going to
be a commitment by Ukraine not to join

4362
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:02,760
be a commitment by Ukraine not to join
 

4363
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,590
be a commitment by Ukraine not to join
NATO formally but a guarantee by the

4364
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:06,600
NATO formally but a guarantee by the
 

4365
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,870
NATO formally but a guarantee by the
West to defend Ukraine in case of an

invasion of its borders Again by Russia

4368
01:11:11,149 --> 01:11:11,159
invasion of its borders Again by Russia
 

4369
01:11:11,159 --> 01:11:12,830
invasion of its borders Again by Russia
like an actual treaty obligation now

4370
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:12,840
like an actual treaty obligation now
 

4371
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:14,930
like an actual treaty obligation now
like the BS treaty obligation and when

4372
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:14,940
like the BS treaty obligation and when
 

4373
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:17,030
like the BS treaty obligation and when
Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in

4374
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:17,040
Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in
 

4375
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:18,050
Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in
the 90s

4376
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:18,060
the 90s
 

4377
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:20,689
the 90s
um and uh and that is likely how this is

4378
01:11:20,689 --> 01:11:20,699
um and uh and that is likely how this is
 

4379
01:11:20,699 --> 01:11:22,910
um and uh and that is likely how this is
going to have to go the problem is that

4380
01:11:22,910 --> 01:11:22,920
going to have to go the problem is that
 

4381
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:25,189
going to have to go the problem is that
requires political courage not from not

4382
01:11:25,189 --> 01:11:25,199
requires political courage not from not
 

4383
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:26,689
requires political courage not from not
from his landscape requires courage from

which has been the easy Road off I think

4458
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:28,620
which has been the easy Road off I think
 

4459
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,990
which has been the easy Road off I think
for a lot of politicians in the west is

4460
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,000
for a lot of politicians in the west is
 

4461
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,669
for a lot of politicians in the west is
for them to just say well this is up to

4462
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:31,679
for them to just say well this is up to
 

4463
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:33,169
for them to just say well this is up to
the ukrainians to decide it's up to the

4464
01:12:33,169 --> 01:12:33,179
the ukrainians to decide it's up to the
 

4465
01:12:33,179 --> 01:12:35,450
the ukrainians to decide it's up to the
ukrainians to decide well is it totally

4466
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:35,460
ukrainians to decide well is it totally
 

4467
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:36,890
ukrainians to decide well is it totally
up to the ukrainians to decide because

4468
01:12:36,890 --> 01:12:36,900
up to the ukrainians to decide because
 

4469
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,810
up to the ukrainians to decide because
it seems like the West is signing an

4470
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:38,820
it seems like the West is signing an
 

4471
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:40,010
it seems like the West is signing an
awful lot of checks and all of Europe is

4472
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:40,020
awful lot of checks and all of Europe is
 

4473
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:41,450
awful lot of checks and all of Europe is
going to freeze this winter

going to freeze this winter
 

4475
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,850
going to freeze this winter
so this is the importance of great

01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:43,860
so this is the importance of great
 

4477
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,830
so this is the importance of great
leadership by the way that's why the

4478
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
leadership by the way that's why the
 

4479
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:48,350

4483
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,510

do you think there's power to just

fundamentally different than
 

4499
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,669
fundamentally different than

01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:20,280
so I'm deeply afraid that Putin outplays
 

4509
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,530
so I'm deeply afraid that Putin outplays
people in the one-on-one scenarios

4510
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:21,540
people in the one-on-one scenarios
 

4511
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:22,669
people in the one-on-one scenarios
because he's done it to multiple

4512
01:13:22,669 --> 01:13:22,679
because he's done it to multiple

one-on-one scenarios with bush with
 

4517
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,130
one-on-one scenarios with bush with
Obama with Trump with with Biden and he

4518
01:13:28,130 --> 01:13:28,140
Obama with Trump with with Biden and he
 

4519
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:30,229
Obama with Trump with with Biden and he
seems to be a very canny operator and a

4520
01:13:30,229 --> 01:13:30,239
seems to be a very canny operator and a
 

4521
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,669
seems to be a very canny operator and a
very sort of hard-nosed operator in

very sort of hard-nosed operator in
 

4523
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,010
very sort of hard-nosed operator in
those situations I think that if you're

4524
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:34,020
those situations I think that if you're
 

4525
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,270
those situations I think that if you're
going to do something like that like an

4526
01:13:35,270 --> 01:13:35,280
going to do something like that like an
 

4527
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:36,590
going to do something like that like an
actual political face-to-face Summit

actual political face-to-face Summit
 

4529
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,149
actual political face-to-face Summit
what you would need is for Biden to

01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
what you would need is for Biden to
 

4531
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:39,770
what you would need is for Biden to
First have a conversation with zelenski

4532
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:39,780
First have a conversation with zelenski
 

4533
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:41,270
First have a conversation with zelenski
where zelinski knows what's going on so

4534
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:41,280
where zelinski knows what's going on so
 

4535
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:44,390
where zelinski knows what's going on so
he's aware and then Biden walks in and

4536
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:44,400
he's aware and then Biden walks in and
 

4537
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,510
he's aware and then Biden walks in and
he says to Putin on camera here's the

4550
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
um but you know the the big problem for
 

4551
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:02,090
um but you know the the big problem for
Putin I think and the problem with

4552
01:14:02,090 --> 01:14:02,100
Putin I think and the problem with
 

4553
01:14:02,100 --> 01:14:03,770
Putin I think and the problem with
public facing fora maybe it's a private

4554
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:03,780
public facing fora maybe it's a private
 

4555
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:05,149
public facing fora maybe it's a private
meeting if it's a private meeting maybe

4556
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:05,159
meeting if it's a private meeting maybe
 

4557
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:06,410
meeting if it's a private meeting maybe
that's the best thing there's a

4558
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:06,420
that's the best thing there's a
 

4559
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,430
that's the best thing there's a
public-facing forum I think it's a

4560
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:07,440
public-facing forum I think it's a
 

4561
01:14:07,440 --> 01:14:08,330
public-facing forum I think it's a
problem because Putin's afraid of being

4562
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:08,340
problem because Putin's afraid of being
 

4563
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:10,370
problem because Putin's afraid of being
humiliated at this point um if it's if

4564
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:10,380
humiliated at this point um if it's if
 

4565
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,590
humiliated at this point um if it's if
it's a private meeting then

4566
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:12,600
it's a private meeting then
 

4567
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,709
it's a private meeting then
sure except that again I just I wonder

4568
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:15,719
sure except that again I just I wonder
 

4569
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:17,330
sure except that again I just I wonder
whether

4570
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:17,340
whether
 

4571
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,630
whether
when it comes to and a person as canny

4572
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:20,640
when it comes to and a person as canny
 

4573
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,970
when it comes to and a person as canny
as Putin and to

4574
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:22,980
as Putin and to
 

4575
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,770
as Putin and to
a politician that I really don't think

4576
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:24,780
a politician that I really don't think
 

4577
01:14:24,780 --> 01:14:26,209
a politician that I really don't think
is a particularly sophisticated player

4578
01:14:26,209 --> 01:14:26,219
is a particularly sophisticated player
 

4579
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,790
is a particularly sophisticated player
in in Joe Biden and again this is not

4580
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
in in Joe Biden and again this is not
 

4581
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,410
in in Joe Biden and again this is not
unique to Biden I think that most of our

4582
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:30,420
unique to Biden I think that most of our
 

4583
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,590
unique to Biden I think that most of our
presidents for the for the last 30 40

4584
01:14:33,590 --> 01:14:33,600
presidents for the for the last 30 40
 

4585
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:34,790
presidents for the for the last 30 40
years have not been particularly

4586
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
years have not been particularly
 

4587
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,950
years have not been particularly
sophisticated players uh I think that

4588
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:36,960
sophisticated players uh I think that
 

4589
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,010
sophisticated players uh I think that
that's that's a that's a risky scenario

4590
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,020
that's that's a that's a risky scenario
 

4591
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:42,290
that's that's a that's a risky scenario
yeah I still believe in the power of

01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:44,930
that because otherwise
um

president to come to us and uh I think

4650
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:56,820
president to come to us and uh I think
 

4651
01:15:56,820 --> 01:15:58,550
president to come to us and uh I think
that makes the president look strong not

4652
01:15:58,550 --> 01:15:58,560
that makes the president look strong not
 

4653
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,470
that makes the president look strong not
weak I mean I agree with you I think it

4654
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
weak I mean I agree with you I think it
 

4655
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,970
weak I mean I agree with you I think it
would also require some people on the

4656
01:16:01,970 --> 01:16:01,980
would also require some people on the
 

4657
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,830
would also require some people on the
right people like me if it's Joe Biden

4658
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:03,840
right people like me if it's Joe Biden
 

4659
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:05,630
right people like me if it's Joe Biden
to say if Biden does that I see what

4660
01:16:05,630 --> 01:16:05,640
to say if Biden does that I see what
 

4661
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,310
to say if Biden does that I see what
he's doing and it's the right move I

4662
01:16:07,310 --> 01:16:07,320
he's doing and it's the right move I
 

4663
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,450
he's doing and it's the right move I
think one of the things that he's afraid

4664
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:08,460
think one of the things that he's afraid
 

4665
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:10,490
think one of the things that he's afraid
of to steal me on him I think one thing

4666
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:10,500
of to steal me on him I think one thing
 

4667
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,750
of to steal me on him I think one thing
he's afraid of is he goes and he makes

4668
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:11,760
he's afraid of is he goes and he makes
 

4669
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,310
he's afraid of is he goes and he makes
that sort of deal and the right says you

4670
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:13,320
that sort of deal and the right says you
 

4671
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:14,930
that sort of deal and the right says you
just cowered in front of Russia you just

4672
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:14,940
just cowered in front of Russia you just
 

4673
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:16,850
just cowered in front of Russia you just
you just gave away Ukraine whatever it

4674
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:16,860
you just gave away Ukraine whatever it
 

4675
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:17,570
you just gave away Ukraine whatever it
is

4676
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:17,580
is
 

4677
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:18,830
is
um but uh you know it's going to require

4678
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:18,840
um but uh you know it's going to require
 

4679
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:20,149
um but uh you know it's going to require
some some people on the right to say

4680
01:16:20,149 --> 01:16:20,159
some some people on the right to say
 

4681
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,010
some some people on the right to say
that that move is the right move and

4682
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:22,020
that that move is the right move and
 

4683
01:16:22,020 --> 01:16:23,270
that that move is the right move and
then he'll buy it if Biden actually

4684
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
then he'll buy it if Biden actually
 

4685
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,770
then he'll buy it if Biden actually
performs that move

4686
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:24,780
performs that move
 

4687
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,770
performs that move

treat what ought to be a discussion as
for example in exercise and performance

actually a lot like what we're doing
 

4817
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:36,350
actually a lot like what we're doing
right now it's just the person maybe

4818
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:36,360
right now it's just the person maybe
 

4819
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:38,570
right now it's just the person maybe

uh and so that's that's fine usually
 

4823
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,250
uh and so that's that's fine usually
half the debate or discussion is me just

4824
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:43,260
half the debate or discussion is me just
 

4825
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:44,750
half the debate or discussion is me just
asking for clarification of terms like

4826
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:44,760
asking for clarification of terms like
 

4827
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,430
asking for clarification of terms like
what exactly do you mean by this so I

4828

what exactly do you mean by this so I
 

4829
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:48,709
what exactly do you mean by this so I
can drill down on where the actual

4830
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:48,719
can drill down on where the actual
 

4831
01:18:48,719 --> 01:18:50,330
can drill down on where the actual
disagreement May lie because some of the

4832
01:18:50,330 --> 01:18:50,340
disagreement May lie because some of the
 

4833
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,350
disagreement May lie because some of the
time people think they're disagreeing

4834
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:51,360
time people think they're disagreeing
 

4835
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:53,149
time people think they're disagreeing
and they're actually not disagreeing and

4836
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:53,159
and they're actually not disagreeing and
 

4837

enough British TV so the way that

5114
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
enough British TV so the way that
 

5115
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,850
enough British TV so the way that
interviews are done there are much more

5116
01:23:01,850 --> 01:23:01,860
interviews are done there are much more
 

5117
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:03,770
interviews are done there are much more
adversarial than American TV in American

5118
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:03,780
adversarial than American TV in American
 

5119
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:05,510
adversarial than American TV in American
TV if somebody is adversarial with you

5120
01:23:05,510 --> 01:23:05,520
TV if somebody is adversarial with you
 

5121
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,590
TV if somebody is adversarial with you
you assume that they're a member of the

5122
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:06,600
you assume that they're a member of the
 

5123
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,510
you assume that they're a member of the
other side that's typically how it is uh

5124
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:08,520
other side that's typically how it is uh
 

5125
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,890
other side that's typically how it is uh
and so I'm critiquing some of his

5126
01:23:09,890 --> 01:23:09,900
and so I'm critiquing some of his
 

5127
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:11,270
and so I'm critiquing some of his
questions at the beginning and I thought

5128
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:11,280
questions at the beginning and I thought
 

5129
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:12,350
questions at the beginning and I thought
that the critique of some of his

5130
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:12,360
that the critique of some of his
 

5131
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:13,610
that the critique of some of his
questions is actually Fair he's asking

5132
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:13,620
questions is actually Fair he's asking
 

5133
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,410
questions is actually Fair he's asking
me about abortion and I thought he was

5134
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:15,420
me about abortion and I thought he was
 

5135
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,209
me about abortion and I thought he was
asking it from a way of framing the

5136
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:17,219
asking it from a way of framing the
 

5137
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:18,709
asking it from a way of framing the
question that wasn't accurate and so I

5138
01:23:18,709 --> 01:23:18,719
question that wasn't accurate and so I
 

5139
01:23:18,719 --> 01:23:19,910
question that wasn't accurate and so I
assumed that he was on the left because

5140
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:19,920
assumed that he was on the left because
 

5141
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,010
assumed that he was on the left because
again I'd never heard of him uh and so

5142
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:22,020
again I'd never heard of him uh and so
 

5143
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:24,709
again I'd never heard of him uh and so
you know I mischaracterized him and I

5144
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:24,719
you know I mischaracterized him and I
 

5145
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,390

5147
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,950

5176
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:55,560
far as you know what I wish I had done
 

5177
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,870
far as you know what I wish I had done
differently I wish I had known who he

5178
01:23:56,870 --> 01:23:56,880
differently I wish I had known who he
 

5179
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,370
differently I wish I had known who he
was I wish I'd done my research I wish

5180
01:23:58,370 --> 01:23:58,380
was I wish I'd done my research I wish
 

5181
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,229
was I wish I'd done my research I wish
that I I wish that I had treated it as

5182
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
that I I wish that I had treated it as
 

5183
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:01,669
that I I wish that I had treated it as
though there was a possibility there was

5184
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
though there was a possibility there was
 

5185
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:02,870
though there was a possibility there was
going to be more adversarial than it was

5186
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:02,880
going to be more adversarial than it was
 

5187
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:05,090
going to be more adversarial than it was
I think I was in cautious about the

5188
01:24:05,090 --> 01:24:05,100
I think I was in cautious about the
 

5189
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:06,770
I think I was in cautious about the
interview because it was pitched as it's

5190
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:06,780
interview because it was pitched as it's
 

5191
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:08,090
interview because it was pitched as it's
just another book interview and it

5192
01:24:08,090 --> 01:24:08,100
just another book interview and it
 

5193
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:09,229
just another book interview and it
wasn't just another book interview it

5194
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:09,239
wasn't just another book interview it
 

5195
01:24:09,239 --> 01:24:10,669
wasn't just another book interview it
was treated much more adversarially than

5196
01:24:10,669 --> 01:24:10,679
was treated much more adversarially than
 

5197
01:24:10,679 --> 01:24:11,689
was treated much more adversarially than
that

5198
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:11,699
that
 

5199
01:24:11,699 --> 01:24:13,550
that
um so I wish that that's on me I got to

5200
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:13,560
um so I wish that that's on me I got to
 

5201
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,649
um so I wish that that's on me I got to
research the people who are talking to

5202
01:24:15,649 --> 01:24:15,659
research the people who are talking to
 

5203
01:24:15,659 --> 01:24:17,810
research the people who are talking to
me and watch their shows and learn about

5204
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:17,820
me and watch their shows and learn about

me and watch their shows and learn about
that and then obviously you know the

5206
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:19,860
that and then obviously you know the
 

5207
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,729
that and then obviously you know the
kind of gut level appeal to Ego or

5208
01:24:22,729 --> 01:24:22,739
kind of gut level appeal to Ego or
 

5209
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:24,110
kind of gut level appeal to Ego or
arrogance like that that's a bad look

5210
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:24,120
arrogance like that that's a bad look
 

5211
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,910
arrogance like that that's a bad look
and and shouldn't have done that and

5212
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
and and shouldn't have done that and

the forces behind this do you have a

5662
01:31:40,129 --> 01:31:40,139
the forces behind this do you have a
 

5663
01:31:40,139 --> 01:31:43,430
the forces behind this do you have a
process or or just uh you uh wait for

5664
01:31:43,430 --> 01:31:43,440
process or or just uh you uh wait for
 

5665

I mean I think that it I don't think
 

5669
01:31:46,679 --> 01:31:49,090
I mean I think that it I don't think
it's a formal process but because I read

5670
01:31:49,090 --> 01:31:49,100
it's a formal process but because I read
 

5671
01:31:49,100 --> 01:31:51,830
it's a formal process but because I read
so there's two ways to do it one is

5672
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
so there's two ways to do it one is
 

5673
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,390
so there's two ways to do it one is
sometimes

5674
01:31:53,390 --> 01:31:53,400
sometimes
 

5675
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,550
sometimes
you know that sometimes The Daily Grind

5676
01:31:55,550 --> 01:31:55,560

of the news is going to refer back to
core principles that are broader and

5680
01:31:59,870 --> 01:31:59,880
core principles that are broader and
 

5681
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:00,709
core principles that are broader and
deeper

5682
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:00,719
deeper
 

5683
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:03,890
deeper
so I thank God because I've read so much

5695
01:32:12,780 --> 01:32:15,770
sort of channel that into in the mental
Rolodex these three big ideas that I

5696
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:15,780
Rolodex these three big ideas that I
 

5697
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,450
Rolodex these three big ideas that I
think are are really important and then

5698
01:32:17,450 --> 01:32:17,460
think are are really important and then
 

5699
01:32:17,460 --> 01:32:18,770
think are are really important and then
I can talk at length about what those

5700
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:18,780
I can talk at length about what those
 

5701
01:32:18,780 --> 01:32:21,169
I can talk at length about what those
ideas are and I can explicate those uh

5702
01:32:21,169 --> 01:32:21,179
ideas are and I can explicate those uh
 

5703
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:22,850
ideas are and I can explicate those uh
and and so you know for example when we

5704
01:32:22,850 --> 01:32:22,860
and and so you know for example when we
 

5705
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:24,830
and and so you know for example when we
were talking about must taking over

5706
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:24,840

on you know and I do that I would say
 

5715
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:36,350
on you know and I do that I would say
fairly frequently we're talking about

5716
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:36,360
fairly frequently we're talking about
 

5717
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:37,090
fairly frequently we're talking about
um

5718
01:32:37,090 --> 01:32:37,100
um
 

5719
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:39,530
um
say subsidization of industry and I can

5720
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:39,540
say subsidization of industry and I can
 

5721
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:40,790
say subsidization of industry and I can
immediately tie that into okay what's

5722
01:32:40,790 --> 01:32:40,800
immediately tie that into okay what's
 

5723
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:42,110
immediately tie that into okay what's
the history of subsidization in the

5724
01:32:42,110 --> 01:32:42,120
the history of subsidization in the
 

5725
01:32:42,120 --> 01:32:43,669
the history of subsidization in the
United States going all the way back to

5726
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
United States going all the way back to
 

5727
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,410
United States going all the way back to
Woodrow Wilson and Ford through FDR's

5728
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:45,420
Woodrow Wilson and Ford through FDR's
 

5729
01:32:45,420 --> 01:32:46,910
Woodrow Wilson and Ford through FDR's
industrial policy and how does that tie

5730
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:46,920
industrial policy and how does that tie
 

5731
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:48,830
industrial policy and how does that tie
into sort of broader Economic Policy

5732
01:32:48,830 --> 01:32:48,840
into sort of broader Economic Policy
 

5733
01:32:48,840 --> 01:32:51,110
into sort of broader Economic Policy
internationally so it allows me to tie

01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:51,120
internationally so it allows me to tie
 

5735
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:53,209
internationally so it allows me to tie
into bigger themes because the what I

5736
01:32:53,209 --> 01:32:53,219
into bigger themes because the what I
 

5737
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:54,649
into bigger themes because the what I
tend to read is mostly not news what I

01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
that's the icing on the cake but the
 

5747
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:03,709
that's the icing on the cake but the
actual cake is the hundreds of pages in

other words it would be more specific to

01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:39,900
engineering than to say just broad
 

5981
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:41,570
engineering than to say just broad
spectrum they're a genius and that does

5982
01:36:41,570 --> 01:36:41,580
spectrum they're a genius and that does
 

5983
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:42,890
spectrum they're a genius and that does
avoid the problem of thinking that

not good at right it's a little more
 

5989
01:36:45,120 --> 01:36:47,209
not good at right it's a little more

been sort of impactful on some of the
thoughts I've been having what's the key

6046
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:37,800
thoughts I've been having what's the key
 

6047
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,410
thoughts I've been having what's the key
idea in there the key idea is that we've

6048
01:37:39,410 --> 01:37:39,420
idea in there the key idea is that we've
 

6049
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,629
idea in there the key idea is that we've

done in the west from how it was

6052
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:43,260
done in the west from how it was
 

6053
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:45,169
done in the west from how it was
historically done that basically for

6054
01:37:45,169 --> 01:37:45,179
historically done that basically for
 

6055
01:37:45,179 --> 01:37:47,390
historically done that basically for
nearly all of human history the way that

6056
01:37:47,390 --> 01:37:47,400
nearly all of human history the way that
 

6057
01:37:47,400 --> 01:37:50,209
nearly all of human history the way that
we identify as human beings is as a mix

6058
01:37:50,209 --> 01:37:50,219
we identify as human beings is as a mix
 

6059
01:37:50,219 --> 01:37:51,950
we identify as human beings is as a mix
of our biological drives and then how

6060
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:51,960
of our biological drives and then how
 

6061
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:52,850
of our biological drives and then how
that interacts with the social

6062
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:52,860
that interacts with the social
 

6063
01:37:52,860 --> 01:37:54,590
that interacts with the social
institutions around us and so when

6064
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:54,600
institutions around us and so when
 

6065
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,689
institutions around us and so when
you're a child you're a bunch of

6066
01:37:55,689 --> 01:37:55,699
you're a child you're a bunch of
 

6067
01:37:55,699 --> 01:37:57,590
you're a child you're a bunch of
unfettered biological drives and it's

6068
01:37:57,590 --> 01:37:57,600
unfettered biological drives and it's
 

6069
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:59,450
unfettered biological drives and it's
your parents job to civilize you and

6070
01:37:59,450 --> 01:37:59,460
your parents job to civilize you and
 

6071
01:37:59,460 --> 01:38:00,830
your parents job to civilize you and
civilize you literally means bring you

6072
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:00,840
civilize you literally means bring you
 

6073
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,629
civilize you literally means bring you
into civilization right you learn the

6074
01:38:02,629 --> 01:38:02,639
into civilization right you learn the
 

6075
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:03,890
into civilization right you learn the
rules of the road you learn how to

6076
01:38:03,890 --> 01:38:03,900
rules of the road you learn how to
 

6077
01:38:03,900 --> 01:38:06,229
rules of the road you learn how to
integrate into institutions that already

6078
01:38:06,229 --> 01:38:06,239
integrate into institutions that already
 

6079
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:08,330
integrate into institutions that already
exist and are designed to shape you and

6080
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:08,340
exist and are designed to shape you and
 

6081
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:09,410
exist and are designed to shape you and
it's how you interact with those

6082
01:38:09,410 --> 01:38:09,420
it's how you interact with those
 

6083
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,090
it's how you interact with those
institutions that makes you you it's not

6084
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:11,100
institutions that makes you you it's not
 

6085
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:12,649
institutions that makes you you it's not
just a set of biological drives and then

6086
01:38:12,649 --> 01:38:12,659
just a set of biological drives and then
 

6087
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:15,350
just a set of biological drives and then
in the modern world we've really driven

6088
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
in the modern world we've really driven
 

6089
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,450
in the modern world we've really driven
toward the idea that what we are is how

6090
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:17,460
toward the idea that what we are is how
 

6091
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:19,010
toward the idea that what we are is how
we feel on the inside without reference

6092
01:38:19,010 --> 01:38:19,020
we feel on the inside without reference
 

6093
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:20,450
we feel on the inside without reference
to the outside world and it's the job of

6094
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:20,460
to the outside world and it's the job of
 

6095
01:38:20,460 --> 01:38:21,770
to the outside world and it's the job of
the outside world to celebrate and

6096
01:38:21,770 --> 01:38:21,780
the outside world to celebrate and
 

6097
01:38:21,780 --> 01:38:23,629
the outside world to celebrate and
reflect what we think about ourselves on

6098
01:38:23,629 --> 01:38:23,639
reflect what we think about ourselves on
 

6099
01:38:23,639 --> 01:38:25,850
reflect what we think about ourselves on
the inside and so what that means that

6100
01:38:25,850 --> 01:38:25,860
the inside and so what that means that
 

6101
01:38:25,860 --> 01:38:28,970
the inside and so what that means that
we are driven now toward fighting

6102
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:28,980
we are driven now toward fighting
 

6103
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:30,470
we are driven now toward fighting
institutions because institutions are in

6104
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
institutions because institutions are in
 

6105
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,910
institutions because institutions are in
positions so everything around us

6106
01:38:31,910 --> 01:38:31,920
positions so everything around us
 

6107
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:33,709
positions so everything around us
societal institutions these are these

6108
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:33,719
societal institutions these are these
 

6109
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:34,790
societal institutions these are these
are things that are crimping our style

6110
01:38:34,790 --> 01:38:34,800
are things that are crimping our style
 

6111
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:36,169
are things that are crimping our style
they're making us not feel the way that

6112
01:38:36,169 --> 01:38:36,179
they're making us not feel the way that
 

6113
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:37,490
they're making us not feel the way that
we want to feel and if we just destroy

6114
01:38:37,490 --> 01:38:37,500
we want to feel and if we just destroy
 

6115
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:39,050
we want to feel and if we just destroy
those things then we'll be Freer and

6116
01:38:39,050 --> 01:38:39,060
those things then we'll be Freer and
 

6117
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:41,209
those things then we'll be Freer and
more liberated it's it's a it's a I

6118
01:38:41,209 --> 01:38:41,219
more liberated it's it's a it's a I
 

6119
01:38:41,219 --> 01:38:43,129
more liberated it's it's a it's a I
think much deeper model of of how to

6120
01:38:43,129 --> 01:38:43,139
think much deeper model of of how to
 

6121
01:38:43,139 --> 01:38:45,470
think much deeper model of of how to
think about why our social politics

6122
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:45,480
think about why our social politics
 

6123
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:46,550
think about why our social politics
particular are moving in a particular

particular are moving in a particular
 

6125

direction is that a ground shift has

6126
01:38:48,530 --> 01:38:48,540
direction is that a ground shift has
 

6127
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:49,729
direction is that a ground shift has
happened and how people think about

6128
01:38:49,729 --> 01:38:49,739
happened and how people think about
 

6129
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:52,330
happened and how people think about
themselves and and this has had some

6130
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:52,340
themselves and and this has had some
 

6131
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:54,590
themselves and and this has had some
somewhat kind of shocking

6132
01:38:54,590 --> 01:38:54,600
somewhat kind of shocking
 

6133
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,870
somewhat kind of shocking
effect in terms of social politics so

6134
01:38:56,870 --> 01:38:56,880
effect in terms of social politics so
 

6135
01:38:56,880 --> 01:38:58,550
effect in terms of social politics so
there's negative consequences in your

6136
01:38:58,550 --> 01:38:58,560
there's negative consequences in your
 

6137
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:00,290
there's negative consequences in your
view of that but

6138
01:39:00,290 --> 01:39:00,300
view of that but
 

6139
01:39:00,300 --> 01:39:02,270
view of that but
um is there also positive consequence of

6140
01:39:02,270 --> 01:39:02,280
um is there also positive consequence of
 

6141
01:39:02,280 --> 01:39:05,090
um is there also positive consequence of
more power uh more agency to the

6142
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:05,100
more power uh more agency to the
 

6143
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:06,770
more power uh more agency to the
individual I think that you can make the

6144
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:06,780
individual I think that you can make the
 

6145
01:39:06,780 --> 01:39:08,149
individual I think that you can make the
argument that institutions were weighing

6146
01:39:08,149 --> 01:39:08,159
argument that institutions were weighing
 

6147
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,350
argument that institutions were weighing
too heavily in how people form their

6148
01:39:09,350 --> 01:39:09,360
too heavily in how people form their
 

6149
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:11,330
too heavily in how people form their
identity but I think that what we've

6150
01:39:11,330 --> 01:39:11,340
identity but I think that what we've
 

6151
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:13,070
identity but I think that what we've
done has gone significantly too far on

6152
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:13,080
done has gone significantly too far on
 

6153
01:39:13,080 --> 01:39:14,330
done has gone significantly too far on
the other side we basically decided to

6154
01:39:14,330 --> 01:39:14,340
the other side we basically decided to
 

6155
01:39:14,340 --> 01:39:16,250
the other side we basically decided to
blow up the institutions in favor of

6156
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:16,260
blow up the institutions in favor of
 

6157
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:17,870
blow up the institutions in favor of
unfettered

6158
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:17,880
unfettered
 

6159
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:20,870
unfettered
feeling slash identity and I think that

6160
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
feeling slash identity and I think that
 

6161
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,430
feeling slash identity and I think that
that is not only a large mistake I think

6162
01:39:22,430 --> 01:39:22,440
that is not only a large mistake I think
 

6163
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:23,689
that is not only a large mistake I think
it's going to have Dior ramifications

6164
01:39:23,689 --> 01:39:23,699
it's going to have Dior ramifications
 

6165
01:39:23,699 --> 01:39:25,970
it's going to have Dior ramifications
for everything from suicidal ideation to

6166
01:39:25,970 --> 01:39:25,980
for everything from suicidal ideation to
 

6167
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:29,030
for everything from suicidal ideation to
institutional longevity in in politics

6168
01:39:29,030 --> 01:39:29,040
institutional longevity in in politics
 

6169
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,370
institutional longevity in in politics
and and in society more broadly So

6170
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:31,380
and and in society more broadly So
 

6171
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:33,470
and and in society more broadly So
speaking about the nature of self you've

6172
01:39:33,470 --> 01:39:33,480
speaking about the nature of self you've
 

6173
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:38,209
speaking about the nature of self you've
been an outspoken proponent of pro-life

6174
01:39:38,209 --> 01:39:38,219
been an outspoken proponent of pro-life
 

6175
01:39:38,219 --> 01:39:40,790
been an outspoken proponent of pro-life
um can you can we start by

6176
01:39:40,790 --> 01:39:40,800
um can you can we start by
 

6177
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:43,010
um can you can we start by
you trying to steal me on the case for

6178
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:43,020
you trying to steal me on the case for
 

6179
01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:45,770
you trying to steal me on the case for
pro-choice that abortion is not murder

6180
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:45,780
pro-choice that abortion is not murder
 

6181
01:39:45,780 --> 01:39:49,070
pro-choice that abortion is not murder
and uh a woman's right to choose is a

6182
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:49,080
and uh a woman's right to choose is a
 

6183
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,649
and uh a woman's right to choose is a
fundamental human right freedom so I

6184
01:39:51,649 --> 01:39:51,659
fundamental human right freedom so I
 

6185
01:39:51,659 --> 01:39:54,050
fundamental human right freedom so I
think that the the the only way to steal

6186
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:54,060
think that the the the only way to steal
 

6187
01:39:54,060 --> 01:39:56,689
think that the the the only way to steal
man the pro-choice case is to

6188
01:39:56,689 --> 01:39:56,699
man the pro-choice case is to
 

6189
01:39:56,699 --> 01:39:58,790
man the pro-choice case is to
and be ideologically consistent

6190
01:39:58,790 --> 01:39:58,800
and be ideologically consistent
 

6191
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,250
and be ideologically consistent
is to suggest that there is no interest

6192
01:40:01,250 --> 01:40:01,260
is to suggest that there is no interest
 

6193
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:04,970
is to suggest that there is no interest
in the life of The Unborn

6194
01:40:04,970 --> 01:40:04,980
in the life of The Unborn
 

6195
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,030
in the life of The Unborn
that counterweighs at all freedom of of

6196
01:40:08,030 --> 01:40:08,040
that counterweighs at all freedom of of
 

6197
01:40:08,040 --> 01:40:12,709
that counterweighs at all freedom of of
choice uh so the so what that means is

6198
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
choice uh so the so what that means is
 

6199
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,510
choice uh so the so what that means is
we can take the full example we can get

6200
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:14,520
we can take the full example we can get
 

6201
01:40:14,520 --> 01:40:15,950
we can take the full example we can get
sort of the partial example so if we

6202
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:15,960
sort of the partial example so if we
 

6203
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,030
sort of the partial example so if we
take the full example what that would

6204
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:17,040
take the full example what that would
 

6205
01:40:17,040 --> 01:40:18,110
take the full example what that would
mean is that up until point of birth

6206
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:18,120
mean is that up until point of birth
 

6207
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:19,310
mean is that up until point of birth
which is sort of the democratic party

6208
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:19,320
which is sort of the democratic party
 

6209
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:22,729
which is sort of the democratic party
platform position uh that there is that

6210
01:40:22,729 --> 01:40:22,739
platform position uh that there is that
 

6211
01:40:22,739 --> 01:40:23,990
platform position uh that there is that
a woman's right to choose ought to

6212
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
a woman's right to choose ought to
 

6213
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,790
a woman's right to choose ought to
extend for any reason whatsoever up to a

6214
01:40:25,790 --> 01:40:25,800
extend for any reason whatsoever up to a
 

6215
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:26,750
extend for any reason whatsoever up to a
point of birth the only way to argue

6216
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:26,760
point of birth the only way to argue
 

6217
01:40:26,760 --> 01:40:28,250
point of birth the only way to argue
that is that bodily autonomy is the only

6218
01:40:28,250 --> 01:40:28,260
that is that bodily autonomy is the only
 

6219
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,930
that is that bodily autonomy is the only
Factor there is no countervailing factor

6220
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:29,940
Factor there is no countervailing factor
 

6221
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,930
Factor there is no countervailing factor
that would ever outweigh bodily autonomy

6222
01:40:32,930 --> 01:40:32,940
that would ever outweigh bodily autonomy
 

6223
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,669
that would ever outweigh bodily autonomy
um that that would be the the strongest

6224
01:40:34,669 --> 01:40:34,679
um that that would be the the strongest
 

6225
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:36,470
um that that would be the the strongest
version of the argument another version

6226
01:40:36,470 --> 01:40:36,480
version of the argument another version
 

6227
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,090
version of the argument another version
of that argument would be that the

6228
01:40:38,090 --> 01:40:38,100
of that argument would be that the
 

6229
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:39,649
of that argument would be that the
reason that bodily autonomy ought to

6230
01:40:39,649 --> 01:40:39,659
reason that bodily autonomy ought to
 

6231
01:40:39,659 --> 01:40:42,530
reason that bodily autonomy ought to
weigh so heavily is because women can't

6232
01:40:42,530 --> 01:40:42,540
weigh so heavily is because women can't
 

6233
01:40:42,540 --> 01:40:46,370
weigh so heavily is because women can't
be the well the equals of men if the

01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:46,380
be the well the equals of men if the
 

6235
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:48,290
be the well the equals of men if the

if pregnancy changes women in a way that

6240
01:40:52,430 --> 01:40:52,440
if pregnancy changes women in a way that
 

6241
01:40:52,440 --> 01:40:53,629
if pregnancy changes women in a way that
it doesn't change men it's a form of sex

6242
01:40:53,629 --> 01:40:53,639
it doesn't change men it's a form of sex
 

6243
01:40:53,639 --> 01:40:55,430
it doesn't change men it's a form of sex
discrimination for women to ever have to

01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,440
discrimination for women to ever have to
 

6245
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:57,229
discrimination for women to ever have to
go through with pregnancy which is an

01:40:57,229 --> 01:40:57,239
go through with pregnancy which is an

6248
01:40:58,250 --> 01:40:58,260
argument that was made by Ruth Bader
 

6249
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,629

Ginsburg kind of

6250
01:40:59,629 --> 01:40:59,639
Ginsburg kind of
 

6251
01:40:59,639 --> 01:41:01,550
Ginsburg kind of
um those are the arguments the the kind

6252
01:41:01,550 --> 01:41:01,560
um those are the arguments the the kind
 

6253
01:41:01,560 --> 01:41:04,669
um those are the arguments the the kind
of softer version is the more I would

6254
01:41:04,669 --> 01:41:04,679
of softer version is the more I would
 

6255
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:07,070
of softer version is the more I would
say emotionally resonant version of the

6256
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:07,080
say emotionally resonant version of the
 

6257
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,649
say emotionally resonant version of the
argument which is that bodily autonomy

6258
01:41:09,649 --> 01:41:09,659
argument which is that bodily autonomy
 

6259
01:41:09,659 --> 01:41:12,110
argument which is that bodily autonomy
ought to outweigh the interests of the

6260
01:41:12,110 --> 01:41:12,120
ought to outweigh the interests of the

01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:14,400
fetus up till point x and then people
 

6263
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:15,470
fetus up till point x and then people
have different feelings about what point

6264
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:15,480
have different feelings about what point
 

6265
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:16,729
have different feelings about what point
x looks like is it up to the point of

01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:16,739
x looks like is it up to the point of
 

6267
01:41:16,739 --> 01:41:17,810
x looks like is it up to the point of
viability is it up to the point of the

01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:17,820
viability is it up to the point of the

01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,129

01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:28,910

6291
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,570
until 12 or 15 weeks there's not enough
there for to not be specific but to be

6292
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:38,580
there for to not be specific but to be
 

6293
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,070
there for to not be specific but to be
kind of how people feel about it to

6294
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:40,080
kind of how people feel about it to
 

6295
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,010
kind of how people feel about it to
outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy and

6296
01:41:43,010 --> 01:41:43,020
outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy and
 

6297
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:44,930
outweigh a woman's bodily autonomy and
then beyond that point then there's

6298
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:44,940
then beyond that point then there's
 

6299
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:47,330
then beyond that point then there's
enough of an interest in the life of the

6300
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:47,340
enough of an interest in the life of the
 

6301
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:49,609
enough of an interest in the life of the
pre-born child uh it's developed enough

6302
01:41:49,609 --> 01:41:49,619
pre-born child uh it's developed enough
 

6303
01:41:49,619 --> 01:41:51,109
pre-born child uh it's developed enough
then now we care about it enough that it

6304
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
then now we care about it enough that it
 

6305
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,609
then now we care about it enough that it
outweighs a woman's bodily autonomy

6306
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:52,619
outweighs a woman's bodily autonomy
 

6307
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:56,030
outweighs a woman's bodily autonomy
what's the strongest case for pro-life

6308
01:41:56,030 --> 01:41:56,040
what's the strongest case for pro-life
 

6309
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:57,830
what's the strongest case for pro-life
in your mind I mean the strongest case

6310
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:57,840
in your mind I mean the strongest case
 

6311
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,129
in your mind I mean the strongest case
for pro-life is that from conception a

6312
01:42:01,129 --> 01:42:01,139
for pro-life is that from conception a
 

6313
01:42:01,139 --> 01:42:02,930
for pro-life is that from conception a
human life has been created it is a

6314
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:02,940
human life has been created it is a
 

6315
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,729
human life has been created it is a
human life with potential that human

6316
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:04,739
human life with potential that human
 

6317
01:42:04,739 --> 01:42:07,609
human life with potential that human
life potential with potential now has an

6318
01:42:07,609 --> 01:42:07,619
life potential with potential now has an
 

6319
01:42:07,619 --> 01:42:09,169
life potential with potential now has an
independent interest in its own

6320
01:42:09,169 --> 01:42:09,179
independent interest in its own
 

6321
01:42:09,179 --> 01:42:12,050
independent interest in its own
existence if I may just uh ask a good

existence if I may just uh ask a good
 

6323
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:15,109

question so conception is when a sperm

6324
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
question so conception is when a sperm
 

6325
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,209
question so conception is when a sperm
fertilizes an egg yes

of its interest in life one of the big

6416
01:43:41,270 --> 01:43:41,280
of its interest in life one of the big
 

6417
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,250
of its interest in life one of the big
problems in trying to draw any line for

6418
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:43,260
problems in trying to draw any line for
 

6419
01:43:43,260 --> 01:43:47,090
problems in trying to draw any line for

the self-interest of life in the in the
 

6421
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:49,609
the self-interest of life in the in the
human life is that it's very difficult

6422
01:43:49,609 --> 01:43:49,619
human life is that it's very difficult
 

6423
01:43:49,619 --> 01:43:51,050
human life is that it's very difficult
to draw any other line that doesn't seem

6424
01:43:51,050 --> 01:43:51,060

01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,790

somewhat arbitrary if you say that

6426
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:52,800
somewhat arbitrary if you say that

01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:55,609
somewhat arbitrary if you say that
independent heartbeat yeah well you know

6428
01:43:55,609 --> 01:43:55,619
independent heartbeat yeah well you know
 

6429
01:43:55,619 --> 01:43:57,709
independent heartbeat yeah well you know
people have pacemakers if you say brain

6430
01:43:57,709 --> 01:43:57,719
people have pacemakers if you say brain
 

6431
01:43:57,719 --> 01:43:59,450
people have pacemakers if you say brain
function people have various levels of

6432
01:43:59,450 --> 01:43:59,460
function people have various levels of
 

6433
01:43:59,460 --> 01:44:01,490
function people have various levels of
brain function as adults if you say

6434
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:01,500
brain function as adults if you say

01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:03,229
brain function as adults if you say
viability babies are not viable after

6436
01:44:03,229 --> 01:44:03,239
viability babies are not viable after
 

6437
01:44:03,239 --> 01:44:05,030
viability babies are not viable after
they are born if I left a newborn baby

6438
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:05,040
they are born if I left a newborn baby
 

6439
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:06,470
they are born if I left a newborn baby
on a table and did not take care of it

6440
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:06,480
on a table and did not take care of it
 

6441
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,330
on a table and did not take care of it
it would be dead in two days so you know

6442
01:44:08,330 --> 01:44:08,340
it would be dead in two days so you know
 

6443
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:09,709
it would be dead in two days so you know
when once you start getting into sort of

6444
01:44:09,709 --> 01:44:09,719
when once you start getting into sort of
 

6445
01:44:09,719 --> 01:44:11,689
when once you start getting into sort of
these lines it starts to get very fuzzy

6446
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:11,699
these lines it starts to get very fuzzy
 

6447
01:44:11,699 --> 01:44:14,270
these lines it starts to get very fuzzy
very quickly and so if you're looking

6448
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:14,280
very quickly and so if you're looking
 

6449
01:44:14,280 --> 01:44:16,669
very quickly and so if you're looking
for sort of a bright line moral rule

6450
01:44:16,669 --> 01:44:16,679
for sort of a bright line moral rule
 

6451
01:44:16,679 --> 01:44:18,229
for sort of a bright line moral rule
that would be the brightline moral rule

6452
01:44:18,229 --> 01:44:18,239
that would be the brightline moral rule
 

6453
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:19,310
that would be the brightline moral rule
that's that's sort of the pro-life case

6454
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:19,320
that's that's sort of the pro-life case
 

6455
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,830
that's that's sort of the pro-life case
well there's still mysterious difficult

6456
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
well there's still mysterious difficult
 

6457
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:24,109
well there's still mysterious difficult
scientific questions of things like

6458
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:24,119
scientific questions of things like
 

6459
01:44:24,119 --> 01:44:25,490
scientific questions of things like
consciousness

6460
01:44:25,490 --> 01:44:25,500
consciousness
 

6461
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:28,669
consciousness
so what do you does the question of

6462
01:44:28,669 --> 01:44:28,679
so what do you does the question of
 

6463
01:44:28,679 --> 01:44:29,930
so what do you does the question of
consciousness

6464
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:29,940
consciousness
 

6465
01:44:29,940 --> 01:44:32,629
consciousness
how does it come into play into this

6466
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
how does it come into play into this
 

6467
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:34,609
how does it come into play into this
debate so I don't believe that

6468
01:44:34,609 --> 01:44:34,619
debate so I don't believe that
 

6469
01:44:34,619 --> 01:44:36,530
debate so I don't believe that
Consciousness is the

6470
01:44:36,530 --> 01:44:36,540
Consciousness is the
 

6471
01:44:36,540 --> 01:44:38,870
Consciousness is the
sole Criterion by which we judge the

6472
01:44:38,870 --> 01:44:38,880
sole Criterion by which we judge the
 

6473
01:44:38,880 --> 01:44:40,850
sole Criterion by which we judge the
self-interest in human life

6474
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:40,860
self-interest in human life
 

6475
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,350
self-interest in human life
so

6476
01:44:42,350 --> 01:44:42,360
so
 

6477
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:43,850
so
we are unconscious a good deal of Our

6478
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:43,860
we are unconscious a good deal of Our
 

6479
01:44:43,860 --> 01:44:44,750
we are unconscious a good deal of Our
Lives

6480
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:44,760
Lives
 

6481
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,490
Lives
right that does not we will be conscious

6482
01:44:46,490 --> 01:44:46,500
right that does not we will be conscious
 

6483
01:44:46,500 --> 01:44:48,709
right that does not we will be conscious
again right when when you're unconscious

6484
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:48,719
again right when when you're unconscious
 

6485
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:50,570
again right when when you're unconscious
when you're asleep for example

6486
01:44:50,570 --> 01:44:50,580
when you're asleep for example
 

6487
01:44:50,580 --> 01:44:52,010
when you're asleep for example
presumably your life is still worth

6488
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:52,020
presumably your life is still worth
 

6489
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:53,330
presumably your life is still worth
living if somebody came in and killed

6490
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:53,340
living if somebody came in and killed
 

6491
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,550
living if somebody came in and killed
you that'd be a serious moral quandary

6492
01:44:55,550 --> 01:44:55,560
you that'd be a serious moral quandary
 

6493
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,470
you that'd be a serious moral quandary
at the very least but the birth of

6494
01:44:57,470 --> 01:44:57,480
at the very least but the birth of
 

6495
01:44:57,480 --> 01:45:00,770
at the very least but the birth of
Consciousness the the lighting up of the

6496
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:00,780
Consciousness the the lighting up of the
 

6497
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,570
Consciousness the the lighting up of the
flame the initial lighting of the flame

6498
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:02,580
flame the initial lighting of the flame
 

6499
01:45:02,580 --> 01:45:04,430
flame the initial lighting of the flame
there does seem to be something special

6500
01:45:04,430 --> 01:45:04,440
there does seem to be something special
 

6501
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,609
there does seem to be something special
about that and it's a it's a mystery of

6502
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:07,619
about that and it's a it's a mystery of
 

6503
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:09,410
about that and it's a it's a mystery of
when that happens well I mean Peter

6504
01:45:09,410 --> 01:45:09,420
when that happens well I mean Peter
 

6505
01:45:09,420 --> 01:45:10,550
when that happens well I mean Peter
Singer makes the case that basically

6506
01:45:10,550 --> 01:45:10,560
Singer makes the case that basically
 

6507
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:11,990
Singer makes the case that basically
self-consciousness doesn't exist until

6508
01:45:11,990 --> 01:45:12,000
self-consciousness doesn't exist until
 

6509
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,209
self-consciousness doesn't exist until
you're two and a half right so he says

6510
01:45:14,209 --> 01:45:14,219
you're two and a half right so he says
 

6511
01:45:14,219 --> 01:45:15,770
you're two and a half right so he says
that even infanticide should be okay or

6512
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:15,780
that even infanticide should be okay or
 

6513
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:18,109
that even infanticide should be okay or
is it the bioethicist over Princeton so

6514
01:45:18,109 --> 01:45:18,119
is it the bioethicist over Princeton so
 

6515
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:19,970
is it the bioethicist over Princeton so
you're getting some real dicey territory

6516
01:45:19,970 --> 01:45:19,980
you're getting some real dicey territory
 

6517
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:21,350
you're getting some real dicey territory
once you get into Consciousness also the

6518
01:45:21,350 --> 01:45:21,360
once you get into Consciousness also the
 

6519
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:22,910
once you get into Consciousness also the
truth is the Consciousness is more of a

6520
01:45:22,910 --> 01:45:22,920
truth is the Consciousness is more of a
 

6521
01:45:22,920 --> 01:45:25,010
truth is the Consciousness is more of a
spectrum than it is a than it is a a

6522
01:45:25,010 --> 01:45:25,020
spectrum than it is a than it is a a
 

6523
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:27,770
spectrum than it is a than it is a a
dividing line meaning that there are

6524
01:45:27,770 --> 01:45:27,780
dividing line meaning that there are
 

6525
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:29,689
dividing line meaning that there are
people with various degrees of brain

6526
01:45:29,689 --> 01:45:29,699
people with various degrees of brain
 

6527
01:45:29,699 --> 01:45:31,129
people with various degrees of brain
function we don't actually know how

6528
01:45:31,129 --> 01:45:31,139
function we don't actually know how
 

6529
01:45:31,139 --> 01:45:32,689
function we don't actually know how
conscious they are and you can get into

6530
01:45:32,689 --> 01:45:32,699
conscious they are and you can get into
 

6531
01:45:32,699 --> 01:45:35,450
conscious they are and you can get into
eugenic territory pretty quickly when we

6532
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:35,460
eugenic territory pretty quickly when we
 

6533
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:36,890
eugenic territory pretty quickly when we
start dividing between lives that are

6534
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:36,900
start dividing between lives that are
 

6535
01:45:36,900 --> 01:45:38,030
start dividing between lives that are
worth living based on levels of

6536
01:45:38,030 --> 01:45:38,040
worth living based on levels of
 

6537
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:39,169
worth living based on levels of

human beings have procreated for

human beings have procreated for
literally all of human existence and by

literally all of human existence and by

01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:16,669
literally all of human existence and by
the way also how all mammals procreate

01:46:25,739 --> 01:46:27,470
that particular situation because you
could have made decisions that would not

01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:29,760
LED you to this particular impasse in
 

6585
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,770
LED you to this particular impasse in
fact this used to be the basis of

6586
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:30,780
fact this used to be the basis of

01:46:30,780 --> 01:46:32,990
fact this used to be the basis of
marriage right was when when we were a

they get married to have sex a position

6594
01:46:38,870 --> 01:46:38,880
they get married to have sex a position
 

6595
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:41,030
they get married to have sex a position
that I still hold and the reason for

6596
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
that I still hold and the reason for
 

6597
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,590
that I still hold and the reason for
that was because then if you have sex

6598
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:42,600
that was because then if you have sex
 

6599
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:43,970
that was because then if you have sex
and you produce a child then the child

6600
01:46:43,970 --> 01:46:43,980
and you produce a child then the child
 

6601
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:45,470
and you produce a child then the child
will grow up in a two-parent family with

6602
01:46:45,470 --> 01:46:45,480
will grow up in a two-parent family with
 

6603
01:46:45,480 --> 01:46:48,350
will grow up in a two-parent family with
stability so you know they they not not

6604
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:48,360
stability so you know they they not not
 

6605
01:46:48,360 --> 01:46:49,729
stability so you know they they not not
a ton of sympathy there when it comes to

sympathy and so that's why I think you
see statistically speaking a huge

arguing from the fringes this tends to
 

6627
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,109
arguing from the fringes this tends to
happen is pro-choice activists will

that you actually have to take on sort

6640
01:47:19,490 --> 01:47:19,500
that you actually have to take on sort
 

6641
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,930
that you actually have to take on sort
of the mainstream case and then decide

6642
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:20,940
of the mainstream case and then decide
 

6643
01:47:20,940 --> 01:47:22,310
of the mainstream case and then decide
whether or not that's acceptable or not

6644
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:22,320
whether or not that's acceptable or not
 

6645
01:47:22,320 --> 01:47:24,350
whether or not that's acceptable or not
but to you the exception just ethically

6646
01:47:24,350 --> 01:47:24,360
but to you the exception just ethically
 

6647
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:26,870
but to you the exception just ethically
without generalizing it

6648
01:47:26,870 --> 01:47:26,880
without generalizing it
 

6649
01:47:26,880 --> 01:47:29,810
without generalizing it
um that is a valid ethically exception I

6650
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:29,820
um that is a valid ethically exception I
 

6651
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,850
um that is a valid ethically exception I
I don't hope that there should be a an

6652
01:47:31,850 --> 01:47:31,860
I don't hope that there should be a an
 

6653
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,169
I don't hope that there should be a an

again I hold by the bright line rule

6656
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:34,500
again I hold by the bright line rule
 

6657
01:47:34,500 --> 01:47:35,810
again I hold by the bright line rule
that wants a human life with potential

6658
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:35,820
that wants a human life with potential
 

6659
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:37,729
that wants a human life with potential
exists then it has its own interest in

01:47:37,729 --> 01:47:37,739
exists then it has its own interest in
 

6661
01:47:37,739 --> 01:47:40,910
exists then it has its own interest in
life that cannot be curbed by your

01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:40,920
life that cannot be curbed by your
 

6663
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:42,530
life that cannot be curbed by your
self-interest

01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:42,540
self-interest
 

6665
01:47:42,540 --> 01:47:44,450
self-interest
um the the only exception that I hold by

6666
01:47:44,450 --> 01:47:44,460
um the the only exception that I hold by
 

6667
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:46,129
um the the only exception that I hold by
is the same exception that literally all

6668
01:47:46,129 --> 01:47:46,139
is the same exception that literally all
 

6669
01:47:46,139 --> 01:47:47,330
is the same exception that literally all
of her life is hold by which is the life

6670
01:47:47,330 --> 01:47:47,340
of her life is hold by which is the life
 

6671
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,070
of her life is hold by which is the life
of the mother is put in danger such a

6672
01:47:49,070 --> 01:47:49,080
of the mother is put in danger such a
 

6673
01:47:49,080 --> 01:47:51,169
of the mother is put in danger such a
tough tough topic because if you believe

6674
01:47:51,169 --> 01:47:51,179
tough tough topic because if you believe
 

6675
01:47:51,179 --> 01:47:53,510
tough tough topic because if you believe
that that's the line then we're

6676
01:47:53,510 --> 01:47:53,520
that that's the line then we're
 

6677
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:55,129
that that's the line then we're
committing mass murder

6678
01:47:55,129 --> 01:47:55,139
committing mass murder
 

6679
01:47:55,139 --> 01:47:57,229
committing mass murder
well or at least Mass killing so I would

6680
01:47:57,229 --> 01:47:57,239
well or at least Mass killing so I would
 

6681
01:47:57,239 --> 01:47:59,689
well or at least Mass killing so I would
say that murder typically requires a

6682
01:47:59,689 --> 01:47:59,699
say that murder typically requires a
 

6683
01:47:59,699 --> 01:48:02,330
say that murder typically requires a
level of mens rea that may be absent in

6684
01:48:02,330 --> 01:48:02,340
level of mens rea that may be absent in
 

6685
01:48:02,340 --> 01:48:03,950
level of mens rea that may be absent in
many cases of abortion right this is

6686
01:48:03,950 --> 01:48:03,960
many cases of abortion right this is
 

6687
01:48:03,960 --> 01:48:05,209
many cases of abortion right this is
because the usual follow-on question is

6688
01:48:05,209 --> 01:48:05,219
because the usual follow-on question is
 

6689
01:48:05,219 --> 01:48:06,290
because the usual follow-on question is
we'll have to murder why not prosecute

6690
01:48:06,290 --> 01:48:06,300
we'll have to murder why not prosecute
 

6691
01:48:06,300 --> 01:48:08,270
we'll have to murder why not prosecute
the woman and the answer is because the

6692
01:48:08,270 --> 01:48:08,280
the woman and the answer is because the
 

6693
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,770
the woman and the answer is because the
vast majority of people who are who are

01:48:09,770 --> 01:48:09,780
vast majority of people who are who are
 

6695
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:11,149
vast majority of people who are who are
having abortions don't actually believe

6696
01:48:11,149 --> 01:48:11,159
having abortions don't actually believe
 

6697
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:12,649
having abortions don't actually believe
that they're killing a person

6698
01:48:12,649 --> 01:48:12,659
that they're killing a person
 

6699
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:15,470
that they're killing a person
they they have a very different view of

6700
01:48:15,470 --> 01:48:15,480
they they have a very different view of
 

6701
01:48:15,480 --> 01:48:18,169
they they have a very different view of
what is exactly happening so you know I

6702
01:48:18,169 --> 01:48:18,179
what is exactly happening so you know I
 

6703
01:48:18,179 --> 01:48:20,030
what is exactly happening so you know I
would say that there are all sorts of

6704
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:20,040
would say that there are all sorts of
 

6705
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:21,350
would say that there are all sorts of
interesting hypotheticals that come in

6706
01:48:21,350 --> 01:48:21,360
interesting hypotheticals that come in
 

6707
01:48:21,360 --> 01:48:23,930
interesting hypotheticals that come in
to play when it comes to abortion and uh

6708
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:23,940
to play when it comes to abortion and uh
 

6709
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,209
to play when it comes to abortion and uh
you can play them any which way

6710
01:48:26,209 --> 01:48:26,219
you can play them any which way
 

6711
01:48:26,219 --> 01:48:27,410
you can play them any which way
um but

6712
01:48:27,410 --> 01:48:27,420
um but
 

6713
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:29,270
um but
levels it let's put it this way there

6714
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:29,280
levels it let's put it this way there
 

6715
01:48:29,280 --> 01:48:30,890
levels it let's put it this way there
are gradations of wrongs I don't think

6716
01:48:30,890 --> 01:48:30,900
are gradations of wrongs I don't think
 

6717
01:48:30,900 --> 01:48:33,129
are gradations of wrongs I don't think
that all abortions are equally

6718
01:48:33,129 --> 01:48:33,139
that all abortions are equally
 

6719
01:48:33,139 --> 01:48:35,750
that all abortions are equally
blameworthy even if I would even if I

6720
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:35,760
blameworthy even if I would even if I
 

6721
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,189
blameworthy even if I would even if I
would ban

6722
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:37,199
would ban
 

6723
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,709
would ban
virtually all of them right okay I think

6724
01:48:39,709 --> 01:48:39,719
virtually all of them right okay I think
 

6725
01:48:39,719 --> 01:48:41,390
virtually all of them right okay I think
that they're mitigating circumstances

6726
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:41,400
that they're mitigating circumstances
 

6727
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:44,330
that they're mitigating circumstances
that make while being wrong some

6728
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:44,340
that make while being wrong some
 

6729
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:46,669
that make while being wrong some
abortions less morally blameworthy than

6730
01:48:46,669 --> 01:48:46,679
abortions less morally blameworthy than
 

6731
01:48:46,679 --> 01:48:48,709
abortions less morally blameworthy than
others I think that you know there there

6732
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
others I think that you know there there
 

6733
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,550
others I think that you know there there
is a I can admit a difference between

6734
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:51,560
is a I can admit a difference between
 

6735
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,250
is a I can admit a difference between
killing a a two-week-old embryo in the

6736
01:48:55,250 --> 01:48:55,260
killing a a two-week-old embryo in the
 

6737
01:48:55,260 --> 01:48:56,810
killing a a two-week-old embryo in the
womb and stabbing a seven year old in

6738
01:48:56,810 --> 01:48:56,820
womb and stabbing a seven year old in
 

6739
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:58,189
womb and stabbing a seven year old in
the face like I can I can recognize all

6740
01:48:58,189 --> 01:48:58,199
the face like I can I can recognize all
 

6741
01:48:58,199 --> 01:48:59,270
the face like I can I can recognize all
that while still saying I think that it

6742
01:48:59,270 --> 01:48:59,280
that while still saying I think that it
 

6743
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:00,229
that while still saying I think that it
would be wrong to terminate a pregnancy

6744
01:49:00,229 --> 01:49:00,239
would be wrong to terminate a pregnancy
 

6745
01:49:00,239 --> 01:49:02,390
would be wrong to terminate a pregnancy
do you think the question of One Life

6746
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:02,400
do you think the question of One Life
 

6747
01:49:02,400 --> 01:49:04,010
do you think the question of One Life
Begins which I think is a fascinating

6748
01:49:04,010 --> 01:49:04,020
Begins which I think is a fascinating
 

6749
01:49:04,020 --> 01:49:05,810
Begins which I think is a fascinating
question

6750
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:05,820
question
 

6751
01:49:05,820 --> 01:49:07,430
question
um is the question of science or a

6752
01:49:07,430 --> 01:49:07,440
um is the question of science or a
 

6753
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:08,810
um is the question of science or a
question of religion I mean One Life

6754
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:08,820
question of religion I mean One Life
 

6755
01:49:08,820 --> 01:49:10,550
question of religion I mean One Life
Begins it's a question of science when

6756
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:10,560
Begins it's a question of science when
 

6757
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:12,350
Begins it's a question of science when
when that life becomes valuable enough

6758
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:12,360
when that life becomes valuable enough
 

6759
01:49:12,360 --> 01:49:14,570
when that life becomes valuable enough
for people to want to protect it uh is

6760
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:14,580
for people to want to protect it uh is
 

6761
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:16,729
for people to want to protect it uh is
is going to be a question that is beyond

6762
01:49:16,729 --> 01:49:16,739
is going to be a question that is beyond
 

6763
01:49:16,739 --> 01:49:18,290
is going to be a question that is beyond
science science doesn't have moral

6764
01:49:18,290 --> 01:49:18,300
science science doesn't have moral
 

6765
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:19,490
science science doesn't have moral
judgments to make about the value of

6766
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:19,500
judgments to make about the value of
 

6767
01:49:19,500 --> 01:49:20,870
judgments to make about the value of
human life this is one of the problems

6768
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:20,880
human life this is one of the problems
 

6769
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:22,310
human life this is one of the problems
that Sam Harris and I have had this

6770
01:49:22,310 --> 01:49:22,320
that Sam Harris and I have had this
 

6771
01:49:22,320 --> 01:49:23,629
that Sam Harris and I have had this
argument many times and it's always kind

6772
01:49:23,629 --> 01:49:23,639
argument many times and it's always kind
 

6773
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:25,669
argument many times and it's always kind
of interesting you know because Sam is

6774
01:49:25,669 --> 01:49:25,679
of interesting you know because Sam is
 

6775
01:49:25,679 --> 01:49:27,109
of interesting you know because Sam is
of the opinion that you can get to Art

6776
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
of the opinion that you can get to Art
 

6777
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:29,149
of the opinion that you can get to Art
From his right that science says is

6778
01:49:29,149 --> 01:49:29,159
From his right that science says is
 

6779
01:49:29,159 --> 01:49:30,709
From his right that science says is
therefore we can learn odd so human

6780
01:49:30,709 --> 01:49:30,719
therefore we can learn odd so human
 

6781
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:33,290
therefore we can learn odd so human
flourishing is the goal of life and I

6782
01:49:33,290 --> 01:49:33,300
flourishing is the goal of life and I
 

6783
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:34,490
flourishing is the goal of life and I
always say to him I don't see where you

6784
01:49:34,490 --> 01:49:34,500
always say to him I don't see where you
 

6785
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,830
always say to him I don't see where you
get that from evolutionary biology yeah

6786
01:49:36,830 --> 01:49:36,840
get that from evolutionary biology yeah
 

6787
01:49:36,840 --> 01:49:38,330
get that from evolutionary biology yeah
you can you can you can assume it just

6788
01:49:38,330 --> 01:49:38,340
you can you can you can assume it just
 

6789
01:49:38,340 --> 01:49:39,890
you can you can you can assume it just
say you're assuming it but don't pretend

6790
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:39,900
say you're assuming it but don't pretend
 

6791
01:49:39,900 --> 01:49:41,870
say you're assuming it but don't pretend
that that is a conclusion that you can

6792
01:49:41,870 --> 01:49:41,880
that that is a conclusion that you can
 

6793
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:43,510
that that is a conclusion that you can
draw straight from

6794
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,520
draw straight from
 

6795
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:46,250
draw straight from
biological reality itself because

6796
01:49:46,250 --> 01:49:46,260
biological reality itself because
 

6797
01:49:46,260 --> 01:49:47,390
biological reality itself because
obviously that doesn't exist in the

6798
01:49:47,390 --> 01:49:47,400
obviously that doesn't exist in the
 

6799
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:49,129
obviously that doesn't exist in the
animal world for example nobody assumes

6800
01:49:49,129 --> 01:49:49,139
animal world for example nobody assumes
 

6801
01:49:49,139 --> 01:49:51,350
animal world for example nobody assumes
the innate value of every ant

6802
01:49:51,350 --> 01:49:51,360
the innate value of every ant
 

6803
01:49:51,360 --> 01:49:53,270
the innate value of every ant
I think I know your answer to this but

6804
01:49:53,270 --> 01:49:53,280
I think I know your answer to this but
 

6805
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,890
I think I know your answer to this but
let's let's test it because I think you

6806
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:54,900
let's let's test it because I think you
 

6807
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:57,530
let's let's test it because I think you
you're going to be wrong so there's a

6808
01:49:57,530 --> 01:49:57,540
you're going to be wrong so there's a
 

6809
01:49:57,540 --> 01:49:59,750
you're going to be wrong so there's a
robot behind you do you think there will

6810
01:49:59,750 --> 01:49:59,760
robot behind you do you think there will
 

6811
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,629
robot behind you do you think there will
be a time in the future when it will be

6812
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
be a time in the future when it will be
 

6813
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:05,390
be a time in the future when it will be
unethical and illegal to kill a robot

6814
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:05,400
unethical and illegal to kill a robot
 

6815
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,270
unethical and illegal to kill a robot
because they will have sentience

6816
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:08,280
because they will have sentience
 

6817
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:11,810
because they will have sentience
my guess is you would say no Lex there's

6818
01:50:11,810 --> 01:50:11,820
my guess is you would say no Lex there's
 

6819
01:50:11,820 --> 01:50:13,310
my guess is you would say no Lex there's
because there's a fundamental difference

6820
01:50:13,310 --> 01:50:13,320
because there's a fundamental difference
 

6821
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,470
because there's a fundamental difference
between humans and robots and I just

6822
01:50:15,470 --> 01:50:15,480
between humans and robots and I just
 

6823
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,729
between humans and robots and I just
want to get you on record because I

6824
01:50:16,729 --> 01:50:16,739
want to get you on record because I
 

6825
01:50:16,739 --> 01:50:17,990
want to get you on record because I
think you'll be wrong

6826
01:50:17,990 --> 01:50:18,000
think you'll be wrong
 

6827
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,910
think you'll be wrong
um I mean it depends on the level of

6828
01:50:19,910 --> 01:50:19,920
um I mean it depends on the level of
 

6829
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:21,890
um I mean it depends on the level of
development I would assume of of the

6830
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:21,900
development I would assume of of the
 

6831
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:23,570
development I would assume of of the
robots I mean you're assuming a

6832
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:23,580
robots I mean you're assuming a
 

6833
01:50:23,580 --> 01:50:25,669
robots I mean you're assuming a
complexity in the robots that that

6834
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
complexity in the robots that that
 

6835
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,950
complexity in the robots that that
eventually imitates what we in the

6836
01:50:27,950 --> 01:50:27,960
eventually imitates what we in the
 

6837
01:50:27,960 --> 01:50:29,090
eventually imitates what we in the
religious life would call the human soul

6838
01:50:29,090 --> 01:50:29,100
religious life would call the human soul
 

6839
01:50:29,100 --> 01:50:31,370
religious life would call the human soul
yes the ability to choose freely for

6840
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:31,380
yes the ability to choose freely for
 

6841
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:32,750
yes the ability to choose freely for
example yes which I believe is sort of

6842
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:32,760
example yes which I believe is sort of
 

6843
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:35,930
example yes which I believe is sort of
the capacity for uh for human beings the

6844
01:50:35,930 --> 01:50:35,940
the capacity for uh for human beings the
 

6845
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:38,810
the capacity for uh for human beings the
ability to suffer yeah if if all of that

6846
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:38,820
ability to suffer yeah if if all of that
 

6847
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,430
ability to suffer yeah if if all of that
could

6848
01:50:40,430 --> 01:50:40,440
could
 

6849
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:42,290
could
be

6850
01:50:42,290 --> 01:50:42,300
be

01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:45,649
be
approved and not programmed meaning the

6853
01:50:45,659 --> 01:50:48,229
approved and not programmed meaning the
freely willed capacity of a machine to

freely willed capacity of a machine to
 

6855
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:49,129

do

6856
01:50:49,129 --> 01:50:49,139
do
 

6857
01:50:49,139 --> 01:50:51,410
do
X Y or Z you could you could not

6858
01:50:51,410 --> 01:50:51,420
X Y or Z you could you could not
 

6859
01:50:51,420 --> 01:50:53,570
X Y or Z you could you could not
pinpoint exactly where it happens in the

6860
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:53,580
pinpoint exactly where it happens in the
 

6861
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:55,729
pinpoint exactly where it happens in the
program right yeah it's not

6862
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:55,739
program right yeah it's not
 

6863
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:57,590
program right yeah it's not
deterministic yeah

6864
01:50:57,590 --> 01:50:57,600
deterministic yeah
 

6865
01:50:57,600 --> 01:50:59,450
deterministic yeah
um then it would raise serious moral

6866
01:50:59,450 --> 01:50:59,460
um then it would raise serious moral
 

6867
01:50:59,460 --> 01:51:01,430
um then it would raise serious moral
issues for sure I'm not trying to answer

6868
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:01,440
issues for sure I'm not trying to answer
 

6869
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,930
issues for sure I'm not trying to answer
that question are you afraid of that

6870
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:02,940
that question are you afraid of that
 

6871
01:51:02,940 --> 01:51:04,609
that question are you afraid of that
time I'm not sure I'm afraid of that

6872
01:51:04,609 --> 01:51:04,619
time I'm not sure I'm afraid of that
 

6873
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:06,590
time I'm not sure I'm afraid of that
time I mean it's

6874
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:06,600
time I mean it's
 

6875
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:08,270
time I mean it's
any more than I'd be afraid if aliens

6876
01:51:08,270 --> 01:51:08,280
any more than I'd be afraid if aliens
 

6877
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:10,609
any more than I'd be afraid if aliens
arrived on in in the world and had these

6878
01:51:10,609 --> 01:51:10,619
arrived on in in the world and had these
 

6879
01:51:10,619 --> 01:51:12,050
arrived on in in the world and had these
characteristics well there's just a lot

6880
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:12,060
characteristics well there's just a lot
 

6881
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:13,370
characteristics well there's just a lot
of moral complexities and they don't

6882
01:51:13,370 --> 01:51:13,380
of moral complexities and they don't
 

6883
01:51:13,380 --> 01:51:14,450
of moral complexities and they don't
necessarily have to be in the physical

6884
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:14,460
necessarily have to be in the physical
 

6885
01:51:14,460 --> 01:51:16,010
necessarily have to be in the physical
space they could be in the digital space

6886
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:16,020
space they could be in the digital space
 

6887
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:18,470
space they could be in the digital space
uh there's an increased sophistication

6888
01:51:18,470 --> 01:51:18,480
uh there's an increased sophistication
 

6889
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:20,270
uh there's an increased sophistication
and number of bots on the internet

6890
01:51:20,270 --> 01:51:20,280
and number of bots on the internet
 

6891
01:51:20,280 --> 01:51:23,330
and number of bots on the internet
including on Twitter uh as they become

6892
01:51:23,330 --> 01:51:23,340
including on Twitter uh as they become
 

6893
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:24,709
including on Twitter uh as they become
more and more intelligent there's going

6894
01:51:24,709 --> 01:51:24,719
more and more intelligent there's going
 

6895
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:26,990
more and more intelligent there's going
to be serious questions about what is

6896
01:51:26,990 --> 01:51:27,000
to be serious questions about what is
 

6897
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,930
to be serious questions about what is
our moral duty to protect ones that have

6898
01:51:29,930 --> 01:51:29,940
our moral duty to protect ones that have
 

6899
01:51:29,940 --> 01:51:32,810
our moral duty to protect ones that have
or claimed to have an identity and

6900
01:51:32,810 --> 01:51:32,820
or claimed to have an identity and
 

6901
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:33,890
or claimed to have an identity and
that'll be really interesting actually

6902
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:33,900
that'll be really interesting actually
 

6903
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:35,209
that'll be really interesting actually
what I'm afraid of is the opposite

6904
01:51:35,209 --> 01:51:35,219
what I'm afraid of is the opposite
 

6905
01:51:35,219 --> 01:51:37,729
what I'm afraid of is the opposite
happening meaning that people the word

6906
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:37,739
happening meaning that people the word
 

6907
01:51:37,739 --> 01:51:39,169
happening meaning that people the word
the worst that should happen is that we

6908
01:51:39,169 --> 01:51:39,179
the worst that should happen is that we
 

6909
01:51:39,179 --> 01:51:40,669
the worst that should happen is that we
develop robots So Sophisticated that

6910
01:51:40,669 --> 01:51:40,679
develop robots So Sophisticated that
 

6911
01:51:40,679 --> 01:51:41,990
develop robots So Sophisticated that
they appear to have free will and then

6912
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,000
they appear to have free will and then
 

6913
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,450
they appear to have free will and then
we treat them with human dignity that

6914
01:51:44,450 --> 01:51:44,460
we treat them with human dignity that
 

6915
01:51:44,460 --> 01:51:45,470
we treat them with human dignity that
should be the worst that happens what

6916
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:45,480
should be the worst that happens what
 

6917
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:46,850
should be the worst that happens what
I'm afraid of is the opposite is that

6918
01:51:46,850 --> 01:51:46,860
I'm afraid of is the opposite is that
 

6919
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:49,250
I'm afraid of is the opposite is that
that we if if we're talking about this

6920
01:51:49,250 --> 01:51:49,260
that we if if we're talking about this
 

6921
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:50,689
that we if if we're talking about this
particular hypothetical that we develop

6922
01:51:50,689 --> 01:51:50,699
particular hypothetical that we develop
 

6923
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:52,370
particular hypothetical that we develop
robots that have all of these apparent

6924
01:51:52,370 --> 01:51:52,380
robots that have all of these apparent
 

6925
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,290
robots that have all of these apparent
abilities and then we dehumanize them

6926
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:54,300
abilities and then we dehumanize them
 

6927
01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,790
abilities and then we dehumanize them
which leads us to also dehumanize the

6928
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:55,800
which leads us to also dehumanize the
 

6929
01:51:55,800 --> 01:51:58,310
which leads us to also dehumanize the
other humans around us which you could

6930
01:51:58,310 --> 01:51:58,320
other humans around us which you could
 

6931
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,229
other humans around us which you could
easily see happening and the devaluation

6932
01:52:00,229 --> 01:52:00,239
easily see happening and the devaluation
 

6933
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:02,270
easily see happening and the devaluation
of life to the point where it doesn't

6934
01:52:02,270 --> 01:52:02,280
of life to the point where it doesn't
 

6935
01:52:02,280 --> 01:52:04,010
of life to the point where it doesn't
really matter I mean people have always

6936
01:52:04,010 --> 01:52:04,020
really matter I mean people have always
 

6937
01:52:04,020 --> 01:52:06,590
really matter I mean people have always
treated unfortunately newly discovered

6938
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:06,600
treated unfortunately newly discovered
 

6939
01:52:06,600 --> 01:52:09,350
treated unfortunately newly discovered
other humans this way so I I don't think

6940
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:09,360
other humans this way so I I don't think
 

6941
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:10,490
other humans this way so I I don't think
there's actually a new problem I think

6942
01:52:10,490 --> 01:52:10,500
there's actually a new problem I think
 

6943
01:52:10,500 --> 01:52:12,290
there's actually a new problem I think
it's a it's a pretty old problem it'll

6944
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:12,300
it's a it's a pretty old problem it'll
 

6945
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:13,370
it's a it's a pretty old problem it'll
just be interesting when it's made of

6946
01:52:13,370 --> 01:52:13,380
just be interesting when it's made of
 

6947
01:52:13,380 --> 01:52:15,890
just be interesting when it's made of
human hands yeah it's uh it's it's an

6948
01:52:15,890 --> 01:52:15,900
human hands yeah it's uh it's it's an
 

6949
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:18,709
human hands yeah it's uh it's it's an
opportunity to celebrate Humanity or to

6950
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:18,719
opportunity to celebrate Humanity or to
 

6951
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:19,310
opportunity to celebrate Humanity or to
um

6952
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:19,320
um
 

6953

um
to bring out the worst in humanity uh so

to bring out the worst in humanity uh so
 

6955
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:24,050
to bring out the worst in humanity uh so
the derision that naturally happens like

6956
01:52:24,050 --> 01:52:24,060
the derision that naturally happens like
 

6957
01:52:24,060 --> 01:52:26,450
the derision that naturally happens like
you said with pointing out uh the other

6958
01:52:26,450 --> 01:52:26,460
you said with pointing out uh the other
 

6959
01:52:26,460 --> 01:52:28,490
you said with pointing out uh the other
let me ask you about climate change

6960
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:28,500
let me ask you about climate change
 

6961
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:32,030
let me ask you about climate change
there's uh let's go from the meme to the

6962
01:52:32,030 --> 01:52:32,040
there's uh let's go from the meme to the
 

6963

there's uh let's go from the meme to the
to the profound philosophy okay the meme

6964
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:34,980
to the profound philosophy okay the meme
 

6965
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:36,590
to the profound philosophy okay the meme
was there's a clip of you talking about

6966

was there's a clip of you talking about
 

6967
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:38,390
was there's a clip of you talking about
climate change and saying that the

6968
01:52:38,390 --> 01:52:38,400
climate change and saying that the
 

6969
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,490
climate change and saying that the
Aquaman meme uh you said that for the

6970
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:40,500
Aquaman meme uh you said that for the
 

6971
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:42,129
Aquaman meme uh you said that for the
sake of argument if the water level

6972
01:52:42,129 --> 01:52:42,139
sake of argument if the water level
 

6973
01:52:42,139 --> 01:52:44,510
sake of argument if the water level
arises five to ten feet in the next

6974
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:44,520
arises five to ten feet in the next
 

6975
01:52:44,520 --> 01:52:46,430
arises five to ten feet in the next
hundred years people will just sell

6976

and then the meme was Zelda who uh can
 

6981
01:52:51,420 --> 01:52:53,450
and then the meme was Zelda who uh can
you argue both sides of that the

6982
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:53,460
you argue both sides of that the
 

6983
01:52:53,460 --> 01:52:54,649
you argue both sides of that the
argument that they're making is a straw

6984
01:52:54,649 --> 01:52:54,659
argument that they're making is a straw
 

6985
01:52:54,659 --> 01:52:55,970
argument that they're making is a straw
man the argument that I'm making is over

time I don't mean that if a tsunami is

6988
01:52:57,290 --> 01:52:57,300
time I don't mean that if a tsunami is
 

6989

about to hit your house you can list it
on eBay that's not that's not what I

6992
01:52:59,870 --> 01:52:59,880
on eBay that's not that's not what I
 

6993
01:52:59,880 --> 01:53:01,250
on eBay that's not that's not what I
mean obviously what I mean is that human

6994
01:53:01,250 --> 01:53:01,260
mean obviously what I mean is that human
 

6995
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:03,169
mean obviously what I mean is that human
beings have an extraordinary ability to

and that as water levels rise real

7000
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:07,560
and that as water levels rise real
 

7001
01:53:07,560 --> 01:53:09,109
and that as water levels rise real
estate prices in those areas tends to

7002
01:53:09,109 --> 01:53:09,119
estate prices in those areas tends to
 

7003
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:11,270
estate prices in those areas tends to
fall that over time people tend to

7004
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:11,280
fall that over time people tend to
 

7005
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:14,149
fall that over time people tend to
abandon those areas they tend to leave

7006
01:53:14,149 --> 01:53:14,159
abandon those areas they tend to leave
 

7007
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:16,490
abandon those areas they tend to leave
they tend to right now sell their houses

7008
01:53:16,490 --> 01:53:16,500
they tend to right now sell their houses
 

7009
01:53:16,500 --> 01:53:17,870
they tend to right now sell their houses
and then they tend to move and

7010
01:53:17,870 --> 01:53:17,880
and then they tend to move and
 

7011
01:53:17,880 --> 01:53:18,950
and then they tend to move and
eventually those houses will be

7012
01:53:18,950 --> 01:53:18,960
eventually those houses will be
 

7013
01:53:18,960 --> 01:53:20,270
eventually those houses will be
worthless and you won't have anybody to

7014
01:53:20,270 --> 01:53:20,280
worthless and you won't have anybody to
 

7015
01:53:20,280 --> 01:53:21,590
worthless and you won't have anybody to
sell to but presumably not that many

7016
01:53:21,590 --> 01:53:21,600
sell to but presumably not that many
 

7017
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:22,850
sell to but presumably not that many
people will be living there by that

7018
01:53:22,850 --> 01:53:22,860
people will be living there by that
 

7019
01:53:22,860 --> 01:53:24,530
people will be living there by that
point which is one of the reasons why

7020
01:53:24,530 --> 01:53:24,540
point which is one of the reasons why
 

7021
01:53:24,540 --> 01:53:25,609
point which is one of the reasons why
the price would be low because there's

7022
01:53:25,609 --> 01:53:25,619
the price would be low because there's
 

7023
01:53:25,619 --> 01:53:27,649
the price would be low because there's
no demand so it's over a hundred years

7024
01:53:27,649 --> 01:53:27,659
no demand so it's over a hundred years
 

7025
01:53:27,659 --> 01:53:30,470
no demand so it's over a hundred years
so all of these price Dynamics are very

7026
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:30,480
so all of these price Dynamics are very
 

7027
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,510
so all of these price Dynamics are very
gradual relative to the other price

7028
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:32,520
gradual relative to the other price
 

7029
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,189
gradual relative to the other price
Dynamics correct that's why the joke of

Dynamics correct that's why the joke of
 

7031
01:53:34,199 --> 01:53:35,750
Dynamics correct that's why the joke of
it of course is that like I'm saying

7032
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760
it of course is that like I'm saying
 

7033
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:37,250
it of course is that like I'm saying
that tomorrow there's a tsunami on your

01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:37,260
that tomorrow there's a tsunami on your
 

7035

that tomorrow there's a tsunami on your
Source step and you're like oh Bob will

01:53:38,870 --> 01:53:38,880
Source step and you're like oh Bob will
 

7037
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,790

buy my house Bob ain't gonna buy your

01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:42,600
house like we all get that but it's a
 

7041
01:53:42,600 --> 01:53:44,689
house like we all get that but it's a
funny man I laughed at it how's your

01:53:44,689 --> 01:53:44,699
funny man I laughed at it how's your
 

7043
01:53:44,699 --> 01:53:48,050
funny man I laughed at it how's your
view on climate change the the human

what we should do in terms of policy to
respond to climate change how has that

01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:53,040
respond to climate change how has that
 

7051
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:55,430
respond to climate change how has that
changed over the years I would say

7052
01:53:55,430 --> 01:53:55,440
changed over the years I would say

I've believed that climate change was a

I've believed that climate change was a
 

7057
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,910
I've believed that climate change was a
reality in that anthropogenic climate

reality in that anthropogenic climate
 

7059
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:04,310
reality in that anthropogenic climate
change is a reality uh I don't argue

climatologists at places like MIT or
 

7065
01:54:08,100 --> 01:54:09,290

Caltech and they know this stuff better
 

7067
01:54:09,300 --> 01:54:11,930
Caltech and they know this stuff better
than I do so you know the the notion

7068
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:11,940
than I do so you know the the notion
 

7069
01:54:11,940 --> 01:54:13,129
than I do so you know the the notion
that climate change is just not

7070
01:54:13,129 --> 01:54:13,139
that climate change is just not
 

7071
01:54:13,139 --> 01:54:14,629
that climate change is just not
happening or that human beings have not

01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
happening or that human beings have not
 

7073
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:16,310
happening or that human beings have not
contributed to climate change I find

7074
01:54:16,310 --> 01:54:16,320
contributed to climate change I find
 

7075
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:18,229
contributed to climate change I find
doubtful the question is to what extent

7076
01:54:18,229 --> 01:54:18,239
doubtful the question is to what extent
 

7077
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:19,790
doubtful the question is to what extent
human beings are contributing to climate

change that 50 is 70 is at 90 I think

there's a little bit more play in the

7082

there's a little bit more play in the
 

7083
01:54:23,699 --> 01:54:24,950
there's a little bit more play in the
joints there so it's not totally clear

it's one of one to me that honestly this
 

7255
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:01,550
it's one of one to me that honestly this

is like a litmus test question as to
 

7257
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:02,330
is like a litmus test question as to

7315
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,350
15 years from now that's going to be
worth a lot more than a dollar people

01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
worth a lot more than a dollar people
 

7317
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,209
worth a lot more than a dollar people
can't actually see that and so the idea

7318
01:57:59,209 --> 01:57:59,219
can't actually see that and so the idea
 

7319
01:57:59,219 --> 01:58:00,649
can't actually see that and so the idea
of let's foresee a problem then we'll

7320
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:00,659
of let's foresee a problem then we'll
 

7321
01:58:00,659 --> 01:58:02,330
of let's foresee a problem then we'll
deal with it right now as opposed to 30

7322
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:02,340
deal with it right now as opposed to 30
 

7323
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,310
deal with it right now as opposed to 30
years down the road typically we let the

7324
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
years down the road typically we let the
 

7325
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,750
years down the road typically we let the
problem happen and then we solve it and

7326
01:58:05,750 --> 01:58:05,760
problem happen and then we solve it and
 

7327
01:58:05,760 --> 01:58:07,129
problem happen and then we solve it and
it's bloodier and worse than it would

7328
01:58:07,129 --> 01:58:07,139
it's bloodier and worse than it would
 

7329
01:58:07,139 --> 01:58:08,209
it's bloodier and worse than it would
have been if we had solved it 30 years

7330
01:58:08,209 --> 01:58:08,219
have been if we had solved it 30 years
 

7331
01:58:08,219 --> 01:58:11,209
have been if we had solved it 30 years
ago but it is in fact effective and

7332
01:58:11,209 --> 01:58:11,219
ago but it is in fact effective and
 

7333
01:58:11,219 --> 01:58:12,470
ago but it is in fact effective and
sometimes it turns out the solution that

7334
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
sometimes it turns out the solution that
 

7335
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,330
sometimes it turns out the solution that
we're proposing 30 years in advance is

7336
01:58:14,330 --> 01:58:14,340
we're proposing 30 years in advance is
 

7337
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:16,010
we're proposing 30 years in advance is
not effective and that's that's a that

7338
01:58:16,010 --> 01:58:16,020
not effective and that's that's a that
 

7339
01:58:16,020 --> 01:58:17,510
not effective and that's that's a that
can be a major problem as well well

7340
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
can be a major problem as well well
 

7341
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,490
can be a major problem as well well
that's then the Steel Man the the case

7342
01:58:19,490 --> 01:58:19,500
that's then the Steel Man the the case
 

7343
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:21,350
that's then the Steel Man the the case
for fear-mongering for irrational

7344
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:21,360
for fear-mongering for irrational
 

7345
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,810
for fear-mongering for irrational
fear-mongering we need to be scared

7346
01:58:23,810 --> 01:58:23,820
fear-mongering we need to be scared
 

7347
01:58:23,820 --> 01:58:25,550
fear-mongering we need to be scared
shitless in order for us to do anything

7348
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:25,560
shitless in order for us to do anything
 

7349
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:28,189
shitless in order for us to do anything
so that that's that you know I'm

7350
01:58:28,189 --> 01:58:28,199
so that that's that you know I'm
 

7351
01:58:28,199 --> 01:58:30,470
so that that's that you know I'm
generally against that but maybe on a

7352
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
generally against that but maybe on a
 

7353
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,290
generally against that but maybe on a
population scale maybe some of that is

7354
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:33,300
population scale maybe some of that is
 

7355
01:58:33,300 --> 01:58:36,350
population scale maybe some of that is
necessary for us to respond appropriate

7356
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,360
necessary for us to respond appropriate
 

7357
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,649
necessary for us to respond appropriate
for long two long-term threats we should

7358
01:58:39,649 --> 01:58:39,659
for long two long-term threats we should
 

7359
01:58:39,659 --> 01:58:41,330
for long two long-term threats we should
be scared jealous I don't think that we

7360
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:41,340
be scared jealous I don't think that we
 

7361
01:58:41,340 --> 01:58:43,189
be scared jealous I don't think that we
can actually do that though uh like I

7362
01:58:43,189 --> 01:58:43,199
can actually do that though uh like I
 

7363
01:58:43,199 --> 01:58:45,050
can actually do that though uh like I
like first of all I think that it's it's

7364
01:58:45,050 --> 01:58:45,060
like first of all I think that it's it's
 

7365
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:47,390
like first of all I think that it's it's
platonic lives are generally bad uh and

7366
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:47,400
platonic lives are generally bad uh and
 

7367
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:48,589
platonic lives are generally bad uh and
then second of all I don't think that we

7368
01:58:48,589 --> 01:58:48,599
then second of all I don't think that we
 

7369
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:50,030
then second of all I don't think that we
actually have the capacity to do this I

7370
01:58:50,030 --> 01:58:50,040
actually have the capacity to do this I
 

7371
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:51,830
actually have the capacity to do this I
think that the people who are you know

7372
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
think that the people who are you know
 

7373
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,570
think that the people who are you know
the the sort of Elites of our society

7374
01:58:53,570 --> 01:58:53,580
the the sort of Elites of our society
 

7375
01:58:53,580 --> 01:58:54,950
the the sort of Elites of our society
who get together in rooms and talk about

7376
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:54,960
who get together in rooms and talk about
 

7377
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,030
who get together in rooms and talk about
this sort of stuff and I've been in some

7378
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:56,040
this sort of stuff and I've been in some
 

7379
01:58:56,040 --> 01:58:57,830
this sort of stuff and I've been in some
of those meetings at my at my synagogues

7380
01:58:57,830 --> 01:58:57,840
of those meetings at my at my synagogues

7387
01:59:04,920 --> 01:59:06,950
did yeah you know I've been in rooms
like Davos like rooms and when people

7388
01:59:06,950 --> 01:59:06,960
like Davos like rooms and when people
 

7389
01:59:06,960 --> 01:59:09,290
like Davos like rooms and when people
discuss these these sorts of topics and

7390
01:59:09,290 --> 01:59:09,300
discuss these these sorts of topics and
 

7391
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:10,430
discuss these these sorts of topics and
they're like what if we just tell people

7392
01:59:10,430 --> 01:59:10,440
they're like what if we just tell people
 

7393
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:11,810
they're like what if we just tell people
that it's going to be a disaster with

7394
01:59:11,810 --> 01:59:11,820
that it's going to be a disaster with
 

7395
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:13,129
that it's going to be a disaster with
two nominees and day after tomorrow it's

7396
01:59:13,129 --> 01:59:13,139
two nominees and day after tomorrow it's
 

7397
01:59:13,139 --> 01:59:14,930
two nominees and day after tomorrow it's
like you guys don't have that power you

7398
01:59:14,930 --> 01:59:14,940
like you guys don't have that power you
 

7399
01:59:14,940 --> 01:59:16,910
like you guys don't have that power you
don't and by the way you'd dramatically

7400
01:59:16,910 --> 01:59:16,920
don't and by the way you'd dramatically
 

7401
01:59:16,920 --> 01:59:18,350
don't and by the way you'd dramatically
undercut your own power because of covid

7402
01:59:18,350 --> 01:59:18,360
undercut your own power because of covid
 

7403
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,910
undercut your own power because of covid
to do this sort of stuff because a lot

7404
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
to do this sort of stuff because a lot
 

7405
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,950
to do this sort of stuff because a lot
of the sort of what if we scare the

7406
01:59:21,950 --> 01:59:21,960
of the sort of what if we scare the
 

7407
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:23,209
of the sort of what if we scare the
living hell out of you to the point

7408
01:59:23,209 --> 01:59:23,219
living hell out of you to the point
 

7409
01:59:23,219 --> 01:59:25,070
living hell out of you to the point
where you stay in your own house for two

7410
01:59:25,070 --> 01:59:25,080
where you stay in your own house for two
 

7411
01:59:25,080 --> 01:59:26,689
where you stay in your own house for two
years and we tell you you can't send

7412
01:59:26,689 --> 01:59:26,699
years and we tell you you can't send
 

7413
01:59:26,699 --> 01:59:28,550
years and we tell you you can't send
your kids to school and then we tell you

7414
01:59:28,550 --> 01:59:28,560
your kids to school and then we tell you
 

7415
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:29,990
your kids to school and then we tell you
that the vaccine is going to prevent

7416
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:30,000
that the vaccine is going to prevent
 

7417
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,629
that the vaccine is going to prevent
transmission and then we also tell you

7418
01:59:32,629 --> 01:59:32,639
transmission and then we also tell you
 

7419
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:34,550
transmission and then we also tell you
that we need to spend seven trillion

7420
01:59:34,550 --> 01:59:34,560
that we need to spend seven trillion
 

7421
01:59:34,560 --> 01:59:35,810
that we need to spend seven trillion
dollars in one year and it won't have

7422
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:35,820
dollars in one year and it won't have
 

7423
01:59:35,820 --> 01:59:37,189
dollars in one year and it won't have
any inflationary effect and it turns out

7424
01:59:37,189 --> 01:59:37,199
any inflationary effect and it turns out
 

7425
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:38,450
any inflationary effect and it turns out
you're wrong on literally all of those

7426
01:59:38,450 --> 01:59:38,460
you're wrong on literally all of those
 

7427
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:39,350
you're wrong on literally all of those
things

7428
01:59:39,350 --> 01:59:39,360
things
 

7429
01:59:39,360 --> 01:59:41,330
things
the the last few years have done more to

7430
01:59:41,330 --> 01:59:41,340
the the last few years have done more to
 

7431
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,830
the the last few years have done more to
undermine institutional trust than any

7432
01:59:42,830 --> 01:59:42,840
undermine institutional trust than any
 

7433
01:59:42,840 --> 01:59:44,510
undermine institutional trust than any
time in in probably American history

7434
01:59:44,510 --> 01:59:44,520
time in in probably American history
 

7435
01:59:44,520 --> 01:59:46,250
time in in probably American history
it's pretty pretty amazing yeah I tend

7436
01:59:46,250 --> 01:59:46,260
it's pretty pretty amazing yeah I tend
 

7437
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:47,510
it's pretty pretty amazing yeah I tend
to agree with that the only thing we

7438
01:59:47,510 --> 01:59:47,520
to agree with that the only thing we
 

7439
01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:49,310
to agree with that the only thing we
have to fear is fear itself

7440
01:59:49,310 --> 01:59:49,320
have to fear is fear itself
 

7441
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:52,910
have to fear is fear itself
let me ask you back to the question of

7442
01:59:52,910 --> 01:59:52,920
let me ask you back to the question of
 

7443
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:54,229
let me ask you back to the question of
God

7444
01:59:54,229 --> 01:59:54,239
God
 

7445
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:56,990
God
and a big ridiculous question who's God

7446
01:59:56,990 --> 01:59:57,000
and a big ridiculous question who's God
 

7447
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,209
and a big ridiculous question who's God
who is God so I'm going to

7448
01:59:59,209 --> 01:59:59,219
who is God so I'm going to
 

7449
01:59:59,219 --> 01:59:59,810
who is God so I'm going to
um

7450
01:59:59,810 --> 01:59:59,820
um
 

7451
01:59:59,820 --> 02:00:01,550
um
I'm gonna use sort of the Aquinas

7452
02:00:01,550 --> 02:00:01,560
I'm gonna use sort of the Aquinas
 

7453
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:05,350
I'm gonna use sort of the Aquinas
formulation of of what God is right that

7454
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:05,360
formulation of of what God is right that
 

7455
02:00:05,360 --> 02:00:07,189
formulation of of what God is right that
if you

7456
02:00:07,189 --> 02:00:07,199
if you
 

7457
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:10,310
if you
if there is a cause of all things not

7458
02:00:10,310 --> 02:00:10,320
if there is a cause of all things not
 

7459
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:11,810
if there is a cause of all things not
physical things if there is a cause

7460
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:11,820
physical things if there is a cause
 

7461
02:00:11,820 --> 02:00:13,850
physical things if there is a cause
underlying the the reason of the

7462
02:00:13,850 --> 02:00:13,860
underlying the the reason of the
 

7463
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:15,709
underlying the the reason of the
universe then that is the thing we call

7464
02:00:15,709 --> 02:00:15,719
universe then that is the thing we call
 

7465
02:00:15,719 --> 02:00:16,669
universe then that is the thing we call
God

7466
02:00:16,669 --> 02:00:16,679
God
 

7467
02:00:16,679 --> 02:00:19,430
God
so not a big guy in the sky with a beard

7468
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440

the natural law by sort of Catholic

the natural law by sort of Catholic
 

7495
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:49,310
the natural law by sort of Catholic
theology why do you think God created

7496
02:00:49,310 --> 02:00:49,320
theology why do you think God created
 

7497
02:00:49,320 --> 02:00:52,250
theology why do you think God created
the universe or as as popularly asked

7507
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:04,729
that the meaning of life is to fulfill
what God made you to do and that is a

7508
02:01:04,729 --> 02:01:04,739
what God made you to do and that is a
 

7509
02:01:04,739 --> 02:01:06,169
what God made you to do and that is a
series of roles

7510
02:01:06,169 --> 02:01:06,179
series of roles
 

7511
02:01:06,179 --> 02:01:08,089
series of roles
I think that human beings and here you

7512
02:01:08,089 --> 02:01:08,099
I think that human beings and here you
 

7513
02:01:08,099 --> 02:01:09,229
I think that human beings and here you
have to look to sort of human nature

7514
02:01:09,229 --> 02:01:09,239
have to look to sort of human nature
 

7515
02:01:09,239 --> 02:01:11,089
have to look to sort of human nature
rather than looking kind of to Big

7516
02:01:11,089 --> 02:01:11,099
rather than looking kind of to Big
 

7517
02:01:11,099 --> 02:01:13,430
rather than looking kind of to Big
questions

7518
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:13,440
questions
 

7519
02:01:13,440 --> 02:01:15,470
questions
I've evolved something that I've really

7520
02:01:15,470 --> 02:01:15,480
I've evolved something that I've really
 

7521
02:01:15,480 --> 02:01:16,910
I've evolved something that I've really
been working on you know I'm writing a

7522
02:01:16,910 --> 02:01:16,920
been working on you know I'm writing a
 

7523
02:01:16,920 --> 02:01:18,709
been working on you know I'm writing a
book about this actually uh that that I

7524
02:01:18,709 --> 02:01:18,719
book about this actually uh that that I
 

7525
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:21,530
book about this actually uh that that I
call colloquially role Theory and

7526
02:01:21,530 --> 02:01:21,540
call colloquially role Theory and
 

7527
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:24,290
call colloquially role Theory and
basically the idea is that the way that

7528
02:01:24,290 --> 02:01:24,300
basically the idea is that the way that
 

7529
02:01:24,300 --> 02:01:25,609
basically the idea is that the way that
we interact with the world is through a

7530
02:01:25,609 --> 02:01:25,619
we interact with the world is through a
 

7531
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:26,930
we interact with the world is through a
series of roles and those are also the

7532
02:01:26,930 --> 02:01:26,940
series of roles and those are also the
 

7533
02:01:26,940 --> 02:01:29,810
series of roles and those are also the
things we find most important and most

7534
02:01:29,810 --> 02:01:29,820
things we find most important and most
 

7535
02:01:29,820 --> 02:01:31,910
things we find most important and most
implementable and they they're sort of

7536
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
implementable and they they're sort of
 

7537
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:34,729
implementable and they they're sort of
virtue ethics right which which suggests

7538
02:01:34,729 --> 02:01:34,739
virtue ethics right which which suggests
 

7539
02:01:34,739 --> 02:01:36,530
virtue ethics right which which suggests
that if we act in accordance with virtue

7540
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:36,540
that if we act in accordance with virtue
 

7541
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,689
that if we act in accordance with virtue
like Aristotle then we will be living

7542
02:01:38,689 --> 02:01:38,699
like Aristotle then we will be living
 

7543
02:01:38,699 --> 02:01:40,790
like Aristotle then we will be living
the most fulfilled and meaningful life

7544
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:40,800
the most fulfilled and meaningful life
 

7545
02:01:40,800 --> 02:01:43,250
the most fulfilled and meaningful life
and then you have sort of deontological

7546
02:01:43,250 --> 02:01:43,260
and then you have sort of deontological
 

7547
02:01:43,260 --> 02:01:45,050
and then you have sort of deontological
effects like content effects that it's a

7548
02:01:45,050 --> 02:01:45,060
effects like content effects that it's a
 

7549
02:01:45,060 --> 02:01:46,370
effects like content effects that it's a
rule-based ethic

7550
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:46,380
rule-based ethic
 

7551
02:01:46,380 --> 02:01:47,870
rule-based ethic
if you follow the rules then you'll then

7552
02:01:47,870 --> 02:01:47,880
if you follow the rules then you'll then
 

7553
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:50,030
if you follow the rules then you'll then
you'll find the meaning of life and then

7554
02:01:50,030 --> 02:01:50,040
you'll find the meaning of life and then
 

7555
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:51,830
you'll find the meaning of life and then
what I'm proposing is that there's

7556
02:01:51,830 --> 02:01:51,840
what I'm proposing is that there's
 

7557
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,689
what I'm proposing is that there's
something that I would call role ethics

7558
02:01:53,689 --> 02:01:53,699
something that I would call role ethics
 

7559
02:01:53,699 --> 02:01:55,010
something that I would call role ethics
which is there are a series of roles

7560
02:01:55,010 --> 02:01:55,020
which is there are a series of roles
 

7561
02:01:55,020 --> 02:01:56,450
which is there are a series of roles
that we play across our lives which are

7562
02:01:56,450 --> 02:01:56,460
that we play across our lives which are
 

7563
02:01:56,460 --> 02:01:57,589
that we play across our lives which are
also the things that we tend to put on

7564
02:01:57,589 --> 02:01:57,599
also the things that we tend to put on
 

7565
02:01:57,599 --> 02:01:58,669
also the things that we tend to put on
our tombstones and find the most

7566
02:01:58,669 --> 02:01:58,679
our tombstones and find the most
 

7567
02:01:58,679 --> 02:02:01,010
our tombstones and find the most
meaningful so what when you go to a

7568
02:02:01,010 --> 02:02:01,020
meaningful so what when you go to a
 

7569
02:02:01,020 --> 02:02:02,570
meaningful so what when you go to a
cemetery you can see what people found

7570
02:02:02,570 --> 02:02:02,580
cemetery you can see what people found
 

7571
02:02:02,580 --> 02:02:03,530
cemetery you can see what people found
the most meaningful because it's the

7572
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:03,540
the most meaningful because it's the
 

7573
02:02:03,540 --> 02:02:04,729
the most meaningful because it's the
stuff they put on the stone that has

7574
02:02:04,729 --> 02:02:04,739
stuff they put on the stone that has
 

7575
02:02:04,739 --> 02:02:06,890
stuff they put on the stone that has
like four words on it right like beloved

7576
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:06,900
like four words on it right like beloved
 

7577
02:02:06,900 --> 02:02:10,189
like four words on it right like beloved
father beloved mother sister brother

7578
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:10,199
father beloved mother sister brother
 

7579
02:02:10,199 --> 02:02:12,709
father beloved mother sister brother
and you might have a job once in a while

7580
02:02:12,709 --> 02:02:12,719
and you might have a job once in a while
 

7581
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,470
and you might have a job once in a while
a Creator you know a religious person

7582
02:02:15,470 --> 02:02:15,480
a Creator you know a religious person
 

7583
02:02:15,480 --> 02:02:16,910
a Creator you know a religious person
right these are all roles that have

7584
02:02:16,910 --> 02:02:16,920
right these are all roles that have
 

7585
02:02:16,920 --> 02:02:18,350
right these are all roles that have
existed across societies and across

7586
02:02:18,350 --> 02:02:18,360
existed across societies and across
 

7587
02:02:18,360 --> 02:02:19,790
existed across societies and across
humanity and those are the things where

7588
02:02:19,790 --> 02:02:19,800
humanity and those are the things where
 

7589
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,470
humanity and those are the things where
we actually find meaning and the way

7590
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:21,480
we actually find meaning and the way
 

7591
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:23,930
we actually find meaning and the way
that we navigate those roles brings us

7592
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:23,940
that we navigate those roles brings us
 

7593
02:02:23,940 --> 02:02:27,890
that we navigate those roles brings us
meaning and I think that God created us

7594
02:02:27,890 --> 02:02:27,900
meaning and I think that God created us
 

7595
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:29,810
meaning and I think that God created us
in order to fulfill those roles for

7596
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:29,820
in order to fulfill those roles for
 

7597
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:30,890
in order to fulfill those roles for
purposes that I can't begin to

7598
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:30,900
purposes that I can't begin to
 

7599
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,589
purposes that I can't begin to
understand because I am him and the more

7600
02:02:33,589 --> 02:02:33,599
understand because I am him and the more
 

7601
02:02:33,599 --> 02:02:36,589
understand because I am him and the more
we the more we recognize those roles and

7602
02:02:36,589 --> 02:02:36,599
we the more we recognize those roles and
 

7603
02:02:36,599 --> 02:02:38,870
we the more we recognize those roles and
the more we we live those roles and then

7604
02:02:38,870 --> 02:02:38,880
the more we we live those roles and then
 

7605
02:02:38,880 --> 02:02:40,129
the more we we live those roles and then
we can express Freedom within those

7606
02:02:40,129 --> 02:02:40,139
we can express Freedom within those
 

7607
02:02:40,139 --> 02:02:41,930
we can express Freedom within those
roles I think that the Liberty exists

7608
02:02:41,930 --> 02:02:41,940
roles I think that the Liberty exists
 

7609
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:43,010
roles I think that the Liberty exists
inside each of those roles and that's

7610
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:43,020
inside each of those roles and that's
 

7611
02:02:43,020 --> 02:02:44,270
inside each of those roles and that's
what makes all of our Lives different

7612
02:02:44,270 --> 02:02:44,280
what makes all of our Lives different
 

7613
02:02:44,280 --> 02:02:46,129
what makes all of our Lives different
and fun we all parents in different ways

7614
02:02:46,129 --> 02:02:46,139
and fun we all parents in different ways
 

7615
02:02:46,139 --> 02:02:47,870
and fun we all parents in different ways
but being a parent is a meaningful role

7616
02:02:47,870 --> 02:02:47,880
but being a parent is a meaningful role
 

7617
02:02:47,880 --> 02:02:51,109
but being a parent is a meaningful role
we all have spouses but you know how you

7618
02:02:51,109 --> 02:02:51,119
we all have spouses but you know how you
 

7619

include things like being a Creator like
we have a creative Instinct as human

7643
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,290
community which is something that we're
built to do if we fulfill those roles

7644
02:03:12,290 --> 02:03:12,300
built to do if we fulfill those roles
 

7645
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:13,370
built to do if we fulfill those roles
properly then we will have made the

7646
02:03:13,370 --> 02:03:13,380
properly then we will have made the
 

7647
02:03:13,380 --> 02:03:14,750
properly then we will have made the
world a better place than we than we

world a better place than we than we
 

7649
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:17,390
world a better place than we than we
inherited it and we'll also have have

7650
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:17,400
inherited it and we'll also have have
 

7651
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:19,910
inherited it and we'll also have have
had the joy of experiencing the the sort

7652
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
had the joy of experiencing the the sort

had the joy of experiencing the the sort
of flow they talk about in in Psychology

7654
02:03:22,669 --> 02:03:22,679
of flow they talk about in in Psychology
 

7655
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:25,129
of flow they talk about in in Psychology
where when you engage in these roles you

7656
02:03:25,129 --> 02:03:25,139
where when you engage in these roles you
 

7657
02:03:25,139 --> 02:03:27,050
where when you engage in these roles you
actually do feel a flow so these roles

7658
02:03:27,050 --> 02:03:27,060
actually do feel a flow so these roles
 

7659
02:03:27,060 --> 02:03:28,490
actually do feel a flow so these roles
are fundamental part of the human

7660
02:03:28,490 --> 02:03:28,500
are fundamental part of the human
 

7661
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,189
are fundamental part of the human
condition yes so you're the the book

7662
02:03:31,189 --> 02:03:31,199
condition yes so you're the the book
 

7663
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:34,310
condition yes so you're the the book
you're working on is is constructing a

7664
02:03:34,310 --> 02:03:34,320
you're working on is is constructing a
 

7665
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:36,890
you're working on is is constructing a
a system to help us understand

7666
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:36,900
a system to help us understand
 

7667
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:39,470
a system to help us understand
it's it's looking at let's assume that

7668
02:03:39,470 --> 02:03:39,480
it's it's looking at let's assume that
 

7669
02:03:39,480 --> 02:03:41,089
it's it's looking at let's assume that
all that's true the real question in the

7670
02:03:41,089 --> 02:03:41,099
all that's true the real question in the
 

7671
02:03:41,099 --> 02:03:42,649
all that's true the real question in the
book is how do you construct a

7672
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:42,659
book is how do you construct a
 

7673
02:03:42,659 --> 02:03:44,930
book is how do you construct a
flourishing and useful

7674
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:44,940
flourishing and useful
 

7675
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:48,050
flourishing and useful
society and politics uh so a society

7676
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:48,060
society and politics uh so a society
 

7677
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:50,390
society and politics uh so a society
level if this is our understanding of a

7678
02:03:50,390 --> 02:03:50,400
level if this is our understanding of a
 

7679
02:03:50,400 --> 02:03:52,189
level if this is our understanding of a
human being how do we construct a good

7680
02:03:52,189 --> 02:03:52,199
human being how do we construct a good
 

7681
02:03:52,199 --> 02:03:54,109
human being how do we construct a good
Society right exactly because I I think

7682
02:03:54,109 --> 02:03:54,119
Society right exactly because I I think
 

7683
02:03:54,119 --> 02:03:56,030
Society right exactly because I I think
that a lot of political theory is right

7684
02:03:56,030 --> 02:03:56,040
that a lot of political theory is right
 

7685
02:03:56,040 --> 02:03:57,709
that a lot of political theory is right
now based in either

7686
02:03:57,709 --> 02:03:57,719
now based in either
 

7687
02:03:57,719 --> 02:04:00,169
now based in either
JS Mill kind of thought which is all

7688
02:04:00,169 --> 02:04:00,179
JS Mill kind of thought which is all
 

7689
02:04:00,179 --> 02:04:02,149
JS Mill kind of thought which is all
that a good politics does allows you

7690
02:04:02,149 --> 02:04:02,159
that a good politics does allows you
 

7691
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:03,050
that a good politics does allows you
wave your hand around until you hit

7692
02:04:03,050 --> 02:04:03,060
wave your hand around until you hit
 

7693
02:04:03,060 --> 02:04:05,330
wave your hand around until you hit
somebody in the face or a rosian thought

7694
02:04:05,330 --> 02:04:05,340
somebody in the face or a rosian thought
 

7695
02:04:05,340 --> 02:04:07,250
somebody in the face or a rosian thought
which is what if we constructed Society

7696
02:04:07,250 --> 02:04:07,260
which is what if we constructed Society
 

7697
02:04:07,260 --> 02:04:08,870
which is what if we constructed Society
in order to achieve the most for the

7698
02:04:08,870 --> 02:04:08,880
in order to achieve the most for the
 

7699
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:11,149
in order to achieve the most for the
least essentially you know what if we

7700
02:04:11,149 --> 02:04:11,159
least essentially you know what if we
 

7701
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:13,129
least essentially you know what if we
constructed society around what actually

7702
02:04:13,129 --> 02:04:13,139
constructed society around what actually
 

7703
02:04:13,139 --> 02:04:15,950
constructed society around what actually
makes humans the most fulfilled and that

7704
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:15,960
makes humans the most fulfilled and that
 

7705
02:04:15,960 --> 02:04:17,750
makes humans the most fulfilled and that
is the the

7706
02:04:17,750 --> 02:04:17,760
is the the
 

7707
02:04:17,760 --> 02:04:19,970
is the the
fulfillment of these particular roles

7708
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:19,980
fulfillment of these particular roles
 

7709
02:04:19,980 --> 02:04:21,770
fulfillment of these particular roles
and where does Liberty come into that

7710
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:21,780
and where does Liberty come into that
 

7711
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,089
and where does Liberty come into that
right how do you avoid the idea of a

7712
02:04:23,089 --> 02:04:23,099
right how do you avoid the idea of a
 

7713
02:04:23,099 --> 02:04:24,589
right how do you avoid the idea of a
tyranny in that right how do you you

7714
02:04:24,589 --> 02:04:24,599
tyranny in that right how do you you
 

7715
02:04:24,599 --> 02:04:26,030
tyranny in that right how do you you
have to be a mother you must be a father

7716
02:04:26,030 --> 02:04:26,040
have to be a mother you must be a father
 

7717
02:04:26,040 --> 02:04:27,530
have to be a mother you must be a father
you must be where does where does

7718
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:27,540
you must be where does where does
 

7719
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:28,910
you must be where does where does
freedom come into that can you reject

7720
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:28,920
freedom come into that can you reject
 

7721
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:31,010
freedom come into that can you reject
those roles totally as a society and be

7722
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:31,020
those roles totally as a society and be
 

7723
02:04:31,020 --> 02:04:32,810
those roles totally as a society and be
okay the answer probably is not so you

7724
02:04:32,810 --> 02:04:32,820
okay the answer probably is not so you
 

7725
02:04:32,820 --> 02:04:35,030
okay the answer probably is not so you
need a society that actually

7726
02:04:35,030 --> 02:04:35,040
need a society that actually
 

7727
02:04:35,040 --> 02:04:37,729
need a society that actually
promotes and and protects those roles

7728
02:04:37,729 --> 02:04:37,739
promotes and and protects those roles
 

7729
02:04:37,739 --> 02:04:39,109
promotes and and protects those roles
but also protects the freedom inside

7730
02:04:39,109 --> 02:04:39,119
but also protects the freedom inside
 

7731
02:04:39,119 --> 02:04:40,729
but also protects the freedom inside
those roles and that raises a more

7732
02:04:40,729 --> 02:04:40,739
those roles and that raises a more
 

7733
02:04:40,739 --> 02:04:42,229
those roles and that raises a more
fundamental question of what exactly

7734
02:04:42,229 --> 02:04:42,239
fundamental question of what exactly
 

7735
02:04:42,239 --> 02:04:43,970
fundamental question of what exactly
Liberty is for and I think that both the

7736
02:04:43,970 --> 02:04:43,980
Liberty is for and I think that both the
 

7737
02:04:43,980 --> 02:04:45,830
Liberty is for and I think that both the
right and the left actually uh tend to

7738
02:04:45,830 --> 02:04:45,840
right and the left actually uh tend to
 

7739
02:04:45,840 --> 02:04:47,390
right and the left actually uh tend to
make a mistake when they discuss Liberty

7740
02:04:47,390 --> 02:04:47,400
make a mistake when they discuss Liberty
 

7741
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,189
make a mistake when they discuss Liberty
the left tends to think that Liberty is

7742
02:04:49,189 --> 02:04:49,199
the left tends to think that Liberty is
 

7743
02:04:49,199 --> 02:04:51,649
the left tends to think that Liberty is
an ultimate good that Simple Choice

7744
02:04:51,649 --> 02:04:51,659
an ultimate good that Simple Choice
 

7745
02:04:51,659 --> 02:04:53,870
an ultimate good that Simple Choice
makes a bad thing good which is not true

7746
02:04:53,870 --> 02:04:53,880
makes a bad thing good which is not true
 

7747
02:04:53,880 --> 02:04:55,250
makes a bad thing good which is not true
and I think the right talks about

7748
02:04:55,250 --> 02:04:55,260
and I think the right talks about
 

7749
02:04:55,260 --> 02:04:56,629
and I think the right talks about
Liberty in almost the same terms

7750
02:04:56,629 --> 02:04:56,639
Liberty in almost the same terms
 

7751
02:04:56,639 --> 02:04:58,490
Liberty in almost the same terms
sometimes and I think that's not true

7752
02:04:58,490 --> 02:04:58,500
sometimes and I think that's not true
 

7753
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:00,709
sometimes and I think that's not true
either the question is whether Liberty

7754
02:05:00,709 --> 02:05:00,719
either the question is whether Liberty
 

7755
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:01,609
either the question is whether Liberty
is

7756
02:05:01,609 --> 02:05:01,619
is
 

7757
02:05:01,619 --> 02:05:03,589
is
of inherent value or instrumental value

7758
02:05:03,589 --> 02:05:03,599
of inherent value or instrumental value
 

7759
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:05,930
of inherent value or instrumental value
is Liberty good in and of itself or is

7760
02:05:05,930 --> 02:05:05,940
is Liberty good in and of itself or is
 

7761
02:05:05,940 --> 02:05:07,370
is Liberty good in and of itself or is
Liberty good because it allows you to

7762
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:07,380
Liberty good because it allows you to
 

7763
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,729
Liberty good because it allows you to
achieve X Y or Z and I've thought about

7764
02:05:10,729 --> 02:05:10,739
achieve X Y or Z and I've thought about
 

7765
02:05:10,739 --> 02:05:12,290
achieve X Y or Z and I've thought about
this one a lot and I I tend to come down

7766
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:12,300
this one a lot and I I tend to come down
 

7767
02:05:12,300 --> 02:05:13,430
this one a lot and I I tend to come down
on the latter side of the aisle I mean

7768
02:05:13,430 --> 02:05:13,440
on the latter side of the aisle I mean
 

7769
02:05:13,440 --> 02:05:14,510
on the latter side of the aisle I mean
this is the US me areas where I move

7770
02:05:14,510 --> 02:05:14,520
this is the US me areas where I move
 

7771
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:15,890
this is the US me areas where I move
this may be an area where I've moved is

7772
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:15,900
this may be an area where I've moved is
 

7773
02:05:15,900 --> 02:05:16,850
this may be an area where I've moved is
there anything when you think more

7774
02:05:16,850 --> 02:05:16,860
there anything when you think more
 

7775
02:05:16,860 --> 02:05:19,310
there anything when you think more
shallowly about politics or maybe more

7776
02:05:19,310 --> 02:05:19,320
shallowly about politics or maybe more
 

7777
02:05:19,320 --> 02:05:20,810
shallowly about politics or maybe more
quickly because this is how we talk in

7778
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:20,820
quickly because this is how we talk in
 

7779
02:05:20,820 --> 02:05:22,609
quickly because this is how we talk in
America is about Liberties and rights we

7780
02:05:22,609 --> 02:05:22,619
America is about Liberties and rights we
 

7781
02:05:22,619 --> 02:05:23,930
America is about Liberties and rights we
tend to think that the right is what

7782
02:05:23,930 --> 02:05:23,940
tend to think that the right is what
 

7783
02:05:23,940 --> 02:05:25,729
tend to think that the right is what
make not like the political right rights

7784
02:05:25,729 --> 02:05:25,739
make not like the political right rights
 

7785
02:05:25,739 --> 02:05:27,290
make not like the political right rights
make things good Liberties make things

7786
02:05:27,290 --> 02:05:27,300
make things good Liberties make things
 

7787
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:29,149
make things good Liberties make things
good the question really is what are

7788
02:05:29,149 --> 02:05:29,159
good the question really is what are
 

7789
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:31,250
good the question really is what are
those rights in Liberties for now you

7790
02:05:31,250 --> 02:05:31,260
those rights in Liberties for now you
 

7791
02:05:31,260 --> 02:05:33,410
those rights in Liberties for now you
have to be careful so that that doesn't

7792
02:05:33,410 --> 02:05:33,420
have to be careful so that that doesn't
 

7793
02:05:33,420 --> 02:05:35,089
have to be careful so that that doesn't
shade into tyranny right you can only

7794
02:05:35,089 --> 02:05:35,099
shade into tyranny right you can only
 

7795
02:05:35,099 --> 02:05:36,290
shade into tyranny right you can only
have Liberty to do the thing that I say

7796
02:05:36,290 --> 02:05:36,300
have Liberty to do the thing that I say
 

7797
02:05:36,300 --> 02:05:37,550
have Liberty to do the thing that I say
that you can do

7798
02:05:37,550 --> 02:05:37,560
that you can do
 

7799
02:05:37,560 --> 02:05:39,229
that you can do
but there have to be spheres of Liberty

7800
02:05:39,229 --> 02:05:39,239
but there have to be spheres of Liberty
 

7801
02:05:39,239 --> 02:05:42,229
but there have to be spheres of Liberty
that are roiling and interesting and

7802
02:05:42,229 --> 02:05:42,239
that are roiling and interesting and
 

7803
02:05:42,239 --> 02:05:43,850
that are roiling and interesting and
filled with debate but without

7804
02:05:43,850 --> 02:05:43,860
filled with debate but without
 

7805
02:05:43,860 --> 02:05:46,430
filled with debate but without
threatening the chief institutions that

7806
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:46,440
threatening the chief institutions that
 

7807
02:05:46,440 --> 02:05:47,810
threatening the chief institutions that
surround those Liberties because if you

7808
02:05:47,810 --> 02:05:47,820
surround those Liberties because if you
 

7809
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:49,129
surround those Liberties because if you
destroy the institutions the Liberties

7810
02:05:49,129 --> 02:05:49,139
destroy the institutions the Liberties
 

7811
02:05:49,139 --> 02:05:50,930
destroy the institutions the Liberties
will go too if you knock down the

7812
02:05:50,930 --> 02:05:50,940
will go too if you knock down the
 

7813
02:05:50,940 --> 02:05:52,250
will go too if you knock down the
pillars of the society the Liberties

7814
02:05:52,250 --> 02:05:52,260
pillars of the society the Liberties
 

7815
02:05:52,260 --> 02:05:53,689
pillars of the society the Liberties
that are on top of those pillars are

7816
02:05:53,689 --> 02:05:53,699
that are on top of those pillars are
 

7817
02:05:53,699 --> 02:05:54,890
that are on top of those pillars are
going to collapse and I think that

7818
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:54,900
going to collapse and I think that
 

7819
02:05:54,900 --> 02:05:56,930
going to collapse and I think that
that's if people are feeling as though

7820
02:05:56,930 --> 02:05:56,940
that's if people are feeling as though
 

7821
02:05:56,940 --> 02:05:57,950
that's if people are feeling as though
we're on the verge of tyranny I think

7822
02:05:57,950 --> 02:05:57,960
we're on the verge of tyranny I think
 

7823
02:05:57,960 --> 02:05:59,390
we're on the verge of tyranny I think
that's why

7824
02:05:59,390 --> 02:05:59,400
that's why
 

7825
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,930
that's why
this is fascinating by the way

7826
02:06:01,930 --> 02:06:01,940
this is fascinating by the way
 

7827
02:06:01,940 --> 02:06:04,550
this is fascinating by the way
instrumental perspective on Liberty I'm

7828
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:04,560
instrumental perspective on Liberty I'm
 

7829
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,229
instrumental perspective on Liberty I'm
just gonna have to give me a lot to

7830
02:06:06,229 --> 02:06:06,239
just gonna have to give me a lot to
 

7831
02:06:06,239 --> 02:06:07,070
just gonna have to give me a lot to
think about

7832
02:06:07,070 --> 02:06:07,080
think about
 

7833
02:06:07,080 --> 02:06:10,129
think about
um let me ask a personal question uh was

7834
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:10,139
um let me ask a personal question uh was
 

7835
02:06:10,139 --> 02:06:11,570
um let me ask a personal question uh was
there ever a time that you had a crisis

7836
02:06:11,570 --> 02:06:11,580
there ever a time that you had a crisis
 

7837
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,490
there ever a time that you had a crisis
of Faith where you questioned your

7838
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:13,500
of Faith where you questioned your
 

7839
02:06:13,500 --> 02:06:16,550
of Faith where you questioned your
belief in God sure and I I would less

7840
02:06:16,550 --> 02:06:16,560
belief in God sure and I I would less
 

7841
02:06:16,560 --> 02:06:17,870
belief in God sure and I I would less
call it a crisis of Faith than an

7842
02:06:17,870 --> 02:06:17,880
call it a crisis of Faith than an
 

7843
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:20,089
call it a crisis of Faith than an
ongoing question of Faith which I think

7844
02:06:20,089 --> 02:06:20,099
ongoing question of Faith which I think
 

7845
02:06:20,099 --> 02:06:22,310
ongoing question of Faith which I think
is I hope most religious people

7846
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:22,320
is I hope most religious people
 

7847
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,430
is I hope most religious people
and the the word Israel right in Hebrew

7848
02:06:25,430 --> 02:06:25,440
and the the word Israel right in Hebrew
 

7849
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,649
and the the word Israel right in Hebrew
Israel means to struggle with God that's

word means and so the idea of struggling
 

7855
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,070

to The Human Condition if you understand
 

7863
02:06:39,420 --> 02:06:41,270
to The Human Condition if you understand
what God's doing then I think you're

what God's doing then I think you're
 

7865
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:42,229
what God's doing then I think you're
wrong

7866
02:06:42,229 --> 02:06:42,239
wrong
 

7867
02:06:42,239 --> 02:06:44,270
wrong
and if you think that that question

7868
02:06:44,270 --> 02:06:44,280
and if you think that that question
 

7869
02:06:44,280 --> 02:06:46,010
and if you think that that question
doesn't matter then I think you're also

7870
02:06:46,010 --> 02:06:46,020
doesn't matter then I think you're also
 

7871
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:46,729
doesn't matter then I think you're also
wrong

7872
02:06:46,729 --> 02:06:46,739
wrong
 

7873
02:06:46,739 --> 02:06:48,109
wrong
I think that God is a very necessary

7874
02:06:48,109 --> 02:06:48,119
I think that God is a very necessary
 

7875
02:06:48,119 --> 02:06:51,229
I think that God is a very necessary

life that's right because you're never
going to get to that answer otherwise

7882
02:06:56,209 --> 02:06:56,219
going to get to that answer otherwise
 

7883
02:06:56,219 --> 02:06:58,430
going to get to that answer otherwise
your God you aren't so what does God

allow cruelty and suffering in the world
 

7887
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:03,410
allow cruelty and suffering in the world
one of the tough questions so we're

7888
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:03,420
one of the tough questions so we're
 

7889
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:05,330
one of the tough questions so we're
going deep here uh there there's two

7890
02:07:05,330 --> 02:07:05,340
going deep here uh there there's two
 

7891
02:07:05,340 --> 02:07:07,850
going deep here uh there there's two
types of Cruelty and suffering so if

7892
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:07,860
types of Cruelty and suffering so if
 

7893
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:08,990
types of Cruelty and suffering so if
we're talking about human cruelty and

7894
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:09,000
we're talking about human cruelty and
 

7895
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,609
we're talking about human cruelty and
suffering because God does not intervene

7896
02:07:10,609 --> 02:07:10,619
suffering because God does not intervene
 

7897
02:07:10,619 --> 02:07:13,250
suffering because God does not intervene
to prevent people from exercising their

7898
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:13,260
to prevent people from exercising their
 

7899
02:07:13,260 --> 02:07:15,290
to prevent people from exercising their
free will because to do so would be to

7900
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:15,300
free will because to do so would be to
 

7901
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:17,510
free will because to do so would be to
deprive human beings of the choice that

7902
02:07:17,510 --> 02:07:17,520
deprive human beings of the choice that
 

7903
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:18,649
deprive human beings of the choice that
makes them human

7904
02:07:18,649 --> 02:07:18,659
makes them human
 

7905
02:07:18,659 --> 02:07:20,030
makes them human
and this is the center of the Garden of

7906
02:07:20,030 --> 02:07:20,040
and this is the center of the Garden of
 

7907
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:22,850
and this is the center of the Garden of
Eden basically is that God could make

7908
02:07:22,850 --> 02:07:22,860
Eden basically is that God could make
 

7909
02:07:22,860 --> 02:07:23,930
Eden basically is that God could make
you an angel in which case you wouldn't

7910
02:07:23,930 --> 02:07:23,940
you an angel in which case you wouldn't
 

7911
02:07:23,940 --> 02:07:25,729
you an angel in which case you wouldn't
have the choice to do the wrong thing

7912
02:07:25,729 --> 02:07:25,739
have the choice to do the wrong thing
 

7913
02:07:25,739 --> 02:07:28,250
have the choice to do the wrong thing
but so long as we are going to allow for

7914
02:07:28,250 --> 02:07:28,260
but so long as we are going to allow for
 

7915
02:07:28,260 --> 02:07:30,229
but so long as we are going to allow for
cause and effect in a universe shaped by

7916
02:07:30,229 --> 02:07:30,239
cause and effect in a universe shaped by
 

7917
02:07:30,239 --> 02:07:32,330
cause and effect in a universe shaped by
your choice cruelty and evil are going

7918
02:07:32,330 --> 02:07:32,340
your choice cruelty and evil are going
 

7919
02:07:32,340 --> 02:07:34,490
your choice cruelty and evil are going
to exist and then there's the question

7920
02:07:34,490 --> 02:07:34,500
to exist and then there's the question
 

7921
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,229
to exist and then there's the question
of just the natural cruelty and

7922
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,239
of just the natural cruelty and
 

7923
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:37,970
of just the natural cruelty and
vicissitudes of life

7924
02:07:37,970 --> 02:07:37,980
vicissitudes of life
 

7925
02:07:37,980 --> 02:07:39,470
vicissitudes of life
and the answer there is I think that God

7926
02:07:39,470 --> 02:07:39,480
and the answer there is I think that God
 

7927
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:40,669
and the answer there is I think that God
obscures himself

7928
02:07:40,669 --> 02:07:40,679
obscures himself
 

7929
02:07:40,679 --> 02:07:42,770
obscures himself
I think that if God were to appear in

7930
02:07:42,770 --> 02:07:42,780
I think that if God were to appear in
 

7931
02:07:42,780 --> 02:07:44,750
I think that if God were to appear in
all of his glory to people on a regular

7932
02:07:44,750 --> 02:07:44,760
all of his glory to people on a regular
 

7933
02:07:44,760 --> 02:07:46,669
all of his glory to people on a regular
basis I think they would make

7934
02:07:46,669 --> 02:07:46,679
basis I think they would make
 

7935
02:07:46,679 --> 02:07:48,830
basis I think they would make
faith and you wouldn't need it there'd

7936
02:07:48,830 --> 02:07:48,840
faith and you wouldn't need it there'd
 

7937
02:07:48,840 --> 02:07:50,930
faith and you wouldn't need it there'd
be no such thing as faith right it would

7971
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:22,609

that's why it does say in the Bible that

7998
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
that's why it does say in the Bible that

interesting well we came to something we
 

8093
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:18,950
interesting well we came to something we
disagree on but that may be uh that

8094
02:10:18,950 --> 02:10:18,960
disagree on but that may be uh that
 

8095
02:10:18,960 --> 02:10:20,750
disagree on but that may be uh that
might reflect itself in our approach to

8096
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:20,760
might reflect itself in our approach to
 

8097
02:10:20,760 --> 02:10:23,570
might reflect itself in our approach to
Twitter as well I think if humans are

8098
02:10:23,570 --> 02:10:23,580
Twitter as well I think if humans are
 

8099
02:10:23,580 --> 02:10:25,250
Twitter as well I think if humans are
left on their own

8100
02:10:25,250 --> 02:10:25,260
left on their own
 

8101
02:10:25,260 --> 02:10:28,310
left on their own
uh they they attend towards good

8102
02:10:28,310 --> 02:10:28,320
uh they they attend towards good
 

8103
02:10:28,320 --> 02:10:30,229
uh they they attend towards good
they definitely have the capacity for

8104
02:10:30,229 --> 02:10:30,239
they definitely have the capacity for
 

8105
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:32,689
they definitely have the capacity for
good and evil but I when left on their

8106
02:10:32,689 --> 02:10:32,699
good and evil but I when left on their
 

8107
02:10:32,699 --> 02:10:33,890
good and evil but I when left on their
own there

8108
02:10:33,890 --> 02:10:33,900
own there
 

8109
02:10:33,900 --> 02:10:36,290
own there
um I I tend to believe they're good

8110
02:10:36,290 --> 02:10:36,300
um I I tend to believe they're good
 

8111
02:10:36,300 --> 02:10:37,729
um I I tend to believe they're good
I think they might be good with limits

8112
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:37,739
I think they might be good with limits
 

8113
02:10:37,739 --> 02:10:39,589
I think they might be good with limits
what I mean by that is that what the

8114
02:10:39,589 --> 02:10:39,599
what I mean by that is that what the
 

8115
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:41,209
what I mean by that is that what the
evidence I think tends to show is that

8116
02:10:41,209 --> 02:10:41,219
evidence I think tends to show is that
 

8117
02:10:41,219 --> 02:10:44,089
evidence I think tends to show is that
human beings are quite tribal so what

8118
02:10:44,089 --> 02:10:44,099
human beings are quite tribal so what
 

8119
02:10:44,099 --> 02:10:45,350
human beings are quite tribal so what
you'll end up with is people who are

8120
02:10:45,350 --> 02:10:45,360
you'll end up with is people who are
 

8121
02:10:45,360 --> 02:10:46,550
you'll end up with is people who are
good with their immediate family and

8122
02:10:46,550 --> 02:10:46,560
good with their immediate family and
 

8123
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:47,810
good with their immediate family and
maybe their immediate neighbors and then

8124
02:10:47,810 --> 02:10:47,820
maybe their immediate neighbors and then
 

8125
02:10:47,820 --> 02:10:48,830
maybe their immediate neighbors and then
when they're threatened by an outside

8126
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:48,840
when they're threatened by an outside
 

8127
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:50,750
when they're threatened by an outside
tribe then they kill everyone

8128
02:10:50,750 --> 02:10:50,760
tribe then they kill everyone
 

8129
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,910
tribe then they kill everyone
which is sort of the history of

8130
02:10:52,910 --> 02:10:52,920
which is sort of the history of
 

8131
02:10:52,920 --> 02:10:54,290
which is sort of the history of
civilization in the pre-civilizational

8132
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:54,300
civilization in the pre-civilizational
 

8133
02:10:54,300 --> 02:10:55,750
civilization in the pre-civilizational
era which was a very violent time

8134
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,760
era which was a very violent time
 

8135
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,770
era which was a very violent time
pre-civilization later was quite violent

8136
02:10:57,770 --> 02:10:57,780
pre-civilization later was quite violent
 

8137
02:10:57,780 --> 02:11:00,470
pre-civilization later was quite violent
do you think on the topic of tribalism

8138
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,480
do you think on the topic of tribalism
 

8139
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,330
do you think on the topic of tribalism
in our modern world

8140
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:02,340
in our modern world
 

8141
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:05,450
in our modern world
what are the pros and cons of tribes is

8142
02:11:05,450 --> 02:11:05,460
what are the pros and cons of tribes is
 

8143
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:07,189
what are the pros and cons of tribes is
that something we we should try to

8144
02:11:07,189 --> 02:11:07,199
that something we we should try to
 

8145
02:11:07,199 --> 02:11:09,229
that something we we should try to
outgrow as a civilization I don't think

8146
02:11:09,229 --> 02:11:09,239
outgrow as a civilization I don't think
 

8147
02:11:09,239 --> 02:11:10,790
outgrow as a civilization I don't think
it's ever going to be possible to fully

8148
02:11:10,790 --> 02:11:10,800
it's ever going to be possible to fully
 

8149
02:11:10,800 --> 02:11:12,709
it's ever going to be possible to fully
outgrow tribalism

8150
02:11:12,709 --> 02:11:12,719
outgrow tribalism
 

8151
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:14,510
outgrow tribalism
I think it's a natural human condition

8152
02:11:14,510 --> 02:11:14,520
I think it's a natural human condition
 

8153
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:17,390
I think it's a natural human condition
to want to be with people who think like

8154
02:11:17,390 --> 02:11:17,400
to want to be with people who think like
 

8155
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:20,030
to want to be with people who think like
you or have a common set of beliefs and

8156
02:11:20,030 --> 02:11:20,040
you or have a common set of beliefs and
 

8157
02:11:20,040 --> 02:11:21,410
you or have a common set of beliefs and
I think trying to obliterate that in the

8158
02:11:21,410 --> 02:11:21,420
I think trying to obliterate that in the
 

8159
02:11:21,420 --> 02:11:23,270
I think trying to obliterate that in the
name of a universalism likely leads to

8160
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
name of a universalism likely leads to
 

8161
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,070
name of a universalism likely leads to
utopian results that have devastating

8162
02:11:25,070 --> 02:11:25,080
utopian results that have devastating
 

8163
02:11:25,080 --> 02:11:26,870
utopian results that have devastating
consequences utopian sort of

8164
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:26,880
consequences utopian sort of
 

8165
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:29,510
consequences utopian sort of
universalism has been failing every time

8166
02:11:29,510 --> 02:11:29,520
universalism has been failing every time
 

8167
02:11:29,520 --> 02:11:31,370
universalism has been failing every time
it's tried whether you're talking about

8168
02:11:31,370 --> 02:11:31,380
it's tried whether you're talking about
 

8169
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:33,350
it's tried whether you're talking about
now it seems to be sort of a liberal

8170
02:11:33,350 --> 02:11:33,360
now it seems to be sort of a liberal
 

8171
02:11:33,360 --> 02:11:35,390
now it seems to be sort of a liberal
universalism which is being rejected by

8172
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:35,400
universalism which is being rejected by
 

8173
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:36,830
universalism which is being rejected by
a huge number of people around the world

8174
02:11:36,830 --> 02:11:36,840
a huge number of people around the world
 

8175
02:11:36,840 --> 02:11:38,390
a huge number of people around the world
in various different cultures whether

8176
02:11:38,390 --> 02:11:38,400
in various different cultures whether
 

8177
02:11:38,400 --> 02:11:39,609
in various different cultures whether
you're talking about religious

8178
02:11:39,609 --> 02:11:39,619
you're talking about religious
 

8179
02:11:39,619 --> 02:11:42,250
you're talking about religious
universalism which typically comes with

8180
02:11:42,250 --> 02:11:42,260
universalism which typically comes with
 

8181
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:44,810
universalism which typically comes with
religious tyranny or they're talking

8182
02:11:44,810 --> 02:11:44,820
religious tyranny or they're talking
 

8183
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:47,870
religious tyranny or they're talking
about communistic or a nazisk sort of

8184
02:11:47,870 --> 02:11:47,880
about communistic or a nazisk sort of
 

8185
02:11:47,880 --> 02:11:49,370
about communistic or a nazisk sort of
universalism which comes with mass water

8186
02:11:49,370 --> 02:11:49,380
universalism which comes with mass water
 

8187
02:11:49,380 --> 02:11:51,530
universalism which comes with mass water
so this is you know universalism I'm not

8188
02:11:51,530 --> 02:11:51,540
so this is you know universalism I'm not
 

8189
02:11:51,540 --> 02:11:54,169
so this is you know universalism I'm not
a believer in uh I think that you have

8190
02:11:54,169 --> 02:11:54,179
a believer in uh I think that you have
 

8191
02:11:54,179 --> 02:11:56,209
a believer in uh I think that you have
you know some values that are fairly

8192
02:11:56,209 --> 02:11:56,219
you know some values that are fairly
 

8193
02:11:56,219 --> 02:11:58,310
you know some values that are fairly
limited that all human beings should

8194
02:11:58,310 --> 02:11:58,320
limited that all human beings should
 

8195
02:11:58,320 --> 02:12:00,830
limited that all human beings should
hold in common and that's pretty much it

8196
02:12:00,830 --> 02:12:00,840
hold in common and that's pretty much it
 

8197
02:12:00,840 --> 02:12:02,750
hold in common and that's pretty much it
like I think that everybody should have

8198
02:12:02,750 --> 02:12:02,760
like I think that everybody should have
 

8199
02:12:02,760 --> 02:12:05,689
like I think that everybody should have
the ability to join with their own

8200
02:12:05,689 --> 02:12:05,699
the ability to join with their own
 

8201
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:07,790
the ability to join with their own
culture I think how we Define tribes a

8202
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:07,800
culture I think how we Define tribes a
 

8203
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:09,229
culture I think how we Define tribes a
different thing yeah so I think that

8204
02:12:09,229 --> 02:12:09,239
different thing yeah so I think that
 

8205
02:12:09,239 --> 02:12:11,030
different thing yeah so I think that
that tribes should not be defined by

8206
02:12:11,030 --> 02:12:11,040
that tribes should not be defined by
 

8207
02:12:11,040 --> 02:12:12,649
that tribes should not be defined by
innate physical characteristics for

8208
02:12:12,649 --> 02:12:12,659
innate physical characteristics for
 

8209
02:12:12,659 --> 02:12:13,430
innate physical characteristics for
example

8210
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,440
example
 

8211
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:15,530
example
because I think that thank God as a

8212
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:15,540
because I think that thank God as a
 

8213
02:12:15,540 --> 02:12:17,450
because I think that thank God as a
civilization we've outgrown that and I

8214
02:12:17,450 --> 02:12:17,460
civilization we've outgrown that and I
 

8215
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:19,550
civilization we've outgrown that and I
think that that is um

8216
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:19,560
think that that is um
 

8217
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:21,609
think that that is um
that is a childish way to view the world

8218
02:12:21,609 --> 02:12:21,619
that is a childish way to view the world
 

8219
02:12:21,619 --> 02:12:23,990
that is a childish way to view the world
and all the tall people aren't a tribe

8220
02:12:23,990 --> 02:12:24,000
and all the tall people aren't a tribe
 

8221
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,490
and all the tall people aren't a tribe
all the black people know all the white

8222
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:25,500
all the black people know all the white
 

8223
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:27,290
all the black people know all the white
people aren't a tribe so the tribes

8224
02:12:27,290 --> 02:12:27,300
people aren't a tribe so the tribes
 

8225
02:12:27,300 --> 02:12:28,970
people aren't a tribe so the tribes
should be formed over ideas versus

8226
02:12:28,970 --> 02:12:28,980
should be formed over ideas versus
 

8227
02:12:28,980 --> 02:12:30,290
should be formed over ideas versus
physical characters that's right which

8228
02:12:30,290 --> 02:12:30,300
physical characters that's right which
 

8229
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:31,729
physical characters that's right which
is why actually to go back to sort of

8230
02:12:31,729 --> 02:12:31,739
is why actually to go back to sort of
 

8231
02:12:31,739 --> 02:12:32,689
is why actually to go back to sort of
the beginning of the conversation when

8232
02:12:32,689 --> 02:12:32,699
the beginning of the conversation when
 

8233
02:12:32,699 --> 02:12:35,149
the beginning of the conversation when
it comes to Jews you know I I'm not a

8234
02:12:35,149 --> 02:12:35,159
it comes to Jews you know I I'm not a
 

8235
02:12:35,159 --> 02:12:36,649
it comes to Jews you know I I'm not a
big idea I'm not a big believer in

8236
02:12:36,649 --> 02:12:36,659
big idea I'm not a big believer in
 

8237

ethnic Judaism right I'm I'm as a person

8238
02:12:39,530 --> 02:12:39,540
ethnic Judaism right I'm I'm as a person
 

8239
02:12:39,540 --> 02:12:41,810
ethnic Judaism right I'm I'm as a person
who takes Judaism seriously Judaism is

8240
02:12:41,810 --> 02:12:41,820
who takes Judaism seriously Judaism is
 

8241
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:43,010
who takes Judaism seriously Judaism is
more to me than you were born with the

8242
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:43,020
more to me than you were born with the
 

8243
02:12:43,020 --> 02:12:45,649
more to me than you were born with the
last name like Berg or Steen and so I

8244
02:12:45,649 --> 02:12:45,659
last name like Berg or Steen and so I
 

8245
02:12:45,659 --> 02:12:47,930
last name like Berg or Steen and so I
just agree with you but he would

8246
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:47,940
just agree with you but he would
 

8247
02:12:47,940 --> 02:12:48,890
just agree with you but he would
disagree with me but that's because he

8248
02:12:48,890 --> 02:12:48,900

child in durable values that is going to
bring them up healthy capable of

02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:56,760
capacity for Innovation that'd be being
 

8321
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,970
capacity for Innovation that'd be being
a good father right being a good spouse

protecting the fellow citizens of your
community while incentivizing them to

02:14:13,550 --> 02:14:13,560
community while incentivizing them to
 

8335
02:14:13,560 --> 02:14:16,310
community while incentivizing them to
build for themselves and they it becomes

8336
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
build for themselves and they it becomes
 

8337
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,410
build for themselves and they it becomes
actually much easier to to think of how

actually much easier to to think of how
to this is why I like the role Theory

to this is why I like the role Theory
 

8341
02:14:19,560 --> 02:14:22,010
to this is why I like the role Theory
because it's very hard since sort of in

02:17:33,780 --> 02:17:35,870
that apply to like 20 and then we get to
the solutions that involve 200 people or

8560
02:17:35,870 --> 02:17:35,880
the solutions that involve 200 people or
 

8561
02:17:35,880 --> 02:17:37,490
the solutions that involve 200 people or
a thousand people let's solve that stuff

8562
02:17:37,490 --> 02:17:37,500
a thousand people let's solve that stuff
 

8563
02:17:37,500 --> 02:17:40,009
a thousand people let's solve that stuff
and I think the solutions at the higher

8564
02:17:40,009 --> 02:17:40,019
and I think the solutions at the higher
 

8565
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:42,230
and I think the solutions at the higher
level flow bottom up not top down what

8566
02:17:42,230 --> 02:17:42,240
level flow bottom up not top down what
 

8567
02:17:42,240 --> 02:17:45,290
level flow bottom up not top down what

dreamer my mom is much more practical
 

8639
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:54,589
dreamer my mom is much more practical
and so you know the the sort of lessons

8640
02:18:54,589 --> 02:18:54,599
and so you know the the sort of lessons
 

8641
02:18:54,599 --> 02:18:56,450
and so you know the the sort of lessons
that I learned from my dad are that you

8642
02:18:56,450 --> 02:18:56,460
that I learned from my dad are that you
 

8643
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:58,549
that I learned from my dad are that you
can have this is sort of the the counter

8644
02:18:58,549 --> 02:18:58,559
can have this is sort of the the counter
 

8645
02:18:58,559 --> 02:18:59,629
can have this is sort of the the counter
lesson is that you can have a good idea

8646
02:18:59,629 --> 02:18:59,639
lesson is that you can have a good idea
 

8647
02:18:59,639 --> 02:19:00,650
lesson is that you can have a good idea
but if you don't have a plan from

8648
02:19:00,650 --> 02:19:00,660
but if you don't have a plan from
 

8649
02:19:00,660 --> 02:19:02,209
but if you don't have a plan from
implementation then it doesn't end up as

8650
02:19:02,209 --> 02:19:02,219
implementation then it doesn't end up as
 

8651
02:19:02,219 --> 02:19:03,950
implementation then it doesn't end up as
reality and I think actually he's

8652
02:19:03,950 --> 02:19:03,960
reality and I think actually he's
 

8653
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:05,330
reality and I think actually he's
learned that better over the course of

8654
02:19:05,330 --> 02:19:05,340

02:27:01,560 --> 02:27:02,630
different senses meaning that when I
talk about love what I think of

9148

friends yeah okay but I'm but I think
 

9159
02:27:12,780 --> 02:27:15,650
friends yeah okay but I'm but I think
that it's that using that same term to

9160
02:27:15,650 --> 02:27:15,660
that it's that using that same term to
 

9161
02:27:15,660 --> 02:27:17,210
that it's that using that same term to
describe how I feel about strangers I

describe how I feel about strangers I
 

9163
02:27:17,220 --> 02:27:18,950
describe how I feel about strangers I
think would just be inaccurate and so

9164
02:27:18,950 --> 02:27:18,960
think would just be inaccurate and so
 

9165
02:27:18,960 --> 02:27:20,929
think would just be inaccurate and so
that's why I'm I'm suggesting that

9166
02:27:20,929 --> 02:27:20,939
that's why I'm I'm suggesting that
 

9167
02:27:20,939 --> 02:27:22,790
that's why I'm I'm suggesting that
respect might be a more solid and

9168
02:27:22,790 --> 02:27:22,800
respect might be a more solid and
 

9169
02:27:22,800 --> 02:27:25,550
respect might be a more solid and
realistic foundation for the way that we

9170
02:27:25,550 --> 02:27:25,560
realistic foundation for the way that we
 

9171
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:27,230
realistic foundation for the way that we

Social Network aspect that doesn't is
 

9237
02:28:25,080 --> 02:28:26,929
Social Network aspect that doesn't is
not constrained by geography

9238
02:28:26,929 --> 02:28:26,939
not constrained by geography
 

9239
02:28:26,939 --> 02:28:28,910
not constrained by geography
yeah I'm gonna differ with you on the

9240
02:28:28,910 --> 02:28:28,920
yeah I'm gonna differ with you on the
 

9241
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:30,050
yeah I'm gonna differ with you on the
interpretation on that but in any case

9242
02:28:30,050 --> 02:28:30,060
interpretation on that but in any case
 

9243
02:28:30,060 --> 02:28:32,630
interpretation on that but in any case
yeah uh the the sort of uh you know the

9244
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,640
yeah uh the the sort of uh you know the
 

9245
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:35,750
yeah uh the the sort of uh you know the
the kind of extension of

9246
02:28:35,750 --> 02:28:35,760
the kind of extension of
 

9247
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:37,610
the kind of extension of
love outwards might be too big and ask

9248
02:28:37,610 --> 02:28:37,620
love outwards might be too big and ask
 

9249
02:28:37,620 --> 02:28:39,110
love outwards might be too big and ask
so maybe we can start with respect and

9250
02:28:39,110 --> 02:28:39,120
so maybe we can start with respect and
 

9251
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:40,910
so maybe we can start with respect and
then hopefully out of that respect can

9252
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:40,920
then hopefully out of that respect can
 

9253
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:43,849
then hopefully out of that respect can
grow something more if people earn their

9254
02:28:43,849 --> 02:28:43,859
grow something more if people earn their
 

9255
02:28:43,859 --> 02:28:46,010
grow something more if people earn their
way in because I think that one of the

9256
02:28:46,010 --> 02:28:46,020
way in because I think that one of the
 

9257
02:28:46,020 --> 02:28:46,849
way in because I think that one of the
big problems when we were talking about

9258
02:28:46,849 --> 02:28:46,859
big problems when we were talking about
 

9259
02:28:46,859 --> 02:28:48,469
big problems when we were talking about
universalism is when people say like I'm

9260
02:28:48,469 --> 02:28:48,479
universalism is when people say like I'm
 

9261
02:28:48,479 --> 02:28:50,570
universalism is when people say like I'm
a world citizen I love people of the

9262
02:28:50,570 --> 02:28:50,580
a world citizen I love people of the
 

9263
02:28:50,580 --> 02:28:51,889
a world citizen I love people of the
other country as much as I love myself

9264
02:28:51,889 --> 02:28:51,899
other country as much as I love myself
 

9265
02:28:51,899 --> 02:28:55,010
other country as much as I love myself
or as much as I love my country it tends

9266
02:28:55,010 --> 02:28:55,020
or as much as I love my country it tends
 

9267
02:28:55,020 --> 02:28:57,710
or as much as I love my country it tends
to actually lead to an almost cram down

9268
02:28:57,710 --> 02:28:57,720
to actually lead to an almost cram down
 

9269
02:28:57,720 --> 02:28:59,210
to actually lead to an almost cram down
utopianism

9270
02:28:59,210 --> 02:28:59,220
utopianism
 

9271
02:28:59,220 --> 02:29:01,490
utopianism
uh that I think can be kind of difficult

9272
02:29:01,490 --> 02:29:01,500
uh that I think can be kind of difficult
 

9273
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:03,410
uh that I think can be kind of difficult
because with love comes a certain

9274
02:29:03,410 --> 02:29:03,420
because with love comes a certain
 

9275
02:29:03,420 --> 02:29:06,170
because with love comes a certain
expectation of of solidarity

9276
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,180
expectation of of solidarity
 

9277
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:08,630
expectation of of solidarity
and I think right I mean when you love

9278
02:29:08,630 --> 02:29:08,640
and I think right I mean when you love
 

9279
02:29:08,640 --> 02:29:09,650
and I think right I mean when you love
your family you love your wife like

9280
02:29:09,650 --> 02:29:09,660
your family you love your wife like
 

9281
02:29:09,660 --> 02:29:11,150
your family you love your wife like
there's a certain level of solidarity

9282
02:29:11,150 --> 02:29:11,160
there's a certain level of solidarity
 

9283
02:29:11,160 --> 02:29:12,590
there's a certain level of solidarity
that is required inside the home in

9284
02:29:12,590 --> 02:29:12,600
that is required inside the home in
 

9285
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:13,849
that is required inside the home in
order to preserve the most loving kind

9286
02:29:13,849 --> 02:29:13,859
order to preserve the most loving kind
 

9287
02:29:13,859 --> 02:29:15,770
order to preserve the most loving kind
of home and so if you love everybody

9288
02:29:15,770 --> 02:29:15,780
of home and so if you love everybody
 

9289
02:29:15,780 --> 02:29:17,330
of home and so if you love everybody
then that sort of implies a certain

9290
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:17,340
then that sort of implies a certain
 

9291
02:29:17,340 --> 02:29:18,710
then that sort of implies a certain
level of solidarity that may not exist

9292
02:29:18,710 --> 02:29:18,720
level of solidarity that may not exist
 

9293
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:21,349
level of solidarity that may not exist
so maybe the idea is for me

9294
02:29:21,349 --> 02:29:21,359
so maybe the idea is for me
 

9295
02:29:21,359 --> 02:29:22,969
so maybe the idea is for me
start with respect and then maybe as

9296
02:29:22,969 --> 02:29:22,979
start with respect and then maybe as
 

9297
02:29:22,979 --> 02:29:24,650
start with respect and then maybe as
people respect each other more then love

9298
02:29:24,650 --> 02:29:24,660
people respect each other more then love
 

9299
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:25,910
people respect each other more then love
is an outgrowth of that as opposed to

9300
02:29:25,910 --> 02:29:25,920
is an outgrowth of that as opposed to
 

9301
02:29:25,920 --> 02:29:27,170
is an outgrowth of that as opposed to
starting with love and then hoping that

9302
02:29:27,170 --> 02:29:27,180
starting with love and then hoping that
 

9303
02:29:27,180 --> 02:29:28,610
starting with love and then hoping that
respect develops yeah there's a danger

9304
02:29:28,610 --> 02:29:28,620
respect develops yeah there's a danger
 

9305
02:29:28,620 --> 02:29:31,429
respect develops yeah there's a danger
that that word becomes empty and instead

9306
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
that that word becomes empty and instead
 

9307
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:33,950
that that word becomes empty and instead
is used for dogmatic kind of

9308
02:29:33,950 --> 02:29:33,960
is used for dogmatic kind of
 

9309
02:29:33,960 --> 02:29:35,349
is used for dogmatic kind of
um

9310
02:29:35,349 --> 02:29:35,359
um
 

9311
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:37,670
um
utopianism I mean this is this is the

9312
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:37,680
utopianism I mean this is this is the
 

9313
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:38,750
utopianism I mean this is this is the
way that for example religious
