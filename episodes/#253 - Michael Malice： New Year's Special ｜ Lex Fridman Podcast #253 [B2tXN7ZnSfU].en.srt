epistemology and so on and so forth um
 

167
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,509
epistemology and so on and so forth um
but that is something that is real in

168
00:03:09,509 --> 00:03:09,519
but that is something that is real in
 

169
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,470
but that is something that is real in
here

170
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
here
 

171
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,350
here
so i completely disagree with his

172
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
so i completely disagree with his
 

173
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,030
so i completely disagree with his
analysis of that and i don't know if

174
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
analysis of that and i don't know if
 

175
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,630
analysis of that and i don't know if
it'll save the world but it's certainly

176
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
it'll save the world but it's certainly
 

177
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,550
it'll save the world but it's certainly
a prerequisite and what's the point of

178
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:18,560
a prerequisite and what's the point of
 

179
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,670
a prerequisite and what's the point of
fighting

180
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:19,680
fighting
 

181
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,670
fighting
for your values if you don't want to

182
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:21,680
for your values if you don't want to
 

183
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,190
for your values if you don't want to
make the world a more beautiful place

184
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,200
make the world a more beautiful place
 

185
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,710
make the world a more beautiful place
well it's also how you define beauty

186
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:24,720
well it's also how you define beauty
 

187
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,309
well it's also how you define beauty
because beauty could be just aesthetic

188
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:26,319
because beauty could be just aesthetic
 

189
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,350
because beauty could be just aesthetic
beauty it could be art of course art

190
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:29,360
beauty it could be art of course art
 

191
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,229
beauty it could be art of course art
could be

192
00:03:30,229 --> 00:03:30,239
could be
 

193
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,110
could be
could encompass a lot a lot more than

194
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
could encompass a lot a lot more than
 

195
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,710
could encompass a lot a lot more than
just literature and paintings it can

196
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:34,720
just literature and paintings it can
 

197
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,149
just literature and paintings it can
encompass

198
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:36,159
encompass
 

199
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,390
encompass
the full

200
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:38,400
the full
 

201
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,550
the full
life the full dance of life

202
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,560
life the full dance of life
 

203
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,390
life the full dance of life
but then beauty could be something

204
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:42,400
but then beauty could be something
 

205
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,070
but then beauty could be something
just uh

206
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
just uh
 

207
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,589
just uh
deeper like

208
00:03:45,589 --> 00:03:45,599
deeper like
 

209
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,070
deeper like
whatever that aw you feel

210
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
whatever that aw you feel
 

211
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,509
whatever that aw you feel
when you pause

212
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
when you pause
 

213
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,750
when you pause
and hear the music

214
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:51,760
and hear the music
 

215
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,470
and hear the music
just

216
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:52,480
just
 

217
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,830
just
hear

218
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
hear
 

219
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,229
hear
and like look up at the stars like for

220
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:56,239
and like look up at the stars like for
 

221
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,309
and like look up at the stars like for
some reason when i see rockets go up for

222
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
some reason when i see rockets go up for
 

223
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,630
some reason when i see rockets go up for
me it's like science what is that

224
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
me it's like science what is that
 

225
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,710
me it's like science what is that
the awe that we're able to accomplish

226
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:02,720
the awe that we're able to accomplish
 

227
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,550
the awe that we're able to accomplish
that as humans you know that's funny

228
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:04,560
that as humans you know that's funny
 

229
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,830
that as humans you know that's funny
because you know there's lots of

230
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:05,840
because you know there's lots of
 

231
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,670
because you know there's lots of
different schools of thought like these

232
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:07,680
different schools of thought like these
 

233
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,670
different schools of thought like these
people versus these people and and you

234
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:09,680
people versus these people and and you
 

235
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,229
people versus these people and and you
know maybe vegans versus uh

236
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,239
know maybe vegans versus uh
 

237
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,869
know maybe vegans versus uh
steakhouse people i think in terms of

238
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
steakhouse people i think in terms of
 

239
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,949
steakhouse people i think in terms of
the sciences and i guess you and i would

240
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:16,959
the sciences and i guess you and i would
 

241
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,629
the sciences and i guess you and i would
be on opposite sides here

242
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:18,639
be on opposite sides here
 

243
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,469
be on opposite sides here
you have the

244
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:20,479
you have the
 

245
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,790
you have the
astronomy people versus the zoology

246
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:22,800
astronomy people versus the zoology
 

247
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,749
astronomy people versus the zoology
people

248
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
people
 

249
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,749
people
like the the big question is would you

250
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:25,759
like the the big question is would you
 

251
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:26,710
like the the big question is would you
rather

252
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
rather
 

253
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,670
rather
spend

254
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
spend
 

255
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,189
spend
10 minutes on the moon or would you

256
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
10 minutes on the moon or would you
 

257
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,749
10 minutes on the moon or would you
rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea

258
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea
 

259
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,550
rather spend 10 minutes in the deep sea
and for me it's clearly the deep sea

260
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:34,560
and for me it's clearly the deep sea
 

261
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,550
and for me it's clearly the deep sea
the zoology that's down there there's

262
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:36,560
the zoology that's down there there's
 

263
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,749
the zoology that's down there there's
something i would encourage people to

264
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:37,759
something i would encourage people to
 

265
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,629
something i would encourage people to
look up

266
00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:38,639
look up
 

267
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,430
look up
called deep staria which is a jellyfish

268
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
called deep staria which is a jellyfish
 

269
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,430
called deep staria which is a jellyfish
then the scientists what's amazing when

270
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
then the scientists what's amazing when
 

271
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,590
then the scientists what's amazing when
you watch these deep-sea dives

272
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:45,600
you watch these deep-sea dives
 

273
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,390
you watch these deep-sea dives
on youtube is that the scientists are

274
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:48,400
on youtube is that the scientists are
 

275
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,670
on youtube is that the scientists are
they're they're nature dorks like

857
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,310
feeds power into the brain to where it
deludes you completely and then you

858
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:52,320
deludes you completely and then you
 

859
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,110
deludes you completely and then you
start

it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an
omelet kind of reasoning and you run

864
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
omelet kind of reasoning and you run
 

865
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,949
omelet kind of reasoning and you run
into trouble it seems like it's much

866
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
into trouble it seems like it's much
 

867
00:14:58,959 --> 00:14:59,829
into trouble it seems like it's much
better

868
00:14:59,829 --> 00:14:59,839
better
 

869
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,430
better
even when you have the power and the

870
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:01,440
even when you have the power and the
 

871
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,990
even when you have the power and the
money and so on to achieve scale to

money and so on to achieve scale to
 

873
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,550
money and so on to achieve scale to
focus on one and then

874
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:06,560
focus on one and then
 

875
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,790
focus on one and then
or locally yeah locally yeah right

876
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:08,800
or locally yeah locally yeah right
 

877
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,750
or locally yeah locally yeah right
because then suppose you have the

878
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:09,760
because then suppose you have the
 

879
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,509
because then suppose you have the
feedback exactly right so if you have

880
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:11,519
feedback exactly right so if you have
 

881
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,269
feedback exactly right so if you have
some kind of program you know in austin

882
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
some kind of program you know in austin
 

883
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,030
some kind of program you know in austin
or brooklyn or something like that and

884
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:15,040
or brooklyn or something like that and
 

885
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,470
or brooklyn or something like that and
you're you can you can watch oh this is

886
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:16,480
you're you can you can watch oh this is
 

887
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,590
you're you can you can watch oh this is
working this isn't working then you

888
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
working this isn't working then you
 

889
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,590
working this isn't working then you
could port it out to other places but

890
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
could port it out to other places but
 

891
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,990

top-down helping is you know

892

893
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,189
top-down helping is you know
at the very least it's going to be

894
00:15:23,189 --> 00:15:23,199
at the very least it's going to be
 

895
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,110
at the very least it's going to be
inefficient and also i think it's a lot

896
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,120
inefficient and also i think it's a lot
 

897
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,189
inefficient and also i think it's a lot
more useful when you're helping people

898
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:27,199
more useful when you're helping people
 

899
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,629
more useful when you're helping people
when it's a one-on-one

900
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:28,639
when it's a one-on-one
 

901
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,030
when it's a one-on-one
relationship because then it's less i

902
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
relationship because then it's less i
 

903
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,470
relationship because then it's less i
don't know embarrassing but certainly

don't know embarrassing but certainly
less something to receive help and you

906
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
less something to receive help and you
 

907
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,629
less something to receive help and you
also feel if it's one thing if you get a

908
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
also feel if it's one thing if you get a
 

909
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,910
also feel if it's one thing if you get a
check from the government you know food

910

between science and writing because the
 

1883
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,430
between science and writing because the
scientific process itself is fun as [\h__\h]

1884
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:57,440
scientific process itself is fun as [\h__\h]
 

1885

reason you go into
 

1893
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,110
reason you go into
uh science is you can continue really

1894
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:09,120
uh science is you can continue really
 

1895
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,669

that are manipulative but i think you
like that bad example because like let's

2248
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
like that bad example because like let's
 

2249
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,230
like that bad example because like let's
look at clinton and let's look at obama

being an uncle now is kid logic
 

2631
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,309
being an uncle now is kid logic
because there have very little bit of

2632
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:22,319
because there have very little bit of
 

2633
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,950
because there have very little bit of
data but they're using logic to make

2634
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
data but they're using logic to make
 

2635
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,710
data but they're using logic to make
sense of it and sometimes it gives them

2636
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
sense of it and sometimes it gives them
 

2637
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,550
sense of it and sometimes it gives them
to the completely wrong conclusions for

2638
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
to the completely wrong conclusions for
 

2639
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,309
to the completely wrong conclusions for
the completely right reasons

2640
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:30,319
the completely right reasons
 

2641
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:31,589
the completely right reasons
i remember

2642
00:44:31,589 --> 00:44:31,599
i remember
 

2643
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:32,870
i remember
you know i

2644
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880

kitchen and i'd be scared in the dark a
 

2649
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,390
kitchen and i'd be scared in the dark a
little bit so they'd leave the light on

2650
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:38,400
little bit so they'd leave the light on
 

2651
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,309
little bit so they'd leave the light on
the kitchen while i went to sleep

the kitchen while i went to sleep
 

2653

and
 

2655
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:43,589
and
at the same time my parents had told me

2656
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
at the same time my parents had told me
 

2657

it's you could think of it as a
nonlinear dynamical system okay from an

nonlinear dynamical system okay from an
 

2959
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,349
nonlinear dynamical system okay from an
engineering perspective

2960
00:50:09,349 --> 00:50:09,359
engineering perspective
 

2961
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,230

it feels like you can solve a lot of
 

2995
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,150
it feels like you can solve a lot of
problems by allowing yourself to just uh

2996
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
problems by allowing yourself to just uh
 

2997
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,910
problems by allowing yourself to just uh
be emotional and

2998

also jim keller who's
 

5521
01:35:47,600 --> 01:35:49,270
also jim keller who's
worked with elon uh so i've had

5522
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:49,280
worked with elon uh so i've had
 

5523
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,950
worked with elon uh so i've had
conversations with them because it's

5524
01:35:50,950 --> 01:35:50,960
conversations with them because it's
 

5525
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,149
conversations with them because it's
just my line of work they're realizing

5526
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,159
just my line of work they're realizing
 

5527
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,669
just my line of work they're realizing
that everything is possible in this

5528
01:35:55,669 --> 01:35:55,679
that everything is possible in this
 

5529
01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:57,270
that everything is possible in this
world yeah yeah

5530
01:35:57,270 --> 01:35:57,280
world yeah yeah
 

5531
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:59,669
world yeah yeah
which is not the russian mindset yeah

5532
01:35:59,669 --> 01:35:59,679
which is not the russian mindset yeah
 

5533
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,750
which is not the russian mindset yeah
well okay all right that's

5534
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:01,760
well okay all right that's
 

5535
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,270
well okay all right that's
let's uh

5536
01:36:05,270 --> 01:36:05,280

 

5537
01:36:05,280 --> 01:36:07,350

style it down a notch

5538
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:07,360
style it down a notch
 

5539
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,590
style it down a notch
yeah it's uh when elon calls first

5540
01:36:09,590 --> 01:36:09,600
yeah it's uh when elon calls first
 

5541
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,709
yeah it's uh when elon calls first
principles thinking but really it's just

5542
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
principles thinking but really it's just
 

5543
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,390
principles thinking but really it's just
not being limited by the constraints of

5544
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:14,400
not being limited by the constraints of
 

5545
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,350
not being limited by the constraints of
the past yes and so saying like okay

5546
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
the past yes and so saying like okay
 

5547
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,870
the past yes and so saying like okay
this is how things have been done but

5548
01:36:18,870 --> 01:36:18,880
this is how things have been done but
 

5549
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,950
this is how things have been done but
can be done much much better

5550
01:36:20,950 --> 01:36:20,960
can be done much much better
 

5551
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:23,109
can be done much much better
and uh that has to do with manufacture

5552
01:36:23,109 --> 01:36:23,119
and uh that has to do with manufacture
 

5553
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:26,390
and uh that has to do with manufacture
like how do we how do we do this 10

5554
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:26,400
like how do we how do we do this 10
 

5555
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:28,550
like how do we how do we do this 10
times cheaper

5556
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:28,560
times cheaper
 

5557
01:36:28,560 --> 01:36:30,390
times cheaper
like everyone says it's this it's super

5558
01:36:30,390 --> 01:36:30,400
like everyone says it's this it's super
 

5559
01:36:30,400 --> 01:36:32,390
like everyone says it's this it's super
expensive but is it does it really need

5560
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:32,400
expensive but is it does it really need
 

5561
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:33,910
expensive but is it does it really need
to be this is more of a question about

5562
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:33,920
to be this is more of a question about
 

5563
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:35,590
to be this is more of a question about
manufacturing about how to take build a

5564
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
manufacturing about how to take build a
 

5565
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,350
manufacturing about how to take build a
product how to actually have a product

5566
01:36:37,350 --> 01:36:37,360
product how to actually have a product
 

5567
01:36:37,360 --> 01:36:38,709
product how to actually have a product
at scale that

5568
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:38,719
at scale that
 

5569
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:40,550
at scale that
has an impact and just having a very

5570
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
has an impact and just having a very
 

5571
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:42,229
has an impact and just having a very
serious engineering

5572
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
serious engineering
 

5573
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:44,550
serious engineering
like to the level of physics

5574
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:44,560
like to the level of physics
 

5575
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,070
like to the level of physics
of discussion about building a thing and

5576
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:48,080
of discussion about building a thing and
 

5577
01:36:48,080 --> 01:36:50,550
of discussion about building a thing and

6217
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:17,669
i did to me it that the way that story
is told

6218
01:47:17,669 --> 01:47:17,679
is told
 

6219
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:19,430
is told
i think has a lot of meaning it's like

6220
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
i think has a lot of meaning it's like
 

6221
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:20,709
i think has a lot of meaning it's like
it to me

6222
01:47:20,709 --> 01:47:20,719
it to me
 

6223
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:22,550
it to me
you're saying that's interesting you say

6224
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
you're saying that's interesting you say
 

6225
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:24,550
you're saying that's interesting you say
it this way but to me it's like saying

6226
01:47:24,550 --> 01:47:24,560
it this way but to me it's like saying
 

6227
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:26,629
it this way but to me it's like saying
animal farm

6228
01:47:26,629 --> 01:47:26,639
animal farm
 

6229
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:28,629
animal farm
doesn't need to be read

6230
01:47:28,629 --> 01:47:28,639
doesn't need to be read
 

6231
01:47:28,639 --> 01:47:31,270
doesn't need to be read
because it's an obvious story

6232
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
because it's an obvious story
 

6233
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,790
because it's an obvious story
i don't think there's much plot to the

6234
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
i don't think there's much plot to the
 

6235
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:34,229
i don't think there's much plot to the
plague

6236
01:47:34,229 --> 01:47:34,239
plague
 

6237
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,430
plague
i think animal farm has a very long plot

6238
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
i think animal farm has a very long plot
 

6239
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:39,910
i think animal farm has a very long plot
and a complex plot but there's

6240
01:47:39,910 --> 01:47:39,920
and a complex plot but there's
 

6241
01:47:39,920 --> 01:47:42,070
and a complex plot but there's
experiences within

6242
01:47:42,070 --> 01:47:42,080
experiences within
 

6243
01:47:42,080 --> 01:47:43,990
experiences within
so the situation is set up and plague

6244
01:47:43,990 --> 01:47:44,000
so the situation is set up and plague
 

6245
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,310
so the situation is set up and plague
and there's experiences that start to

6246
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:46,320
and there's experiences that start to
 

6247
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:48,470
and there's experiences that start to
reveal a philosophy

6248
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
reveal a philosophy
 

6249
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,350
reveal a philosophy
so

6250
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:49,360
so
 

6251
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,629
so
yeah it's not very plot driven yeah but

6252
01:47:52,629 --> 01:47:52,639
yeah it's not very plot driven yeah but
 

6253
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:55,109
yeah it's not very plot driven yeah but
but the so i i would say you still

6254
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:55,119
but the so i i would say you still
 

6255
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:56,550
but the so i i would say you still
should read it

6256
01:47:56,550 --> 01:47:56,560
should read it
 

6257
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,189
should read it
but the plot doesn't like you you didn't

6258
01:47:59,189 --> 01:47:59,199
but the plot doesn't like you you didn't
 

6259
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:01,030
but the plot doesn't like you you didn't
give away anything currently

6260
01:48:01,030 --> 01:48:01,040
give away anything currently
 

6261
01:48:01,040 --> 01:48:02,870
give away anything currently
right that that's

6262
01:48:02,870 --> 01:48:02,880
right that that's
 

6263
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,910
right that that's
so some books are just i mean iran is

6264
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:05,920
so some books are just i mean iran is
 

6265
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,390
so some books are just i mean iran is
similar to that in a sense like the plot

6266
01:48:08,390 --> 01:48:08,400
similar to that in a sense like the plot
 

6267
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:10,709
similar to that in a sense like the plot
is not as important as the behavior of

6268
01:48:10,709 --> 01:48:10,719
is not as important as the behavior of
 

6269
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:13,030
is not as important as the behavior of
the different people in that plot i

6270
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,040
the different people in that plot i
 

6271
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:15,109
the different people in that plot i
think she's very plot heavy

6272
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
think she's very plot heavy
 

6273
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:16,950
think she's very plot heavy
no she has plot but i'm saying that's

6274
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:16,960
no she has plot but i'm saying that's
 

6275
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:19,270
no she has plot but i'm saying that's
not necessarily the important thing to

6276
01:48:19,270 --> 01:48:19,280
not necessarily the important thing to
 

6277
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:20,950
not necessarily the important thing to
me the behavior of the people is the

6278
01:48:20,950 --> 01:48:20,960
me the behavior of the people is the
 

6279
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:22,709
me the behavior of the people is the
important thing sure but you could you

6280
01:48:22,709 --> 01:48:22,719
important thing sure but you could you
 

6281
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:24,470
important thing sure but you could you
could you could like separate it into a

6282
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:24,480
could you could like separate it into a
 

6283
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:27,030
could you could like separate it into a
bunch of blog posts and they stand on

6284
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:27,040
bunch of blog posts and they stand on
 

6285
01:48:27,040 --> 01:48:29,590
bunch of blog posts and they stand on
their own i i would have to

6286
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:29,600
their own i i would have to
 

6287
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:30,830
their own i i would have to
think about that with

6288
01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:30,840
think about that with
 

6289
01:48:30,840 --> 01:48:33,910
think about that with
iran she cr she does through the plot

6290
01:48:33,910 --> 01:48:33,920
iran she cr she does through the plot
 

6291
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,430
iran she cr she does through the plot
create a world where you start to

6292
01:48:35,430 --> 01:48:35,440
create a world where you start to
 

6293
01:48:35,440 --> 01:48:37,510
create a world where you start to
understand right different values that

6294
01:48:37,510 --> 01:48:37,520
understand right different values that
 

6295
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:39,430
understand right different values that
people have

6296
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:39,440
people have
 

6297
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,590
people have
but yeah

6298
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:41,600
but yeah
 

6299
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,310
but yeah
but that's what the plot serves

6300
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
but that's what the plot serves
 

6301
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,149
but that's what the plot serves
yeah i don't know i would have to think

6302
01:48:46,149 --> 01:48:46,159
yeah i don't know i would have to think
 

6303
01:48:46,159 --> 01:48:47,750
yeah i don't know i would have to think
but in the plague it's the behavior of

6304
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:47,760
but in the plague it's the behavior of
 

6305
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:49,430
but in the plague it's the behavior of
the people that's really important and

6306
01:48:49,430 --> 01:48:49,440
the people that's really important and
 

6307

so obviously this desk has a huge amount
 

6325
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,070
so obviously this desk has a huge amount
of plot in

6326
01:49:08,070 --> 01:49:08,080
of plot in
 

6327
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:10,310
of plot in

in most of his work herman hess has a
 

6329
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:12,709
in most of his work herman hess has a
huge amount of plot thomas man doesn't

6330
01:49:12,709 --> 01:49:12,719
huge amount of plot thomas man doesn't

and then add it to the the draft so
 

6673
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:58,470
and then add it to the the draft so
it'll be a complete slog but editing

6674

it'll be a complete slog but editing
 

6675
01:54:58,480 --> 01:54:59,910
it'll be a complete slog but editing
that slog is gonna be a lot easier than

6676
01:54:59,910 --> 01:54:59,920
that slog is gonna be a lot easier than
 

6677
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:01,430
that slog is gonna be a lot easier than
creating it to begin with and when you

6678
01:55:01,430 --> 01:55:01,440
creating it to begin with and when you
 

6679
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:03,910
creating it to begin with and when you
see those disparate lines all laid out

6680
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:03,920
see those disparate lines all laid out
 

6681
01:55:03,920 --> 01:55:07,109
see those disparate lines all laid out
on the page how difficult is it to

6682
01:55:07,109 --> 01:55:07,119
on the page how difficult is it to
 

6683
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:08,790
on the page how difficult is it to
then start stitching it together do you

6684
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:08,800
then start stitching it together do you
 

6685
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:09,990
then start stitching it together do you
find that

6686
01:55:09,990 --> 01:55:10,000
find that
 

6687
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:12,950
find that
when you look at a list of those things

6688
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
when you look at a list of those things
 

6689
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:14,950
when you look at a list of those things
the final product will look very

6690
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:14,960
the final product will look very
 

6691
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:16,790
the final product will look very
different yeah how will you actually use

6692
01:55:16,790 --> 01:55:16,800
different yeah how will you actually use
 

6693
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,629
different yeah how will you actually use
those lines no i will use those lines

6694
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:18,639
those lines no i will use those lines
 

6695
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:21,030
those lines no i will use those lines
then i have a file called scraps so like

6696
01:55:21,030 --> 01:55:21,040
then i have a file called scraps so like
 

6697
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:22,629
then i have a file called scraps so like
if the line's no longer used i put in my

6698
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
if the line's no longer used i put in my
 

6699
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:24,310
if the line's no longer used i put in my
scrap pile

6700
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:24,320
scrap pile
 

6701
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:26,149
scrap pile
i'd love to see what's in this grab pile

6702
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:26,159
i'd love to see what's in this grab pile
 

6703
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:28,070
i'd love to see what's in this grab pile
okay yeah sure

6704
01:55:28,070 --> 01:55:28,080
okay yeah sure
 

6705
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:29,189
okay yeah sure
one of the things i've been pulling

6706
01:55:29,189 --> 01:55:29,199
one of the things i've been pulling
 

6707
01:55:29,199 --> 01:55:30,950
one of the things i've been pulling
scraps is a lot of times when i was

6708
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
scraps is a lot of times when i was
 

6709
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,470
scraps is a lot of times when i was
earlier writing

6710
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
earlier writing
 

6711
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:35,270
earlier writing
i would have contemporary references

6712
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:35,280
i would have contemporary references
 

6713
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:37,990
i would have contemporary references
and i realized that that's bad because i

6714
01:55:37,990 --> 01:55:38,000
and i realized that that's bad because i
 

6715
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:39,270
and i realized that that's bad because i
want the

6716
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:39,280
want the
 

6717
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:42,149
want the
the the reader to be in the past as the

6718
01:55:42,149 --> 01:55:42,159
the the reader to be in the past as the
 

6719
01:55:42,159 --> 01:55:44,470
the the reader to be in the past as the
present so if you're talking about let's

6720
01:55:44,470 --> 01:55:44,480
present so if you're talking about let's
 

6721
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,629
present so if you're talking about let's
say 1901 and you're referring to obama

01:55:46,629 --> 01:55:46,639
say 1901 and you're referring to obama
 

6723
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:48,390
say 1901 and you're referring to obama

special day
in the year to think about how you're

6738
01:56:00,629 --> 01:56:00,639
in the year to think about how you're
 

6739

single day when you wake up
well i usually have several projects i'm

6746
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:07,679
well i usually have several projects i'm
 

6747
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:09,430
well i usually have several projects i'm
working on at once so there's always

6748
01:56:09,430 --> 01:56:09,440
working on at once so there's always
 

6749
01:56:09,440 --> 01:56:11,669
working on at once so there's always
incremental progress on those right but

6750
01:56:11,669 --> 01:56:11,679
incremental progress on those right but
 

6751
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:12,950
incremental progress on those right but
like you know it's nice to have a

6752
01:56:12,950 --> 01:56:12,960
like you know it's nice to have a
 

6753
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:14,550
like you know it's nice to have a
deadline by the end of

6754
01:56:14,550 --> 01:56:14,560
deadline by the end of
 

6755
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,870
deadline by the end of
2022

6756
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:16,880
2022
 

6757
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:19,510
2022
i'll accomplish this kind of a

6758
01:56:19,510 --> 01:56:19,520
i'll accomplish this kind of a
 

6759
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,430
i'll accomplish this kind of a
like to hold yourself responsible and

6760
01:56:21,430 --> 01:56:21,440
like to hold yourself responsible and
 

6761
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,030
like to hold yourself responsible and
then you could do that at the end at the

6762
01:56:23,030 --> 01:56:23,040
then you could do that at the end at the
 

6763
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,470
then you could do that at the end at the
beginning of the year to think about

6764
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,480
beginning of the year to think about
 

6765
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:25,589
beginning of the year to think about
that

6766
01:56:25,589 --> 01:56:25,599
that
 

6767
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:27,910
that
both philosophically like what kind of

6768
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:27,920
both philosophically like what kind of
 

6769
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:28,870
both philosophically like what kind of
big

6770
01:56:28,870 --> 01:56:28,880
big
 

6771
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,189
big
magic not projects that you can quantify

6772
01:56:31,189 --> 01:56:31,199
magic not projects that you can quantify
 

6773
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:33,109
magic not projects that you can quantify
but more like how can i change my life

6774
01:56:33,109 --> 01:56:33,119
but more like how can i change my life
 

6775
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,790
but more like how can i change my life
or like i mentioned take the leap of

6776
01:56:34,790 --> 01:56:34,800
or like i mentioned take the leap of
 

6777
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,310
or like i mentioned take the leap of
different kinds and then there's

6778
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
different kinds and then there's
 

6779
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:39,270
different kinds and then there's
specific things like finish the book

6780
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,280
specific things like finish the book
 

6781
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:40,310
specific things like finish the book
i

6782
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:40,320
i
 

6783
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,669
i
years ago and i'm so i'm i think on some

6784
01:56:43,669 --> 01:56:43,679
years ago and i'm so i'm i think on some
 

6785
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:45,830
years ago and i'm so i'm i think on some
level you much less than me but i think

6786
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
level you much less than me but i think
 

6787
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:48,070
level you much less than me but i think
you're increasing in this direction

6788
01:56:48,070 --> 01:56:48,080
you're increasing in this direction
 

6789
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,310
you're increasing in this direction
i realized it's more i have to learn how

6790
01:56:50,310 --> 01:56:50,320
i realized it's more i have to learn how
 

6791
01:56:50,320 --> 01:56:53,109
i realized it's more i have to learn how
to be a surfer and not a driver

6792
01:56:53,109 --> 01:56:53,119
to be a surfer and not a driver
 

6793
01:56:53,119 --> 01:56:54,950
to be a surfer and not a driver
because when you reach the level we're

6794
01:56:54,950 --> 01:56:54,960
because when you reach the level we're
 

6795
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:57,830
because when you reach the level we're
at in our careers or in our place in the

6796
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:57,840
at in our careers or in our place in the
 

6797
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:58,870
at in our careers or in our place in the
culture

6798
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:58,880
culture
 

6799
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,470
culture
a lot of this is luck

6800
01:57:00,470 --> 01:57:00,480
a lot of this is luck
 

6801
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:03,030
a lot of this is luck
yeah and a lot of this is just like

6802
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:03,040
yeah and a lot of this is just like
 

6803
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:04,950
yeah and a lot of this is just like
like i'm just going along for the ride

6804
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:04,960
like i'm just going along for the ride
 

6805
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:05,990
like i'm just going along for the ride
because

6806
01:57:05,990 --> 01:57:06,000
because
 

6807
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:07,990
because
it's kind of counter-intuitive like you

6808
01:57:07,990 --> 01:57:08,000
it's kind of counter-intuitive like you
 

6809
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,750
it's kind of counter-intuitive like you
know like the success of the anarchist

know like the success of the anarchist
 

6811
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,669
know like the success of the anarchist
handbook was counter-intuitive

6812
01:57:11,669 --> 01:57:11,679
handbook was counter-intuitive
 

6813
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:12,550
handbook was counter-intuitive
um

6814
01:57:12,550 --> 01:57:12,560

7646
02:11:17,430 --> 02:11:17,440
judgment
 

7647
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:18,870

um do you think he has a chance of

7648
02:11:18,870 --> 02:11:18,880
um do you think he has a chance of
 

7649
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:20,870
um do you think he has a chance of
winning do you think he'll win anyone in

7650
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:20,880
winning do you think he'll win anyone in
 

7651
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:22,550
winning do you think he'll win anyone in
a binary political system who's the

7652
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,560
a binary political system who's the
 

7653
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,229
a binary political system who's the
nominee has a chance like whoever the

7654
02:11:24,229 --> 02:11:24,239
nominee has a chance like whoever the
 

7655
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:26,629
nominee has a chance like whoever the
republican democrat has a chance i think

7656
02:11:26,629 --> 02:11:26,639
republican democrat has a chance i think
 

7657
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:29,270
republican democrat has a chance i think
also it's a lot easier to vote for

7658
02:11:29,270 --> 02:11:29,280
also it's a lot easier to vote for
 

7659
02:11:29,280 --> 02:11:30,870
also it's a lot easier to vote for
someone that you have voted for in the

7660
02:11:30,870 --> 02:11:30,880
someone that you have voted for in the
 

7661
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:31,830
someone that you have voted for in the
past

7662
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:31,840
past
 

7663
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,270
past
so that's why incumbents have a big

7664
02:11:33,270 --> 02:11:33,280
so that's why incumbents have a big
 

7665
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:34,629
so that's why incumbents have a big
advantage there's not that psychological

7666
02:11:34,629 --> 02:11:34,639
advantage there's not that psychological
 

7667
02:11:34,639 --> 02:11:37,430
advantage there's not that psychological
barrier to cover i think it's also

7668
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
barrier to cover i think it's also
 

7669
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,270
barrier to cover i think it's also
useful for trump that he's banished for

7670
02:11:39,270 --> 02:11:39,280
useful for trump that he's banished for
 

7671
02:11:39,280 --> 02:11:42,629
useful for trump that he's banished for
social media because then

7672
02:11:42,629 --> 02:11:42,639
social media because then
 

7673
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:43,510
social media because then
he doesn't have to have the

7674
02:11:43,510 --> 02:11:43,520
he doesn't have to have the
 

7675
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:45,910
he doesn't have to have the
responsibility of governing um and all

7676
02:11:45,910 --> 02:11:45,920
responsibility of governing um and all
 

7677
02:11:45,920 --> 02:11:47,830
responsibility of governing um and all
the costs of that you know because no

7678
02:11:47,830 --> 02:11:47,840
the costs of that you know because no
 

7679
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,109
the costs of that you know because no
matter what decisions you make while

7680
02:11:49,109 --> 02:11:49,119
matter what decisions you make while
 

7681
02:11:49,119 --> 02:11:50,069
matter what decisions you make while
governing some people aren't going to

7682
02:11:50,069 --> 02:11:50,079
governing some people aren't going to
 

7683
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:51,350
governing some people aren't going to
like that

7684
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:51,360
like that
 

7685
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:53,430
like that
so he gets to kind of be

02:11:53,430 --> 02:11:53,440
so he gets to kind of be
 

7687
02:11:53,440 --> 02:11:55,109
so he gets to kind of be
above the radar or below the radar

7688
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
above the radar or below the radar

of the strong way to phrase that

8402
02:23:45,670 --> 02:23:45,680
of the strong way to phrase that
 

8403
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:46,389
of the strong way to phrase that
is

8404
02:23:46,389 --> 02:23:46,399
is
 

8405
02:23:46,399 --> 02:23:48,870
is
um

8406
02:23:48,870 --> 02:23:48,880

 

8407
02:23:48,880 --> 02:23:51,590

it weakens

8408
02:23:51,590 --> 02:23:51,600
it weakens
 

8409
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:54,230
it weakens
america like not just

8410
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
america like not just
 

8411
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:56,150
america like not just
the one america but

8412
02:23:56,150 --> 02:23:56,160
the one america but
 

8413
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:59,830
the one america but
like both sides in the divorce will be

8414
02:23:59,830 --> 02:23:59,840
like both sides in the divorce will be
 

8415
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:02,309
like both sides in the divorce will be
much weaker than they individually were

8416
02:24:02,309 --> 02:24:02,319
much weaker than they individually were
 

8417
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:03,510
much weaker than they individually were
together

8418
02:24:03,510 --> 02:24:03,520
together
 

8419
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:06,070
together
so in that sense not that you have to

8420
02:24:06,070 --> 02:24:06,080
so in that sense not that you have to
 

8421
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,309
so in that sense not that you have to
care about what china thinks but like

8422
02:24:08,309 --> 02:24:08,319
care about what china thinks but like
 

8423
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:10,309
care about what china thinks but like
it's a step but it's a big step

8424
02:24:10,309 --> 02:24:10,319
it's a step but it's a big step
 

8425
02:24:10,319 --> 02:24:12,230
it's a step but it's a big step
backwards yes i think in the short term

8426
02:24:12,230 --> 02:24:12,240
backwards yes i think in the short term
 

8427
02:24:12,240 --> 02:24:13,670
backwards yes i think in the short term
it is absolute big step backwards in

8428
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:13,680
it is absolute big step backwards in
 

8429
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,670
it is absolute big step backwards in
terms of power uh there's no question

8430
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:15,680
terms of power uh there's no question
 

8431
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:17,429
terms of power uh there's no question
that you know when you're trying to

8432
02:24:17,429 --> 02:24:17,439
that you know when you're trying to
 

8433
02:24:17,439 --> 02:24:18,870
that you know when you're trying to
reestablish a society there's going to

8434
02:24:18,870 --> 02:24:18,880
reestablish a society there's going to
 

8435
02:24:18,880 --> 02:24:20,710
reestablish a society there's going to
be a transition period that transition

8436
02:24:20,710 --> 02:24:20,720
be a transition period that transition
 

8437
02:24:20,720 --> 02:24:22,710
be a transition period that transition
is going to be costly uh each side

8438
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:22,720
is going to be costly uh each side
 

8439
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:24,469
is going to be costly uh each side
starts wondering wait a minute why are

starts wondering wait a minute why are
 

8441
02:24:24,479 --> 02:24:25,590
starts wondering wait a minute why are
we still doing this we don't have to

8442
02:24:25,590 --> 02:24:25,600
we still doing this we don't have to
 

8443
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:26,870
we still doing this we don't have to
anymore we're not living with them so on

8444
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:26,880
anymore we're not living with them so on
 

8445

anymore we're not living with them so on
and so forth so that's going to be a

8446
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:28,960
and so forth so that's going to be a
 

8447
02:24:28,960 --> 02:24:29,990
and so forth so that's going to be a
concern

8448
02:24:29,990 --> 02:24:30,000
concern
 

8449
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,710
concern

america
uh or even a large primary point of

02:24:36,150 --> 02:24:36,160
uh or even a large primary point of
 

8455
02:24:36,160 --> 02:24:37,750
uh or even a large primary point of
america is to be a bulwark against

my steel man argument is

8476
02:25:02,469 --> 02:25:02,479
my steel man argument is
 

8477
02:25:02,479 --> 02:25:04,389
my steel man argument is
there's no way this is gonna be peaceful

8478
02:25:04,389 --> 02:25:04,399
there's no way this is gonna be peaceful
 

8479
02:25:04,399 --> 02:25:05,910
there's no way this is gonna be peaceful
because the lines don't separate out

8480
02:25:05,910 --> 02:25:05,920
because the lines don't separate out
 

8481
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:08,469
because the lines don't separate out
well so all you're doing is basically

8482
02:25:08,469 --> 02:25:08,479
well so all you're doing is basically
 

8483
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:10,550
well so all you're doing is basically
just replicating the problem because the

8484
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:10,560
just replicating the problem because the
 

8485
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:12,630
just replicating the problem because the
disparity isn't between you know like

8486
02:25:12,630 --> 02:25:12,640
disparity isn't between you know like
 

8487
02:25:12,640 --> 02:25:13,990
disparity isn't between you know like
during the civil war north and south

8488
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:14,000
during the civil war north and south
 

8489
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:15,750
during the civil war north and south
it's like it's between new york city and

8490
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:15,760
it's like it's between new york city and
 

8491
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,910
it's like it's between new york city and
upstate new york between chicago

8492
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:17,920
upstate new york between chicago
 

8493
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:20,150
upstate new york between chicago
downstate chicago once you get outside

8494
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,160
downstate chicago once you get outside
 

8495
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:23,270
downstate chicago once you get outside
of la and like sacramento uh california

8496
02:25:23,270 --> 02:25:23,280
of la and like sacramento uh california
 

8497
02:25:23,280 --> 02:25:25,670
of la and like sacramento uh california
in many ways like kentucky so it doesn't

8498
02:25:25,670 --> 02:25:25,680
in many ways like kentucky so it doesn't
 

8499
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:28,070
in many ways like kentucky so it doesn't
make sense so that's a strong argument i

8500
02:25:28,070 --> 02:25:28,080
make sense so that's a strong argument i
 

8501
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,349
make sense so that's a strong argument i
mean you've talked about that this

8502
02:25:29,349 --> 02:25:29,359
mean you've talked about that this
 

8503
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:31,270
mean you've talked about that this
process would be painful right it can't

8504
02:25:31,270 --> 02:25:31,280
process would be painful right it can't
 

8505
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:33,110
process would be painful right it can't
be pain and we're not just talking about

8506
02:25:33,110 --> 02:25:33,120
be pain and we're not just talking about
 

8507
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:35,110
be pain and we're not just talking about
violence it could be just

8508
02:25:35,110 --> 02:25:35,120
violence it could be just
 

8509
02:25:35,120 --> 02:25:37,030
violence it could be just
even the civil war you could divide it

8510
02:25:37,030 --> 02:25:37,040
even the civil war you could divide it
 

8511
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,429
even the civil war you could divide it
clean somewhat cleanly

8512
02:25:39,429 --> 02:25:39,439
clean somewhat cleanly
 

8513
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:41,510
clean somewhat cleanly
obviously the kind of national divorce

8514
02:25:41,510 --> 02:25:41,520
obviously the kind of national divorce
 

8515
02:25:41,520 --> 02:25:43,190
obviously the kind of national divorce
you might be suggesting

8516
02:25:43,190 --> 02:25:43,200
you might be suggesting
 

8517
02:25:43,200 --> 02:25:45,030
you might be suggesting
is yeah people are living amongst each

8518
02:25:45,030 --> 02:25:45,040
is yeah people are living amongst each
 

8519
02:25:45,040 --> 02:25:47,030
is yeah people are living amongst each
other so you have to literally move it's

8520
02:25:47,030 --> 02:25:47,040
other so you have to literally move it's
 

8521
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,110
other so you have to literally move it's
complicated right so that is a very

8522
02:25:49,110 --> 02:25:49,120
complicated right so that is a very
 

8523
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:51,270
complicated right so that is a very
strong argument it's i think a cogent

8524
02:25:51,270 --> 02:25:51,280
strong argument it's i think a cogent
 

8525
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:52,870
strong argument it's i think a cogent
argument against it

8526
02:25:52,870 --> 02:25:52,880
argument against it
 

8527
02:25:52,880 --> 02:25:54,309
argument against it
two is

8528
02:25:54,309 --> 02:25:54,319
two is
 

8529
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:56,469
two is
it's not just china it's that there's a

8530
02:25:56,469 --> 02:25:56,479
it's not just china it's that there's a
 

8531
02:25:56,479 --> 02:25:57,910
it's not just china it's that there's a
lot of

8532
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:57,920
lot of
 

8533
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:00,070
lot of
bad actors in the world who maybe aren't

8534
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:00,080
bad actors in the world who maybe aren't
 

8535
02:26:00,080 --> 02:26:01,670
bad actors in the world who maybe aren't
like china certainly wants to carry

8536
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:01,680
like china certainly wants to carry
 

8537
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,510
like china certainly wants to carry
itself and have an appearance at least

8538
02:26:03,510 --> 02:26:03,520
itself and have an appearance at least
 

8539
02:26:03,520 --> 02:26:06,469
itself and have an appearance at least
on the world stage as civilized and a

8540
02:26:06,469 --> 02:26:06,479
on the world stage as civilized and a
 

8541
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:09,429
on the world stage as civilized and a
leader there's lots of smaller countries

8542
02:26:09,429 --> 02:26:09,439
leader there's lots of smaller countries
 

8543
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:10,950
leader there's lots of smaller countries
who without us

8544
02:26:10,950 --> 02:26:10,960
who without us
 

8545
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:12,230
who without us
are going to feel comfortable doing some

8546
02:26:12,230 --> 02:26:12,240
are going to feel comfortable doing some
 

8547
02:26:12,240 --> 02:26:13,750
are going to feel comfortable doing some
very nefarious things

8548
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:13,760
very nefarious things
 

8549
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:15,030
very nefarious things
um and

8550
02:26:15,030 --> 02:26:15,040
um and
 

8551
02:26:15,040 --> 02:26:16,150
um and
they're not going to be scared of us

8552
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:16,160
they're not going to be scared of us
 

8553
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:17,830
they're not going to be scared of us
anymore and so that would be a bigger

8554
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:17,840
anymore and so that would be a bigger
 

8555
02:26:17,840 --> 02:26:19,510
anymore and so that would be a bigger
concern in many regards than china so i

8556
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:19,520
concern in many regards than china so i
 

8557
02:26:19,520 --> 02:26:21,190
concern in many regards than china so i
think that's a reasonable one

8558
02:26:21,190 --> 02:26:21,200
think that's a reasonable one
 

8559
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:24,550
think that's a reasonable one
um it could be that both sides if this

8560
02:26:24,550 --> 02:26:24,560
um it could be that both sides if this
 

8561
02:26:24,560 --> 02:26:27,190
um it could be that both sides if this
happens are gonna instead of work toward

8562
02:26:27,190 --> 02:26:27,200
happens are gonna instead of work toward
 

8563
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,990
happens are gonna instead of work toward
better

8564
02:26:27,990 --> 02:26:28,000
better
 

8565
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:29,510
better
the things that make each side bad would

8566
02:26:29,510 --> 02:26:29,520
the things that make each side bad would
 

8567
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:31,750
the things that make each side bad would
get worse yeah and that's you know

8568
02:26:31,750 --> 02:26:31,760
get worse yeah and that's you know
 

8569
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:33,270
get worse yeah and that's you know
having those pushed towards the

8570
02:26:33,270 --> 02:26:33,280
having those pushed towards the
 

8571
02:26:33,280 --> 02:26:34,950
having those pushed towards the
malevolent extremes is i think a very

8572
02:26:34,950 --> 02:26:34,960
malevolent extremes is i think a very
 

8573
02:26:34,960 --> 02:26:37,510
malevolent extremes is i think a very
legitimate criticism and a concern

8574
02:26:37,510 --> 02:26:37,520
legitimate criticism and a concern
 

8575
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:39,110
legitimate criticism and a concern
i mean as you suggested there's no

8576
02:26:39,110 --> 02:26:39,120
i mean as you suggested there's no
 

8577
02:26:39,120 --> 02:26:41,190
i mean as you suggested there's no
guarantee that won't happen correct at

8578
02:26:41,190 --> 02:26:41,200
guarantee that won't happen correct at
 

8579
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:42,150
guarantee that won't happen correct at
all

8580
02:26:42,150 --> 02:26:42,160
all
 

8581
02:26:42,160 --> 02:26:43,429
all
also

8582
02:26:43,429 --> 02:26:43,439

it's the thing you said about america
like one of the one of the arguments

8832
02:30:58,950 --> 02:30:58,960
like one of the one of the arguments
 

8833
02:30:58,960 --> 02:31:02,150

8837
02:31:05,359 --> 02:31:07,110
um we've been at it for a while like
there is a lot of value

8838
02:31:07,110 --> 02:31:07,120
there is a lot of value
 

8839
02:31:07,120 --> 02:31:08,630
there is a lot of value
in the fact that we've been at it for a

8840
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
in the fact that we've been at it for a
 

8841
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:10,389
in the fact that we've been at it for a
while don't just throw it all away all

8842
02:31:10,389 --> 02:31:10,399
while don't just throw it all away all
 

8843
02:31:10,399 --> 02:31:12,469
while don't just throw it all away all
the time so he says like philosophically

8844
02:31:12,469 --> 02:31:12,479
the time so he says like philosophically
 

8845
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:15,670
the time so he says like philosophically
he seems in a lot of walks of life

8846
02:31:15,670 --> 02:31:15,680
he seems in a lot of walks of life
 

8847
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:18,630
he seems in a lot of walks of life
revolution is should be

8848
02:31:18,630 --> 02:31:18,640
revolution is should be
 

8849
02:31:18,640 --> 02:31:21,190
revolution is should be
avoided as much as possible i agree and

8850
02:31:21,190 --> 02:31:21,200
avoided as much as possible i agree and
 

8851
02:31:21,200 --> 02:31:23,670
avoided as much as possible i agree and
so it's kind of interesting

8852
02:31:23,670 --> 02:31:23,680
so it's kind of interesting
 

8853
02:31:23,680 --> 02:31:25,190
so it's kind of interesting
so he makes the case that there's

8854
02:31:25,190 --> 02:31:25,200
so he makes the case that there's
 

8855
02:31:25,200 --> 02:31:27,429
so he makes the case that there's
something fundamentally powerful about

8856
02:31:27,429 --> 02:31:27,439
something fundamentally powerful about
 

8857
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:29,110
something fundamentally powerful about
the nation

8858
02:31:29,110 --> 02:31:29,120
the nation
 

8859
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:32,150
the nation
that we uh it's a it's a

8860
02:31:32,150 --> 02:31:32,160
that we uh it's a it's a
 

8861
02:31:32,160 --> 02:31:35,270
that we uh it's a it's a
it's a nice way to group a culture

8862
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:35,280
it's a nice way to group a culture
 

8863
02:31:35,280 --> 02:31:36,790
it's a nice way to group a culture
and

8864
02:31:36,790 --> 02:31:36,800
and
 

8865
02:31:36,800 --> 02:31:38,870
and
so national divorce i guess goes against

8866
02:31:38,870 --> 02:31:38,880
so national divorce i guess goes against
 

8867
02:31:38,880 --> 02:31:41,510
so national divorce i guess goes against
that i mean do you find some aspect of

8868
02:31:41,510 --> 02:31:41,520
that i mean do you find some aspect of
 

8869
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:43,270
that i mean do you find some aspect of
the virtue of nationalism as you would

8870
02:31:43,270 --> 02:31:43,280
the virtue of nationalism as you would
 

8871
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:44,469
the virtue of nationalism as you would
put it

8872
02:31:44,469 --> 02:31:44,479
put it
 

8873
02:31:44,479 --> 02:31:46,469
put it
powerful

8874
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:46,479
powerful
 

8875
02:31:46,479 --> 02:31:49,110
powerful
well powerful and in in a good sense or

8876
02:31:49,110 --> 02:31:49,120
well powerful and in in a good sense or
 

8877
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,790
well powerful and in in a good sense or
in a good sense so sorry yeah in a good

8878
02:31:50,790 --> 02:31:50,800
in a good sense so sorry yeah in a good
 

8879
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:52,309
in a good sense so sorry yeah in a good
sense like well yeah it brings out the

8880
02:31:52,309 --> 02:31:52,319
sense like well yeah it brings out the
 

8881
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,550
sense like well yeah it brings out the
best in humans i know at the best but it

8882
02:31:54,550 --> 02:31:54,560
best in humans i know at the best but it
 

8883
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:55,990
best in humans i know at the best but it
certainly brings out good things i have

8884
02:31:55,990 --> 02:31:56,000
certainly brings out good things i have
 

8885
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,590
certainly brings out good things i have
that line i always say about i love my

8886
02:31:57,590 --> 02:31:57,600
that line i always say about i love my
 

8887
02:31:57,600 --> 02:31:58,950
that line i always say about i love my
country i hate the government because i

8888
02:31:58,950 --> 02:31:58,960
country i hate the government because i
 

8889
02:31:58,960 --> 02:32:00,469
country i hate the government because i
love my country yeah

8890
02:32:00,469 --> 02:32:00,479
love my country yeah
 

8891
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:02,469
love my country yeah
so there is a love of country i think

8892
02:32:02,469 --> 02:32:02,479
so there is a love of country i think
 

8893
02:32:02,479 --> 02:32:03,830
so there is a love of country i think
it's value but i i don't know that

8894
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:03,840
it's value but i i don't know that
 

8895
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,309
it's value but i i don't know that
that's the i think

8896
02:32:06,309 --> 02:32:06,319
that's the i think
 

8897
02:32:06,319 --> 02:32:07,830
that's the i think
it's also the case because the country

8898
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
it's also the case because the country
 

8899
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,990
it's also the case because the country

even from the scientists because it's a
 

9653
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,469
even from the scientists because it's a

9654
02:44:42,469 --> 02:44:42,479
dynamic process they don't know what
 

9655
02:44:42,479 --> 02:44:44,070
dynamic process they don't know what
they're dealing with a lot of it has to

9656
02:44:44,070 --> 02:44:44,080
they're dealing with a lot of it has to
 

9657

02:45:05,990 --> 02:45:06,000
said it was horse paste although it's
 

9683
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:07,429
said it was horse paste although it's
veterinary medicine why didn't they say

9684
02:45:07,429 --> 02:45:07,439
veterinary medicine why didn't they say
 

9685
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,110
veterinary medicine why didn't they say
dog paste or cat paste

9686
02:45:09,110 --> 02:45:09,120
dog paste or cat paste
 

9687
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,670
dog paste or cat paste
it's like well he's not dead

9688
02:45:11,670 --> 02:45:11,680
it's like well he's not dead
 

9689
02:45:11,680 --> 02:45:14,870
it's like well he's not dead
so and he's also taking drugs

9690
02:45:14,870 --> 02:45:14,880
so and he's also taking drugs
 

9691
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:16,790
so and he's also taking drugs
which are used in other circumstances

9692
02:45:16,790 --> 02:45:16,800
which are used in other circumstances
 

9693
02:45:16,800 --> 02:45:18,630
which are used in other circumstances
the very least maybe they're pointless

9694
02:45:18,630 --> 02:45:18,640
the very least maybe they're pointless
 

9695
02:45:18,640 --> 02:45:19,429
the very least maybe they're pointless
but

9696
02:45:19,429 --> 02:45:19,439
but
 

9697
02:45:19,439 --> 02:45:21,349
but
if the drug is being allowed for

9698
02:45:21,349 --> 02:45:21,359
if the drug is being allowed for
 

9699
02:45:21,359 --> 02:45:23,269
if the drug is being allowed for
pharmaceutical reasons the odds are

9700
02:45:23,269 --> 02:45:23,279
pharmaceutical reasons the odds are
 

9701
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:24,230
pharmaceutical reasons the odds are
quite low that they're going to have

9702
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:24,240
quite low that they're going to have
 

9703
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:27,190
quite low that they're going to have
deleterious side effects uh in general

9704
02:45:27,190 --> 02:45:27,200
deleterious side effects uh in general
 

9705
02:45:27,200 --> 02:45:28,870
deleterious side effects uh in general
so

9706
02:45:28,870 --> 02:45:28,880
so
 

9707
02:45:28,880 --> 02:45:31,590
so
i think this kind of insistence

9708
02:45:31,590 --> 02:45:31,600
i think this kind of insistence
 

9709
02:45:31,600 --> 02:45:33,750
i think this kind of insistence
that there has to be one

9710
02:45:33,750 --> 02:45:33,760
that there has to be one
 

9711
02:45:33,760 --> 02:45:36,469
that there has to be one
a officially approved

9712
02:45:36,469 --> 02:45:36,479
a officially approved
 

9713
02:45:36,479 --> 02:45:37,510
a officially approved
outcome

9714
02:45:37,510 --> 02:45:37,520
outcome
 

9715
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:39,590
outcome
that we're all doing that is kind of

9716
02:45:39,590 --> 02:45:39,600
that we're all doing that is kind of
 

9717
02:45:39,600 --> 02:45:42,150
that we're all doing that is kind of
dangerous thinking in general by the way

9718
02:45:42,150 --> 02:45:42,160
dangerous thinking in general by the way
 

9719
02:45:42,160 --> 02:45:44,070
dangerous thinking in general by the way
i don't know if you saw i got a chance

9720
02:45:44,070 --> 02:45:44,080
i don't know if you saw i got a chance

uh ask him
what he likes best about me oh what does

what he likes best about me oh what does
 

9739
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:03,110
what he likes best about me oh what does
he like best yeah yeah so i actually had

9740
02:46:03,110 --> 02:46:03,120
he like best yeah yeah so i actually had
 

9741
02:46:03,120 --> 02:46:04,309
he like best yeah yeah so i actually had
that in my list of questions i was going

9742
02:46:04,309 --> 02:46:04,319
that in my list of questions i was going
 

9743
02:46:04,319 --> 02:46:07,590
that in my list of questions i was going
to ask him and my plan was i'll ask him

9744
02:46:07,590 --> 02:46:07,600
to ask him and my plan was i'll ask him
 

9745
02:46:07,600 --> 02:46:09,429
to ask him and my plan was i'll ask him
uh michael malus wants to know what you

9746
02:46:09,429 --> 02:46:09,439
uh michael malus wants to know what you
 

9747
02:46:09,439 --> 02:46:11,750
uh michael malus wants to know what you
like best about him and then my guess is

9748
02:46:11,750 --> 02:46:11,760
like best about him and then my guess is
 

9749
02:46:11,760 --> 02:46:13,830
like best about him and then my guess is
he'd be like who and i'd be like exactly

9750
02:46:13,830 --> 02:46:13,840
he'd be like who and i'd be like exactly
 

9751
02:46:13,840 --> 02:46:15,990
he'd be like who and i'd be like exactly
and then go on

9752
02:46:15,990 --> 02:46:16,000
and then go on
 

9753
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,630
and then go on
but i thought like how it was such a

9754
02:46:18,630 --> 02:46:18,640
but i thought like how it was such a
 

9755
02:46:18,640 --> 02:46:20,550
but i thought like how it was such a
tense conversation that i thought there

02:46:20,550 --> 02:46:20,560
tense conversation that i thought there
 

9757
02:46:20,560 --> 02:46:21,670
tense conversation that i thought there
would be no

10436
02:57:38,070 --> 02:57:38,080
but it's clear to me that he is a
 

10437
02:57:38,080 --> 02:57:40,550
but it's clear to me that he is a
student of power oh for sure

it's um
 

10747
03:02:45,279 --> 03:02:48,309
it's um
it's a non-trivial almost like

10748
03:02:48,309 --> 03:02:48,319
it's a non-trivial almost like
 

10749
03:02:48,319 --> 03:02:49,910
it's a non-trivial almost like
um and then the other thing without

03:02:49,910 --> 03:02:49,920
um and then the other thing without
 

10751
03:02:49,920 --> 03:02:52,389
um and then the other thing without
actually is this is a dynamic system

10752
03:02:52,389 --> 03:02:52,399
actually is this is a dynamic system
 

10753
03:02:52,399 --> 03:02:53,750
actually is this is a dynamic system
like on the one hand he's going to want

10754
03:02:53,750 --> 03:02:53,760
like on the one hand he's going to want
 

10755
03:02:53,760 --> 03:02:56,070
like on the one hand he's going to want

to say we got it right every time right
but then how is that even possible when

10758
03:02:57,429 --> 03:02:57,439
but then how is that even possible when
 

10759
03:02:57,439 --> 03:02:59,269
but then how is that even possible when
you're dealing with a evolving

10760
03:02:59,269 --> 03:02:59,279
you're dealing with a evolving

you're dealing with a evolving
unknown dynamic situation when did you

10762
03:03:02,150 --> 03:03:02,160
unknown dynamic situation when did you
 

10763
03:03:02,160 --> 03:03:03,750
unknown dynamic situation when did you
guys get it wrong did that result in

10764
03:03:03,750 --> 03:03:03,760
guys get it wrong did that result in
 

10765
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:06,150
guys get it wrong did that result in
lives lost do you feel guilty about that

10766
03:03:06,150 --> 03:03:06,160
lives lost do you feel guilty about that
 

10767

the changing mind and the mask is the

10770
03:03:10,389 --> 03:03:10,399
the changing mind and the mask is the
 

10771
03:03:10,399 --> 03:03:12,630
the changing mind and the mask is the
arrogance and how it was communicated to

10772

me a lot of this boils down to uh
 

10775
03:03:15,920 --> 03:03:17,910
me a lot of this boils down to uh
how things are communicated

10776
03:03:17,910 --> 03:03:17,920
how things are communicated
 

10777

it should hurt
 

11369
03:13:07,920 --> 03:13:09,510
it should hurt
it's like uh when i competed in jiu

11370
03:13:09,510 --> 03:13:09,520
it's like uh when i competed in jiu
 

11371
03:13:09,520 --> 03:13:12,070
it's like uh when i competed in jiu
jitsu or you do like sports and so on

11372
03:13:12,070 --> 03:13:12,080
jitsu or you do like sports and so on

03:13:12,080 --> 03:13:13,590
jitsu or you do like sports and so on
don't just say i'm gonna have fun out

11374
03:13:13,590 --> 03:13:13,600
don't just say i'm gonna have fun out
 

11375
03:13:13,600 --> 03:13:16,070
don't just say i'm gonna have fun out
there so on no try to win

11376
03:13:16,070 --> 03:13:16,080
there so on no try to win
 

11377
03:13:16,080 --> 03:13:18,550
there so on no try to win
and because then if you don't it hurts

11378
03:13:18,550 --> 03:13:18,560
and because then if you don't it hurts
 

11379
03:13:18,560 --> 03:13:20,150
and because then if you don't it hurts
and you learn from that

11381
03:13:20,160 --> 03:13:21,910
and you learn from that
um and then throughout i think that's
