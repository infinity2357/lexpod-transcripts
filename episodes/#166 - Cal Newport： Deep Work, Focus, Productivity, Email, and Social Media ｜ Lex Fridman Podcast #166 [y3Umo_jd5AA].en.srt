00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,070
to work deeply on something you know i
had been calling it

172
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:50,080
had been calling it
 

173
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,070
had been calling it
hard focus in my writing uh before that

174
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,080
hard focus in my writing uh before that
 

175
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,509
hard focus in my writing uh before that
well so the context you would understand

176
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
well so the context you would understand
 

177
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,589
well so the context you would understand
i was in the theory group in csail at

178
00:02:57,589 --> 00:02:57,599
i was in the theory group in csail at
 

179
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,509
i was in the theory group in csail at
mit right so i was surrounded at the

180
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
mit right so i was surrounded at the
 

181
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:00,790
mit right so i was surrounded at the
time when i was coming up with these

182
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:00,800
time when i was coming up with these
 

183
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,589
time when i was coming up with these
ideas

184
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
ideas
 

185
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,430
ideas
by these professional theoreticians and

186
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,440
by these professional theoreticians and
 

187
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,750
by these professional theoreticians and
that's like a murderer's row

188
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:05,760
that's like a murderer's row
 

189
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,430
that's like a murderer's row
of thinkers there right i mean it's like

yeah so so i'm in the theory group right

202
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:17,920
yeah so so i'm in the theory group right
 

203
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,830
yeah so so i'm in the theory group right
doing theoretical computer science

204
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:19,840
doing theoretical computer science
 

205
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,309
doing theoretical computer science
uh and i publish a book so you know so i

206
00:03:22,309 --> 00:03:22,319
uh and i publish a book so you know so i
 

207
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,589
uh and i publish a book so you know so i
was in this milieu where i was being

208
00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
was in this milieu where i was being
 

209
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,190
was in this milieu where i was being
exposed to people

210
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,200
exposed to people
 

211
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,509
exposed to people
uh where focus was their tier one skill

212
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
uh where focus was their tier one skill
 

213
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,630
uh where focus was their tier one skill
like that's what you would talk about

214
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:28,640
like that's what you would talk about
 

215
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,509
like that's what you would talk about
right like

216
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
right like
 

217
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,670
right like
how how intensely i can focus that was

218
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:31,680
how how intensely i can focus that was
 

219
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,110
how how intensely i can focus that was
the the key skill

220
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,120
the the key skill
 

221
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,789
the the key skill
it's like your 4 40 time or something if

222
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
it's like your 4 40 time or something if
 

223
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,710
it's like your 4 40 time or something if
you were an athlete right

224
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:36,720
you were an athlete right
 

225
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,550
you were an athlete right
so so this is something that people are

226
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,560
so so this is something that people are
 

227
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,789
so so this is something that people are
actually the the the theory folks

228
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
actually the the the theory folks
 

229
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,030
actually the the the theory folks
are thinking about oh yeah really like

230
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
are thinking about oh yeah really like
 

231
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,869
are thinking about oh yeah really like
they're openly discussing like how do

232
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:44,879
they're openly discussing like how do
 

233
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,550
they're openly discussing like how do
you focus i mean i don't know if they

234
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
you focus i mean i don't know if they
 

235
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,030
you focus i mean i don't know if they
would

236
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,040
would
 

237
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,070
would
you know quantify it but but focus was

238
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
you know quantify it but but focus was
 

239
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,350
you know quantify it but but focus was
the tier one skill

240
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:51,360
the tier one skill
 

241
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,110
the tier one skill
so you you would come in here would be a

242
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,120
so you you would come in here would be a
 

243
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,789
so you you would come in here would be a
typical day you'd come in

244
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
typical day you'd come in
 

245
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,470
typical day you'd come in
uh and eric domain would be sitting in

246
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:56,480
uh and eric domain would be sitting in
 

247
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,550
uh and eric domain would be sitting in
front of a white board yeah right with a

248
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:58,560
front of a white board yeah right with a
 

249
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,990
front of a white board yeah right with a
whole group of visitors

250
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
whole group of visitors
 

251
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,830
whole group of visitors
who had come to work with them and maybe

252
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:01,840
who had come to work with them and maybe
 

253
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,509
who had come to work with them and maybe
that projected like a grid on there

254
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
that projected like a grid on there
 

255
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,789
that projected like a grid on there
because they're working on some

256
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:04,799
because they're working on some
 

257
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,350
because they're working on some
graph theory problem you go to lunch you

258
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:07,360
graph theory problem you go to lunch you
 

259
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,309
graph theory problem you go to lunch you
go to the gym

260
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
go to the gym
 

261
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,470
go to the gym
you come back they're sitting there

262
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
you come back they're sitting there
 

263
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,990
you come back they're sitting there
staring at the same

264
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
staring at the same
 

265
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,270
staring at the same
same white board right like that's the

266
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:13,280
same white board right like that's the
 

267
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,869
same white board right like that's the
tier one skill this is the difference

268
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:14,879
tier one skill this is the difference
 

269
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,110
tier one skill this is the difference
between different disciplines like i

270
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:17,120
between different disciplines like i
 

271
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,670
between different disciplines like i
i often feel for many reasons like a

272
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:19,680
i often feel for many reasons like a
 

273
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,550
i often feel for many reasons like a
fraud

274
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
fraud
 

275
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,150
fraud
but i definitely feel like a fraud when

276
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
but i definitely feel like a fraud when
 

277
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,270
but i definitely feel like a fraud when
i hang out with like either

278
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,280
i hang out with like either
 

279
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,270
i hang out with like either
mathematicians or physicists

280
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
mathematicians or physicists
 

281
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,510
mathematicians or physicists
it's like it feels like they're doing

282
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
it's like it feels like they're doing
 

283
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,950
it's like it feels like they're doing
the legit work

284
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
the legit work
 

285
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,870
the legit work
because when you talk closer in computer

286
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
because when you talk closer in computer
 

287
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,550
because when you talk closer in computer
science you get to programming

288
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:32,560
science you get to programming
 

289
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,310
science you get to programming
or like machine learning like the the

290
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
or like machine learning like the the
 

291
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,469

like
just the engineering version of it it

00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:41,440
just the engineering version of it it
 

297
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,030
just the engineering version of it it
it's it feels like you're

298
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,040
it's it feels like you're
 

299
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,469
it's it feels like you're
gone so far away from what's required to

300
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
gone so far away from what's required to
 

301
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,150
gone so far away from what's required to
solve something fundamental about this

302
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,160
solve something fundamental about this
 

303
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,150
solve something fundamental about this
universe it feels like you're just like

304
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:50,160
universe it feels like you're just like
 

305
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,909
universe it feels like you're just like
cheating your way into like some kind of

306
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
cheating your way into like some kind of

trick to figure out how to solve a

308
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:54,080
trick to figure out how to solve a
 

309
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,990
trick to figure out how to solve a
problem in this one particular case yeah

310
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
problem in this one particular case yeah
 

311
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,270
problem in this one particular case yeah
that's how it feels

312
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
that's how it feels
 

313
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,510
that's how it feels
right and it's uh i'd be interested

314
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:01,520
right and it's uh i'd be interested
 

315
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,710
right and it's uh i'd be interested
to hear what you think about that

316
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
to hear what you think about that
 

317
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,830
to hear what you think about that
because um programming doesn't always

318
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:05,840
because um programming doesn't always
 

319
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,029
because um programming doesn't always
feel

320
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
feel
 

321
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,230
feel
like you need to think deeply to

322
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:10,240
like you need to think deeply to
 

323
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,790
like you need to think deeply to
work deeply but sometimes it does so

324
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
work deeply but sometimes it does so
 

325
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,230
work deeply but sometimes it does so
it's a weird dance

326
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,240
it's a weird dance
 

327
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,550
it's a weird dance
for sure code does right i mean

328
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
for sure code does right i mean
 

329
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,590
for sure code does right i mean
especially if you're coming up with

330
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
especially if you're coming up with
 

331
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,029
especially if you're coming up with
original

algorithmic designs i think it's a great

334
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
algorithmic designs i think it's a great
 

335
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,550
algorithmic designs i think it's a great
example of deep work

336
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
example of deep work
 

337
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,990
example of deep work
i mean yeah the the hardcore

338
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
i mean yeah the the hardcore
 

339
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,310
i mean yeah the the hardcore
theoreticians they push it to an extreme

340
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
theoreticians they push it to an extreme
 

341
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,550
theoreticians they push it to an extreme
i mean i i think it's like

342
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:28,560
i mean i i think it's like
 

343
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,029
i mean i i think it's like
knowing that athletic endeavor is good

344
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
knowing that athletic endeavor is good
 

345
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:31,670
knowing that athletic endeavor is good
and then

346
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
and then
 

347
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,830
and then
hanging out with a olympic athlete like

348
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:33,840
hanging out with a olympic athlete like
 

349
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,510
hanging out with a olympic athlete like
oh i see that's what it is

350
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:35,520
oh i see that's what it is
 

351
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,189
oh i see that's what it is
now for the grad students like me were

352
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:37,199
now for the grad students like me were
 

353
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,029
now for the grad students like me were
not anywhere near that level but the

354
00:05:39,029 --> 00:05:39,039
not anywhere near that level but the
 

355
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,390
not anywhere near that level but the
faculty

356
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
faculty
 

357
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,790
faculty
the faculty in that group these were the

358
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:42,800
the faculty in that group these were the
 

359
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,590
the faculty in that group these were the
cognitive

360
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:43,600
cognitive
 

361
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,469
cognitive
olympic athletes but coding i think is a

362
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:46,479
olympic athletes but coding i think is a
 

363
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,029
olympic athletes but coding i think is a
classic example of deep work because

364
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
classic example of deep work because
 

365
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,790
classic example of deep work because
i got this problem i want to solve i

366
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
i got this problem i want to solve i
 

367
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,070
i got this problem i want to solve i
have all of these tools

368
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:52,080
have all of these tools
 

369
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,110
have all of these tools
and i have to combine them somehow

370
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:55,120
and i have to combine them somehow
 

371
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,629
and i have to combine them somehow
creatively and on the fly but but so

372
00:05:56,629 --> 00:05:56,639
creatively and on the fly but but so
 

373
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,710
creatively and on the fly but but so
basically i had been exposed to that

374
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:58,720
basically i had been exposed to that
 

375
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,150
basically i had been exposed to that
so i was used to this notion when i was

376
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,160
so i was used to this notion when i was
 

377
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,590
so i was used to this notion when i was
in grad school and i was writing my blog

378
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
in grad school and i was writing my blog
 

379
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,110
in grad school and i was writing my blog
i'd write about hard focus

380
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
i'd write about hard focus
 

381
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,189
i'd write about hard focus
you know that was a term i used then i

382
00:06:05,189 --> 00:06:05,199
you know that was a term i used then i
 

383
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,469
you know that was a term i used then i
published this book

384
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:06,479
published this book
 

385
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,070
published this book
so good they can't ignore you which came

386
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
so good they can't ignore you which came
 

387
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,550
so good they can't ignore you which came
out in 2012 so like right as i began as

388
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:10,560
out in 2012 so like right as i began as
 

389
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,990
out in 2012 so like right as i began as
a professor

390
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,000
a professor
 

391
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,469
a professor
and that book had this notion of skill

392
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:14,479
and that book had this notion of skill
 

393
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:15,670
and that book had this notion of skill
being really important for career

394
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
being really important for career
 

395
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,790
being really important for career
satisfaction that

396
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:16,800
satisfaction that
 

397
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,350
satisfaction that
it's not just following your passion you

398
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:19,360
it's not just following your passion you
 

399
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,550
it's not just following your passion you
have to actually really get good at

400
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:20,560
have to actually really get good at
 

401
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,830
have to actually really get good at
something and then you use that skills

402
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
something and then you use that skills
 

403
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,950
something and then you use that skills
as leverage and there's this big

404
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:22,960
as leverage and there's this big
 

405
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,550
as leverage and there's this big
follow-up question to that book of okay

406
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
follow-up question to that book of okay
 

407
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,309
follow-up question to that book of okay
well how do i get really good at this

408
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:26,319
well how do i get really good at this
 

409
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,150
well how do i get really good at this
yeah and then i look back to my grad

410
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
yeah and then i look back to my grad
 

411
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,150
yeah and then i look back to my grad
school experience i was like huh

412
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,160
school experience i was like huh
 

413
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,990
school experience i was like huh
there's this focus thing that we used to

414
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,000
there's this focus thing that we used to
 

415
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,990
there's this focus thing that we used to
do i wonder how

416
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,000
do i wonder how
 

417
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,510
do i wonder how
generally applicable that is into the

418
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:35,520
generally applicable that is into the
 

419
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,870
generally applicable that is into the
knowledge sector and so as i started

420
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:36,880
knowledge sector and so as i started
 

421
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,150
knowledge sector and so as i started
thinking about it

422
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
thinking about it
 

423
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,749
thinking about it
it became clear there's this interesting

424
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
it became clear there's this interesting
 

425
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,430
it became clear there's this interesting
storyline that emerged that okay

426
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:41,440
storyline that emerged that okay
 

427
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,110
storyline that emerged that okay
actually undistracted concentration is

428
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,120
actually undistracted concentration is
 

429
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,469
actually undistracted concentration is
not just important for

430
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:44,479
not just important for
 

431
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,550
not just important for
esoteric theoreticians it's important

432
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
esoteric theoreticians it's important
 

433
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,749
esoteric theoreticians it's important
here it's important here and so forth

434
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
here it's important here and so forth
 

435
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,550
here it's important here and so forth
here

436
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
here
 

437
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,150
here
and that involved into the uh the deep

438
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,160
and that involved into the uh the deep
 

439
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,990
and that involved into the uh the deep
work hypothesis which is

440
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,000
work hypothesis which is
 

441
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,189
work hypothesis which is
across the whole knowledge work sector

442
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
across the whole knowledge work sector
 

443
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,870
across the whole knowledge work sector
focus is very important and we've

444
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
focus is very important and we've
 

445
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,870
focus is very important and we've
accidentally created circumstances where

446
00:06:58,870 --> 00:06:58,880
accidentally created circumstances where
 

447
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,270
accidentally created circumstances where
we just don't do a lot of it so focus is

448
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,280
we just don't do a lot of it so focus is
 

449
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,350
we just don't do a lot of it so focus is
the sort of prerequisite for basically

450
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,360
the sort of prerequisite for basically
 

451
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,029
the sort of prerequisite for basically
uh you say knowledge work but

452
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
uh you say knowledge work but
 

453
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,950
uh you say knowledge work but
basically any kind of skill acquisition

454
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
basically any kind of skill acquisition
 

455
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,110
basically any kind of skill acquisition
any kind of major effort in this world

456
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:09,120
any kind of major effort in this world
 

457
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,510
any kind of major effort in this world
can we break that apart a little bit

458
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
can we break that apart a little bit
 

459
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,230
can we break that apart a little bit
yeah so

460
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
yeah so
 

461
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,430
yeah so
so a key a key aspect of focus is not

462
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:15,440
so a key a key aspect of focus is not
 

463
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,390
so a key a key aspect of focus is not
just that you're

464
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:16,400
just that you're
 

465
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,670
just that you're
you're concentrating hard on something

466
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:17,680
you're concentrating hard on something
 

467
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,990
you're concentrating hard on something
but you do it without distraction

468
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,000
but you do it without distraction
 

469
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,710
but you do it without distraction
so a big theme of my work is that

470
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:22,720
so a big theme of my work is that
 

471
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,550
so a big theme of my work is that
context shifting

472
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:24,560
context shifting
 

473
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,589
context shifting
kills the human capacity to think so if

474
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
kills the human capacity to think so if
 

475
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,270
kills the human capacity to think so if
i if i change what i'm paying attention

476
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
i if i change what i'm paying attention
 

477
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,950
i if i change what i'm paying attention
to to something different

478
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:30,960
to to something different
 

479
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,150
to to something different
really even if it's brief and then try

480
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:32,160
really even if it's brief and then try
 

481
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,430
really even if it's brief and then try
to bring it back to the main thing i'm

482
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:33,440
to bring it back to the main thing i'm
 

483
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,070
to bring it back to the main thing i'm
doing

484
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
doing
 

485
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,909
doing
that causes a huge cognitive pile up to

486
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
that causes a huge cognitive pile up to
 

487
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,909
that causes a huge cognitive pile up to
make it very hard to think clearly

488
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:37,919
make it very hard to think clearly
 

489
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,510
make it very hard to think clearly
so even if you think okay look i'm

490
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:39,520
so even if you think okay look i'm
 

491
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,270
so even if you think okay look i'm
writing this code or i'm writing this

492
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,280
writing this code or i'm writing this
 

493
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,830
writing this code or i'm writing this
essay and i'm not multitasking and all

494
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:43,840
essay and i'm not multitasking and all
 

495
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,510
essay and i'm not multitasking and all
my windows are closed and i have no

496
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:45,520
my windows are closed and i have no
 

497
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,990
my windows are closed and i have no
notifications on but every five or six

498
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,000
notifications on but every five or six
 

499
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,909
notifications on but every five or six
minutes you quickly check

500
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:49,919
minutes you quickly check
 

501
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,070
minutes you quickly check
like an inbox or your phone that

502
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,080
like an inbox or your phone that
 

503
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,830
like an inbox or your phone that
initiates a contact shift in your brain

504
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:53,840
initiates a contact shift in your brain
 

505
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,110
initiates a contact shift in your brain
right we're gonna start to suppress some

506
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
right we're gonna start to suppress some
 

507
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,230
right we're gonna start to suppress some
neural networks we're gonna try to

508
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:56,240
neural networks we're gonna try to
 

509
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,350
neural networks we're gonna try to
amplify some others

510
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:57,360
amplify some others
 

511
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,869
amplify some others
it's a pretty complicated process

512
00:07:58,869 --> 00:07:58,879
it's a pretty complicated process
 

513
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,150
it's a pretty complicated process
actually there's a sort of neurological

514
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
actually there's a sort of neurological
 

515
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,150
actually there's a sort of neurological
cascade that happens

516
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,160
cascade that happens
 

517
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,070
cascade that happens
you rip yourself away from that halfway

518
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,080
you rip yourself away from that halfway
 

519
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,270
you rip yourself away from that halfway
through and go back to what you're doing

520
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,280
through and go back to what you're doing
 

521
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,390
through and go back to what you're doing
and i was trying to switch back to the

522
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
and i was trying to switch back to the
 

523
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,749
and i was trying to switch back to the
original thing even though it's also in

524
00:08:07,749 --> 00:08:07,759
original thing even though it's also in
 

525
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,029
original thing even though it's also in
your brain's in the process of switching

526
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:09,039
your brain's in the process of switching
 

527
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,550
your brain's in the process of switching
to these emails and trying to understand

528
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,560
to these emails and trying to understand
 

529
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,670
to these emails and trying to understand
those contexts

530
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:11,680
those contexts
 

531
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,270
those contexts
and as a result your ability to think

532
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,280
and as a result your ability to think
 

533
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,150
and as a result your ability to think
clearly just goes really down

534
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,160
clearly just goes really down
 

535
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,589
clearly just goes really down
and it's fatiguing too i mean you do

536
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:17,599
and it's fatiguing too i mean you do
 

537
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,350
and it's fatiguing too i mean you do
this long enough you get midday and

538
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
this long enough you get midday and
 

539
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,629
this long enough you get midday and
you're like okay i can't

540
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
you're like okay i can't
 

541
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,550
you're like okay i can't
i can't think anymore you've exhausted

542
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:22,560
i can't think anymore you've exhausted
 

543
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,469
i can't think anymore you've exhausted
yourself is there some kind of

544
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
yourself is there some kind of
 

545
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,749
yourself is there some kind of
um perfect number of minutes

546
00:08:27,749 --> 00:08:27,759
um perfect number of minutes
 

547
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,670
um perfect number of minutes
would you say so we're talking about

548
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,680
would you say so we're talking about
 

549
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,790
would you say so we're talking about
focusing

550
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:30,800
focusing
 

551
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,149
focusing
on a particular task for you know

552
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:34,159
on a particular task for you know
 

553
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,230
on a particular task for you know
one minute five minutes 10 minutes 30

554
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
one minute five minutes 10 minutes 30
 

555
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,550
one minute five minutes 10 minutes 30
minutes is it possible to kind of

556
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:38,560
minutes is it possible to kind of
 

557
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,190
minutes is it possible to kind of
context switch while maintaining deep

558
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:41,200
context switch while maintaining deep
 

559
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,389
context switch while maintaining deep
focus

560
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:42,399
focus
 

561
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,389
focus
you know every 20 minutes or so so if

562
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:44,399
you know every 20 minutes or so so if
 

563
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,750
you know every 20 minutes or so so if
you're thinking of like

564
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
you're thinking of like
 

565
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,990
you're thinking of like
this again maybe it's a selfish kind of

566
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
this again maybe it's a selfish kind of
 

567
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,350
this again maybe it's a selfish kind of
perspective but if you think about

568
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,360
perspective but if you think about
 

569
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,949
perspective but if you think about
programming

570
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:50,959
programming
 

571
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,550
programming
you know you're focused on a particular

572
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:52,560
you know you're focused on a particular
 

573
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,230
you know you're focused on a particular
design of a little bit maybe a small

574
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:54,240
design of a little bit maybe a small
 

575
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,750
design of a little bit maybe a small
scale on a particular function

576
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:55,760
scale on a particular function
 

577
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,430
scale on a particular function
or a large scale on a on a system

578
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
or a large scale on a on a system
 

579
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,070
or a large scale on a on a system
and then the shift to focus happens like

580
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,080
and then the shift to focus happens like
 

581
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,630
and then the shift to focus happens like
this

582
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:02,640
this
 

583
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,269
this
which is like wait a minute is there a

584
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
which is like wait a minute is there a
 

585
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,949
which is like wait a minute is there a
library that can achieve this little

586
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
library that can achieve this little
 

587
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,150
library that can achieve this little
task or something like that

588
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
task or something like that
 

589
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,389
task or something like that
and then you have to look it up this is

590
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:10,399
and then you have to look it up this is
 

591
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,350
and then you have to look it up this is
the danger zone

592
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:11,360
the danger zone
 

593
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,910
the danger zone
you go to the internets yeah and and so

594
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
you go to the internets yeah and and so
 

595
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,790
you go to the internets yeah and and so
you have to

596
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:14,800
you have to
 

597
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,949
you have to
now you it is a kind of contact switch

598
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:16,959
now you it is a kind of contact switch
 

599
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,550
now you it is a kind of contact switch
because as opposed to thinking about the

600
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
because as opposed to thinking about the
 

601
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,910
because as opposed to thinking about the
particular problem

602
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:19,920
particular problem
 

603
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,269
particular problem
you now have switch thinking about like

604
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:23,279
you now have switch thinking about like
 

605
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,389
you now have switch thinking about like
uh consuming and integrating knowledge

606
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:26,399
uh consuming and integrating knowledge
 

607
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,750
uh consuming and integrating knowledge
that's out there

608
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,760
that's out there
 

609
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,230
that's out there
that can plug into your solution to a

610
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:30,240
that can plug into your solution to a
 

611
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,910
that can plug into your solution to a
particular problem it definitely feels

612
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:31,920
particular problem it definitely feels
 

613
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,509
particular problem it definitely feels
like a contact switch

614
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
like a contact switch
 

615
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,509
like a contact switch
but is that is that a really bad thing

616
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:35,519
but is that is that a really bad thing
 

617
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,750
but is that is that a really bad thing
to do so should you be setting it aside

618
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:37,760
to do so should you be setting it aside
 

619
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,470
to do so should you be setting it aside
always

620
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
always
 

621
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,110
always
and really trying to as much as possible

622
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
and really trying to as much as possible
 

623
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,070
and really trying to as much as possible
go deep

624
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:42,080
go deep
 

625
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,630
go deep
and stay there for like a really long

626
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
and stay there for like a really long
 

627
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,750
and stay there for like a really long
period of time

628
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:45,760
period of time
 

629
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,190
period of time
well i mean i think if you're looking up

630
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
well i mean i think if you're looking up
 

631
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,590
well i mean i think if you're looking up
a library that's relevant to what you're

632
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:49,600
a library that's relevant to what you're
 

633
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,310
a library that's relevant to what you're
doing

634
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:50,320
doing
 

635
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,590
doing
that's probably okay and i don't know

636
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600
that's probably okay and i don't know
 

637
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,790
that's probably okay and i don't know
that i would count that as a full

638
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:52,800
that i would count that as a full
 

639
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,550
that i would count that as a full
context shift because

640
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:54,560
context shift because
 

641
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,389
context shift because
the semantic networks involved are

642
00:09:56,389 --> 00:09:56,399
the semantic networks involved are
 

643
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,070
the semantic networks involved are
relatively similar right

644
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,080
relatively similar right
 

645
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,910
relatively similar right
you're thinking about this type of

646
00:09:59,910 --> 00:09:59,920
you're thinking about this type of
 

647
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,430
you're thinking about this type of
solution you're thinking about coding

648
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
solution you're thinking about coding
 

649
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,550
solution you're thinking about coding
you're thinking about this type of

650
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:02,560
you're thinking about this type of
 

651
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,350
you're thinking about this type of
functions

652
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
functions
 

653
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,630
functions
where you're really going to get hit is

654
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:04,640
where you're really going to get hit is
 

655
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,230
where you're really going to get hit is
if you switch your context to something

656
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,240
if you switch your context to something
 

657
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,790
if you switch your context to something
that's

658
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
that's
 

659
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,110
that's
different and if there's unresolved

660
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
different and if there's unresolved
 

661
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,949
different and if there's unresolved
obligations so really the worst possible

662
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:10,959
obligations so really the worst possible
 

663
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:12,150
obligations so really the worst possible
thing you could do would be to look at

664
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:12,160
thing you could do would be to look at

669
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,069
because here's 20 emails i can't answer
most of these right now they're

670
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
most of these right now they're
 

671
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,350
most of these right now they're
completely different

672
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,360
completely different
 

673
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,110
completely different
like the context of these emails like

674
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,120
like the context of these emails like
 

675
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,710
like the context of these emails like
okay there's a grant funding issue or

676
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:22,720
okay there's a grant funding issue or
 

677
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,670
okay there's a grant funding issue or
something like this is very different

678
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:23,680
something like this is very different
 

679
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,350
something like this is very different
than the coding i'm doing

680
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:25,360
than the coding i'm doing
 

681
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,269
than the coding i'm doing
and i'm leaving it unresolved so it's

682
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:27,279
and i'm leaving it unresolved so it's
 

683
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,949
and i'm leaving it unresolved so it's
like someone needs something from me

calm and peaceful over there right
that could be devastating because you're

698
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:38,720
that could be devastating because you're
 

699
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,990
that could be devastating because you're
going to expose yourself to something

700
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:40,000
going to expose yourself to something
 

701
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,350
going to expose yourself to something
that's emotionally arousing

702
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,360
that's emotionally arousing
 

703
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,710
that's emotionally arousing
that's going to completely mess up the

704
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
that's going to completely mess up the
 

705
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,990
that's going to completely mess up the
cognitive platform there and then when

706
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
cognitive platform there and then when
 

707
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,750
cognitive platform there and then when
you come back to okay let me try to code

708
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
you come back to okay let me try to code
 

709
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,710
you come back to okay let me try to code
again

710
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
again
 

711
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,310
again
it's really difficult this is both the

712
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,320
it's really difficult this is both the
 

713
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,910
it's really difficult this is both the
information and the emotion

714
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
information and the emotion
 

715
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,230
information and the emotion
yeah both both can be killers if what

716
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,240
yeah both both can be killers if what
 

717
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,190
yeah both both can be killers if what
you're trying to do

718
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,200
you're trying to do
 

719
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,790
you're trying to do
so i would recommend at least an hour at

720
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
so i would recommend at least an hour at
 

721
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,870
so i would recommend at least an hour at
a time because it could take up to 20

722
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:56,880
a time because it could take up to 20
 

723
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,430
a time because it could take up to 20
minutes

724
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:57,440
minutes
 

725
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,990
minutes
to completely clear out the residue from

726
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:00,000
to completely clear out the residue from
 

727
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,269
to completely clear out the residue from
whatever it was you were thinking about

728
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:01,279
whatever it was you were thinking about
 

729
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,389
whatever it was you were thinking about
before

730
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:02,399
before
 

731
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,910
before
so if you're coding for 30 minutes you

732
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:03,920
so if you're coding for 30 minutes you
 

733
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,509
so if you're coding for 30 minutes you
might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes

734
00:11:05,509 --> 00:11:05,519
might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes
 

735
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,470
might only be getting 10 or 15 minutes
of actual

736
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
of actual
 

737
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,790
of actual
sort of peak lex going on there right so

738
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:08,800
sort of peak lex going on there right so
 

739
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,030
sort of peak lex going on there right so
an hour at least you get a good 40 45

740
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
an hour at least you get a good 40 45
 

741
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,030
an hour at least you get a good 40 45
minutes plus i'm partial to 90 minutes

742
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,040
minutes plus i'm partial to 90 minutes
 

743
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,550
minutes plus i'm partial to 90 minutes
that's a really good

744
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:14,560
that's a really good
 

745
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,910
that's a really good
a really good chunk we can get a lot

746
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:15,920
a really good chunk we can get a lot
 

747
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,470
a really good chunk we can get a lot
done but just before you get exhausted

748
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:18,480
done but just before you get exhausted
 

749
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,750
done but just before you get exhausted
you can sort of

750
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
you can sort of
 

751
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,150
you can sort of
pull back a little bit yeah and now one

752
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,160
pull back a little bit yeah and now one
 

753
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,110
pull back a little bit yeah and now one
of the beautiful and

754
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,120
of the beautiful and
 

755
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,509
of the beautiful and
you know people can read about in your

756
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
you know people can read about in your
 

757
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,870
you know people can read about in your
book deep work

758
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:26,880
book deep work
 

759
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,790
book deep work
but and i know this has been out for a

760
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:28,800
but and i know this has been out for a
 

761
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,230
but and i know this has been out for a
long time and people are probably

762
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
long time and people are probably
 

763
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,470
long time and people are probably
familiar with many other concepts but

764
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
familiar with many other concepts but
 

765
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,470
familiar with many other concepts but
it's still pretty profound it has stayed

766
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,480
it's still pretty profound it has stayed
 

767
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,150
it's still pretty profound it has stayed
with me for a long time

768
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
with me for a long time
 

769
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,069
with me for a long time
uh there's something about adding the

770
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:38,079
uh there's something about adding the
 

771
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,269
uh there's something about adding the
terms to it

772
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
terms to it
 

773
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,990
terms to it
that actually solidifies the concepts

774
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
that actually solidifies the concepts
 

775
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,949
that actually solidifies the concepts
like words matter

776
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
like words matter
 

777
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,150
like words matter
it's pretty cool and uh just for me

778
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,160
it's pretty cool and uh just for me
 

779
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,269
it's pretty cool and uh just for me
sort of as a comment there's

780
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:49,279
sort of as a comment there's
 

781
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,430
sort of as a comment there's
uh it's a struggle and it's very

782

here
here's what's left what do i actually

874
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
here's what's left what do i actually
 

875
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,470
here's what's left what do i actually
want to do with it so in this half hour

876
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:16,480
want to do with it so in this half hour
 

877
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,750
want to do with it so in this half hour
i'm going to work on this

878
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:17,760
i'm going to work on this
 

879
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,030
i'm going to work on this
for this 90 minute block i'm going to

880
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,040
for this 90 minute block i'm going to
 

881
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,150
for this 90 minute block i'm going to
work on that and during this hour i'm

882
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
work on that and during this hour i'm
 

883
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,350
work on that and during this hour i'm
going to try to fit this in and then

884
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:21,360
going to try to fit this in and then
 

885
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,790
going to try to fit this in and then
actually have this half hour gap between

886
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
actually have this half hour gap between
 

887
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,910
actually have this half hour gap between
two meetings so why don't i take

888
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
two meetings so why don't i take
 

889
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,670
two meetings so why don't i take
advantage of that to go run five errands

890
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
advantage of that to go run five errands
 

891
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,509
advantage of that to go run five errands
i can kind of batch those together

892
00:13:27,509 --> 00:13:27,519
i can kind of batch those together
 

893
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,389
i can kind of batch those together
but blocking out in advance this is what

894
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:30,399
but blocking out in advance this is what
 

895
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,230
but blocking out in advance this is what
i want to do with the time available

896
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
i want to do with the time available
 

897
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,590
i want to do with the time available
i mean i find that's much more effective

898
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:33,600
i mean i find that's much more effective
 

899
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,710
i mean i find that's much more effective
now once you're doing this once you're

900
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:34,720
now once you're doing this once you're
 

901
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,150
now once you're doing this once you're
in a discipline of time blocking

902
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
in a discipline of time blocking
 

903
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,910
in a discipline of time blocking
it's much easier to actually see this is

904
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
it's much easier to actually see this is
 

905
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,990
it's much easier to actually see this is
where i want for example to deep work

906
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
where i want for example to deep work
 

907
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,430
where i want for example to deep work
and i can get a handle on the other

908
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,440
and i can get a handle on the other
 

909
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,189
and i can get a handle on the other
things that need to happen and find

910
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:43,199
things that need to happen and find
 

911
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,310
things that need to happen and find
better places to

912
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:44,320
better places to
 

913
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,069
better places to
fit them so i can prioritize this and

914
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
fit them so i can prioritize this and
 

915
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,350
fit them so i can prioritize this and
you're going to get a lot more of that

empty day so that's going to be the day
that i really need to nail on writing or

980
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:36,880
that i really need to nail on writing or
 

981
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,910
that i really need to nail on writing or
something like this

982
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:37,920
something like this
 

983
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,910
something like this
and then every day you look at your

984
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
and then every day you look at your
 

985
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,949
and then every day you look at your
weekly plan

986
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
weekly plan
 

987
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,310
weekly plan
and still only block off the actual

988
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
and still only block off the actual
 

989
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,550
and still only block off the actual
hours so you do that that three scales

990
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:44,560
hours so you do that that three scales
 

991
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:44,870
hours so you do that that three scales
the

992
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
the
 

993
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,470
the
the quarterly down to weekly down to

994
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
the quarterly down to weekly down to
 

995
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,110
the quarterly down to weekly down to
daily and we're talking about actual

996
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
daily and we're talking about actual
 

997
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:49,990
daily and we're talking about actual
times of day

998
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,000
times of day
 

999
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,030

but i'm of your same mindset if a deep
work session is going

1142
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:20,959
work session is going
 

1143
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,909
work session is going

1144
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:23,919
well you just rock and roll and let it
 

1145
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,750
well you just rock and roll and let it
go on so like one of the big keys of

1146
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
go on so like one of the big keys of
 

1147
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,350
go on so like one of the big keys of
time block at least the way i do it so i

1148
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:27,360
time block at least the way i do it so i
 

1149
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,630
time block at least the way i do it so i
even you know sell this

1150
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
even you know sell this
 

1151
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,870
even you know sell this
planner to help people time block it has

1152
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
planner to help people time block it has
 

1153
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,990
planner to help people time block it has
many columns because

1154
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
many columns because
 

1155
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,909
many columns because
the discipline is oh if your initial

1156
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:33,919
the discipline is oh if your initial
 

1157
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,750
the discipline is oh if your initial
schedule changes

1158
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:35,760
schedule changes
 

1159
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,110
schedule changes
you just move over one next time you get

1160
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
you just move over one next time you get
 

1161
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,789
you just move over one next time you get
a chance to move over one column

1162
00:17:38,789 --> 00:17:38,799
a chance to move over one column
 

1163
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,909
a chance to move over one column
and then you just fix it for the time

1164
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
and then you just fix it for the time
 

1165
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,590
and then you just fix it for the time
that's remaining so in other words

and gave it some thought for what to do
because i'll do the same thing even

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
because i'll do the same thing even
 

1193

1213
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,630
yeah well that's that's what it is for
me like with writing i think it's

1214
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
me like with writing i think it's
 

1215
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,150
me like with writing i think it's
writing so hard in a certain way that

1216
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:22,160
writing so hard in a certain way that
 

1217
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,310
writing so hard in a certain way that
it's you don't really get on a roll in

1218
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:24,320
it's you don't really get on a roll in
 

1219
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,230
it's you don't really get on a roll in
some sense like it's just difficult

1220
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
some sense like it's just difficult
 

1221
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,310
some sense like it's just difficult
uh but working on proofs it's very hard

1222
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,320
uh but working on proofs it's very hard
 

1223
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,390
uh but working on proofs it's very hard
to pull yourself away from a proof if

1224
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
to pull yourself away from a proof if
 

1225
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,070
to pull yourself away from a proof if
you start to get some traction just

1226
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
you start to get some traction just
 

1227
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,350
you start to get some traction just
you've been at it for a couple hours

1228
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
you've been at it for a couple hours
 

1229
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,190
you've been at it for a couple hours
then you feel the uh the pins and

1230
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
then you feel the uh the pins and
 

1231
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,710
then you feel the uh the pins and
tumblers starting to click together and

1232
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:38,720
tumblers starting to click together and
 

1233
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,390
tumblers starting to click together and
progress is being made

1234
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
progress is being made
 

1235
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,990
progress is being made
it's really hard to call pull away from

1236
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
it's really hard to call pull away from
 

1237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,430
it's really hard to call pull away from
that so so i'm willing to get yelled at

1238
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
that so so i'm willing to get yelled at

that so so i'm willing to get yelled at
by almost everyone

1240
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
by almost everyone
 

1241
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,990
by almost everyone

1242
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
of course there is also a positive
 

1243
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:48,710
of course there is also a positive
effect to

1244
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
effect to
 

1245
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,909
effect to
uh pulling yourself out of it when

00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:17,520
so now we're sort of starting something
 

1273
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,470
so now we're sort of starting something
up from cold

session uh

1306
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,080
session uh
 

1307
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,590
session uh
it's uh why it seems like i don't i only

1308
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
it's uh why it seems like i don't i only
 

1309

that has deadlines and so the one of the

1312
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
that has deadlines and so the one of the
 

1313
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,590
that has deadlines and so the one of the
implied powerful things about time

1314
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
implied powerful things about time
 

1315
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,990
implied powerful things about time
blocking is there's a kind of deadline

1316
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
blocking is there's a kind of deadline
 

1317
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,549
blocking is there's a kind of deadline
or there's a artificial a real sense of

1318
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
or there's a artificial a real sense of
 

1319
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,909
or there's a artificial a real sense of
urgency

1320
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
urgency
 

1321
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,070
urgency
do you think it's possible to get

1322
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:02,080
do you think it's possible to get
 

1323
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,510
do you think it's possible to get
anything done in this world without

1324
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:03,520
anything done in this world without
 

1325
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,149
anything done in this world without
deadlines

1326
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
deadlines
 

1327
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,470
deadlines
why why do deadlines work so well well

1328
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:06,480
why why do deadlines work so well well
 

1329
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,830
why why do deadlines work so well well
it's i mean it's a clear motivational

1330
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
it's i mean it's a clear motivational
 

1331
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,470
it's i mean it's a clear motivational
signal

1332
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:08,480
signal
 

1333
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,270
signal
but in the in the short term you do get

1334
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
but in the in the short term you do get
 

1335
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,630
but in the in the short term you do get
an effect like that in time blocking i

1336
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:12,640
an effect like that in time blocking i
 

1337
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,470
an effect like that in time blocking i
think the the strong effect you get by

1338
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:14,480
think the the strong effect you get by
 

1339
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,350
think the the strong effect you get by
saying

1340
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:15,360
saying
 

1341
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,029
saying
this is the exact time i'm going to work

1342
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:17,039
this is the exact time i'm going to work
 

1343
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,350
this is the exact time i'm going to work
on this is that you don't have to debate

1344
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:19,360
on this is that you don't have to debate
 

1345
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,909
on this is that you don't have to debate
with yourself every three minutes about

1346
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:21,919
with yourself every three minutes about
 

1347
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,430
with yourself every three minutes about

should i take a break now right like
this is the big issue with just saying

1350
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:24,720
this is the big issue with just saying
 

1351
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,149
this is the big issue with just saying
you know i'm going to go right

1352
00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:26,159
you know i'm going to go right
 

1353

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
i'm going to write for a while and
 

1355
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,549
i'm going to write for a while and
that's it because your mind is saying

1356
00:20:28,549 --> 00:20:28,559
that's it because your mind is saying
 

1357
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,830
that's it because your mind is saying
well obviously we're going to take some

1358
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:29,840
well obviously we're going to take some
 

1359

well obviously we're going to take some
breaks

1360
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:30,559
breaks
 

1361
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:31,510
breaks
right we're not just going to write

1362
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:31,520
right we're not just going to write
 

1363
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,990
right we're not just going to write
forever and so why not right now

1364
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,000
forever and so why not right now
 

1365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,029
forever and so why not right now
you have to be like well not right now

1366
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039

let's go a little bit longer five
 

1369
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,950
let's go a little bit longer five
minutes later we'll always take a break

1370
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
minutes later we'll always take a break
 

1371
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,070
minutes later we'll always take a break
now like we should probably look at the

1372
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,080
now like we should probably look at the
 

1373
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,630
now like we should probably look at the
internet

1374
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
internet
 

1375
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,909
internet
now you have to constantly have this

1376
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
now you have to constantly have this
 

1377
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,950
now you have to constantly have this
battle on the other hand if you're in a

1378
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:40,960
battle on the other hand if you're in a
 

1379
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,070
battle on the other hand if you're in a
time block schedule

1380
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,080

1534
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:07,840
processed and that's like the
 

1535
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,430
processed and that's like the
philosophical aspect of that book deep

1536
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:09,440
philosophical aspect of that book deep
 

1537
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,870
philosophical aspect of that book deep
work is that there's something

1538
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
work is that there's something
 

1539
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,070
work is that there's something
very human and deep about just wrangling

1540
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,080
very human and deep about just wrangling
 

1541
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,669
very human and deep about just wrangling
with the world of ideas i mean aristotle

1542
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:15,679
with the world of ideas i mean aristotle
 

1543
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,190
with the world of ideas i mean aristotle
talked about this if you go back and

1544
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:17,200
talked about this if you go back and
 

1545
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,029
talked about this if you go back and
and read the ethics he's trying to

1546
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:19,039
and read the ethics he's trying to
 

1547
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,549
and read the ethics he's trying to
understand the meaning of life and he

1548
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:20,559
understand the meaning of life and he
 

1549
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,990
understand the meaning of life and he
eventually ends up ultimately

1550
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
eventually ends up ultimately
 

1551
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,270
eventually ends up ultimately
at the human capacity to contemplate

1552
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:25,280
at the human capacity to contemplate
 

1553
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,310
at the human capacity to contemplate
deeply

1554
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:26,320
deeply
 

1555
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,750
deeply
it's kind of a teleological argument

1556
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
it's kind of a teleological argument
 

1557
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,350
it's kind of a teleological argument
it's the things that only humans can do

1558
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
it's the things that only humans can do
 

1559
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,470
it's the things that only humans can do
and therefore it must be somehow

1560
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:30,480
and therefore it must be somehow
 

1561
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,909
and therefore it must be somehow
connected to our ends and he said

1562
00:23:31,909 --> 00:23:31,919
connected to our ends and he said
 

1563
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,110
connected to our ends and he said
ultimately that's where

1564
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:33,120
ultimately that's where
 

1565
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,710
ultimately that's where
that's refound his meaning but you know

1566
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:34,720
that's refound his meaning but you know
 

1567
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,310
that's refound his meaning but you know
he's touching on some sort of intimation

1568
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:36,320
he's touching on some sort of intimation
 

1569
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,669
he's touching on some sort of intimation
there that's correct that

1570
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
there that's correct that
 

1571
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,029
there that's correct that
and so what i try to build my life

1572
00:23:39,029 --> 00:23:39,039
and so what i try to build my life
 

1573
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,950
and so what i try to build my life
around is regularly thinking hard about

1574
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
around is regularly thinking hard about
 

1575
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,630
around is regularly thinking hard about
stuff that's interesting just like if

1576
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:44,640
stuff that's interesting just like if
 

1577
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,230
stuff that's interesting just like if
you get a fitness habit going

1578
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
you get a fitness habit going
 

1579
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,070
you get a fitness habit going
you feel off when you don't do it

1580
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:50,080
you feel off when you don't do it
 

1581
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,669
you feel off when you don't do it
i try to get that cognitive habit so

1582
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:51,679
i try to get that cognitive habit so
 

1583
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,430
i try to get that cognitive habit so
it's like i got it i mean look i have my

1584
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
it's like i got it i mean look i have my
 

1585

it's like i got it i mean look i have my
bag here somewhere i have my notebook in

1586
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:54,880
bag here somewhere i have my notebook in
 

1587
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,430
bag here somewhere i have my notebook in
it because

1588
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:55,440
it because
 

1589
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,750
it because
i was thinking on the uber ride over i

1590
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:57,760
i was thinking on the uber ride over i
 

1591
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,029
i was thinking on the uber ride over i
was like you know i could get some

1592
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
was like you know i could get some
 

1593
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,470
was like you know i could get some
i'm working on this new proof and it

1594
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:00,480
i'm working on this new proof and it
 

1595
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,950
i'm working on this new proof and it
just so you train yourself you train

1596
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:02,960
just so you train yourself you train
 

1597
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,470
just so you train yourself you train
yourself to appreciate certain things

1598
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:04,480
yourself to appreciate certain things
 

1599
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,549
yourself to appreciate certain things
and then over time the hope is that it

1600
00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:06,559
and then over time the hope is that it
 

1601
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,190
and then over time the hope is that it
accretes well let's talk about some

1602
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
accretes well let's talk about some
 

1603
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,470
accretes well let's talk about some
demons because

1604
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:10,480
demons because
 

1605
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,470
demons because
i wonder it's okay there's like deep

1606
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:12,480
i wonder it's okay there's like deep
 

1607
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,669
i wonder it's okay there's like deep
work

1608
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
work
 

1609
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,110
work
which uh and the

1610
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120

but it does feel like if i'm just being
 

1737
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,990
but it does feel like if i'm just being
introspective

1738
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,000
introspective
 

1739
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,710
introspective
that i bring it on to myself i suppose a

1740
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:22,720
that i bring it on to myself i suppose a
 

1741
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,310
that i bring it on to myself i suppose a
lot of people do this kind of thing

1742
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
lot of people do this kind of thing
 

1743
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,470
lot of people do this kind of thing
yes is they they flourish

1744
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
yes is they they flourish
 

1745
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,510
yes is they they flourish
under pressure yeah and i wonder if that

1746
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:31,520
under pressure yeah and i wonder if that
 

1747
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,149
under pressure yeah and i wonder if that
um if that's just the hack i've

1748
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
um if that's just the hack i've
 

1749
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,230
um if that's just the hack i've
developed as a habit

1750
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:36,240
developed as a habit
 

1751
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,669

1813
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,750
which is kind of an easy job right um i
put artificial

1814
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:27,760
put artificial
 

1815
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,990

research and so as a postdoc
 

1825
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,510

so it's like okay i want to get really

1840
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
so it's like okay i want to get really
 

1841
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,310
so it's like okay i want to get really
good at putting artificial constraints

1842
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,320
good at putting artificial constraints
 

1843
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,430
good at putting artificial constraints
on so that i stay

1844
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
on so that i stay
 

1845
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,830
on so that i stay
i didn't want to get uh flabby when my

1846
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:53,840
i didn't want to get uh flabby when my
 

1847
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,350
i didn't want to get uh flabby when my
job was easy so that when i became a

1848
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
job was easy so that when i became a
 

1849
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,389
job was easy so that when i became a
professor

1850
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:56,399
professor
 

1851
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,830
professor
and now all of that's paying off because

1852
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
and now all of that's paying off because
 

1853
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,590
and now all of that's paying off because
i have a ton of kids so

1854
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
i have a ton of kids so
 

1855
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,669
i have a ton of kids so
so now i don't really have a choice

1856
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679
so now i don't really have a choice
 

1857
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:02,950
so now i don't really have a choice
that's what's probably keeping me away

1858
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:02,960
that's what's probably keeping me away
 

1859
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,990
that's what's probably keeping me away
from cool things

1860
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:04,000
from cool things
 

1861
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,149
from cool things

then after a while people
 

1865
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,029
then after a while people

you
yeah so if you if you live in chaos

1892
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:35,200
yeah so if you if you live in chaos
 

1893

you're going to attract chaotic people
and then it becomes like this uh self

1896
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
and then it becomes like this uh self
 

1897
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,830
and then it becomes like this uh self
fulfilling prophecy yeah and it feels

1898
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:42,840
fulfilling prophecy yeah and it feels
 

1899
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,909
fulfilling prophecy yeah and it feels
like i'm not bothered by it

1900
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
like i'm not bothered by it
 

1901
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,389
like i'm not bothered by it
but i guess this is all coming around to

1902
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
but i guess this is all coming around to
 

1903
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,789
but i guess this is all coming around to
exactly what you're saying which is like

1904
00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:50,799
exactly what you're saying which is like
 

1905
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,230
exactly what you're saying which is like
i think one of the big hacks for

1906
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
i think one of the big hacks for
 

1907
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,830
i think one of the big hacks for
productive people that i've met

1908
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:53,840
productive people that i've met
 

1909
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,870
productive people that i've met
is to get married and have kids

1910
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
is to get married and have kids
 

1911
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,190
is to get married and have kids
honestly it's it's very perhaps

1912
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
honestly it's it's very perhaps
 

1913
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,230
honestly it's it's very perhaps
counter-intuitive

1914
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,240
counter-intuitive
 

1915
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,830
counter-intuitive
yeah but it gets it's like the ultimate

1916
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:03,840
yeah but it gets it's like the ultimate
 

1917
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,710
yeah but it gets it's like the ultimate
timetable enforcer yeah it enforces a

1918
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:06,720
timetable enforcer yeah it enforces a
 

1919
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,149
timetable enforcer yeah it enforces a
lot of timetables

1920
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:08,159
lot of timetables
 

1921
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,110
lot of timetables
uh though it has a huge kids have a huge

1922
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:11,120
uh though it has a huge kids have a huge
 

1923
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,110
uh though it has a huge kids have a huge
productivity hit those he got away

1924
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
productivity hit those he got away
 

1925

2035
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,950
things try to do them really well and
then the know why

2036
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:42,960
then the know why
 

2037
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,470
then the know why
is have a connection to some sort of

2038
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
is have a connection to some sort of
 

2039
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,110
is have a connection to some sort of
value like in general i think

2040
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
value like in general i think
 

2041
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,269
value like in general i think
this is worth doing uh and then seeing

2042
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
this is worth doing uh and then seeing
 

2043
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:50,470
this is worth doing uh and then seeing
where it leads

2044
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:50,480
where it leads
 

2045
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,830
where it leads
and so uh the choice of the few things

2046
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
and so uh the choice of the few things
 

2047
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,870
and so uh the choice of the few things
is grounded in what like a little like a

2048
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:56,880
is grounded in what like a little like a
 

2049

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,389
love for the thing like a sense that you
say you wanted to write

2054

kind of
 

2059
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,830
kind of
introspective moment of thinking this

2060
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:07,840
introspective moment of thinking this
 

2061
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,430
introspective moment of thinking this
actually brings me a lot of joy

2062
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:09,440
actually brings me a lot of joy
 

2063

actually brings me a lot of joy
and fulfillment yeah i mean it gets

2064
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:10,960
and fulfillment yeah i mean it gets
 

2065
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,230
and fulfillment yeah i mean it gets
complicated because i wrote a whole book

2066
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
complicated because i wrote a whole book
 

2067
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,029
complicated because i wrote a whole book
about

2068
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:13,039

2073
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,149
which is like the first thing i kind of
got infamous for

2074
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
got infamous for
 

2075
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,029

i wrote that back in 2012. but but the

2076
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:21,039
i wrote that back in 2012. but but the
 

2077
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,310
i wrote that back in 2012. but but the
argument there is like passion

2078
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320

so what i was pushing back on was the
myth that the passion for what you do

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:54,240
and you sort of like kind of make some
 

2245
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,590
and you sort of like kind of make some
noises like while the other person's

2246
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
noises like while the other person's

2253
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,350
wants to talk next but now it's purely
digital you see a flashing

2254
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:01,360
digital you see a flashing
 

2255
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,509
digital you see a flashing
but in a faculty meeting which is very

2256
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:03,519
but in a faculty meeting which is very
 

2257
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,430
but in a faculty meeting which is very
interesting like even as we're talking

2258
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:05,440
interesting like even as we're talking
 

2259
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,389
interesting like even as we're talking
now

2260
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:06,399
now
 

2261
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,030
now
there's a visual element that seems to

2262
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,040
there's a visual element that seems to
 

2263
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,190
there's a visual element that seems to
increase the probability of interruption

2264
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
increase the probability of interruption
 

2265
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,829
increase the probability of interruption
yeah when it's just darkness you

2266
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:13,839
yeah when it's just darkness you
 

2267
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,629
yeah when it's just darkness you
actually

2268
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
actually
 

2269
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,349
actually
listen better and you don't interrupt so

2270
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
listen better and you don't interrupt so
 

2271
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,109
listen better and you don't interrupt so
like if you create a culture there's

2272
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,119
like if you create a culture there's
 

2273
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,869
like if you create a culture there's
there's always going to be but

2274
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
there's always going to be but
 

2275
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,270
there's always going to be but
they're they're actually exceptions

2276
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280
they're they're actually exceptions
 

2277
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,589
they're they're actually exceptions
everybody adjusts they kind of evolve to

2278
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
everybody adjusts they kind of evolve to
 

2279
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,310
everybody adjusts they kind of evolve to
the

2280
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:26,320
the
 

2281
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,270
the
the beat of the room okay that's one

2282
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:29,280
the beat of the room okay that's one
 

2283
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,030
the beat of the room okay that's one
fascinating aspect like okay

2284
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
fascinating aspect like okay
 

2285
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,349
fascinating aspect like okay
that's weird because it's different than

2286
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
that's weird because it's different than
 

2287
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,430
that's weird because it's different than
like a zoom call where there's video

2288
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:35,440
like a zoom call where there's video
 

2289
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,270
like a zoom call where there's video
yeah uh it's just audio you think video

2290
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:39,280
yeah uh it's just audio you think video

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:42,869
ads
but actually seems like it subtracts the

2294
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
but actually seems like it subtracts the
 

2295
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,109
but actually seems like it subtracts the
second aspect of it that's fascinating

2296
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
second aspect of it that's fascinating
 

2297
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,230
second aspect of it that's fascinating
is when it's no video just audio there's

2298
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:48,240
is when it's no video just audio there's
 

2299

interesting
 

2661
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,349
interesting
the but the final result when you

2662
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:37,359
the but the final result when you
 

2663
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:38,710
the but the final result when you
observe it

2664
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:38,720
observe it
 

2665
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,510
observe it
is uh it's very fulfilling i think it's

2666
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:41,520
is uh it's very fulfilling i think it's
 

2667
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,270
is uh it's very fulfilling i think it's
very beneficial

2668
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
very beneficial
 

2669
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,270
very beneficial
but it's very addicting so you have to

2670
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,280
but it's very addicting so you have to
 

2671
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,630
but it's very addicting so you have to
make sure

2672
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:46,640
make sure
 

2673
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,150
make sure
you moderate yeah that's interesting and

2675
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,230
you moderate yeah that's interesting and
okay well so maybe i'll try it i mean

2676
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
okay well so maybe i'll try it i mean
 

2677
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,270
okay well so maybe i'll try it i mean
look there's no

here's interesting things happening
 

2709
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,870
here's interesting things happening
right you're not jocking in the feed for

2710
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
right you're not jocking in the feed for
 

2711
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,309
right you're not jocking in the feed for
look i'm being clever or something and

2712
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
look i'm being clever or something and
 

2713
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,309
look i'm being clever or something and
i'm going to get a light count that goes

2714
00:41:24,309 --> 00:41:24,319
i'm going to get a light count that goes
 

2715
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,150
i'm going to get a light count that goes
up and that's going to influence and

2716
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:26,160
up and that's going to influence and
 

2717
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,510
up and that's going to influence and
right and there's more friction there's

2718
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,520
right and there's more friction there's
 

2719
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,270
right and there's more friction there's
more cognitive friction i guess involved

00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:28,640
david goggins model of i mean he's
 

3039
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,950
david goggins model of i mean he's
probably more applying it to running but

3040
00:46:30,950 --> 00:46:30,960
probably more applying it to running but
 

3041
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,589
probably more applying it to running but
uh when it feels like your mind can't

3042
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
uh when it feels like your mind can't
 

3043
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,030
uh when it feels like your mind can't
take any more

3044
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:35,040
take any more
 

3045
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:37,990
take any more
that you're just 40 percent uh at your

3046
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:38,000
that you're just 40 percent uh at your
 

3047
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,790
that you're just 40 percent uh at your
capacity

3048
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:38,800
capacity
 

3049
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,950
capacity
i mean it's just like arbitrary levels

3050
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:40,960
i mean it's just like arbitrary levels
 

3051
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,550
i mean it's just like arbitrary levels
the navy seal thing right the navy seal

3052
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:42,560
the navy seal thing right the navy seal
 

3053
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,829
the navy seal thing right the navy seal
thing yeah i mean you could put that at

3054
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
thing yeah i mean you could put that at
 

3055
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,270
thing yeah i mean you could put that at
any percent but it is

3056
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
any percent but it is
 

3057
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,069
any percent but it is
remarkable that if you just take it one

3058
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
remarkable that if you just take it one
 

3059
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,910
remarkable that if you just take it one
step at a time just keep going it's

3060
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:49,920
step at a time just keep going it's
 

3061
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,790
step at a time just keep going it's
it's uh similar to this idea of a

3062
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:52,800
it's uh similar to this idea of a
 

3063
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,630
it's uh similar to this idea of a
process if you just trust the process

3064
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
process if you just trust the process
 

3065
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,990
process if you just trust the process
and you just keep following even

3066
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
and you just keep following even
 

3067
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,670
and you just keep following even
if the passion goes up and down and so

3068
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
if the passion goes up and down and so
 

3069
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,630
if the passion goes up and down and so
on then ultimately

3070
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:00,640
on then ultimately
 

3071
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,190
on then ultimately
if you look in aggregate the passion

3072
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
if you look in aggregate the passion
 

3073
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:03,990
if you look in aggregate the passion
will increase

3074
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:04,000
will increase
 

3075
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,430
will increase
yeah your self-satisfaction will

3076
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
yeah your self-satisfaction will
 

3077
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,430
yeah your self-satisfaction will
increase yeah i think and if you have

3078
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:07,440
increase yeah i think and if you have
 

3079
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,190
increase yeah i think and if you have
two things this has been a big strategy

3080
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:09,200
two things this has been a big strategy
 

3081
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,470
two things this has been a big strategy
of mine so that you can

3082
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:10,480
of mine so that you can
 

3083
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:12,870
of mine so that you can
what you hope for is off phase off phase

3084
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:12,880
what you hope for is off phase off phase
 

3085
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,069
what you hope for is off phase off phase
alignment like that

3086
00:47:14,069 --> 00:47:14,079
alignment like that
 

3087
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:15,510
alignment like that
sometimes it's in phase and that's a

3088
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
sometimes it's in phase and that's a
 

3089
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,670
sometimes it's in phase and that's a
problem uh but off phase alignment's

3090
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:17,680
problem uh but off phase alignment's
 

3091
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:18,870
problem uh but off phase alignment's
good so okay

3092
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
good so okay
 

3093
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,870
good so okay
my research i'm struggling uh but my

3094
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:20,880
my research i'm struggling uh but my
 

3095
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,309
my research i'm struggling uh but my
book stuff is going well

3096
00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:22,319
book stuff is going well
 

3097
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,829
book stuff is going well
right and so when you when you add those

3098
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
right and so when you when you add those
 

3099
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,190
right and so when you when you add those
two waves together like oh we're doing

3100
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
two waves together like oh we're doing
 

3101
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,309
two waves together like oh we're doing
pretty well and then

3102
00:47:26,309 --> 00:47:26,319
pretty well and then
 

3103
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,069
pretty well and then
uh in other periods like on my writing

3104
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:28,079
uh in other periods like on my writing
 

3105
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,109
uh in other periods like on my writing
you know i feel like i'm just not

3106
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:29,119
you know i feel like i'm just not
 

3107
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,630
you know i feel like i'm just not
getting anywhere but i've had some good

3108
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
getting anywhere but i've had some good
 

3109
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,230
getting anywhere but i've had some good
papers i'm feeling good over there

3110
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
papers i'm feeling good over there
 

3111
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,470
papers i'm feeling good over there
so having two things that they can

3112
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
so having two things that they can
 

3113
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,750
so having two things that they can
counteract each other

3114
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
counteract each other
 

3115
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,589
counteract each other
now sometimes they fall into sync and

3116
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:37,599
now sometimes they fall into sync and
 

3117
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:39,109
now sometimes they fall into sync and
then it gets rough then when

3118
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:39,119
then it gets rough then when
 

3119
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,309
then it gets rough then when
you know when everything because

3120
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
you know when everything because
 

3121
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,589
you know when everything because
everything for me is cyclical you know

3122
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
everything for me is cyclical you know
 

3123
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,950
everything for me is cyclical you know
good periods bad periods with all this

3124
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:42,960
good periods bad periods with all this
 

3125
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:43,829
good periods bad periods with all this
stuff so

3126
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:43,839
stuff so
 

3127
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:46,470
stuff so
uh typically they don't coincide so it

3128
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
uh typically they don't coincide so it
 

3129
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,430
uh typically they don't coincide so it
helps compensate

3130
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:47,440
helps compensate
 

3131
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,589
helps compensate
when they do coincide you get really

3132
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:49,599
when they do coincide you get really
 

3133
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:50,870
when they do coincide you get really
high highs like where everything's

3134
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
high highs like where everything's
 

3135
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,990
high highs like where everything's
clicking and then you get these really

3136
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:52,000
clicking and then you get these really
 

3137
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,829
clicking and then you get these really
low lows where like your research is not

3138
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
low lows where like your research is not
 

3139
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,230
low lows where like your research is not
working your program's not clicking

3140
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:56,240
working your program's not clicking
 

3141
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,349
working your program's not clicking
you feel like you're nowhere with your

3142
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
you feel like you're nowhere with your
 

3143
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,829
you feel like you're nowhere with your
writing uh and then it's a little

3144
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
writing uh and then it's a little
 

3145
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,630
writing uh and then it's a little
rougher

3146
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:00,640
rougher
 

3147
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:03,109
rougher
is do you do you think about the concept

3148
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:03,119
is do you do you think about the concept
 

3149
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:03,910
is do you do you think about the concept
of burnout

3150
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
of burnout
 

3151
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,910
of burnout
because i personally never experienced

3152
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:05,920
because i personally never experienced
 

3153
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,270
because i personally never experienced
burnout in the way that

3154
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
burnout in the way that
 

3155
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,309
burnout in the way that
folks talk about which is like it's not

3156
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:10,319
folks talk about which is like it's not
 

3157
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:10,630
folks talk about which is like it's not
just

3158
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
just
 

3159
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,030
just
the up and down it's like you don't want

3160
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040
the up and down it's like you don't want
 

3161
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,710
the up and down it's like you don't want
to do anything ever again

3162
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
to do anything ever again
 

3163
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,870
to do anything ever again
yeah it like it's it's for some people

yeah yeah so i do worry about it
 

3171
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,710
yeah yeah so i do worry about it
so when i used to do student writing

3172
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:24,720
so when i used to do student writing
 

3173
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,150
so when i used to do student writing
like writing about students and student

3174
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
like writing about students and student
 

3175
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,349
like writing about students and student
advice

3176
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
advice
 

3177
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:29,190
advice
it came up a lot with students at elite

3178
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,200
it came up a lot with students at elite
 

3179
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,630
it came up a lot with students at elite
schools and

3180
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
schools and
 

3181
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,230
schools and
i used to call it deep procrastination

3182
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
i used to call it deep procrastination
 

3183
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,990
i used to call it deep procrastination
but it was a real

3184
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
but it was a real
 

3185
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,030
but it was a real
really vivid very replicatable

3186
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:37,040
really vivid very replicatable
 

3187
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,549
really vivid very replicatable
syndrome where they stopped being able

3188
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
syndrome where they stopped being able
 

3189
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:40,309
syndrome where they stopped being able
to do schoolwork yeah like

3190

to do schoolwork yeah like
this is due the professor gives you an

3192
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:42,160
this is due the professor gives you an
 

3193
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,750
this is due the professor gives you an
extension and the professor goes to

3194
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
extension and the professor goes to
 

3195
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,109
extension and the professor goes to
incomplete and says you got you

3196
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
incomplete and says you got you
 

3197
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,309
incomplete and says you got you

3200
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:48,400
to hand this in they can't do it
 

3201
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,630
to hand this in they can't do it
right it's like it's a complete stop on

3202
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
right it's like it's a complete stop on
 

3203
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:52,230
right it's like it's a complete stop on
the ability to actually do work

3204
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:52,240
the ability to actually do work
 

3205
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,589
the ability to actually do work
so i used to counsel students who had

3206
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
so i used to counsel students who had
 

3207
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,030
so i used to counsel students who had
that issue and often it was a

3208
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
that issue and often it was a
 

3209
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:56,309
that issue and often it was a
combination of

3210
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
combination of
 

3211
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,190
combination of
this is my best analysis is you have

3212
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
this is my best analysis is you have
 

3213
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,630
this is my best analysis is you have
just the the physical and cognitive

3214
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:00,640
just the the physical and cognitive
 

3215
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:01,589
just the the physical and cognitive
difficulties of

3216
00:49:01,589 --> 00:49:01,599
difficulties of
 

3217
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,270
difficulties of
they're usually under a very hard load

3218
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:03,280
they're usually under a very hard load
 

3219
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,470
they're usually under a very hard load
right they're doing too many majors

3220
00:49:04,470 --> 00:49:04,480
right they're doing too many majors
 

3221
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,910
right they're doing too many majors
doing extracurriculars just you know

3222
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:05,920
doing extracurriculars just you know
 

3223
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,349
doing extracurriculars just you know
really pushing themselves

3224
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:07,359
really pushing themselves
 

3225
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:10,150
really pushing themselves
and the motivation is not sufficiently

3226
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
and the motivation is not sufficiently
 

3227
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,349
and the motivation is not sufficiently
intrinsic

3228
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
intrinsic
 

3229
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,950
intrinsic
right so if you have a motivational

3230
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:12,960
right so if you have a motivational
 

3231
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,390
right so if you have a motivational
center that's not completely on board so

3232
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:14,400
center that's not completely on board so
 

3233
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,510
center that's not completely on board so
a lot of these kids like when i'm

3234
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:15,520
a lot of these kids like when i'm
 

3235
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,630
a lot of these kids like when i'm
dealing with mit kids

3236
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:16,640
dealing with mit kids
 

3237
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,630
dealing with mit kids
they would be you know their whole town

3238
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:18,640
they would be you know their whole town
 

3239
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,470
they would be you know their whole town
was shooting off fireworks that they got

3240
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:20,480
was shooting off fireworks that they got
 

3241
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:21,829
was shooting off fireworks that they got
in there everyone's hoped that they were

3242
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:21,839
in there everyone's hoped that they were
 

3243
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:22,790
in there everyone's hoped that they were
going there

3244
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
going there
 

3245
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,549
going there
uh and that they're in three majors they

3246
00:49:24,549 --> 00:49:24,559
uh and that they're in three majors they
 

3247
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:25,510
uh and that they're in three majors they
don't want to let people down but

3248
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:25,520
don't want to let people down but
 

3249
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:26,790
don't want to let people down but
they're not really interested in being a

3250
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:26,800
they're not really interested in being a
 

3251
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,990
they're not really interested in being a
doctor or whatever

3252
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
doctor or whatever
 

3253
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,589
doctor or whatever
so your motivation's not in the right

3254
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:29,599
so your motivation's not in the right
 

3255
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,109
so your motivation's not in the right
place the motivational psychologist

3256
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
place the motivational psychologist
 

3257
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,710
place the motivational psychologist
would say the locus of control was more

3258
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
would say the locus of control was more
 

3259
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,309
would say the locus of control was more
towards the extrinsic end of

3260
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:34,319
towards the extrinsic end of
 

3261
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,630
towards the extrinsic end of
the spectrum and you have hardship and

3262
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
the spectrum and you have hardship and
 

3263
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,750
the spectrum and you have hardship and
you could just fritz out the whole

3264
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:37,760
you could just fritz out the whole
 

3265
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,630
you could just fritz out the whole
system

3266
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
system
 

3267
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,069
system
and so i would always be very worried

3268
00:49:40,069 --> 00:49:40,079
and so i would always be very worried
 

3269
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:41,670
and so i would always be very worried
about that so i think about that a lot

3270
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
about that so i think about that a lot
 

3271
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,069
about that so i think about that a lot
i do a lot of multi-phase or multi-scale

3272
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
i do a lot of multi-phase or multi-scale
 

3273
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,270
i do a lot of multi-phase or multi-scale
seasonality

3274
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
seasonality
 

3275
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,990
seasonality
so i'll go hard on something for a while

3276
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
so i'll go hard on something for a while
 

3277
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,069
so i'll go hard on something for a while
and then for a few weeks go easy

3278
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
and then for a few weeks go easy
 

3279
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,829
and then for a few weeks go easy
i'll have semesters that are hard and

3280
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
i'll have semesters that are hard and
 

3281
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,270
i'll have semesters that are hard and
semesters that are easier i'll take the

3282
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,280
semesters that are easier i'll take the
 

3283
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,030
semesters that are easier i'll take the
summer really low so on multiple scales

3284
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,040
summer really low so on multiple scales
 

3285
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,150
summer really low so on multiple scales
and in the day i'll go really hard on

3286
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
and in the day i'll go really hard on
 

3287
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,430
and in the day i'll go really hard on
something but then have a hard cut off

3288
00:49:57,430 --> 00:49:57,440
something but then have a hard cut off
 

3289
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,349
something but then have a hard cut off
at five so like every scale

3290
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
at five so like every scale
 

3291
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:01,829
at five so like every scale
it's all about rest and recovery because

00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:01,839
it's all about rest and recovery because
 

3293
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,109

i really want to avoid that and i do

3294
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:03,119
i really want to avoid that and i do
 

3295
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:04,790
i really want to avoid that and i do

pretty recently i get minor burnt outs i
 

3299
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,150
pretty recently i get minor burnt outs i
got a paper

3300
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:08,160

far

3318
00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:21,839
far
 

3319
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:23,349
far
yeah and so i kind of pulled it back now

3320
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:23,359
yeah and so i kind of pulled it back now
 

3321
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,549
yeah and so i kind of pulled it back now
i'm doing this book launch then after

3322
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:24,559
i'm doing this book launch then after
 

3323
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:25,829
i'm doing this book launch then after
this book launch i'm pulling it back

3324

this book launch i'm pulling it back
 

3325
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:26,470
this book launch i'm pulling it back
again

3326
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:26,480
again
 

3327
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,470
again
so i like i seasonality for rest and

3328
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480
so i like i seasonality for rest and
 

3329
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:29,910
so i like i seasonality for rest and
recovery i think it's crucial

3330
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
recovery i think it's crucial
 

3331
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,190
recovery i think it's crucial
and at every scale daily monthly

3332
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
and at every scale daily monthly
 

3333
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,950
and at every scale daily monthly
you know and then at the annual scale an

3334
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
you know and then at the annual scale an
 

3335
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,390
you know and then at the annual scale an
easy summer for example i think it's

3336
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
easy summer for example i think it's
 

3337
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,510
easy summer for example i think it's
like a great idea

3338
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
like a great idea
 

3339
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,549
like a great idea
if that's possible okay you just made me

3340
00:50:40,549 --> 00:50:40,559
if that's possible okay you just made me
 

3341
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:41,510
if that's possible okay you just made me
realize that

3342
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:41,520
realize that
 

3343
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,829
realize that
that's exactly what i do because i i

3344
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:43,839
that's exactly what i do because i i
 

3345
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,349
that's exactly what i do because i i
feel like i'm not even close to burning

3346
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
feel like i'm not even close to burning
 

3347
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:45,670
feel like i'm not even close to burning
out

3348
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
out
 

3349
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,510
out
anything even though i i'm in chaos yeah

3350
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,520
anything even though i i'm in chaos yeah
 

3351
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,510
anything even though i i'm in chaos yeah
i feel the right exact ways of

3352
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:51,520
i feel the right exact ways of
 

3353
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,589
i feel the right exact ways of
seasonality is the

3354
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
seasonality is the
 

3355
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,470
seasonality is the
not not even the seasonality but like

regular schedule or your mind is going
 

3521
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,870
regular schedule or your mind is going
to form a pavlovian connection

3522
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
to form a pavlovian connection
 

3523
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,270
to form a pavlovian connection
between as soon as i feel boredom i get

3524
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:27,280
between as soon as i feel boredom i get
 

3525
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,309
between as soon as i feel boredom i get
stimuli

3526
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
stimuli
 

3527
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,510
stimuli
and once it forms that connection it's

3528
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:29,520
and once it forms that connection it's
 

3529
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,790
and once it forms that connection it's
never going to tolerate deep work so

3530
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:30,800
never going to tolerate deep work so
 

3531
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:31,589
never going to tolerate deep work so
there's this very

3532
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
there's this very
 

3533
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,870
there's this very
pragmatic treatment of boredom of your

3534
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
pragmatic treatment of boredom of your
 

3535
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,549
pragmatic treatment of boredom of your
mind better be used to the idea that

3536
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
mind better be used to the idea that
 

3537
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,910
mind better be used to the idea that
sometimes you don't get stimuli because

3538
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
sometimes you don't get stimuli because
 

3539
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,109
sometimes you don't get stimuli because
otherwise you can't write for three

3540
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:39,119
otherwise you can't write for three
 

3541

otherwise you can't write for three
hours

hours
 

3543
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,589
hours
like it's just not going to tolerate it

3544
00:53:41,589 --> 00:53:41,599
like it's just not going to tolerate it
 

3545

but more more recently what i'm really
 

3547
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,470
but more more recently what i'm really
interested in boredom is it as a

3548
00:53:44,470 --> 00:53:44,480
interested in boredom is it as a
 

3549
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,710
interested in boredom is it as a
fundamental human drive

3550
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
fundamental human drive
 

3551
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,069
fundamental human drive
right because it's incredibly

3552
00:53:48,069 --> 00:53:48,079
right because it's incredibly
 

3553
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:50,390
right because it's incredibly
uncomfortable and think about the other

3554
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
uncomfortable and think about the other
 

3555
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,829
uncomfortable and think about the other
things that are incredibly uncomfortable

3556
00:53:51,829 --> 00:53:51,839
things that are incredibly uncomfortable
 

3557
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,109
things that are incredibly uncomfortable
like hunger or thirst

3558
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
like hunger or thirst
 

3559
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,589
like hunger or thirst
they serve a really important purpose

3560
00:53:55,589 --> 00:53:55,599
they serve a really important purpose
 

3561
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,430
they serve a really important purpose
for a species right like if something is

3562
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:57,440
for a species right like if something is
 

3563
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,950
for a species right like if something is
really distressing there's a reason pain

3564
00:53:58,950 --> 00:53:58,960
really distressing there's a reason pain
 

3565
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,390
really distressing there's a reason pain
is really uncomfortable because we need

3566
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:00,400
is really uncomfortable because we need
 

3567
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:00,790
is really uncomfortable because we need
to

to
 

3569
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,790
to
worry about getting injured thirst is

3570
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:02,800
worry about getting injured thirst is
 

3571

worry about getting injured thirst is
really uncomfortable because we need

3572
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:04,000
really uncomfortable because we need
 

3573
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,349
really uncomfortable because we need
water to survive

3574
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:05,359
water to survive
 

3575
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,510
water to survive
so what's boredom why is that

3576
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
so what's boredom why is that
 

3577

so what's boredom why is that
uncomfortable

uncomfortable
 

3579
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,790
uncomfortable
and and i've been interested in this

3580
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
and and i've been interested in this
 

3581
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,990
and and i've been interested in this
notion that

3582
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:12,000
notion that
 

3583
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,430
notion that
boredom is about driving us towards

3584
00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:15,440
boredom is about driving us towards
 

3585
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,309
boredom is about driving us towards
productive action like as a species i

3586
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:18,319
productive action like as a species i
 

3587
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,670
productive action like as a species i
mean think about it like what

3588
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
mean think about it like what
 

3589
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,589
mean think about it like what
what got us to actually take advantage

3590
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
what got us to actually take advantage
 

3591
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,510
what got us to actually take advantage
of these brains what got us to actually

3592
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:23,520
of these brains what got us to actually
 

3593
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,270
of these brains what got us to actually
work with fire what got us to start

3594
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
work with fire what got us to start
 

3595
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,589
work with fire what got us to start
shaping stones and the hand axes and

3596
00:54:27,589 --> 00:54:27,599
shaping stones and the hand axes and
 

3597
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,790
shaping stones and the hand axes and
figuring out if we could actually

3598
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
figuring out if we could actually
 

3599
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:29,589
figuring out if we could actually
sharpen a stick

3600
00:54:29,589 --> 00:54:29,599
sharpen a stick
 

3601
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,430
sharpen a stick
sharp enough that we could throw it as a

3602
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:31,440
sharp enough that we could throw it as a
 

3603
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,510
sharp enough that we could throw it as a
melee weapon or a distance weapon for

3604
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
melee weapon or a distance weapon for
 

3605
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,109
melee weapon or a distance weapon for
hunting mammoth right

3606
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
hunting mammoth right
 

3607
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,150
hunting mammoth right
boredom drives us towards action so now

3608
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:38,160
boredom drives us towards action so now
 

3609
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,589
boredom drives us towards action so now
i'm fascinated by this fundamental

3610
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
i'm fascinated by this fundamental
 

3611
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:41,030
i'm fascinated by this fundamental
action instinct

3612
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:41,040
action instinct
 

3613
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,549
action instinct
uh because i have this theory that i'm

3614
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:42,559
uh because i have this theory that i'm
 

3615
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,390
uh because i have this theory that i'm
working on that

3616
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:44,400
working on that
 

3617
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,150
working on that
we're out of sync with it just like we

3618
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:46,160
we're out of sync with it just like we
 

3619
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,829
we're out of sync with it just like we
got we have this drive for hunger but

3620
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:47,839
got we have this drive for hunger but
 

3621
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:49,270
got we have this drive for hunger but
then we introduced junk food and got out

3622
00:54:49,270 --> 00:54:49,280
then we introduced junk food and got out
 

3623
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,710
then we introduced junk food and got out
of sync with hunger and it makes us

3624
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:50,720
of sync with hunger and it makes us
 

3625
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,549
of sync with hunger and it makes us
really unhealthy we have this drive

3626
00:54:52,549 --> 00:54:52,559
really unhealthy we have this drive
 

3627
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,549
really unhealthy we have this drive
towards action but then we we overload

3628
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
towards action but then we we overload
 

3629
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,990
towards action but then we we overload
ourselves and we have all of these

3630
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
ourselves and we have all of these
 

3631
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,910
ourselves and we have all of these
distractions and then that causes

3632
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
distractions and then that causes
 

3633
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,789
distractions and then that causes
uh it's like a cognitive action obesity

3634
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:00,799
uh it's like a cognitive action obesity
 

3635
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:02,230
uh it's like a cognitive action obesity
type thing because it short-circuits

3636
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
type thing because it short-circuits
 

3637
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:03,589
type thing because it short-circuits
this system that wants us to do things

3638
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
this system that wants us to do things
 

3639
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,710
this system that wants us to do things
but we put more things in our plate than

3640
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:04,720
but we put more things in our plate than
 

3641
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,069
but we put more things in our plate than
we can possibly do and then we're really

3642
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
we can possibly do and then we're really
 

3643
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:07,430
we can possibly do and then we're really
frustrated we can't do them

3644
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:07,440
frustrated we can't do them
 

3645
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,710
frustrated we can't do them
and we're short-circuiting all of our

3646
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
and we're short-circuiting all of our
 

3647
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,069
and we're short-circuiting all of our
wires so it all comes back to this

3648
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
wires so it all comes back to this
 

3649
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,349
wires so it all comes back to this
question

3650
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:11,359
question
 

3651
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:15,750
question
well what would be the ideal the ideal

3652
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
well what would be the ideal the ideal
 

3653
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,270
well what would be the ideal the ideal
sort of amount of stuff to do and type

3654
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,280
sort of amount of stuff to do and type
 

3655
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,789
sort of amount of stuff to do and type
of things to do like if we wanted to

3656
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
of things to do like if we wanted to
 

3657
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:20,549
of things to do like if we wanted to
look back at our ancestral environment

3658
00:55:20,549 --> 00:55:20,559
look back at our ancestral environment
 

3659
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,630
look back at our ancestral environment
and say if i could just build from

3660
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
and say if i could just build from
 

3661
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,829
and say if i could just build from
scratch

3662
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
scratch
 

3663
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,349
scratch
what type how much work i do and what i

3664
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
what type how much work i do and what i
 

3665
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,670
what type how much work i do and what i
work on to be as in touch with that as

3666
00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:27,680
work on to be as in touch with that as
 

3667
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:28,789
work on to be as in touch with that as
like paleo people are trying to get

3668
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:28,799
like paleo people are trying to get
 

3669
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,150
like paleo people are trying to get
their diets in touch with that and so

3670
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,160
their diets in touch with that and so
 

3671
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,030
their diets in touch with that and so
now i'm just

3672
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
now i'm just
 

3673
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,150
now i'm just
let's see this is i'm just it's

3674
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
let's see this is i'm just it's
 

3675
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,109
let's see this is i'm just it's
something i made up yeah but now i'm

3676
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,119
something i made up yeah but now i'm
 

3677
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,870
something i made up yeah but now i'm
going deep on it and one of my podcast

3678
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:36,880
going deep on it and one of my podcast
 

3679
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,230
going deep on it and one of my podcast
listeners i was talking about on the

3680
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
listeners i was talking about on the
 

3681
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:38,789
listeners i was talking about on the
show and

3682
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:38,799
show and
 

3683
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,230
show and
i was like well i kept trying to learn

3684
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
i was like well i kept trying to learn
 

3685
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,829
i was like well i kept trying to learn
about animals and boredom and she sent

3686
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:41,839
about animals and boredom and she sent
 

3687
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,109
about animals and boredom and she sent
me this cool article from

3688
00:55:43,109 --> 00:55:43,119
me this cool article from
 

3689
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,789
me this cool article from
an animal behaviorist journal about what

3690
00:55:44,789 --> 00:55:44,799
an animal behaviorist journal about what
 

3691
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,870
an animal behaviorist journal about what
we know about human boredom versus

3692
00:55:46,870 --> 00:55:46,880
we know about human boredom versus
 

3693
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,710
we know about human boredom versus
animal boredom so trying to figure out

3694
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
animal boredom so trying to figure out
 

3695
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,910
animal boredom so trying to figure out
that puzzle

3696
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:49,920
that puzzle
 

3697
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,630
that puzzle
is uh the wave that's high so i can get

3698
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
is uh the wave that's high so i can get
 

3699
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,069
is uh the wave that's high so i can get
through the wave that's low of like i

3700
00:55:54,069 --> 00:55:54,079
through the wave that's low of like i
 

3701
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:55,270
through the wave that's low of like i
don't know about this pandemic book

3702
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:55,280
don't know about this pandemic book
 

3703
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,030
don't know about this pandemic book
launch and yeah

3704
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,040
launch and yeah
 

3705
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,190
launch and yeah
and my research my research is stumbling

3706
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
and my research my research is stumbling
 

3707
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,789
and my research my research is stumbling
a little bit because of the pandemic and

3708
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
a little bit because of the pandemic and
 

3709
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,589
a little bit because of the pandemic and
so i needed a nice you know high so

3710
00:56:03,589 --> 00:56:03,599
so i needed a nice you know high so
 

3711
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,190
so i needed a nice you know high so
there we go there's a case study

3712
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:05,200
there we go there's a case study
 

3713
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,990
there we go there's a case study
well the is both a case study and a very

3714
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
well the is both a case study and a very
 

3715
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,430
well the is both a case study and a very
interesting set of concepts because i

3716
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:09,440
interesting set of concepts because i
 

3717
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,789
interesting set of concepts because i
didn't even realize that

3718
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:10,799
didn't even realize that
 

3719
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,069
didn't even realize that
it's so simple i'm one of the people

3720
00:56:14,069 --> 00:56:14,079
it's so simple i'm one of the people
 

3721
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,230
it's so simple i'm one of the people
that uh

3722
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
that uh
 

3723
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,309
that uh
has a interesting push and pull dynamic

3724
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
has a interesting push and pull dynamic
 

3725
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:19,910
has a interesting push and pull dynamic
with hunger trying to understand the

3726
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
with hunger trying to understand the
 

3727
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,630
with hunger trying to understand the
hunger with myself like i probably have

3728
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:22,640
hunger with myself like i probably have
 

3729
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,470
hunger with myself like i probably have
an unhealthy relationship with food

3730
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:24,480
an unhealthy relationship with food
 

3731
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,630
an unhealthy relationship with food
i don't know but there's probably

3732
00:56:26,630 --> 00:56:26,640
i don't know but there's probably
 

3733
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,230
i don't know but there's probably
probably a perfect

3734
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:28,240
probably a perfect
 

3735
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,270
probably a perfect
that's a nice way to think about diet as

3736
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
that's a nice way to think about diet as
 

3737
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:35,109
that's a nice way to think about diet as
action there's probably an optimal risk

3738
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:35,119
action there's probably an optimal risk
 

3739
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:38,630
action there's probably an optimal risk
diet response to the the experience that

3740
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
diet response to the the experience that
 

3741
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,430
diet response to the the experience that
our body's

3742
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
our body's
 

3743
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,510
our body's
telling us the signal that a body's

3744
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:41,520
telling us the signal that a body's
 

3745
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,109
telling us the signal that a body's
sending which is hunger

3746
00:56:43,109 --> 00:56:43,119
sending which is hunger
 

3747
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,589
sending which is hunger
and in that same way boredom is sending

3748
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599
and in that same way boredom is sending
 

3749
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:46,710
and in that same way boredom is sending
a signal

3750
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
a signal
 

3751
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,870
a signal
and most of our intellectual activities

3752
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:48,880
and most of our intellectual activities
 

3753
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,829
and most of our intellectual activities
in this world

3754
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
in this world
 

3755
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,549
in this world
our creative activities are essentially

3756
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
our creative activities are essentially
 

3757
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,309
our creative activities are essentially
a response

3758
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:54,319
a response
 

3759
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,670
a response
uh to that signal yeah and think about

3760
00:56:57,670 --> 00:56:57,680
uh to that signal yeah and think about
 

3761
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,150
uh to that signal yeah and think about
this

3762
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:58,160
this
 

3763
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,390
this
analogy that we have this hunger

3764
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
analogy that we have this hunger
 

3765
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,510
analogy that we have this hunger
instinct that

3766
00:57:01,510 --> 00:57:01,520
instinct that
 

3767
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,910
instinct that
junk food short circuits yes right it's

3768
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
junk food short circuits yes right it's
 

3769
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,549
junk food short circuits yes right it's
like oh

3770
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
like oh
 

3771
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,710
like oh
we'll satisfy that hyper palatably and

3772
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
we'll satisfy that hyper palatably and
 

3773
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,150
we'll satisfy that hyper palatably and
it doesn't end up well

3774
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
it doesn't end up well
 

3775
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,549
it doesn't end up well
now think about modern attention

3776
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:10,559
now think about modern attention

alternative is that going to lead to a
 

3789
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,109
alternative is that going to lead to a
similar problem so i've been fasting a

3790
00:57:23,109 --> 00:57:23,119
similar problem so i've been fasting a
 

3791
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,549
similar problem so i've been fasting a
lot lately like

3792
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:24,559
lot lately like
 

3793
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:27,750
lot lately like
i'm doing um eating once a day i've been

i'm doing um eating once a day i've been
 

3795
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,510
i'm doing um eating once a day i've been
doing that for over a month

3796
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:29,520

meat
 

3801
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,150
meat
but it's very fasting has been

3802
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160
but it's very fasting has been
 

3803
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,270
but it's very fasting has been
incredible

3804
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:37,280
incredible
 

3805
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,150
incredible
for me for focus for well-being for a

3806
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:40,160
for me for focus for well-being for a
 

3807
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:40,710
for me for focus for well-being for a
few

3808
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:40,720
few
 

3809
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:42,150
few
i don't i don't know just for feeling

3810
00:57:42,150 --> 00:57:42,160
i don't i don't know just for feeling
 

3811
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,069
i don't i don't know just for feeling
good okay we'll put on a chart what

3812
00:57:44,069 --> 00:57:44,079
good okay we'll put on a chart what
 

3813
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:45,589
good okay we'll put on a chart what
makes me feel good

3814
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
makes me feel good
 

3815
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:49,270
makes me feel good
and uh that fasting and eating primarily

3816
00:57:49,270 --> 00:57:49,280
and uh that fasting and eating primarily
 

3817
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,430
and uh that fasting and eating primarily
meat-based diet makes me feel really

3818
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:51,440
meat-based diet makes me feel really
 

3819
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,309
meat-based diet makes me feel really
good

3820
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
good
 

3821
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,589
good
and so but that ultimately

3822
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
and so but that ultimately
 

3823
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,630
and so but that ultimately
what fasting did i haven't fasted super

3824
00:57:58,630 --> 00:57:58,640
what fasting did i haven't fasted super
 

3825
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,750
what fasting did i haven't fasted super
long yet like a seven

3826
00:57:59,750 --> 00:57:59,760
long yet like a seven
 

3827
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,069
long yet like a seven
day diet which i really like to do but

3828
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:02,079
day diet which i really like to do but
 

3829
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,190
day diet which i really like to do but
even just fasting for a day for 24 hours

3830
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:05,200
even just fasting for a day for 24 hours
 

3831
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,390
even just fasting for a day for 24 hours
gets you in touch with your with this

3832
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
gets you in touch with your with this
 

3833
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,829
gets you in touch with your with this
signal

3834
00:58:09,829 --> 00:58:09,839
signal
 

3835
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:11,750
signal
it's fascinating like you get to listen

3836
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:11,760
it's fascinating like you get to listen
 

3837
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,990
it's fascinating like you get to listen
to your you learn to listen to your body

3838
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:14,000

of green beans on the side
 

4007
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,109
of green beans on the side
and i had 1700 people go through this

4008
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
and i had 1700 people go through this
 

4009
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,190
and i had 1700 people go through this
experiment like spend 30 days doing this

4010
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:03,200
experiment like spend 30 days doing this
 

4011
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,630
experiment like spend 30 days doing this
and it's hard at first but then they get

4012
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:04,640
and it's hard at first but then they get
 

4013
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,030
and it's hard at first but then they get
used to listening to themselves and sort

4014

used to listening to themselves and sort
 

4015

pushing me towards
 

4019
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:11,190
pushing me towards
and it was pushing people towards

4020
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:11,200
and it was pushing people towards
 

4021
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,270
and it was pushing people towards
connection was pushing people towards

4022
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:13,280
connection was pushing people towards
 

4023
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,349

01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:17,119
it was pushing people towards
 

4027
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,430
it was pushing people towards
high quality leisure activities like i

4028
01:01:19,430 --> 01:01:19,440
high quality leisure activities like i
 

4029
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:20,150
high quality leisure activities like i
want to go

4030
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:20,160
want to go
 

4031
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,829
want to go
do something that's complicated and it

4032
01:01:21,829 --> 01:01:21,839
do something that's complicated and it
 

4033
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:23,349
do something that's complicated and it
took weeks sometimes for them to get in

4034
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:23,359
took weeks sometimes for them to get in
 

4035
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:24,870
took weeks sometimes for them to get in
touch with their boredom

4036
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:24,880
touch with their boredom
 

4037
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,670
touch with their boredom
but then it completely rewired how they

4038
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:27,680
but then it completely rewired how they
 

4039
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,549
but then it completely rewired how they
thought about

4040
01:01:28,549 --> 01:01:28,559
thought about
 

4041
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,750
thought about
what do i want to do with my time

4042
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:29,760
what do i want to do with my time
 

4043
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,190
what do i want to do with my time
outside of work and then the idea is

4044
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
outside of work and then the idea is
 

4045
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,150
outside of work and then the idea is
when you were done with that then it was

4046
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
when you were done with that then it was
 

4047
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,190
when you were done with that then it was
much easier to go back

4048
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,200
much easier to go back
 

4049
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:34,789
much easier to go back
and completely change your digital life

4050
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
and completely change your digital life
 

4051
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,190
and completely change your digital life
because you have alternatives right

4052
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,200
because you have alternatives right
 

4053
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,549
because you have alternatives right
you're not just trying to abstain from

4054
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:38,559
you're not just trying to abstain from
 

4055
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,670
you're not just trying to abstain from
things you don't like

4056
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:39,680
things you don't like
 

4057
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,510
things you don't like
but that's basically listening to

4058
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
but that's basically listening to
 

4059
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,190
but that's basically listening to
boredom experiment like just

4060
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
boredom experiment like just
 

4061
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,589
boredom experiment like just
be there with the boredom and see where

4062
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
be there with the boredom and see where
 

4063
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,510
be there with the boredom and see where
it drives you when you don't have

4064
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:47,520
it drives you when you don't have
 

4065
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:48,950
it drives you when you don't have
you know the digital cheez-its okay so

4066
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
you know the digital cheez-its okay so
 

4067
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,870
you know the digital cheez-its okay so
if i can't do that

4068
01:01:50,870 --> 01:01:50,880
if i can't do that
 

4069
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,069
if i can't do that
where is it going to drive me well i

4070
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:52,079
where is it going to drive me well i
 

4071
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:52,870
where is it going to drive me well i
guess i kind of want to go to the

4072
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
guess i kind of want to go to the
 

4073
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,950
guess i kind of want to go to the
library which came up a lot by the way a

4074
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
library which came up a lot by the way a
 

4075
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,870
library which came up a lot by the way a
lot of people rediscovered the library

4076
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:56,880
lot of people rediscovered the library
 

4077
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,549
lot of people rediscovered the library
you know physical books physical books

4078
01:01:58,549 --> 01:01:58,559
you know physical books physical books
 

4079
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:00,309
you know physical books physical books
like you can just go borrow them

4080
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
like you can just go borrow them
 

4081
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,069
like you can just go borrow them
and like it there's like low pressure

4082
01:02:02,069 --> 01:02:02,079
and like it there's like low pressure
 

4083
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:03,510
and like it there's like low pressure
and you can explore and you bring them

4084

and you can explore and you bring them
 

4085
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,309
and you can explore and you bring them
home and then you

4086
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:04,319
home and then you
 

4087
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:05,589
home and then you
read them and you can like sit by the

4088
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
read them and you can like sit by the
 

4089
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:06,789
read them and you can like sit by the
window and read them and it's nice

4091
01:02:06,799 --> 01:02:08,390
window and read them and it's nice
weather outside and i used to do that 20

4092
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
weather outside and i used to do that 20
 

4093
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,430
weather outside and i used to do that 20
years ago

4094
01:02:09,430 --> 01:02:09,440
years ago
 

4095
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:11,510
years ago
they're listening to boredom so can you

4096
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
they're listening to boredom so can you
 

4097
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:12,870
they're listening to boredom so can you
maybe elaborate a little bit

4098
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
maybe elaborate a little bit
 

4099
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,029
maybe elaborate a little bit
on the different experiences that people

4100
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:15,039
on the different experiences that people
 

4101
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,150
on the different experiences that people
had when they quit

4102
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,160
had when they quit
 

4103
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,230
had when they quit
social media for 30 days like is that if

4104
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
social media for 30 days like is that if
 

4105
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,630
social media for 30 days like is that if
you were to recommend that process

4106
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:20,640
you were to recommend that process
 

4107
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,910
you were to recommend that process
what is ultimately the goal yeah digital

4108
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
what is ultimately the goal yeah digital
 

4109
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:26,150
what is ultimately the goal yeah digital
minimalism that's that's my philosophy

4110
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
minimalism that's that's my philosophy
 

4111
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,549
minimalism that's that's my philosophy
for all this tech and it's working

4112
01:02:28,549 --> 01:02:28,559
for all this tech and it's working
 

4113
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:30,549
for all this tech and it's working
backwards from what's important

4114
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
backwards from what's important
 

4115
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,230
backwards from what's important
so it's you figure out what you're

4116
01:02:32,230 --> 01:02:32,240
so it's you figure out what you're
 

4117
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,589
so it's you figure out what you're
actually all about like what you want to

4118
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:33,599
actually all about like what you want to
 

4119
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:34,870
actually all about like what you want to
do what you want to spend your time

4120
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
do what you want to spend your time
 

4121
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,670
do what you want to spend your time
doing

4122
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:35,680
doing
 

4123
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,829
doing
and then you can ask okay is there a

4124
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
and then you can ask okay is there a
 

4125
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,430
and then you can ask okay is there a
place that tech can amplify or support

4126
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:39,440
place that tech can amplify or support
 

4127
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,470
place that tech can amplify or support
some of these things and that's how you

4128
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
some of these things and that's how you
 

4129
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,710
some of these things and that's how you
decide what tech to use

4130
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
decide what tech to use
 

4131
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,190
decide what tech to use
and so the the process is let's actually

4132
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:45,200
and so the the process is let's actually
 

4133
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,950
and so the the process is let's actually
get away from everything let's be bored

4134
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:46,960
get away from everything let's be bored
 

4135
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:48,309
get away from everything let's be bored
for a while let's let's really spend a

4136
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
for a while let's let's really spend a
 

4137
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,589
for a while let's let's really spend a
month getting really figuring out what

4138
01:02:49,589 --> 01:02:49,599
month getting really figuring out what
 

4139
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,789
month getting really figuring out what
do i actually want to do

4140
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:50,799
do i actually want to do
 

4141
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:51,990
do i actually want to do
what do i want to spend my time doing

4142
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
what do i want to spend my time doing
 

4143
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,750
what do i want to spend my time doing
what's important to me you know what

4144
01:02:53,750 --> 01:02:53,760
what's important to me you know what
 

4145
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,870
what's important to me you know what
makes me feel good and then when you're

4146
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:54,880
makes me feel good and then when you're
 

4147
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:56,390
makes me feel good and then when you're
done you can bring back in tech very

4148
01:02:56,390 --> 01:02:56,400
done you can bring back in tech very
 

4149
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,470
done you can bring back in tech very
strategically to help those things right

4150
01:02:58,470 --> 01:02:58,480
strategically to help those things right
 

4151
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,549
strategically to help those things right
and that was the goal that turns out to

4152
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:00,559
and that was the goal that turns out to
 

4153
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:01,990
and that was the goal that turns out to
be much more successful than when

4154

they were much more successful than the
people that just said i'm sick of using

4312
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:10,640
people that just said i'm sick of using

01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
so i'm just gonna white knuckle it just
 

4317
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,870
so i'm just gonna white knuckle it just
30 days will be good for me i just gotta

4318
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
30 days will be good for me i just gotta
 

4319

30 days will be good for me i just gotta
just gotta get away from it or something

4320
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,400
just gotta get away from it or something
 

4321
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,710
just gotta get away from it or something
it doesn't last so you don't use social

4322
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
it doesn't last so you don't use social
 

4323
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:19,670
it doesn't last so you don't use social
media currently

4324
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
media currently
 

4325
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,069
media currently
yeah of do you find that a lot of people

4326
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
yeah of do you find that a lot of people
 

4327
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,309
yeah of do you find that a lot of people
go into this process

4328
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:24,319
go into this process
 

4329
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:28,230
go into this process
will uh will seek to basically arrive at

4330
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:28,240
will uh will seek to basically arrive at
 

4331
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,270
will uh will seek to basically arrive at
a similar place

4332
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:29,280
a similar place
 

4333
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,950
a similar place
to not use social media primarily about

4334
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
to not use social media primarily about
 

4335
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,670
to not use social media primarily about
half right so so about half when they

4336
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
half right so so about half when they
 

4337
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:34,870
half right so so about half when they
went through this exercise and these

4338
01:05:34,870 --> 01:05:34,880
went through this exercise and these
 

4339
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:35,670
went through this exercise and these
aren't

4340
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:35,680
aren't
 

4341
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,670
aren't
quantified numbers you know this is just

4342
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:37,680
quantified numbers you know this is just
 

4343
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:39,349
quantified numbers you know this is just
they sent me reports and

4344
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
they sent me reports and
 

4345
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,990
they sent me reports and
yeah that's pretty good though so 1700

4346
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:42,000
yeah that's pretty good though so 1700
 

4347
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:42,470
yeah that's pretty good though so 1700
yeah

4348
01:05:42,470 --> 01:05:42,480
yeah
 

4349
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,910
yeah
yeah so so roughly half probably got rid

4350
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:45,920
yeah so so roughly half probably got rid
 

4351
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,510
yeah so so roughly half probably got rid
of social media altogether once they did

4352
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
of social media altogether once they did
 

4353
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,870
of social media altogether once they did
this exercise they realized these things

4354
01:05:48,870 --> 01:05:48,880
this exercise they realized these things
 

4355
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:51,029
this exercise they realized these things
i care about i don't

4356
01:05:51,029 --> 01:05:51,039
i care about i don't
 

4357
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,150
i care about i don't
social media is not the tools that's

4358
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
social media is not the tools that's
 

4359
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,309
social media is not the tools that's
really helping the other half

4360
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:54,319
really helping the other half
 

4361
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:55,990
really helping the other half
kept some there are some things in their

4362
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,000
kept some there are some things in their
 

4363
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,750
kept some there are some things in their
life where some social media was

4364
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
life where some social media was
 

4365
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,990
life where some social media was
useful but the key thing is if they knew

4366
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:00,000
useful but the key thing is if they knew
 

4367
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,309
useful but the key thing is if they knew
why they were deploying social media

4368
01:06:02,309 --> 01:06:02,319
why they were deploying social media
 

4369
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,630
why they were deploying social media
they could put fences around it so for

4370
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:04,640
they could put fences around it so for
 

4371
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:06,069
they could put fences around it so for
example of those half that kept some

4372
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
example of those half that kept some
 

4373
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:06,950
example of those half that kept some
social media

social media
almost none of them kept it on their

4376
01:06:08,069 --> 01:06:08,079
almost none of them kept it on their
 

4377
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,990
almost none of them kept it on their
phone oh interesting

4378
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,000
phone oh interesting
 

4379
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,829
phone oh interesting
yeah so i can't optimize if you don't

4380
01:06:11,829 --> 01:06:11,839
yeah so i can't optimize if you don't
 

4381
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,789
yeah so i can't optimize if you don't
know what it is the function you're

4382
01:06:12,789 --> 01:06:12,799
know what it is the function you're
 

4383
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:13,910
know what it is the function you're
trying to optimize so it's like this

4384
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:13,920
trying to optimize so it's like this
 

4385
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:14,549
trying to optimize so it's like this
huge hack

4386
01:06:14,549 --> 01:06:14,559
huge hack
 

4387
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:15,829
huge hack
like once you know this is why i'm using

4388
01:06:15,829 --> 01:06:15,839
like once you know this is why i'm using
 

4389
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:17,829
like once you know this is why i'm using
twitter then you can have a lot of rules

4390
01:06:17,829 --> 01:06:17,839
twitter then you can have a lot of rules
 

4391
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:18,950
twitter then you can have a lot of rules
about how you use twitter

4392
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:18,960
about how you use twitter
 

4393
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,710
about how you use twitter
and and suddenly you take this cost

4394
01:06:20,710 --> 01:06:20,720
and and suddenly you take this cost
 

4395
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:22,309
and and suddenly you take this cost
benefit ratio and it goes like

4396
01:06:22,309 --> 01:06:22,319
benefit ratio and it goes like
 

4397
01:06:22,319 --> 01:06:24,390
benefit ratio and it goes like
way from the company's advantage and way

4398
01:06:24,390 --> 01:06:24,400
way from the company's advantage and way
 

4399
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:25,670
way from the company's advantage and way
over towards your advantage

4400
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:25,680
over towards your advantage
 

4401
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,029
over towards your advantage

01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
haven't actually done it for 30 days
 

4409

the way that people conceptualized what
 

4697
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,070
the way that people conceptualized what
for example

4698
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
for example
 

4699
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:04,310

debate and discussion was like it

4700
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320

introduced a rhetorical dunk culture
 

4703
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,470
introduced a rhetorical dunk culture
where it's sort of more about tribes not

4704
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
where it's sort of more about tribes not
 

4705

giving ground to other tribes and
and it's like it's a complete there's

4708
01:11:12,470 --> 01:11:12,480
and it's like it's a complete there's
 

4709
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:14,950
and it's like it's a complete there's
different places and times

4710
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
different places and times
 

4711
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,550
different places and times
when that type of discussion was thought

4712
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
when that type of discussion was thought
 

4713
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,990
when that type of discussion was thought
of differently right

4714
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,000
of differently right
 

4715
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,310
of differently right
well yeah absolutely but i i tend to

4716
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,320
well yeah absolutely but i i tend to
 

4717
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,750
well yeah absolutely but i i tend to
believe i don't know what you think that

4718
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
believe i don't know what you think that
 

4719
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,830
believe i don't know what you think that
there's the technological solutions like

4720
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
there's the technological solutions like
 

4721
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,350
there's the technological solutions like
there's literally

4722
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
there's literally
 

4723
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,070
there's literally
different features in twitter that could

4724
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
different features in twitter that could
 

4725
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,149
different features in twitter that could
completely reverse that there's so much

4726
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
completely reverse that there's so much
 

4727
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,590
completely reverse that there's so much
power in the different

4728
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:31,600
power in the different
 

4729
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,149
power in the different
choices yeah that are made and it could

4730
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
choices yeah that are made and it could
 

4731
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,189
choices yeah that are made and it could
still be

4732
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
still be
 

4733
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:37,189
still be
highly engaging and have very different

4734
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:37,199
highly engaging and have very different
 

4735
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:38,870
highly engaging and have very different
effects perhaps more negative but

4736
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:38,880
effects perhaps more negative but
 

4737
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,110
effects perhaps more negative but
or hopefully more positive yeah so it's

4738
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:41,120
or hopefully more positive yeah so it's
 

4739
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,229
or hopefully more positive yeah so it's
i'm trying to pull these two things

4740
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
i'm trying to pull these two things
 

4741
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,149
i'm trying to pull these two things
apart so there's these

4742
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
apart so there's these
 

4743
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,910
apart so there's these
two ways social media let's say could

4744
01:11:45,910 --> 01:11:45,920
two ways social media let's say could
 

4745
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:48,149
two ways social media let's say could
change the experience of reading a major

4746
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:48,159
change the experience of reading a major
 

4747
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:49,350
change the experience of reading a major
newspaper today

4748
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
newspaper today
 

4749
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,950
newspaper today
one could be a little bit more economic

4750
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:50,960
one could be a little bit more economic
 

4751
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,870
one could be a little bit more economic
right so so the internet made it cheaper

4752
01:11:52,870 --> 01:11:52,880
right so so the internet made it cheaper
 

4753
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:54,310
right so so the internet made it cheaper
to get news the newspapers had to

4754
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:54,320
to get news the newspapers had to
 

4755
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,830
to get news the newspapers had to
retreat to a paywall model because it

4756
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
retreat to a paywall model because it
 

4757
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:56,709
retreat to a paywall model because it
was the only way they were going to

4758
01:11:56,709 --> 01:11:56,719
was the only way they were going to
 

4759
01:11:56,719 --> 01:11:58,149
was the only way they were going to
survive but once you're in a paywall

4760
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
survive but once you're in a paywall
 

4761
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,350
survive but once you're in a paywall
model then then

4762
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
model then then
 

4763
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:01,110
model then then
what you really want to do is make your

4764
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,120
what you really want to do is make your
 

4765
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,950
what you really want to do is make your
tribe which is within the paywall very

4766
01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
tribe which is within the paywall very
 

4767
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,630
tribe which is within the paywall very
very happy with you so you want to work

4768
01:12:04,630 --> 01:12:04,640
very happy with you so you want to work
 

4769
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,229
very happy with you so you want to work
to them but then there's the sort of

4770
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:06,239
to them but then there's the sort of
 

4771
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:07,990
to them but then there's the sort of
the determinist point of view which is

4772
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:08,000
the determinist point of view which is
 

4773
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,270
the determinist point of view which is
the properties of twitter which were

4774
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:09,280
the properties of twitter which were
 

4775
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,550
the properties of twitter which were
arbitrary

4949
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:51,350
very
i'm very bearish yes on the big

4950
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:51,360
i'm very bearish yes on the big
 

4951
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:52,310
i'm very bearish yes on the big
platforms

4952
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:52,320
platforms
 

4953
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,550
platforms
having a long future you are i think the

4954
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:54,560
having a long future you are i think the
 

4955
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:56,390
having a long future you are i think the
moment i think the moment of three or

4956
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
moment i think the moment of three or
 

4957
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:57,830
moment i think the moment of three or
four major platforms

4958
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
four major platforms
 

4959
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,870
four major platforms
is uh not gonna last

4960
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880
is uh not gonna last
 

4961
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,870
is uh not gonna last
right so i don't know okay this is just

4962
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
right so i don't know okay this is just
 

4963
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,149
right so i don't know okay this is just
perspective right so you can start

4964
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:04,159
perspective right so you can start
 

4965
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:05,910
perspective right so you can start
shorting these stocks uh

4966
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:05,920
shorting these stocks uh
 

4967
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,430
shorting these stocks uh
i'm on my don't tell that's not

4968
01:15:07,430 --> 01:15:07,440
i'm on my don't tell that's not
 

4969
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,510
i'm on my don't tell that's not
financial yeah yeah don't do robinhood

4970
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:09,520
financial yeah yeah don't do robinhood
 

4971
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:12,310
financial yeah yeah don't do robinhood
um so here's here's i think the the big

4972
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:12,320
um so here's here's i think the the big
 

4973
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,550
um so here's here's i think the the big
mistake the major platforms made

4974
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
mistake the major platforms made
 

4975
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,510
mistake the major platforms made
as when they they took out the network

4976
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
as when they they took out the network
 

4977
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,950
as when they they took out the network
effect advantage

4978
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:18,960
effect advantage
 

4979
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,189
effect advantage
right so the original pitch especially

4980
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:21,199
right so the original pitch especially
 

4981
01:15:21,199 --> 01:15:23,030
right so the original pitch especially
something like facebook or instagram

4982
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
something like facebook or instagram
 

4983
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:25,990
something like facebook or instagram
was the people you know are on here

4984
01:15:25,990 --> 01:15:26,000
was the people you know are on here
 

4985
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,669
was the people you know are on here
right so like what you use this was you

4986
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
right so like what you use this was you
 

4987
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,950
right so like what you use this was you
can connect to people that you already

4988
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
can connect to people that you already
 

4989
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:29,510
can connect to people that you already
know

4990
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:29,520
know
 

4991
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,510
know
this is what makes the network useful we

4992
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:31,520
this is what makes the network useful we
 

4993
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,030
this is what makes the network useful we
so therefore the value of our network

4994
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
so therefore the value of our network
 

4995
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:33,510
so therefore the value of our network
grows

4996
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:33,520
grows
 

4997
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,189
grows
uh quadratically with the number of

4998
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:35,199
uh quadratically with the number of
 

4999
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:37,189
uh quadratically with the number of
users and therefore it's such a head

5000
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
users and therefore it's such a head
 

5001
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,630
users and therefore it's such a head
start that there's no way that someone

5002
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:38,640
start that there's no way that someone
 

5003
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,149
start that there's no way that someone
else can catch up

5004
01:15:40,149 --> 01:15:40,159
else can catch up
 

5005
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,910
else can catch up
but when they shifted and when facebook

5006
01:15:41,910 --> 01:15:41,920
but when they shifted and when facebook
 

5007
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:43,110
but when they shifted and when facebook
took the lead of say we're going to

5008
01:15:43,110 --> 01:15:43,120
took the lead of say we're going to
 

5009
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:45,510
took the lead of say we're going to
shift towards a news feed model

5010
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:45,520
shift towards a news feed model
 

5011
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:47,110
shift towards a news feed model
they basically said we're going to try

5012
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:47,120
they basically said we're going to try
 

5013
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:49,350
they basically said we're going to try
to in the moment get more data and get

5014
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:49,360
to in the moment get more data and get
 

5015
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:50,870
to in the moment get more data and get
more likes like what we're going to go

more likes like what we're going to go
 

5017
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:51,990
more likes like what we're going to go
towards is actually just

5018
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
towards is actually just
 

5019
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,470
towards is actually just
uh seeing interesting stuff like scene

5020
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
uh seeing interesting stuff like scene
 

5021
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,149
uh seeing interesting stuff like scene
diverted information so people took this

5022
01:15:56,149 --> 01:15:56,159
diverted information so people took this

5029
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,310
digitally to other tools
like group text messages and whatsapp

5030
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
like group text messages and whatsapp
 

5031
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,270
like group text messages and whatsapp
and stuff like this right so you don't

5032
01:16:03,270 --> 01:16:03,280
and stuff like this right so you don't
 

5033
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:04,709
and stuff like this right so you don't
think about these tools as oh this is

5034
01:16:04,709 --> 01:16:04,719
think about these tools as oh this is
 

5035
01:16:04,719 --> 01:16:06,310
think about these tools as oh this is
where i connect with people

5036
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:06,320
where i connect with people
 

5037
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:07,910

once it's just a feed that's kind of

5038
01:16:07,910 --> 01:16:07,920
once it's just a feed that's kind of
 

5039
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,070
once it's just a feed that's kind of
interesting now you're competing with

5040
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
interesting now you're competing with
 

5041
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:11,189
interesting now you're competing with
everything else that can produce

5042
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:11,199
everything else that can produce
 

5043
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,270
everything else that can produce
interesting content that's diverting

5044
01:16:13,270 --> 01:16:13,280
interesting content that's diverting
 

5045
01:16:13,280 --> 01:16:15,590
interesting content that's diverting
and i think that is a much fiercer

5046
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
and i think that is a much fiercer
 

5047
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:16,950
and i think that is a much fiercer
competition because now for example

5048
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
competition because now for example
 

5049
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,229
competition because now for example
you're going up against podcast

5050
01:16:18,229 --> 01:16:18,239
you're going up against podcast
 

5051
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:19,910
you're going up against podcast
right i mean like okay i guess you know

5052
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:19,920
right i mean like okay i guess you know
 

5053

the twitter feed is interesting right

5054
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:21,520
the twitter feed is interesting right
 

5055
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:22,470
the twitter feed is interesting right
now

5056
01:16:22,470 --> 01:16:22,480
now
 

5057
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,390
now
um but also a podcast is interesting or

5058
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:24,400
um but also a podcast is interesting or
 

5059
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:25,510
um but also a podcast is interesting or
something else could be interesting too

5060
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
something else could be interesting too
 

5061
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,110
something else could be interesting too
i think it's a much fiercer competition

5062
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
i think it's a much fiercer competition
 

5063
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:27,750
i think it's a much fiercer competition
when there's no

5064
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
when there's no
 

5065
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,830
when there's no
there's no more network effects right

5066
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:29,840
there's no more network effects right
 

5067
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,350
there's no more network effects right
and so my sense is we're going to see a

5068
01:16:31,350 --> 01:16:31,360
and so my sense is we're going to see a
 

5069
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,189
and so my sense is we're going to see a
fragmentation into what i call long tail

5070
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
fragmentation into what i call long tail
 

5071
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:34,630
fragmentation into what i call long tail

where if i don't need everyone i know to
 

5075
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:39,669
where if i don't need everyone i know to
be on a platform then why not have

5076
01:16:39,669 --> 01:16:39,679
be on a platform then why not have
 

5077
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:41,669
be on a platform then why not have
three or four bespoke platforms i use

5078
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
three or four bespoke platforms i use
 

5079
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,350
three or four bespoke platforms i use
where it's a thousand people

5080
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
where it's a thousand people
 

5081
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,110
where it's a thousand people
and it's all we're all interested in you

5082
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:45,120
and it's all we're all interested in you
 

5083
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,390
and it's all we're all interested in you
know whatever

5084
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
know whatever
 

5085
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,709
know whatever
ai or comedy and it's we've we've

5086
01:16:48,709 --> 01:16:48,719
ai or comedy and it's we've we've
 

5087
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:50,310
ai or comedy and it's we've we've
perfected this interface and maybe it's

5088
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:50,320
perfected this interface and maybe it's
 

5089
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,910
perfected this interface and maybe it's
like clubhouse it's audio or something

5090
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:51,920
like clubhouse it's audio or something
 

5091
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,149
like clubhouse it's audio or something
and

5092
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159
and
 

5093
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,750
and
we all pay two dollars so we don't have

5094
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
we all pay two dollars so we don't have
 

5095
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:55,669
we all pay two dollars so we don't have
to worry about attention harvesting

5096
01:16:55,669 --> 01:16:55,679
to worry about attention harvesting
 

5097
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:57,110
to worry about attention harvesting
and that's going to be wildly more

5098
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
and that's going to be wildly more
 

5099
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,390
and that's going to be wildly more
entertaining i mean i'm thinking about

5100
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
entertaining i mean i'm thinking about
 

5101
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,470
entertaining i mean i'm thinking about
comedians on twitter

5102
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
comedians on twitter
 

5103
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,430
comedians on twitter
it's not the best internet possible

5104
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:03,440
it's not the best internet possible
 

5105
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,790
it's not the best internet possible
format for them

5106
01:17:04,790 --> 01:17:04,800
format for them
 

5107

now so this is my thought is that
 

5127
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,270
now so this is my thought is that
there's really no

5128
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:19,280
there's really no
 

5129
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:21,189
there's really no
there's really no strong advantage to

01:17:21,189 --> 01:17:21,199
there's really no strong advantage to
 

5131
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:22,310
there's really no strong advantage to
having one

that whole thing could fragment and i

5144
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:34,640
that whole thing could fragment and i
 

5145
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,910
that whole thing could fragment and i
think the glue that was holding together

5146
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:35,920
think the glue that was holding together
 

5147
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,270
think the glue that was holding together
was network effects i don't think they

5148
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
was network effects i don't think they
 

5149
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:38,550
was network effects i don't think they
realized that when network effects have

5150
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560
realized that when network effects have
 

5151
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:39,750
realized that when network effects have
been destabilized

5152
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,760
been destabilized
 

5153
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,030
been destabilized
they don't have the centrifugal force

5154
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:41,040
they don't have the centrifugal force
 

5155
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,790
they don't have the centrifugal force
anymore and they're spinning faster and

5156
01:17:42,790 --> 01:17:42,800
anymore and they're spinning faster and
 

5157
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,270
anymore and they're spinning faster and
faster but is is a twitter feed really

multiple different feeds
 

5191
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:16,550

gamification that they've figured out

5196
01:18:20,390 --> 01:18:20,400
gamification that they've figured out
 

5197
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,669
gamification that they've figured out
yeah the and

5198

yeah the and
uh you so you have to whatever you

5200

uh you so you have to whatever you
 

5201
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:24,709
uh you so you have to whatever you
create

5202
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:24,719
create
 

5203
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:26,630
create
you have to at least provide some

5204
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
you have to at least provide some
 

5205
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,709
you have to at least provide some
pleasure in that same gamification kind

5206
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
pleasure in that same gamification kind
 

5207
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:29,510
pleasure in that same gamification kind
of way

5208
01:18:29,510 --> 01:18:29,520
of way
 

5209
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:31,990
of way
it doesn't have to have to do with scale

5210
01:18:31,990 --> 01:18:32,000
it doesn't have to have to do with scale
 

5211
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,750
it doesn't have to have to do with scale
of large social networks but

5212
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:33,760
of large social networks but
 

5213
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,070
of large social networks but
i mean i guess you're implying that you

5214
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:36,080
i mean i guess you're implying that you
 

5215
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,149
i mean i guess you're implying that you
should be able to design that kind of

5216
01:18:38,149 --> 01:18:38,159
should be able to design that kind of
 

5217
01:18:38,159 --> 01:18:40,470
should be able to design that kind of
uh mechanism in other forms or people

5218
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:40,480
uh mechanism in other forms or people
 

5219
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,390
uh mechanism in other forms or people
are turning on the that gamification

5220
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
are turning on the that gamification
 

5221
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,310
are turning on the that gamification
i mean so people are getting wise to it

5222
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:44,320
i mean so people are getting wise to it
 

5223
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,830
i mean so people are getting wise to it
and are getting uncomfortable about it

5224
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:45,840
and are getting uncomfortable about it
 

5225
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:46,149
and are getting uncomfortable about it
right

5226

mean that's the power

5530
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
mean that's the power
 

5531
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,990
mean that's the power
and uh the downside you can have

5532
01:23:17,990 --> 01:23:18,000
and uh the downside you can have
 

5533
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,270
and uh the downside you can have
i mean hitler could have a blog today

5534
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:21,280
i mean hitler could have a blog today
 

5535
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,310
i mean hitler could have a blog today
yeah and he would have

5536
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320
yeah and he would have
 

5537
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:24,550
yeah and he would have
potentially very large following if he's

5538
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:24,560
potentially very large following if he's
 

5539
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,070
potentially very large following if he's
charismatic if he's

5540
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
charismatic if he's
 

5541
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,229
charismatic if he's
has you know as good with words he's

5542
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,239
has you know as good with words he's
 

5543
01:23:28,239 --> 01:23:30,470
has you know as good with words he's
able to express the ideas whatever maybe

5544
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:30,480
able to express the ideas whatever maybe
 

5545
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:31,830
able to express the ideas whatever maybe
he's able to channel

5546
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
he's able to channel
 

5547
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,350
he's able to channel
the frustration the anger that people

5548
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
the frustration the anger that people
 

5549
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,110
the frustration the anger that people
have about a certain thing and

5550
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
have about a certain thing and
 

5551
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,270
have about a certain thing and
so i think that's the power of blogs but

5552
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,280
so i think that's the power of blogs but
 

5553
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,149
so i think that's the power of blogs but
it's also the

5554
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
it's also the
 

5555
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,830
it's also the
limitation but that doesn't we're not

5556
01:23:39,830 --> 01:23:39,840
limitation but that doesn't we're not
 

5557
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,350
limitation but that doesn't we're not
trying to solve that you can't solve

5558
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:41,360
trying to solve that you can't solve
 

5559
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:42,950
trying to solve that you can't solve
that yeah the fundamental problem you're

5560
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
that yeah the fundamental problem you're
 

5561
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,390
that yeah the fundamental problem you're
saying is not the problem

5562
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
saying is not the problem
 

5563
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,030
saying is not the problem
the your your thesis is that there's

5564
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
the your your thesis is that there's
 

5565
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:47,990
the your your thesis is that there's
nothing special

5566
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
nothing special
 

5567
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,430
nothing special
about large-scale social networks that

5568
01:23:51,430 --> 01:23:51,440
about large-scale social networks that
 

5569
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,430
about large-scale social networks that
guarantees that they will keep existing

5570
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:53,440
guarantees that they will keep existing
 

5571
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:55,189
guarantees that they will keep existing
and it's important to remember for a lot

5572
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
and it's important to remember for a lot
 

5573
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:55,750
and it's important to remember for a lot
of the

5574
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:55,760
of the
 

5575
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,070
of the
older generation of internet activists

5576
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:58,080
older generation of internet activists
 

5577
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,590
older generation of internet activists
or the people who are very pro-internet

5578
01:23:59,590 --> 01:23:59,600
or the people who are very pro-internet
 

5579
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,189
or the people who are very pro-internet
in the early days

5580
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:01,199
in the early days
 

5581
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,990
in the early days
they were completely flabbergasted by

5582
01:24:03,990 --> 01:24:04,000
they were completely flabbergasted by
 

5583
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:05,030
they were completely flabbergasted by
the rise of these

5584
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:05,040
the rise of these
 

5585
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,070
the rise of these
platforms say why would you take the

5586
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:08,080
platforms say why would you take the
 

5587
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,510
platforms say why would you take the
internet and then build your own version

5588
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
internet and then build your own version
 

5589
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,790
internet and then build your own version
of the internet

5590
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
of the internet
 

5591
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,270
of the internet
where you own all the servers and we

5592
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:13,280
where you own all the servers and we
 

5593
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:14,550
where you own all the servers and we
built this whole distribute the whole

5594
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:14,560
built this whole distribute the whole
 

5595
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,470
built this whole distribute the whole
thing with open protocols

5596
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:16,480
thing with open protocols
 

5597
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:17,910
thing with open protocols
everyone anywhere in the world use the

5598
01:24:17,910 --> 01:24:17,920
everyone anywhere in the world use the
 

5599
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:19,270
everyone anywhere in the world use the
same protocols your machine can talk to

5600
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:19,280
same protocols your machine can talk to
 

5601
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:20,709
same protocols your machine can talk to
any other machine it's the most

5602
01:24:20,709 --> 01:24:20,719
any other machine it's the most
 

5603
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:23,350
any other machine it's the most
democratic communication system that's

5604
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:23,360
democratic communication system that's
 

5605
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:24,790
democratic communication system that's
ever been built and then these companies

5606
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
ever been built and then these companies
 

5607
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:25,910
ever been built and then these companies
came along and said we're going to build

5608
01:24:25,910 --> 01:24:25,920
came along and said we're going to build
 

5609
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:26,470
came along and said we're going to build
our own

5610
01:24:26,470 --> 01:24:26,480
our own
 

5611
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:27,750
our own
let's own all the servers and put them

5612
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:27,760
let's own all the servers and put them
 

5613
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:29,270
let's own all the servers and put them
in buildings that we own and the

5614
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:29,280
in buildings that we own and the
 

5615
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:29,990
in buildings that we own and the
internet will just be

5616
01:24:29,990 --> 01:24:30,000
internet will just be
 

5617
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:31,510
internet will just be
the the first mile this gets you into

5618
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:31,520
the the first mile this gets you into
 

5619
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:33,270
the the first mile this gets you into
our private internet where we own the

5620
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
our private internet where we own the
 

5621
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,110
our private internet where we own the
whole thing it went completely against

5622
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:35,120
whole thing it went completely against
 

5623
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,470
whole thing it went completely against
the entire

5624
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:36,480
the entire
 

5625
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,870
the entire
motivation of the internet was like yes

5626
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:38,880
motivation of the internet was like yes
 

5627
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,629
motivation of the internet was like yes
we it's not going to be one person owns

5628
01:24:40,629 --> 01:24:40,639
we it's not going to be one person owns
 

5629
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:41,990
we it's not going to be one person owns
all the servers and you pay to access

5630
01:24:41,990 --> 01:24:42,000
all the servers and you pay to access
 

5631
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:42,950
all the servers and you pay to access
them it's any one

5632
01:24:42,950 --> 01:24:42,960
them it's any one
 

5633
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,470
them it's any one
server that they own can talk to anyone

5634
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
server that they own can talk to anyone
 

5635
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,990
server that they own can talk to anyone
else's server because we all agree on a

5636
01:24:45,990 --> 01:24:46,000
else's server because we all agree on a
 

5637
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,669
else's server because we all agree on a
standard set of

5638
01:24:47,669 --> 01:24:47,679
standard set of
 

5639
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:49,910
standard set of
protocols and so the the old guard of

5640
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
protocols and so the the old guard of
 

5641
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,669
protocols and so the the old guard of
pro internet people

5642
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:51,679
pro internet people
 

5643
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:54,070
pro internet people
never understood this move towards let's

5644
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,080
never understood this move towards let's
 

5645
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,110
never understood this move towards let's
build

5646
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:55,120
build
 

5647
01:24:55,120 --> 01:24:57,510
build
private versions of the internet uh

5648
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
private versions of the internet uh
 

5649
01:24:57,520 --> 01:24:58,550
private versions of the internet uh
we'll build three or four private

5650
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
we'll build three or four private
 

5651
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,990
we'll build three or four private
internets and that's what we'll all use

5652
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,000
internets and that's what we'll all use
 

5653
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:01,910
internets and that's what we'll all use
it was the opposite basically well it's

5654
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
it was the opposite basically well it's
 

5655
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:03,270
it was the opposite basically well it's
funny enough i don't know if you follow

5656
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:03,280
funny enough i don't know if you follow
 

5657
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:05,510
funny enough i don't know if you follow
but jack dorsey is also

5658
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
but jack dorsey is also
 

5659
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,669
but jack dorsey is also
uh as a proponent and is helping to fund

5660
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:09,679
uh as a proponent and is helping to fund
 

5661
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,990
uh as a proponent and is helping to fund
create fully distributed version to

5662
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
create fully distributed version to
 

5663
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,189
create fully distributed version to
twitter essentially

5664
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
twitter essentially
 

5665
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,510
twitter essentially
that would potentially destroy twitter

5666
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:15,520
that would potentially destroy twitter
 

5667
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:16,629
that would potentially destroy twitter
yeah but i think there

5668
01:25:16,629 --> 01:25:16,639
yeah but i think there
 

5669
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:19,350
yeah but i think there
you know there might be financial art

5670
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
you know there might be financial art
 

5671
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:20,950
you know there might be financial art
like business cases to be made there i'm

5672
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:20,960
like business cases to be made there i'm
 

5673
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,669
like business cases to be made there i'm
not sure

5674
01:25:21,669 --> 01:25:21,679
not sure
 

5675
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:23,590
not sure
but that seems to be another alternative

5676
01:25:23,590 --> 01:25:23,600
but that seems to be another alternative
 

5677
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,790
but that seems to be another alternative
as as opposed to creating a bunch of

5678
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:26,800
as as opposed to creating a bunch of
 

5679
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,070
as as opposed to creating a bunch of
uh like the long tail uh creating like

5680
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:30,080
uh like the long tail uh creating like
 

5681
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:32,229
uh like the long tail uh creating like
the ultimate long tail of like fully

5682
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:32,239
the ultimate long tail of like fully
 

5683
01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:33,110
the ultimate long tail of like fully
distributed

5684
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:33,120
distributed
 

5685
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,030
distributed
yeah which is what the internet is but

5686
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
yeah which is what the internet is but
 

5687
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,149
yeah which is what the internet is but
that's that's sort of like

5688
01:25:36,149 --> 01:25:36,159
that's that's sort of like
 

5689
01:25:36,159 --> 01:25:37,350
that's that's sort of like
when i'm thinking about long tail social

5690
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
when i'm thinking about long tail social
 

5691
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,189
when i'm thinking about long tail social
media i'm thinking it's uh

5692
01:25:39,189 --> 01:25:39,199
media i'm thinking it's uh
 

5693
01:25:39,199 --> 01:25:40,870
media i'm thinking it's uh
like the text not so important like

5694
01:25:40,870 --> 01:25:40,880
like the text not so important like
 

5695
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:42,310
like the text not so important like
there's groups out there

5696
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:42,320
there's groups out there
 

5697
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:44,790
there's groups out there
right i know where the tech they use to

5698
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
right i know where the tech they use to
 

5699
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:45,990
right i know where the tech they use to
actually implement their

5700
01:25:45,990 --> 01:25:46,000
actually implement their
 

5701
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,590
actually implement their
digital only social group whatever they

5702
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:47,600
digital only social group whatever they
 

5703
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,350
digital only social group whatever they
might use slack they might use some

5704
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:49,360
might use slack they might use some
 

5705
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,870
might use slack they might use some
combination of zoomer it doesn't matter

5706
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:50,880
combination of zoomer it doesn't matter
 

5707
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,550
combination of zoomer it doesn't matter
i think in the tech world

5708
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
i think in the tech world
 

5709
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,390
i think in the tech world
we want to build the beautiful protocol

5710
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
we want to build the beautiful protocol
 

5711
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,910
we want to build the beautiful protocol
right that okay everyone's going to use

5712
01:25:55,910 --> 01:25:55,920
right that okay everyone's going to use
 

5713
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,870
right that okay everyone's going to use
as just a

5714
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,880
as just a
 

5715
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,870
as just a
federated server protocol in which we've

5716
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:58,880
federated server protocol in which we've
 

5717
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,070
federated server protocol in which we've
worked out x y and z and no one

5718
01:26:00,070 --> 01:26:00,080
worked out x y and z and no one
 

5719
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:00,950
worked out x y and z and no one
understands it because then the

5720
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:00,960
understands it because then the
 

5721
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,470
understands it because then the
engineers need it all to make i get it

5722
01:26:02,470 --> 01:26:02,480
engineers need it all to make i get it
 

5723
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:03,830
engineers need it all to make i get it
because i'm a nerd like this like okay

5724
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:03,840
because i'm a nerd like this like okay
 

5725
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:04,950
because i'm a nerd like this like okay
every standard has to fit with

5726
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
every standard has to fit with
 

5727
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,229

meanwhile you know you have this group
 

5733
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:10,870
meanwhile you know you have this group
of bike enthusiasts that are like yeah

5734
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:10,880
of bike enthusiasts that are like yeah
 

5735
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:11,510
of bike enthusiasts that are like yeah
we'll just

5736
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:11,520
we'll just
 

5737
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:13,350
we'll just
jump onto zoom and have some slack and

jump onto zoom and have some slack and
 

5739
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,030
jump onto zoom and have some slack and
put up a blog the tech doesn't really

5740
01:26:15,030 --> 01:26:15,040
put up a blog the tech doesn't really
 

5741
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:15,590
put up a blog the tech doesn't really

yeah like i i think uh facebook hasn't
actually messed up

5788
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:54,880
actually messed up
 

5789
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:57,750
actually messed up
for like enough to there's two things

5790
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:57,760
for like enough to there's two things
 

5791
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,030
for like enough to there's two things
they haven't messed up enough for people

5792
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
they haven't messed up enough for people
 

5793
01:26:59,040 --> 01:27:00,550
they haven't messed up enough for people
to really leave aggressively

5794
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
to really leave aggressively
 

5795
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,110
to really leave aggressively
and there's no good alternative for them

5796
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
and there's no good alternative for them
 

5797
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:03,750
and there's no good alternative for them
to leave

5798
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:03,760
to leave
 

5799
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:06,149
to leave
i think if good alternatives pop up it

5800
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:06,159
i think if good alternatives pop up it
 

5801
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,510
i think if good alternatives pop up it
would just immediately happen

5802
01:27:07,510 --> 01:27:07,520
would just immediately happen
 

5803
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,030
would just immediately happen
this stuff is a lot more culturally

5804
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040

5805
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:10,950
this stuff is a lot more culturally
fragile i think i mean twitter's having

5806
01:27:10,950 --> 01:27:10,960
fragile i think i mean twitter's having
 

5807
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:12,229
fragile i think i mean twitter's having
a moment because it was feeding a

5808
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:12,239
a moment because it was feeding a
 

5809
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:13,590
a moment because it was feeding a
certain type of and there's a lot of

5810
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
certain type of and there's a lot of
 

5811
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,189
certain type of and there's a lot of
anxieties that was in the the sort of

5812
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
anxieties that was in the the sort of
 

5813
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:16,950
anxieties that was in the the sort of
political sphere anyways that

5814
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:16,960
political sphere anyways that
 

5815
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,070
political sphere anyways that
twitter was working with

5816
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
twitter was working with
 

5817
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:21,590
twitter was working with
but its moment could go to as well i

5818
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:21,600
but its moment could go to as well i
 

5819
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,430
but its moment could go to as well i
mean it's a really arbitrary thing

01:28:03,669 --> 01:28:03,679
why are epidemiologists having to do
 

5871
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:04,709
why are epidemiologists having to do
tweet threads

5872
01:28:04,709 --> 01:28:04,719
tweet threads
 

5873
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:06,149
tweet threads
well because there's mechanisms of

5874
01:28:06,149 --> 01:28:06,159
well because there's mechanisms of
 

5875
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:07,830
well because there's mechanisms of
publishing that make it easier on

5876
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:07,840
publishing that make it easier on
 

5877
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,550
publishing that make it easier on
twitter

5878
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:08,560
twitter
 

5879
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:10,709
twitter
i mean we're evolving as a species and

5880
01:28:10,709 --> 01:28:10,719
i mean we're evolving as a species and
 

5881
01:28:10,719 --> 01:28:11,750
i mean we're evolving as a species and
the internet is a very

5882
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
the internet is a very
 

5883
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:14,709
the internet is a very
fresh thing yeah and so it's kind of

5884
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:14,719
fresh thing yeah and so it's kind of
 

5885
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,070
fresh thing yeah and so it's kind of
interesting to think

5886
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
interesting to think
 

5887
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,629
interesting to think
that as opposed to twitter it's this is

5888
01:28:18,629 --> 01:28:18,639
that as opposed to twitter it's this is
 

5889
01:28:18,639 --> 01:28:20,229
that as opposed to twitter it's this is
what jack also complains about

5890
01:28:20,229 --> 01:28:20,239
what jack also complains about
 

5891
01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:22,629
what jack also complains about
is twitter's not innovating fast enough

5892
01:28:22,629 --> 01:28:22,639
is twitter's not innovating fast enough
 

5893
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:23,750
is twitter's not innovating fast enough
yeah and

5894
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:23,760
yeah and
 

5895
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:26,070
yeah and
so it's almost like the people are

5896
01:28:26,070 --> 01:28:26,080
so it's almost like the people are
 

5897
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:28,149
so it's almost like the people are
innovating and thinking about their

5898
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:28,159
innovating and thinking about their
 

5899
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:29,669
innovating and thinking about their
productive life

5900
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
productive life
 

5901
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,070
productive life
faster than the platforms in which they

5902
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
faster than the platforms in which they
 

5903
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:34,070
faster than the platforms in which they
operate can catch up yeah and so

5904
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
operate can catch up yeah and so
 

5905
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:36,390
operate can catch up yeah and so
at the point you the gap grows

5906
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:36,400
at the point you the gap grows
 

5907
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:37,350
at the point you the gap grows

many little silos and then people will
jump and it will just continue in this

5920

jump and it will just continue in this
 

5921
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,870
jump and it will just continue in this
kind of way but see

5971
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:29,830
probably that's an email all day and
and so like there's an innovation that's

5972
01:29:29,830 --> 01:29:29,840
and so like there's an innovation that's
 

5973
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:31,510
and so like there's an innovation that's
going to that group you know it's going

5974
01:29:31,510 --> 01:29:31,520
going to that group you know it's going
 

5975
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:31,750
going to that group you know it's going
to

5976
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:31,760
to
 

5977
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:33,110
to
suck them off which is actually a very

5978
01:29:33,110 --> 01:29:33,120
suck them off which is actually a very
 

5979
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,430
suck them off which is actually a very
large group yeah that's a lot of that's

01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:35,440
large group yeah that's a lot of that's
 

5981
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:36,229
large group yeah that's a lot of that's
a lot of energy

that's probably gonna dr that drove a
 

5987
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:40,310
that's probably gonna dr that drove a
lot of uh

5988
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
lot of uh

about
creating like sub stack to creating a

6028
01:30:15,430 --> 01:30:15,440
clunkiness of the interfaces
 

6029
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:18,390
clunkiness of the interfaces
the um and i don't know it's to some

6030
01:30:18,390 --> 01:30:18,400
the um and i don't know it's to some
 

6031
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,750
the um and i don't know it's to some

spent a lot of money on this
 

6035
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,550
spent a lot of money on this
and to some degree it's a survivorship

6036
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:22,560
and to some degree it's a survivorship
 

6037
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:24,149
and to some degree it's a survivorship
bias yeah right i think

6038
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:24,159
bias yeah right i think
 

6039
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,229
bias yeah right i think

javascript model which
brendan ike talked about he just

6070
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600

become uh according to stack exchange
the most popular programming language in

6084
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:05,600
the most popular programming language in
 

6085
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,430
the most popular programming language in
the world that yeah it drives like most

6086
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
the world that yeah it drives like most
 

6087
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,189
the world that yeah it drives like most
of the internet and even the back end

6088

and now mobile and
yeah and so that that's an argument for

6092
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:13,360
yeah and so that that's an argument for
 

6093
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:14,629
yeah and so that that's an argument for
the kind of thing you're talking about

6094
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
the kind of thing you're talking about
 

6095
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:15,669
the kind of thing you're talking about
where like

6096
01:31:15,669 --> 01:31:15,679
where like
 

6097
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,310
where like
like the bike club people yeah could

6098
01:31:18,310 --> 01:31:18,320
like the bike club people yeah could
 

6099
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:21,189
like the bike club people yeah could
literally create the thing that would uh

6100
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:21,199
literally create the thing that would uh
 

6101
01:31:21,199 --> 01:31:23,189
literally create the thing that would uh
you know run most of the internet you

6102
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:23,199
you know run most of the internet you
 

6103
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,390
you know run most of the internet you
know 10 years from now

6104
01:31:24,390 --> 01:31:24,400
know 10 years from now
 

6105
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,870
know 10 years from now
yeah it's so there's something to that

6106
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
yeah it's so there's something to that
 

6107
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:27,590
yeah it's so there's something to that
like

6108
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:27,600
like
 

6109
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,270
like
as opposed to trying to get lucky or

6110
01:31:29,270 --> 01:31:29,280
as opposed to trying to get lucky or
 

6111
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,950
as opposed to trying to get lucky or
trying to think through stuff is just to

6112
01:31:30,950 --> 01:31:30,960
trying to think through stuff is just to
 

6113
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:31,590
trying to think through stuff is just to
uh

6114
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:31,600
uh
 

6115
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,669
uh
to solve a particular problem do stuff

6116
01:31:33,669 --> 01:31:33,679
to solve a particular problem do stuff
 

6117
01:31:33,679 --> 01:31:35,350
to solve a particular problem do stuff
yeah and do stuff do something like

6118
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
yeah and do stuff do something like
 

6119
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,950
yeah and do stuff do something like
keep tinkering until you love it yeah

6120
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
keep tinkering until you love it yeah
 

6121
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,870
keep tinkering until you love it yeah
yeah and then uh

6122
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:38,880
yeah and then uh
 

6123
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,790
yeah and then uh
and of course the sad thing is timing

6124
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
and of course the sad thing is timing
 

6125
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,310
and of course the sad thing is timing
and luck matter

6126
01:31:42,310 --> 01:31:42,320
and luck matter
 

6127
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,830
and luck matter
and that you can't really control that's

6128
01:31:43,830 --> 01:31:43,840
and that you can't really control that's
 

6129
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,430
and that you can't really control that's
the problem yeah but uh

6130
01:31:45,430 --> 01:31:45,440
the problem yeah but uh
 

6131
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,149
the problem yeah but uh
you can't go back to 2007. yeah that's

6132
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:48,159
you can't go back to 2007. yeah that's
 

6133
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:49,270
you can't go back to 2007. yeah that's
like the number one thing you could do

6134
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:49,280
like the number one thing you could do
 

6135
01:31:49,280 --> 01:31:50,550
like the number one thing you could do
to have a lot of success with a new

6136
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,560
to have a lot of success with a new
 

6137
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,510
to have a lot of success with a new
platform is

6138
01:31:51,510 --> 01:31:51,520
platform is
 

6139
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:53,990
platform is
go back in time 14 years so the thing

6140
01:31:53,990 --> 01:31:54,000
go back in time 14 years so the thing
 

6141
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,510
go back in time 14 years so the thing
you have to kind of think about is

6142
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:55,520
you have to kind of think about is
 

6143
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,830
you have to kind of think about is
what is the like what's the totally new

6144
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
what is the like what's the totally new
 

6145
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:59,110
what is the like what's the totally new
thing

6146
01:31:59,110 --> 01:31:59,120
thing
 

6147
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:02,070
thing
that uh 10 years from now would seem

6148
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:02,080
that uh 10 years from now would seem
 

6149
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:02,870
that uh 10 years from now would seem
obvious

6150
01:32:02,870 --> 01:32:02,880
obvious
 

6151
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,229
obvious
i mean some people are saying clubhouse

6152
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,239
i mean some people are saying clubhouse
 

6153

is that there's been a lot of stuff
like clubhouse before yeah but it

6156
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:09,440
like clubhouse before yeah but it
 

6157

like clubhouse before yeah but it
it hit the right kind of thing uh

6158
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
it hit the right kind of thing uh
 

6159
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,629
it hit the right kind of thing uh
similar to tesla actually what clubhouse

6160
01:32:14,629 --> 01:32:14,639
similar to tesla actually what clubhouse
 

6161
01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:16,550
similar to tesla actually what clubhouse
did is it got a lot of

6162
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,560
did is it got a lot of

quickly and um
 

6167
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,030
quickly and um
and then the the other effect is like

6168
01:32:23,030 --> 01:32:23,040
and then the the other effect is like
 

6169
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:25,189
and then the the other effect is like
it's invite only so like oh all the

though
 

6231
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:22,470
though
so one of the issues with a lot of these

6232
01:33:22,470 --> 01:33:22,480
so one of the issues with a lot of these
 

6233
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:24,790
so one of the issues with a lot of these
platforms i think is

6234
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:24,800
platforms i think is
 

6235
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,709
platforms i think is
uh bits are cheap enough now uh that

6236
01:33:28,709 --> 01:33:28,719
uh bits are cheap enough now uh that
 

6237

model i mean the investors need that

6240
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:32,080

6241
01:33:32,080 --> 01:33:32,709
model i mean the investors need that
model

6242
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:32,719
model
 

6243
01:33:32,719 --> 01:33:36,149
model
there's really not really an imperative

6244
01:33:36,149 --> 01:33:36,159
there's really not really an imperative
 

6245
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:39,750
there's really not really an imperative
of we need something that can scale

6246
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:39,760
of we need something that can scale

6249
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,310
to 100 million plus a year revenue so
because it's going to require this much

6250
01:33:44,310 --> 01:33:44,320
because it's going to require this much
 

6251
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,390
because it's going to require this much
seed and angel investment and and you're

investor model which i think is

6270
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:00,480
investor model which i think is
 

6271
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:02,550
investor model which i think is
basically the case i mean bits are so

6272
01:34:02,550 --> 01:34:02,560
basically the case i mean bits are so
 

6273
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:04,070
basically the case i mean bits are so
cheap everything is so cheap

6274
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,080
cheap everything is so cheap
 

6275
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,189
cheap everything is so cheap
you don't necess so even like with

01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:08,560
right this notion of like this needs to
 

6281
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:09,189
right this notion of like this needs to
be a

6282
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
be a

6307
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:31,270
where it even found that capital in the
world that it could concentrate and

6544
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
control
 

6545
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:52,870
control
and it has sort of devolved a lot of

6546
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:52,880
and it has sort of devolved a lot of
 

6547
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:55,109
and it has sort of devolved a lot of
work in the office now to all i do is

6548
01:37:55,109 --> 01:37:55,119
work in the office now to all i do is
 

6549
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,790
work in the office now to all i do is
constantly tend

6550
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
constantly tend
 

6551
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,030
constantly tend
communication channels so it's

6552
01:37:59,030 --> 01:37:59,040
communication channels so it's
 

6553
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,629
communication channels so it's
fascinating what you're describing

6554
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
fascinating what you're describing
 

6555
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,550
fascinating what you're describing
is uh nobody ever paused in this whole

6556
01:38:04,550 --> 01:38:04,560
is uh nobody ever paused in this whole
 

6557
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:07,109
is uh nobody ever paused in this whole
evolution to try to create a system that

6558
01:38:07,109 --> 01:38:07,119
evolution to try to create a system that
 

6559
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:08,629
evolution to try to create a system that
actually works

6560
01:38:08,629 --> 01:38:08,639
actually works
 

6561
01:38:08,639 --> 01:38:11,750
actually works
that it was um kind of like a huge fan

6562
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:11,760
that it was um kind of like a huge fan
 

6563
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:13,830
that it was um kind of like a huge fan
of cellular automata so it just kind of

6564
01:38:13,830 --> 01:38:13,840
of cellular automata so it just kind of
 

6565
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:14,550
of cellular automata so it just kind of
started

6566
01:38:14,550 --> 01:38:14,560
started
 

6567
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,189
started
yeah uh very a very simple mechanism

6568
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:17,199
yeah uh very a very simple mechanism
 

6569
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:18,629
yeah uh very a very simple mechanism
just like cellular time and it just kind

6570
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
just like cellular time and it just kind
 

6571
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,470
just like cellular time and it just kind
of grew to overtake

6572
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,480
of grew to overtake
 

6573
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,430
of grew to overtake
all the fundamental communication of how

6574
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,440
all the fundamental communication of how
 

6575
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:25,189
all the fundamental communication of how
we do business and also personal life

6576
01:38:25,189 --> 01:38:25,199
we do business and also personal life
 

6577
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:27,270
we do business and also personal life
yeah and that's one of the big ideas is

6578
01:38:27,270 --> 01:38:27,280
yeah and that's one of the big ideas is
 

6579
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:29,030
yeah and that's one of the big ideas is
that the unintentionality

6580
01:38:29,030 --> 01:38:29,040
that the unintentionality
 

6581
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,470
that the unintentionality
yeah right so this goes back to

6582
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
yeah right so this goes back to
 

6583
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,149
yeah right so this goes back to
technological determinism i mean this is

6584
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
technological determinism i mean this is
 

6585
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,910
technological determinism i mean this is
a weird business book because i go deep

6586
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
a weird business book because i go deep
 

6587
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:34,870
a weird business book because i go deep
on

6588
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:34,880
on
 

6589
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,950
on
philosophy i go deep on for some reason

6590
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:36,960
philosophy i go deep on for some reason
 

6591
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:38,629
philosophy i go deep on for some reason
we get into paleoanthropology for a

6592
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
we get into paleoanthropology for a
 

6593
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,390
we get into paleoanthropology for a
while we do a lot of neuroscience it's

6594
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:40,400
while we do a lot of neuroscience it's
 

6595
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:41,669
while we do a lot of neuroscience it's
kind of a weird book

6596
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:41,679
kind of a weird book
 

6597
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,189
kind of a weird book
uh but i got real into this

6598
01:38:43,189 --> 01:38:43,199
uh but i got real into this
 

6599
01:38:43,199 --> 01:38:44,870
uh but i got real into this
technological determinism right this

6600
01:38:44,870 --> 01:38:44,880
technological determinism right this
 

6601
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:46,229
technological determinism right this
notion that just the presence of a

6602
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:46,239
notion that just the presence of a
 

6603
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:48,550
notion that just the presence of a
technology can change how people act

6604
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:48,560
technology can change how people act
 

6605
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:49,910
technology can change how people act
that's my big argument about what

6606
01:38:49,910 --> 01:38:49,920
that's my big argument about what
 

6607
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,510
that's my big argument about what
happened with the hive mind and i can

6608
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:51,520
happened with the hive mind and i can
 

6609
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,870
happened with the hive mind and i can
document

6610
01:38:52,870 --> 01:38:52,880
document
 

6611
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,709
document
specific examples right so i document

6612
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:54,719
specific examples right so i document
 

6613
01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:56,830
specific examples right so i document
this example in ibm

6614
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:56,840
this example in ibm
 

6615
01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:00,470
this example in ibm
1987 maybe 85 but it's in like the mid

6616
01:39:00,470 --> 01:39:00,480
1987 maybe 85 but it's in like the mid
 

6617
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:01,750
1987 maybe 85 but it's in like the mid
to late 80s ibm

6618
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:01,760
to late 80s ibm

our monk headquarters we're going to put

6620
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:03,840
our monk headquarters we're going to put
 

6621
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:05,189
our monk headquarters we're going to put
an internal email

6622
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:05,199
an internal email
 

6623
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:08,070
an internal email
right because uh it's convenient and so

6624
01:39:08,070 --> 01:39:08,080
right because uh it's convenient and so
 

6625
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:09,669
right because uh it's convenient and so
they ran a whole study and so i talked

6626
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:09,679
they ran a whole study and so i talked
 

6627
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:10,870
they ran a whole study and so i talked
to the engineer

6628
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
to the engineer
 

6629
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,229
to the engineer
who ran the study adrian stone like

6630
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:12,239
who ran the study adrian stone like
 

6631
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,270
who ran the study adrian stone like
we're going to run this study to figure

6632
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
we're going to run this study to figure
 

6633
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,030
we're going to run this study to figure
out how much do we communicate because

6634
01:39:15,030 --> 01:39:15,040
out how much do we communicate because
 

6635
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:16,310
out how much do we communicate because
it was still an era where

6636
01:39:16,310 --> 01:39:16,320
it was still an era where
 

6637
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,990
it was still an era where
it's expensive right so you have to

6638
01:39:17,990 --> 01:39:18,000
it's expensive right so you have to
 

6639
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,070
it's expensive right so you have to
provision a mainframe so you can't

6640
01:39:20,070 --> 01:39:20,080
provision a mainframe so you can't
 

6641
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,350
provision a mainframe so you can't
over provision like we want to know how

6642
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
over provision like we want to know how
 

6643
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,790
over provision like we want to know how
much communication actually happened so

6644
01:39:22,790 --> 01:39:22,800
much communication actually happened so
 

6645
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:23,990
much communication actually happened so
they went and figured it out

6646
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:24,000
they went and figured it out
 

6647
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,590
they went and figured it out
how many memos how many calls how many

6648
01:39:25,590 --> 01:39:25,600
how many memos how many calls how many
 

6649
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,910
how many memos how many calls how many
notes great we'll provision a mainframe

6650
01:39:27,910 --> 01:39:27,920
notes great we'll provision a mainframe
 

6651
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:29,510
notes great we'll provision a mainframe
to handle email that can handle all of

6652
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
to handle email that can handle all of
 

6653
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,310
to handle email that can handle all of
that so if

6654
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:30,320
that so if
 

6655
01:39:30,320 --> 01:39:32,390
that so if
all of our communication moves to email

6656
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
all of our communication moves to email
 

6657
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:33,990
all of our communication moves to email
the mainframe will still be fine

6658
01:39:33,990 --> 01:39:34,000
the mainframe will still be fine
 

6659
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,830
the mainframe will still be fine
in three days they had melted it down

6660
01:39:35,830 --> 01:39:35,840
in three days they had melted it down
 

6661
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,550
in three days they had melted it down
people were communicating six times more

6662
01:39:38,550 --> 01:39:38,560
people were communicating six times more
 

6663
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:41,109
people were communicating six times more
than that estimate so just in three days

6664
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:41,119
than that estimate so just in three days
 

6665
01:39:41,119 --> 01:39:42,790
than that estimate so just in three days
the presence of a low friction digital

6666
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
the presence of a low friction digital
 

6667
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:44,310
the presence of a low friction digital
communication tool

6668
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:44,320
communication tool
 

6669
01:39:44,320 --> 01:39:45,750
communication tool
drastically changed how everyone

6670
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:45,760
drastically changed how everyone
 

6671
01:39:45,760 --> 01:39:47,350
drastically changed how everyone
collaborated so that's not enough time

6672
01:39:47,350 --> 01:39:47,360
collaborated so that's not enough time
 

6673
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:47,830
collaborated so that's not enough time
for

6674
01:39:47,830 --> 01:39:47,840
for
 

6675
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,830
for
you know an all hands meeting guys we

6676
01:39:49,830 --> 01:39:49,840
you know an all hands meeting guys we
 

6677
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,430
you know an all hands meeting guys we
figured it out you know this is what

6678
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,440
figured it out you know this is what
 

6679
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:52,709
figured it out you know this is what
we need to communicate a lot more is

6680
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:52,719
we need to communicate a lot more is
 

6681
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,229
we need to communicate a lot more is
what's going to make us uh more

6682
01:39:54,229 --> 01:39:54,239
what's going to make us uh more
 

6683
01:39:54,239 --> 01:39:55,830
what's going to make us uh more
productive we need more emails it's

6684
01:39:55,830 --> 01:39:55,840
productive we need more emails it's
 

6685
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,350
productive we need more emails it's
emergent

6686
01:39:57,350 --> 01:39:57,360
emergent
 

6687
01:39:57,360 --> 01:39:59,590
emergent
isn't that just on the positive end

6688
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
isn't that just on the positive end
 

6689
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:00,629
isn't that just on the positive end
amazing to you

6690

like is isn't email amazing like in
 

6693
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:04,629
like is isn't email amazing like in
those early days

6694
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:04,639
those early days
 

6695
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,950
those early days
like just the frictionless communication

6696
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
like just the frictionless communication
 

6697
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,070
like just the frictionless communication
i mean

6698
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
i mean
 

6699
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:11,189
i mean
email is awesome like the people say

6700
01:40:11,189 --> 01:40:11,199
email is awesome like the people say
 

6701
01:40:11,199 --> 01:40:12,550
email is awesome like the people say
that there's a lot of problems with

6702
01:40:12,550 --> 01:40:12,560
that there's a lot of problems with
 

6703
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,229
that there's a lot of problems with
emails just like people say a lot of

problems with twitter and so on

6706
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:15,600
problems with twitter and so on
 

6707
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,510
problems with twitter and so on
it's kind of cool that you can just send

6708
01:40:17,510 --> 01:40:17,520
it's kind of cool that you can just send
 

6709
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:19,189
it's kind of cool that you can just send
a little note it was a miracle

6710
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
a little note it was a miracle
 

6711
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:22,229
a little note it was a miracle
right so i i so i i wrote a there's

6712
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
right so i i so i i wrote a there's
 

6713
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,669
right so i i so i i wrote a there's
originally was a new yorker piece

6714
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:23,679
originally was a new yorker piece
 

6715
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,350
originally was a new yorker piece
from a year or two ago called was email

6716
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:25,360
from a year or two ago called was email
 

6717
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:27,669
from a year or two ago called was email
a mistake and then it's in the book too

6718
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:27,679
a mistake and then it's in the book too
 

6719
01:40:27,679 --> 01:40:31,030
a mistake and then it's in the book too
yeah but i go into the history of email

6720
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
yeah but i go into the history of email
 

6721
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,550
yeah but i go into the history of email
like why did it come along

6722
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:32,560
like why did it come along
 

6723
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:34,790
like why did it come along
and it solved a huge problem so it was

6724
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
and it solved a huge problem so it was
 

6725
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:36,550
and it solved a huge problem so it was
the problem of fast asynchronous

6726
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:36,560
the problem of fast asynchronous
 

6727
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,669
the problem of fast asynchronous
communication yeah

6728
01:40:37,669 --> 01:40:37,679
communication yeah
 

6729
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:39,270
communication yeah
and it was a problem did not exist until

6730
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
and it was a problem did not exist until
 

6731
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,790
and it was a problem did not exist until
we got large offices

6732
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
we got large offices
 

6733
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,629
we got large offices
and we got large offices synchronous

6734
01:40:42,629 --> 01:40:42,639
and we got large offices synchronous
 

6735
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:43,830
and we got large offices synchronous
communication like let's get on the

6736
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:43,840
communication like let's get on the
 

6737
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,109
communication like let's get on the
phone at the same time there's too much

6738
01:40:45,109 --> 01:40:45,119
phone at the same time there's too much
 

6739
01:40:45,119 --> 01:40:46,390
phone at the same time there's too much
overhead to it there's too many people

6740
01:40:46,390 --> 01:40:46,400
overhead to it there's too many people
 

6741
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:47,910
overhead to it there's too many people
you might have to talk to

6742
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:47,920
you might have to talk to
 

6743
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:49,430
you might have to talk to
asynchronous communication like let me

6744
01:40:49,430 --> 01:40:49,440
asynchronous communication like let me
 

6745
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:51,189
asynchronous communication like let me
send you a memo when i'm ready and you

6746
01:40:51,189 --> 01:40:51,199
send you a memo when i'm ready and you
 

6747
01:40:51,199 --> 01:40:52,470
send you a memo when i'm ready and you
can read it when you're ready

6748
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
can read it when you're ready
 

6749
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,470
can read it when you're ready
took too long and so it was like a huge

6750
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,480
took too long and so it was like a huge
 

6751
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,750
took too long and so it was like a huge
problem so one of the things i talked

6752
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:55,760
problem so one of the things i talked
 

6753
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,030
problem so one of the things i talked
about is the way that when they built

6754
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:57,040
about is the way that when they built
 

6755
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:57,590
about is the way that when they built
the

6756
01:40:57,590 --> 01:40:57,600
the
 

6757
01:40:57,600 --> 01:40:59,830
the
cia headquarters there was such a need

6758
01:40:59,830 --> 01:40:59,840
cia headquarters there was such a need
 

6759
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,910
cia headquarters there was such a need
for fast asynchronous communication

6760
01:41:01,910 --> 01:41:01,920
for fast asynchronous communication
 

6761
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:04,149
for fast asynchronous communication
that they built a pneumatic-powered

6762
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
that they built a pneumatic-powered
 

6763
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:05,830
that they built a pneumatic-powered
email system they had these pneumatic

6764
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:05,840
email system they had these pneumatic
 

6765
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:07,510
email system they had these pneumatic
tubes all throughout the headquarters

6766
01:41:07,510 --> 01:41:07,520
tubes all throughout the headquarters
 

6767
01:41:07,520 --> 01:41:09,430
tubes all throughout the headquarters
with electromagnetic routers

6768
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
with electromagnetic routers
 

6769
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,350
with electromagnetic routers
so you would put your message in a

6770
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
so you would put your message in a
 

6771
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,430
so you would put your message in a
plexiglass tube and you would turn these

6772
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
plexiglass tube and you would turn these
 

6773
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,270
plexiglass tube and you would turn these
brass dials about the location you would

6774
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
brass dials about the location you would
 

6775
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,790
brass dials about the location you would
stick it in these things and pneumatic

6776
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
stick it in these things and pneumatic
 

6777
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:17,990
stick it in these things and pneumatic
tubes and it would shoot and

6778
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
tubes and it would shoot and
 

6779
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,830
tubes and it would shoot and
sort and work its way through these

6780
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
sort and work its way through these
 

6781
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,990
sort and work its way through these
tubes to show up in just a minute or

6782
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:22,000
tubes to show up in just a minute or
 

6783
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,950
tubes to show up in just a minute or
something

6784
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:22,960
something
 

6785
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:24,470
something
at the floor and at the general office

6786
01:41:24,470 --> 01:41:24,480
at the floor and at the general office
 

6787
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:26,070
at the floor and at the general office
suite where you wanted to go and my

6788
01:41:26,070 --> 01:41:26,080
suite where you wanted to go and my
 

6789
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,430
suite where you wanted to go and my
point is the fact that they spent so

6790
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:27,440
point is the fact that they spent so
 

6791
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:27,830
point is the fact that they spent so
much

6792
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:27,840
much
 

6793
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,510
much
money to make that work show how

6794
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:29,520
money to make that work show how
 

6795
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:30,870
money to make that work show how
important

6796
01:41:30,870 --> 01:41:30,880
important
 

6797
01:41:30,880 --> 01:41:32,310
important
fast asynchronous communication was

6798
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,320
fast asynchronous communication was
 

6799
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:34,790
fast asynchronous communication was
large offices so when email came along

6800
01:41:34,790 --> 01:41:34,800
large offices so when email came along
 

6801
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:37,030
large offices so when email came along
it was a productivity silver bullet it

6802
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
it was a productivity silver bullet it
 

6803
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,070
it was a productivity silver bullet it
was a miracle i talked to the

6804
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,080
was a miracle i talked to the
 

6805
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,750
was a miracle i talked to the
researchers who were working on

6806

the late 80s trying to figure out how
 

6811
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:43,990
the late 80s trying to figure out how
are we going to use computer networks to

6812
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
are we going to use computer networks to
 

6813
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,109
are we going to use computer networks to
be more productive and they were

6814
01:41:45,109 --> 01:41:45,119
be more productive and they were
 

6815
01:41:45,119 --> 01:41:47,030
be more productive and they were
building all these systems and tools

6816
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
building all these systems and tools
 

6817
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,950
building all these systems and tools
email showed up it just wiped all that

6818
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:48,960
email showed up it just wiped all that
 

6819
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:50,070

research off the map
 

6821
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,990
research off the map
there was no need to build these custom

6822
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
there was no need to build these custom
 

6823
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,910
there was no need to build these custom
intranet applications there was no need

6824
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
intranet applications there was no need
 

6825
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,669

to build these these communication
 

6827
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,189
to build these these communication
platforms email could just do

6828
01:41:57,189 --> 01:41:57,199
platforms email could just do
 

6829
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:59,590
platforms email could just do
everything yeah right so it was a

6830
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
everything yeah right so it was a
 

6831
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,189
everything yeah right so it was a
miracle application which is why it's

6832
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
miracle application which is why it's
 

6833
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:01,669
miracle application which is why it's
spread

6834
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:01,679
spread
 

6835
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,510
spread
everywhere that's one of these things

6836
01:42:03,510 --> 01:42:03,520
everywhere that's one of these things
 

6837
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,510
everywhere that's one of these things
where okay unintended consequences right

6838
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
where okay unintended consequences right
 

6839
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,270
where okay unintended consequences right
you had this miracle productivity silver

6840
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:07,280
you had this miracle productivity silver
 

6841
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:08,950
you had this miracle productivity silver
bullet it spread everywhere

6842
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
bullet it spread everywhere
 

6843
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,350
bullet it spread everywhere
but it was so effective it just you know

6844
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,360
but it was so effective it just you know
 

6845
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,550
but it was so effective it just you know
i don't know like a drug i'm sure

that like is so effective at treating

6852
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:17,840
that like is so effective at treating
 

6853
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,109
that like is so effective at treating
this that it also blows up your whole

01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:19,119
this that it also blows up your whole
 

6855
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:20,390
this that it also blows up your whole
immune system and then everyone gets

6856
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:20,400
immune system and then everyone gets
 

6857
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,750
immune system and then everyone gets
sick but well ultimately

6858

01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
it probably significantly increased the
 

6861
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:25,030
it probably significantly increased the
productivity of the world but there's a

6862
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:25,040
productivity of the world but there's a
 

6863
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:25,910
productivity of the world but there's a
kind of hump

6864
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:25,920
kind of hump
 

6865
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:29,510
kind of hump
that it now has plateaued and then we're

6866
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:29,520
that it now has plateaued and then we're
 

6867
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:30,950
that it now has plateaued and then we're
the the fundamental question you're

6868
01:42:30,950 --> 01:42:30,960
the the fundamental question you're
 

6869
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,030
the the fundamental question you're
asking is like okay how do we take the

6870
01:42:33,030 --> 01:42:33,040
asking is like okay how do we take the
 

6871
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:33,590
asking is like okay how do we take the
next

6872
01:42:33,590 --> 01:42:33,600
next
 

6873
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:34,629
next
how do we keep increasing the

6874
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:34,639
how do we keep increasing the
 

6875
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:36,310
how do we keep increasing the
productivity yeah no i think it brought

6876
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
productivity yeah no i think it brought
 

6877
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:37,109
productivity yeah no i think it brought
it down so

6878
01:42:37,109 --> 01:42:37,119
it down so
 

6879
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,470
it down so
my think so my contention and uh

6880
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480
my think so my contention and uh
 

6881
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:41,830
my think so my contention and uh
so again there's a little in the book

6882
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:41,840
so again there's a little in the book
 

6883
01:42:41,840 --> 01:42:43,990
so again there's a little in the book
but i have a more recent wired article

6884
01:42:43,990 --> 01:42:44,000
but i have a more recent wired article
 

6885
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,109
but i have a more recent wired article
that puts some newer numbers to this i

6886
01:42:47,109 --> 01:42:47,119
that puts some newer numbers to this i
 

6887
01:42:47,119 --> 01:42:48,790
that puts some newer numbers to this i
subscribe to the hypothesis that the

6888
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
subscribe to the hypothesis that the
 

6889
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:51,350
subscribe to the hypothesis that the
hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental

6890
01:42:51,350 --> 01:42:51,360
hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental
 

6891
01:42:51,360 --> 01:42:53,430
hyperactive hive mind was so detrimental
so yeah it helped productivity at first

6892
01:42:53,430 --> 01:42:53,440
so yeah it helped productivity at first
 

6893
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:54,870
so yeah it helped productivity at first
right when you could

6894
01:42:54,870 --> 01:42:54,880
right when you could
 

6895
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:56,629
right when you could
do fast asynchronous communication but

6896
01:42:56,629 --> 01:42:56,639
do fast asynchronous communication but
 

6897
01:42:56,639 --> 01:42:57,990
do fast asynchronous communication but
very quickly there was a sort of

6898
01:42:57,990 --> 01:42:58,000
very quickly there was a sort of
 

6899
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,189
very quickly there was a sort of
exponential rise in

6900
01:42:59,189 --> 01:42:59,199
exponential rise in
 

6901
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,510
exponential rise in
communication amounts once we got to the

6902
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:01,520
communication amounts once we got to the
 

6903
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:02,790
communication amounts once we got to the
point where the hive mind meant you had

6904
01:43:02,790 --> 01:43:02,800
point where the hive mind meant you had
 

6905
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,470
point where the hive mind meant you had
to constantly check your email i think

6906
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:04,480
to constantly check your email i think
 

6907
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,709
to constantly check your email i think
that made us so unproductive

6908
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:06,719
that made us so unproductive
 

6909
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,070
that made us so unproductive
that it actually was pulling down

6910
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:08,080
that it actually was pulling down
 

6911
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,590
that it actually was pulling down
non-industrial productivity and i think

6912
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:09,600
non-industrial productivity and i think
 

6913
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:09,990
non-industrial productivity and i think
the only

6914
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:10,000
the only
 

6915
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,070
the only
reason why so it certainly has not been

6916
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:12,080
reason why so it certainly has not been
 

6917
01:43:12,080 --> 01:43:14,070
reason why so it certainly has not been
going up that metric's been stagnating

6918
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:14,080
going up that metric's been stagnating
 

6919
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,750
going up that metric's been stagnating
for a long time now while all this was

6920
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
for a long time now while all this was
 

6921
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:16,709
for a long time now while all this was
going on

6922
01:43:16,709 --> 01:43:16,719
going on
 

6923
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:18,070
going on
i think the only reason why it hasn't

6924
01:43:18,070 --> 01:43:18,080
i think the only reason why it hasn't
 

6925
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:20,229
i think the only reason why it hasn't
fallen is that we added these

6926
01:43:20,229 --> 01:43:20,239
fallen is that we added these
 

6927
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,629
fallen is that we added these
extra shifts off the books i'm going to

6928
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:22,639
extra shifts off the books i'm going to
 

6929
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:23,830

work for three hours in the morning i'm

6930
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:23,840
work for three hours in the morning i'm
 

6931

work for three hours in the morning i'm
gonna work for three hours at night and

01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
gonna work for three hours at night and
 

6933
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:27,430
gonna work for three hours at night and
only that i think has allowed us to

6934
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:27,440
only that i think has allowed us to
 

6935
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:28,629
only that i think has allowed us to
basically

6936
01:43:28,629 --> 01:43:28,639
basically
 

6937
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,109
basically
maintain a stagnated non-industrial

6938
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
maintain a stagnated non-industrial
 

6939

it's fundamentally back to the context

it's fundamentally back to the context
 

6965
01:43:50,880 --> 01:43:52,070
it's fundamentally back to the context
switching is the

6966

01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:54,550
switching is the
poison in context switching is poison

6968
01:43:54,550 --> 01:43:54,560

it's the

01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:57,430
it's the
what what is it about email that forces

what what is it about email that forces
 

6973
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,709
what what is it about email that forces
context switching is it both our

context switching is it both our

6977
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,149

drags us in yeah or is it expectation

6978
01:44:02,149 --> 01:44:02,159
drags us in yeah or is it expectation
 

6979
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:03,669
drags us in yeah or is it expectation
yeah right right because it's not

6980
01:44:03,669 --> 01:44:03,679
yeah right right because it's not
 

6981
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:04,830
yeah right right because it's not
i think we've seen this through a

01:44:04,830 --> 01:44:04,840
i think we've seen this through a

01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
lens recently like oh am i addicted to
 

6987
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:11,270

email yes

6988
01:44:11,270 --> 01:44:11,280
email yes
 

6989
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,910

uh i have bad etiquette about my email

6990
01:44:13,910 --> 01:44:13,920
uh i have bad etiquette about my email
 

6991
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:15,910
uh i have bad etiquette about my email
no it's the underlying workflow

6992
01:44:15,910 --> 01:44:15,920
no it's the underlying workflow
 

6993
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:18,950
no it's the underlying workflow
so the tool itself i will exonerate

6994
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960
so the tool itself i will exonerate
 

6995
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:21,510
so the tool itself i will exonerate
right i think i would rather use pop3

6996
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:21,520
right i think i would rather use pop3
 

6997
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,189
right i think i would rather use pop3
than a fax protocol

6998
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
than a fax protocol
 

6999
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,270
than a fax protocol
right i think it's easier the issue is

7000
01:44:25,270 --> 01:44:25,280
right i think it's easier the issue is
 

7001
01:44:25,280 --> 01:44:26,870
right i think it's easier the issue is
the hyperactive hivemind workflow

so if i am now collaborating with 20 or

7004
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
so if i am now collaborating with 20 or
 

7005
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,709
so if i am now collaborating with 20 or
30 different people

right it's like you have 30 metaphorical

7014
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:37,199
right it's like you have 30 metaphorical
 

7015
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:38,709
right it's like you have 30 metaphorical
ping pong tables and when the balls come

7016
01:44:38,709 --> 01:44:38,719
ping pong tables and when the balls come
 

7017
01:44:38,719 --> 01:44:40,229
ping pong tables and when the balls come
back across you have to pretty soon hit

7018
01:44:40,229 --> 01:44:40,239
back across you have to pretty soon hit
 

7019
01:44:40,239 --> 01:44:41,030
back across you have to pretty soon hit
it back

7020
01:44:41,030 --> 01:44:41,040
it back
 

7021
01:44:41,040 --> 01:44:43,430
it back
or stuff actually grinds to a halt so

7022
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,440
or stuff actually grinds to a halt so
 

7023
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,790
or stuff actually grinds to a halt so
it's not it's the workflow that's the

7024
01:44:44,790 --> 01:44:44,800
it's not it's the workflow that's the
 

7025
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,350
it's not it's the workflow that's the
problem

7026
01:44:45,350 --> 01:44:45,360
problem
 

7027
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:46,790
problem
it's not the tools the fact that we use

7028
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
it's not the tools the fact that we use
 

7029
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,390
it's not the tools the fact that we use
it to do all of our collaboration let's

7030
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
it to do all of our collaboration let's
 

7031
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,830
it to do all of our collaboration let's
just send messages back and forth which

7032
01:44:49,830 --> 01:44:49,840
just send messages back and forth which
 

7033
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:50,950
just send messages back and forth which
means you can't be

7034
01:44:50,950 --> 01:44:50,960
means you can't be
 

7035
01:44:50,960 --> 01:44:53,350
means you can't be
far from checking that because if you

7036
01:44:53,350 --> 01:44:53,360
far from checking that because if you
 

7037
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:55,109
far from checking that because if you
take a break if you batch if you try to

7038
01:44:55,109 --> 01:44:55,119
take a break if you batch if you try to
 

7039
01:44:55,119 --> 01:44:56,629
take a break if you batch if you try to
have better habits

7040
01:44:56,629 --> 01:44:56,639
have better habits
 

7041
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,109
have better habits
it's going to slow things down so my

7042
01:44:59,109 --> 01:44:59,119
it's going to slow things down so my
 

7043
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:00,709
it's going to slow things down so my
whole villain is this hyperactive hive

7044
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
whole villain is this hyperactive hive

the tool is fine i don't want the tool

7048
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,000
the tool is fine i don't want the tool
 

7049
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,070
the tool is fine i don't want the tool
to go away but i want to replace the

7050
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
to go away but i want to replace the
 

7051
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,590
to go away but i want to replace the
hyperactive my workflow i think this is

7052
01:45:07,590 --> 01:45:07,600
hyperactive my workflow i think this is
 

7053
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:08,149
hyperactive my workflow i think this is
going to be

7054
01:45:08,149 --> 01:45:08,159
going to be
 

7055
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,950
going to be
one of the biggest value generating

7056
01:45:10,950 --> 01:45:10,960
one of the biggest value generating
 

7057

of the 21st century is going to be of
 

7067
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:21,510
of the 21st century is going to be of
that importance there's so much

7068
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:21,520
that importance there's so much
 

7069
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,750
that importance there's so much
latent productivity that's being

7070
01:45:23,750 --> 01:45:23,760
latent productivity that's being
 

7071
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,189
latent productivity that's being
suppressed because we just figure things

7072
01:45:25,189 --> 01:45:25,199
suppressed because we just figure things
 

7073
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:26,870
suppressed because we just figure things
out on the fly in email that as we

7074
01:45:26,870 --> 01:45:26,880
out on the fly in email that as we
 

7075
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:29,990
out on the fly in email that as we
figure that out i think it's going to be

7076
01:45:29,990 --> 01:45:30,000
figure that out i think it's going to be
 

7077
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:32,709
figure that out i think it's going to be
hundreds of billions of dollars you're

7078
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:32,719
hundreds of billions of dollars you're
 

7079
01:45:32,719 --> 01:45:33,590
hundreds of billions of dollars you're
so

7080
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:33,600
so
 

7081
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,950
so
absolutely right the question is

7082
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960
absolutely right the question is
 

7083
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:38,629
absolutely right the question is
what is the world without email look

7084
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
what is the world without email look
 

7085
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,709

take each of these processes and say is

7128
01:46:12,870 --> 01:46:12,880
take each of these processes and say is
 

7129
01:46:12,880 --> 01:46:14,709
take each of these processes and say is
there a better way to do this

i don't have to just send you a message
 

7165
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,910
i don't have to just send you a message
on the fly and you do this

7166

on the fly and you do this
 

7167
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:43,830
on the fly and you do this
process by process and the pressure on

7168

01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:54,709
collaborating over email or slack which
is just a faster way of doing the hive

7184
01:46:54,709 --> 01:46:54,719
is just a faster way of doing the hive
 

7185
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:56,070
is just a faster way of doing the hive
mind i mean the slack doesn't solve

7186
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:56,080
mind i mean the slack doesn't solve
 

7187
01:46:56,080 --> 01:46:57,109
mind i mean the slack doesn't solve
anything there

7188
01:46:57,109 --> 01:46:57,119
anything there
 

7189
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,669
anything there
uh you have better structured bespoke

7190
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
uh you have better structured bespoke
 

7191
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:00,950
uh you have better structured bespoke
processes i think that's what's going to

7192
01:47:00,950 --> 01:47:00,960
processes i think that's what's going to
 

7193
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:01,590
processes i think that's what's going to
unleash

7194
01:47:01,590 --> 01:47:01,600
unleash
 

7195
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,229
unleash
this massive productivity bespoke so the

7196
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:04,239
this massive productivity bespoke so the
 

7197
01:47:04,239 --> 01:47:05,510
this massive productivity bespoke so the
interesting thing is like

7198
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:05,520
interesting thing is like
 

7199
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:06,790
interesting thing is like
for example you and i exchanged some

7200
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:06,800
for example you and i exchanged some
 

7201
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,629
for example you and i exchanged some
emails so obviously i

7202
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
emails so obviously i
 

7203
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,790
emails so obviously i
uh for let's just say my particular case

7204
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
uh for let's just say my particular case
 

7205
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,310
uh for let's just say my particular case
i schedule podcasts there's a bunch of

7206
01:47:12,310 --> 01:47:12,320
i schedule podcasts there's a bunch of
 

7207
01:47:12,320 --> 01:47:13,910
i schedule podcasts there's a bunch of
different tasks

7208
01:47:13,910 --> 01:47:13,920
different tasks
 

7209
01:47:13,920 --> 01:47:16,629
different tasks
fascinatingly enough that i do that

7210
01:47:16,629 --> 01:47:16,639
fascinatingly enough that i do that
 

7211
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:18,310
fascinatingly enough that i do that
could be converted into processes

7212
01:47:18,310 --> 01:47:18,320
could be converted into processes
 

7213
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,109
could be converted into processes
yeah is it up to me to create that

7214
01:47:21,109 --> 01:47:21,119
yeah is it up to me to create that
 

7215
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:21,669
yeah is it up to me to create that
process

7216
01:47:21,669 --> 01:47:21,679
process
 

7217
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:23,189
process
or do you think we also need to build

7218
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:23,199
or do you think we also need to build
 

7219
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,109
or do you think we also need to build
tools just like email was

7220
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:25,119
tools just like email was
 

7221
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:28,390
tools just like email was
a protocol for uh helping us

7222
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
a protocol for uh helping us
 

7223
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,950
a protocol for uh helping us
create proxy for the different tasks i

7224
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:30,960
create proxy for the different tasks i
 

7225
01:47:30,960 --> 01:47:33,189
create proxy for the different tasks i
mean i think ultimately

7226
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199
mean i think ultimately
 

7227
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:34,550
mean i think ultimately
the whole organization the whole team

7228
01:47:34,550 --> 01:47:34,560
the whole organization the whole team
 

7229
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:36,229
the whole organization the whole team
has to be involved i think ultimately

7230
01:47:36,229 --> 01:47:36,239
has to be involved i think ultimately
 

7231
01:47:36,239 --> 01:47:37,430
has to be involved i think ultimately
there's certainly a lot of investor

7232
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:37,440
there's certainly a lot of investor
 

7233
01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:38,709
there's certainly a lot of investor
money being spent right now to try to

7234
01:47:38,709 --> 01:47:38,719
money being spent right now to try to
 

7235
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,149
money being spent right now to try to
figure out those tools

7236
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
figure out those tools
 

7237
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:41,510
figure out those tools
right so i think silicon valley has

7238
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
right so i think silicon valley has
 

7239
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:42,709
right so i think silicon valley has
figured this out in the past couple of

7240
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
figured this out in the past couple of
 

7241
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:44,870
figured this out in the past couple of
years this is the difference between

7242
01:47:44,870 --> 01:47:44,880
years this is the difference between
 

7243
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:46,470
years this is the difference between
when i was talking to people after deep

7244
01:47:46,470 --> 01:47:46,480
when i was talking to people after deep
 

7245
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:49,189
when i was talking to people after deep
work and now five years later

7246
01:47:49,189 --> 01:47:49,199
work and now five years later
 

7247
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:51,510
work and now five years later
is this scent is in the air right

7248
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
is this scent is in the air right
 

7249
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,629
is this scent is in the air right
because there's so much latent

7250
01:47:52,629 --> 01:47:52,639
because there's so much latent
 

7251
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:53,910
because there's so much latent
productivity so yes there are going to

7252
01:47:53,910 --> 01:47:53,920
productivity so yes there are going to
 

7253
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,590
productivity so yes there are going to
be new tools which i think could help

7254
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,600
be new tools which i think could help
 

7255
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,189
be new tools which i think could help
they're already tools that exist i mean

7256
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
they're already tools that exist i mean
 

7257
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:57,990
they're already tools that exist i mean

things like trello or basecamp or
 

7263
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,109
things like trello or basecamp or
asana or flow and you know our schedule

01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:21,920
might help us do that yeah and i would
 

7283

some of these things are going to take

7288
01:48:25,510 --> 01:48:25,520
some of these things are going to take
 

7289
01:48:25,520 --> 01:48:27,830
some of these things are going to take
more time so writing a letter to someone

7290
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:27,840
more time so writing a letter to someone
 

7291
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,870
more time so writing a letter to someone
is like a

7292
01:48:28,870 --> 01:48:28,880
is like a
 

7293
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:30,229
is like a
high value activity is probably worth

7294
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:30,239
high value activity is probably worth
 

7295
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:32,310
high value activity is probably worth
doing the thing that's killer is the

7296
01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:32,320
doing the thing that's killer is the
 

7297
01:48:32,320 --> 01:48:33,350
doing the thing that's killer is the
back and forth

7298
01:48:33,350 --> 01:48:33,360
back and forth
 

7299
01:48:33,360 --> 01:48:34,870
back and forth
because now i have to keep checking

7300
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:34,880
because now i have to keep checking
 

7301
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,629
because now i have to keep checking
right so we scheduled this together

7302
01:48:36,629 --> 01:48:36,639
right so we scheduled this together
 

7303
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:37,430
right so we scheduled this together
because i

7304
01:48:37,430 --> 01:48:37,440
because i
 

7305
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,189
because i
knew you from before but like most of

7306
01:48:39,189 --> 01:48:39,199
knew you from before but like most of
 

7307
01:48:39,199 --> 01:48:41,109
knew you from before but like most of
the the interviews i was scheduling for

7308
01:48:41,109 --> 01:48:41,119
the the interviews i was scheduling for
 

7309
01:48:41,119 --> 01:48:41,430
the the interviews i was scheduling for
this

7310
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:41,440
this
 

7311
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:43,189
this
actually i have a process with my

7312
01:48:43,189 --> 01:48:43,199
actually i have a process with my
 

7313
01:48:43,199 --> 01:48:45,189
actually i have a process with my
publicist where we use a shared document

7314
01:48:45,189 --> 01:48:45,199
publicist where we use a shared document
 

7315
01:48:45,199 --> 01:48:46,629
publicist where we use a shared document
and she puts stuff in there and then i

7316
01:48:46,629 --> 01:48:46,639
and she puts stuff in there and then i
 

7317
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,470
and she puts stuff in there and then i
check it twice a week and

7318
01:48:48,470 --> 01:48:48,480
check it twice a week and
 

7319
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,149
check it twice a week and
there's scheduling options and i say

7320
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:50,159
there's scheduling options and i say
 

7321
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,189
there's scheduling options and i say
here's what i want to do this one or

7322
01:48:51,189 --> 01:48:51,199
here's what i want to do this one or
 

7323
01:48:51,199 --> 01:48:52,709
here's what i want to do this one or
this will work for this one or whatever

7324
01:48:52,709 --> 01:48:52,719
this will work for this one or whatever
 

7325
01:48:52,719 --> 01:48:54,470
this will work for this one or whatever
and it takes more time in the moment

7326
01:48:54,470 --> 01:48:54,480
and it takes more time in the moment
 

7327
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,229
and it takes more time in the moment
than just but it means that we have

7328
01:48:56,229 --> 01:48:56,239
than just but it means that we have
 

7329
01:48:56,239 --> 01:48:58,709
than just but it means that we have
almost no back and forth messaging for

7330
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:58,719
almost no back and forth messaging for
 

7331
01:48:58,719 --> 01:48:59,990
almost no back and forth messaging for
podcast scheduling which without

7332
01:48:59,990 --> 01:49:00,000
podcast scheduling which without
 

7333
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:02,470
podcast scheduling which without
this so like with my uk publisher i

7334
01:49:02,470 --> 01:49:02,480
this so like with my uk publisher i
 

7335
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:03,750
this so like with my uk publisher i
didn't put this process into place

7336
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:03,760
didn't put this process into place
 

7337
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:04,709
didn't put this process into place
because we're not

7338
01:49:04,709 --> 01:49:04,719
because we're not
 

7339
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:06,790
because we're not
doing as many interviews but it's all

7340
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:06,800
doing as many interviews but it's all
 

7341
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,550
doing as many interviews but it's all
the time and i'm like oh man i could

7342
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:08,560
the time and i'm like oh man i could
 

7343
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,149
the time and i'm like oh man i could
really feel the difference right it's

7344
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:10,159
really feel the difference right it's
 

7345
01:49:10,159 --> 01:49:11,750
really feel the difference right it's
the back and forth that's killer i

7346
01:49:11,750 --> 01:49:11,760
the back and forth that's killer i
 

7347
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:13,669
the back and forth that's killer i
suppose it is up to

7348
01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
suppose it is up to
 

7349
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:15,270
suppose it is up to
the individual people involved like you

7350
01:49:15,270 --> 01:49:15,280
the individual people involved like you
 

7351
01:49:15,280 --> 01:49:16,870
the individual people involved like you
said uh

7352
01:49:16,870 --> 01:49:16,880
said uh
 

7353
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,870
said uh
knowledge workers like they have to

7354
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
knowledge workers like they have to
 

7355
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,950
knowledge workers like they have to
carry the responsibility

7356
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
carry the responsibility
 

7357
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,990
carry the responsibility
of uh creating processes like how

7358
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,000
of uh creating processes like how
 

7359
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:25,510
of uh creating processes like how
always asking the first principles

7360
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,520
always asking the first principles
 

7361
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:27,030
always asking the first principles
question how could this be converted

7362
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
question how could this be converted
 

7363
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:28,229
question how could this be converted
into a process

7364
01:49:28,229 --> 01:49:28,239
into a process
 

7365
01:49:28,239 --> 01:49:29,669
into a process
yeah so you can start by doing this

7366
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:29,679
yeah so you can start by doing this
 

7367
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:31,750
yeah so you can start by doing this
yourself like just with what you can

7368
01:49:31,750 --> 01:49:31,760
yourself like just with what you can
 

7369
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,629
yourself like just with what you can
control

7370
01:49:32,629 --> 01:49:32,639
control
 

7371
01:49:32,639 --> 01:49:34,470
control
i think ultimately once the team teams

7372
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:34,480
i think ultimately once the team teams
 

7373
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,510
i think ultimately once the team teams
are doing that i think that's probably

7374
01:49:35,510 --> 01:49:35,520
are doing that i think that's probably
 

7375
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:36,310
are doing that i think that's probably
the right scale

7376
01:49:36,310 --> 01:49:36,320
the right scale
 

7377
01:49:36,320 --> 01:49:37,270
the right scale
if you try to do this at the

7378
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,280
if you try to do this at the
 

7379
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:38,470
if you try to do this at the
organizational scale you're going to get

7380
01:49:38,470 --> 01:49:38,480
organizational scale you're going to get
 

7381
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:39,750
organizational scale you're going to get
bureaucracy right

7382
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
bureaucracy right
 

7383
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:42,950
bureaucracy right
so if it's exactly right elon musk is

7384
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
so if it's exactly right elon musk is
 

7385
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:43,669
so if it's exactly right elon musk is
going to

7386
01:49:43,669 --> 01:49:43,679
going to
 

7387
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:45,990
going to
dictate down to everyone at tesla or

7388
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:46,000
dictate down to everyone at tesla or
 

7389
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:46,709
dictate down to everyone at tesla or
something like this

7390
01:49:46,709 --> 01:49:46,719
something like this
 

7391
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:47,990
something like this
that's too much remove you get

7392
01:49:47,990 --> 01:49:48,000
that's too much remove you get
 

7393
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,750
that's too much remove you get
bureaucracy but if it's we're a team of

7394
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:49,760
bureaucracy but if it's we're a team of
 

7395
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,870
bureaucracy but if it's we're a team of
six

7396
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
six
 

7397
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:52,870
six
that's working together on you know

7398
01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:52,880
that's working together on you know
 

7399
01:49:52,880 --> 01:49:55,030
that's working together on you know
whatever powertrain software

7400
01:49:55,030 --> 01:49:55,040
whatever powertrain software
 

7401
01:49:55,040 --> 01:49:56,390
whatever powertrain software
then we can figure out on our own what

7402
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:56,400
then we can figure out on our own what
 

7403
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:57,750
then we can figure out on our own what
are our processes how do we want to do

7404
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:57,760
are our processes how do we want to do
 

7405
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:58,070
are our processes how do we want to do
this

7406
01:49:58,070 --> 01:49:58,080
this
 

7407
01:49:58,080 --> 01:49:59,510
this
so it's ultimately also creating a

7408
01:49:59,510 --> 01:49:59,520
so it's ultimately also creating a
 

7409
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:01,910
so it's ultimately also creating a
culture we're saying like in email

7410
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:01,920
culture we're saying like in email
 

7411
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:03,669
culture we're saying like in email
sending an email just for the hell of it

7412
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
sending an email just for the hell of it
 

7413
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,510
sending an email just for the hell of it
it should be taboo like

7414
01:50:05,510 --> 01:50:05,520
it should be taboo like
 

7415
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:08,709
it should be taboo like
so like you are being uh

7416
01:50:08,709 --> 01:50:08,719
so like you are being uh
 

7417
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:09,990
so like you are being uh
you're being destructive to the

7418
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:10,000
you're being destructive to the
 

7419
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,669
you're being destructive to the
productivity of the team by sending this

7420
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:11,679
productivity of the team by sending this
 

7421
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:13,270
productivity of the team by sending this
email yes as opposed to

7422
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:13,280
email yes as opposed to
 

7423
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,470
email yes as opposed to
uh helping develop uh a process and so

7424
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:16,480
uh helping develop uh a process and so
 

7425
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:17,030
uh helping develop uh a process and so
on

7426
01:50:17,030 --> 01:50:17,040
on
 

7427
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:20,310
on
uh that that will ultimately automate

7428
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:20,320
uh that that will ultimately automate
 

7429
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:20,629
uh that that will ultimately automate
this

7430
01:50:20,629 --> 01:50:20,639
this
 

7431
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:21,990
this
that's why i'm trying to spread this

7432
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,000
that's why i'm trying to spread this
 

7433
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,589
that's why i'm trying to spread this
message of the context switches it's

7434
01:50:23,589 --> 01:50:23,599
message of the context switches it's
 

7435
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:25,189
message of the context switches it's
poison i get so much into the science of

7436
01:50:25,189 --> 01:50:25,199
poison i get so much into the science of
 

7437
01:50:25,199 --> 01:50:26,550
poison i get so much into the science of
it i think we underestimate

7438
01:50:26,550 --> 01:50:26,560
it i think we underestimate
 

7439
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,790
it i think we underestimate
how much it kills us they have to wrench

7440
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:28,800
how much it kills us they have to wrench
 

7441
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:30,149
how much it kills us they have to wrench
away our contacts look at a message and

7442
01:50:30,149 --> 01:50:30,159
away our contacts look at a message and
 

7443
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:30,709
away our contacts look at a message and
come back

7444
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
come back
 

7445
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,870
come back
and so once you have the mindset of it's

7446
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:32,880
and so once you have the mindset of it's
 

7447
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,030
and so once you have the mindset of it's
a huge thing to ask of someone

7448
01:50:35,030 --> 01:50:35,040
a huge thing to ask of someone
 

7449
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,709
a huge thing to ask of someone
to have to take their attention off

7450
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
to have to take their attention off
 

7451
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,149
to have to take their attention off
something and look back at this and if

7452
01:50:38,149 --> 01:50:38,159
something and look back at this and if
 

7453
01:50:38,159 --> 01:50:38,950
something and look back at this and if
they have to do that

7454
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:38,960
they have to do that
 

7455
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:40,550
they have to do that
for three or four times like we're just

7456
01:50:40,550 --> 01:50:40,560
for three or four times like we're just
 

7457
01:50:40,560 --> 01:50:41,990
for three or four times like we're just
going to figure this out on the fly

7458
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
going to figure this out on the fly
 

7459
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,430
going to figure this out on the fly
and every message is going to require

7460
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
and every message is going to require
 

7461
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:44,870
and every message is going to require
five checks of the inbox while you wait

7462
01:50:44,870 --> 01:50:44,880
five checks of the inbox while you wait
 

7463
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:45,430
five checks of the inbox while you wait
for it well

7464
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,440
for it well
 

7465
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,189
for it well
now you've created whatever it is at

7466
01:50:47,189 --> 01:50:47,199
now you've created whatever it is at
 

7467
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:49,109
now you've created whatever it is at
this point 25 or 30

7468
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
this point 25 or 30
 

7469
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:51,270
this point 25 or 30
contact shifts like you've just done a

7470
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
contact shifts like you've just done a
 

7471
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,790
contact shifts like you've just done a
huge disservice to someone's day this

7472
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
huge disservice to someone's day this
 

7473
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,070
huge disservice to someone's day this
would be like if i had a professional

7474
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,080
would be like if i had a professional
 

7475
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:55,669
would be like if i had a professional
athlete it's like hey do me a favor

7476
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
athlete it's like hey do me a favor

to get there you're going to have to

7480
01:50:58,070 --> 01:50:58,080
to get there you're going to have to
 

7481
01:50:58,080 --> 01:50:59,430
to get there you're going to have to
carry this sandbag

7482
01:50:59,430 --> 01:50:59,440
carry this sandbag
 

7483
01:50:59,440 --> 01:51:01,109
carry this sandbag
and sprint up this hill like completely

7484
01:51:01,109 --> 01:51:01,119
and sprint up this hill like completely
 

7485
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:02,229
and sprint up this hill like completely
exhaust your muscles and then you have

7486
01:51:02,229 --> 01:51:02,239
exhaust your muscles and then you have
 

7487
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:03,669
exhaust your muscles and then you have
to go play a game like of course i'm not

7488
01:51:03,669 --> 01:51:03,679
to go play a game like of course i'm not

01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
going to ask an athlete to do
 

7491
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:06,950
going to ask an athlete to do
like an incredibly physically demanding

7492
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:06,960
like an incredibly physically demanding
 

7493
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,470
like an incredibly physically demanding
thing right before a game

7494
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:08,480
thing right before a game
 

7495
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,870
thing right before a game
but something as easy as thoughts

7496
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:10,880
but something as easy as thoughts
 

7497
01:51:10,880 --> 01:51:12,390
but something as easy as thoughts
question mark or like hey do you want to

7498
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:12,400
question mark or like hey do you want to
 

7499

jump on a call and it's going to be six

jump on a call and it's going to be six
 

7501
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:15,669
jump on a call and it's going to be six

it's kind of the cognitive equivalent

7504
01:51:17,350 --> 01:51:17,360
it's kind of the cognitive equivalent
 

7505
01:51:17,360 --> 01:51:18,550
it's kind of the cognitive equivalent
right you're taking the wind out of

7506
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:18,560
right you're taking the wind out of

many spreadsheets and processes are
 

7523
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,070

it's like claude shannon right i talked
 

7527
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:35,270
it's like claude shannon right i talked
about communication theater information

7528
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
about communication theater information
 

7529
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:36,229
about communication theater information
theory

7530
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:36,239
theory
 

7531
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:37,510
theory
it takes time to come up with a clever

7532
01:51:37,510 --> 01:51:37,520
it takes time to come up with a clever
 

7533
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:39,350
it takes time to come up with a clever
code up front so you spend more time up

7534
01:51:39,350 --> 01:51:39,360
code up front so you spend more time up
 

7535
01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:40,629
code up front so you spend more time up
front figuring out those spreadsheets

7536
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
front figuring out those spreadsheets
 

7537
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:41,189
front figuring out those spreadsheets
and trying to

7538
01:51:41,189 --> 01:51:41,199
and trying to
 

7539
01:51:41,199 --> 01:51:44,070
and trying to
get people on board with it but then

7540
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
get people on board with it but then
 

7541
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:45,350
get people on board with it but then
your communication going forward is all

7542
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
your communication going forward is all
 

7543
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,430
your communication going forward is all
much more efficient so over time

7544
01:51:47,430 --> 01:51:47,440
much more efficient so over time
 

7545
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:49,589
much more efficient so over time
you're using much less bandwidth right

7546
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
you're using much less bandwidth right
 

7547
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:51,830
you're using much less bandwidth right
so you you do pain up front

7548
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:51,840
so you you do pain up front
 

7549
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,750
so you you do pain up front
yes it's quicker just right now to send

7550
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:53,760
yes it's quicker just right now to send
 

7551
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,830
yes it's quicker just right now to send
an email but if i spend a half day to do

this over the next six months
 

7555
01:51:57,360 --> 01:52:00,709
this over the next six months
i've saved myself 600 emails now here's

7556
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
i've saved myself 600 emails now here's
 

7557
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:01,589
i've saved myself 600 emails now here's
a tough question

7558
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:01,599
a tough question
 

7559
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:03,109
a tough question
uh for you know from the computer

7560
01:52:03,109 --> 01:52:03,119
uh for you know from the computer
 

7561
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,430
uh for you know from the computer
science perspective we often over

7562
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:05,440
science perspective we often over
 

7563
01:52:05,440 --> 01:52:09,350
science perspective we often over
optimize so you create processes

7564
01:52:09,350 --> 01:52:09,360
optimize so you create processes
 

7565
01:52:09,360 --> 01:52:12,390
optimize so you create processes
and you okay just like you're saying

7566
01:52:12,390 --> 01:52:12,400
and you okay just like you're saying
 

7567
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:17,109
and you okay just like you're saying
it's so pleasurable to increase

7568
01:52:17,109 --> 01:52:17,119
it's so pleasurable to increase
 

7569
01:52:17,119 --> 01:52:19,750
it's so pleasurable to increase
uh in the long term productivity that

7570
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:19,760
uh in the long term productivity that
 

7571
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,709
uh in the long term productivity that
sometimes you just

7572
01:52:20,709 --> 01:52:20,719
sometimes you just
 

7573
01:52:20,719 --> 01:52:22,870
sometimes you just
enjoy that process in itself yeah by

7574
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
enjoy that process in itself yeah by
 

7575
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,030
enjoy that process in itself yeah by
just creating processes

7576
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
just creating processes
 

7577
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:28,310
just creating processes
and you actually never uh

7578
01:52:28,310 --> 01:52:28,320
and you actually never uh
 

7579
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:29,990
and you actually never uh
like it has a negative effect on

7580
01:52:29,990 --> 01:52:30,000
like it has a negative effect on
 

7581
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,350
like it has a negative effect on
productivity long term because you're

7582
01:52:31,350 --> 01:52:31,360
productivity long term because you're
 

7583
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,350
productivity long term because you're
too obsessed with the processes

7584
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
too obsessed with the processes
 

7585
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:36,629
too obsessed with the processes
is that is that uh a nice problem to

7586
01:52:36,629 --> 01:52:36,639
is that is that uh a nice problem to
 

7587
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:37,669
is that is that uh a nice problem to
have essentially

7588
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
have essentially
 

7589
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:39,910
have essentially
i mean it's a problem i mean because

7590
01:52:39,910 --> 01:52:39,920
i mean it's a problem i mean because
 

7591
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:41,510
i mean it's a problem i mean because
let's look at the one sector that does

7592
01:52:41,510 --> 01:52:41,520
let's look at the one sector that does
 

7593
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:42,629
let's look at the one sector that does
do this which is

7594
01:52:42,629 --> 01:52:42,639
do this which is
 

7595
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:45,270
do this which is
uh developers yeah right so agile

7596
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
uh developers yeah right so agile
 

7597
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:47,830
uh developers yeah right so agile
methodologies like scrum or kanban are

7598
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:47,840
methodologies like scrum or kanban are
 

7599
01:52:47,840 --> 01:52:49,830
methodologies like scrum or kanban are
basically workflow methodologies that

7600
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:49,840
basically workflow methodologies that
 

7601
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,109
basically workflow methodologies that
are much better than the hyperactive

7602
01:52:51,109 --> 01:52:51,119
are much better than the hyperactive
 

7603
01:52:51,119 --> 01:52:52,229
are much better than the hyperactive

01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:54,960
but man some of those programmers get
 

7607
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:56,070
but man some of those programmers get
pretty obsessive i don't know if you've

7608
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,080
pretty obsessive i don't know if you've
 

7609
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,430
pretty obsessive i don't know if you've
ever talked to a whatever

7610
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:57,440
ever talked to a whatever
 

7611
01:52:57,440 --> 01:53:00,229
ever talked to a whatever
level three scrum master they get really

7612
01:53:00,229 --> 01:53:00,239
level three scrum master they get really
 

7613
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:01,030
level three scrum master they get really
obsessive

7614
01:53:01,030 --> 01:53:01,040
obsessive
 

7615
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:03,750
obsessive
about like it has to happen exactly this

7616
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:03,760
about like it has to happen exactly this
 

7617
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:04,070
about like it has to happen exactly this
way

7618
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:04,080
way
 

7619
01:53:04,080 --> 01:53:05,350
way
and it's probably seven times more

7620
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,360
and it's probably seven times more
 

7621
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,109
and it's probably seven times more
complex than it needs to be

7622
01:53:07,109 --> 01:53:07,119
complex than it needs to be
 

7623
01:53:07,119 --> 01:53:08,790
complex than it needs to be
i'm hoping that's just because nerds

7624
01:53:08,790 --> 01:53:08,800
i'm hoping that's just because nerds
 

7625
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,229
i'm hoping that's just because nerds
like me you know

7626
01:53:10,229 --> 01:53:10,239
like me you know
 

7627
01:53:10,239 --> 01:53:12,629
like me you know
like to do that but it's it's a a

7628
01:53:12,629 --> 01:53:12,639
like to do that but it's it's a a
 

7629
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:14,310
like to do that but it's it's a a
broadly probably an issue right we have

7630
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,320
broadly probably an issue right we have
 

7631
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:15,750
broadly probably an issue right we have
to be careful because you can just go

7632
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:15,760
to be careful because you can just go
 

7633
01:53:15,760 --> 01:53:16,870
to be careful because you can just go
down that

7634
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:16,880
down that
 

7635
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:18,629
down that
that fiddling path like so it needs to

7636
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
that fiddling path like so it needs to
 

7637
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:20,149
that fiddling path like so it needs to
be here's how we do it let's reduce the

7638
01:53:20,149 --> 01:53:20,159
be here's how we do it let's reduce the
 

7639
01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:21,270
be here's how we do it let's reduce the
messages and let's roll

7640
01:53:21,270 --> 01:53:21,280
messages and let's roll
 

7641
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:24,950
messages and let's roll
you know um you can't save yourself

7642
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
you know um you can't save yourself
 

7643
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,189
you know um you can't save yourself
through if you can get the process just

7644
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
through if you can get the process just
 

7645
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,149
through if you can get the process just
right right

7646
01:53:28,149 --> 01:53:28,159
right right
 

7647
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:30,470
right right
so i wrote this article kind of recently

7648
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:30,480
so i wrote this article kind of recently
 

7649
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:31,589
so i wrote this article kind of recently
called the rise and fall of getting

term
in the early 2000s where people just

7664
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:43,360
in the early 2000s where people just
 

7665
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,270
in the early 2000s where people just
became convinced that if they could

7666
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:45,280
became convinced that if they could
 

7667
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:47,189
became convinced that if they could
combine their productivity systems with

7668
01:53:47,189 --> 01:53:47,199
combine their productivity systems with
 

7669
01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:49,430
combine their productivity systems with
software and they could find just the

7670
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:49,440
software and they could find just the
 

7671
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:50,470
software and they could find just the
right software just the right

7672
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,480
right software just the right
 

7673
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,830
right software just the right
configuration where they could offload

7674
01:53:51,830 --> 01:53:51,840
configuration where they could offload
 

7675
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:53,109
configuration where they could offload
most of the difficulty of work would

7676
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:53,119
most of the difficulty of work would
 

7677
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:53,669
most of the difficulty of work would
happen

7678
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
happen
 

7679
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:54,870
happen
with the machines when you kind of

7680
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880
with the machines when you kind of
 

7681
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:55,990
with the machines when you kind of
figure out for and then they could just

7682
01:53:55,990 --> 01:53:56,000
figure out for and then they could just
 

7683
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:57,430
figure out for and then they could just
sort of crank widgets and would be

7684
01:53:57,430 --> 01:53:57,440
sort of crank widgets and would be
 

7685
01:53:57,440 --> 01:53:59,030
sort of crank widgets and would be
and the whole thing fell apart because

7686
01:53:59,030 --> 01:53:59,040
and the whole thing fell apart because
 

7687
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:00,709
and the whole thing fell apart because
work is hard and it's hard to do

7688
01:54:00,709 --> 01:54:00,719
work is hard and it's hard to do
 

7689
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:01,990
work is hard and it's hard to do
and making decisions about what to work

7690
01:54:01,990 --> 01:54:02,000
and making decisions about what to work
 

7691
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:04,070
and making decisions about what to work
on is hard and no system can really do

7692
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,080
on is hard and no system can really do
 

7693
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:06,870
on is hard and no system can really do
that for you so you have to have this

7694
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:06,880
that for you so you have to have this
 

7695
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,669
that for you so you have to have this
this sort of balance between i uh

7696
01:54:09,669 --> 01:54:09,679
this sort of balance between i uh
 

7697
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,270
this sort of balance between i uh
contact switches are poison so we got to

7698
01:54:11,270 --> 01:54:11,280
contact switches are poison so we got to
 

7699
01:54:11,280 --> 01:54:12,550
contact switches are poison so we got to
get rid of the context which is once

7700
01:54:12,550 --> 01:54:12,560
get rid of the context which is once
 

7701
01:54:12,560 --> 01:54:13,750
get rid of the context which is once
like something's working good enough to

7702
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760
like something's working good enough to
 

7703
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,149
like something's working good enough to
get rid of the context switches then

7704
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
get rid of the context switches then
 

7705
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,430
get rid of the context switches then
get after it yeah there's a

7706
01:54:17,430 --> 01:54:17,440
get after it yeah there's a
 

7707
01:54:17,440 --> 01:54:19,350
get after it yeah there's a
psychological process there for me and

7708
01:54:19,350 --> 01:54:19,360
psychological process there for me and
 

7709
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,870
psychological process there for me and
the ocd nature

7710
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
the ocd nature
 

7711
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,109
the ocd nature
like i've literally embarrassingly

7712
01:54:23,109 --> 01:54:23,119
like i've literally embarrassingly
 

7713
01:54:23,119 --> 01:54:25,910
like i've literally embarrassingly
enough have lost my before when

7714
01:54:25,910 --> 01:54:25,920
enough have lost my before when
 

7715
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,470
enough have lost my before when
uh so in in many of the processes that

7716
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480
uh so in in many of the processes that
 

7717
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,310
uh so in in many of the processes that
involve python scripts

7718
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:30,320
involve python scripts
 

7719
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:33,350
involve python scripts
the rule is to not use

7720
01:54:33,350 --> 01:54:33,360
the rule is to not use
 

7721
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:36,070
the rule is to not use
spaces underscore zone there's like

7722
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:36,080
spaces underscore zone there's like
 

7723
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:39,189
spaces underscore zone there's like
rules for like how you format stuff okay

7724
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:39,199
rules for like how you format stuff okay
 

7725
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:42,229
rules for like how you format stuff okay
and like i should not lose my when

7726
01:54:42,229 --> 01:54:42,239
and like i should not lose my when
 

7727
01:54:42,239 --> 01:54:42,950
and like i should not lose my when
somebody

7728
01:54:42,950 --> 01:54:42,960
somebody
 

7729
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:45,189
somebody
had a space and maybe capital letters

7730
01:54:45,189 --> 01:54:45,199
had a space and maybe capital letters
 

7731
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:47,270
had a space and maybe capital letters
like it's okay to have a space

7732
01:54:47,270 --> 01:54:47,280
like it's okay to have a space
 

7733
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:49,109
like it's okay to have a space
i think because there's this feeling

7734
01:54:49,109 --> 01:54:49,119
i think because there's this feeling
 

7735
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,870
i think because there's this feeling
like something is not perfect

7736
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
like something is not perfect
 

7737
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:54,070
like something is not perfect
yeah and uh as opposed to in the python

7738
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,080
yeah and uh as opposed to in the python
 

7739
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,990
yeah and uh as opposed to in the python
script allowing some flexibility around

7740
01:54:55,990 --> 01:54:56,000
script allowing some flexibility around
 

7741
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:56,550
script allowing some flexibility around
that

7742
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,560
that
 

7743
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,310
that
you create this programmatic way that's

7744
01:54:58,310 --> 01:54:58,320
you create this programmatic way that's
 

7745
01:54:58,320 --> 01:54:59,990
you create this programmatic way that's
flawless and when everything's working

7746
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:00,000
flawless and when everything's working
 

7747
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:00,709
flawless and when everything's working
perfectly it's

7748
01:55:00,709 --> 01:55:00,719
perfectly it's
 

7749
01:55:00,719 --> 01:55:04,470
perfectly it's
perfect but actually if you strive for

7750
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:04,480
perfect but actually if you strive for
 

7751
01:55:04,480 --> 01:55:05,990
perfect but actually if you strive for
perfection

7752
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,000
perfection
 

7753
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:09,510
perfection
it has the same stress like has a lot of

7754
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:09,520
it has the same stress like has a lot of
 

7755
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:10,870
it has the same stress like has a lot of
the stress that you were seeking to

7756
01:55:10,870 --> 01:55:10,880
the stress that you were seeking to
 

7757
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:12,950
the stress that you were seeking to
escape with the contact switching yeah

7758
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
escape with the contact switching yeah
 

7759
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,990
escape with the contact switching yeah
because you're almost

7760
01:55:15,990 --> 01:55:16,000
because you're almost
 

7761
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,629
because you're almost
stressing about errors like when the

7762
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:18,639
stressing about errors like when the
 

7763
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:20,149
stressing about errors like when the
process is functioning

7764
01:55:20,149 --> 01:55:20,159
process is functioning
 

7765
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:22,149
process is functioning
you're there's always this anxiety of

7766
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:22,159
you're there's always this anxiety of
 

7767
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:24,229
you're there's always this anxiety of
like i wonder if it's gonna

7768
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
like i wonder if it's gonna
 

7769
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,149
like i wonder if it's gonna
succeed yeah i wonder if it's gonna

7770
01:55:26,149 --> 01:55:26,159
succeed yeah i wonder if it's gonna
 

7771
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:27,750
succeed yeah i wonder if it's gonna
succeed yeah no no i think some of

7772
01:55:27,750 --> 01:55:27,760
succeed yeah no no i think some of
 

7773
01:55:27,760 --> 01:55:28,550
succeed yeah no no i think some of
that's just you and i

7774
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
that's just you and i
 

7775
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:29,910
that's just you and i
probably i mean it's just our mindset

7776
01:55:29,910 --> 01:55:29,920
probably i mean it's just our mindset
 

7777
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,830
probably i mean it's just our mindset
right we're in we do computer science

7778
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
right we're in we do computer science
 

7779
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:32,310
right we're in we do computer science
right

7780
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:32,320
right
 

7781
01:55:32,320 --> 01:55:35,270
right
so chicken and egg yeah and a lot of the

7782
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:35,280
so chicken and egg yeah and a lot of the
 

7783
01:55:35,280 --> 01:55:36,950
so chicken and egg yeah and a lot of the
processes end up working here are much

7784
01:55:36,950 --> 01:55:36,960
processes end up working here are much
 

7785
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:38,550
processes end up working here are much
rougher it's like okay instead of

7786
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:38,560
rougher it's like okay instead of
 

7787
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:39,990
rougher it's like okay instead of
letting clients just

7788
01:55:39,990 --> 01:55:40,000
letting clients just
 

7789
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:43,030

all right we're gonna instead of
emailing about this project we'll have a

7814
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:00,560
emailing about this project we'll have a
 

7815
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:03,270
emailing about this project we'll have a
trello board and we'll do a weekly

7816

let's go

7822
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:06,880
let's go
 

7823
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:08,470
let's go
and now everything's on there and on our

7824
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:08,480
and now everything's on there and on our
 

7825
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:09,669
and now everything's on there and on our
inboxes we'll have to send as many

7826
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:09,679
inboxes we'll have to send as many
 

7827
01:56:09,679 --> 01:56:11,270
inboxes we'll have to send as many
messages so like that rough level of

7828
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
messages so like that rough level of
 

7829
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,229
messages so like that rough level of
granularity

7830
01:56:12,229 --> 01:56:12,239
granularity
 

7831
01:56:12,239 --> 01:56:15,030
granularity
that gets you most of the way there so

7832
01:56:15,030 --> 01:56:15,040
that gets you most of the way there so
 

7833
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:17,109
that gets you most of the way there so
the parts that you can't automate and

7834
01:56:17,109 --> 01:56:17,119
the parts that you can't automate and
 

7835
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:19,750
the parts that you can't automate and
turn into a process

7836
01:56:19,750 --> 01:56:19,760
turn into a process
 

7837
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,750
turn into a process
so how many parts like that do you think

7838
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:21,760
so how many parts like that do you think
 

7839
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,629
so how many parts like that do you think
should remain in a perfect world

7840
01:56:24,629 --> 01:56:24,639
should remain in a perfect world
 

7841
01:56:24,639 --> 01:56:27,990
should remain in a perfect world
and uh for those parts where email is

7842
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:28,000
and uh for those parts where email is
 

7843
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:28,550
and uh for those parts where email is
still

7844
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
still
 

7845
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:31,750
still
useful what do you recommend those

7846
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:31,760
useful what do you recommend those
 

7847
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,189
useful what do you recommend those
emails look like how

7848
01:56:33,189 --> 01:56:33,199

email is good for delivering information

7854
01:56:40,629 --> 01:56:40,639
email is good for delivering information
 

7855
01:56:40,639 --> 01:56:41,990
email is good for delivering information
right so i think of it like a fax

7856
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:42,000
right so i think of it like a fax
 

7857
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,430
right so i think of it like a fax
machine or something you know it's a

7858
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:43,440
machine or something you know it's a
 

7859
01:56:43,440 --> 01:56:45,350
machine or something you know it's a
really good fax machine so if i need to

7860
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:45,360
really good fax machine so if i need to
 

7861
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:46,629
really good fax machine so if i need to
send you something and you just send you

7862
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
send you something and you just send you
 

7863
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,470
send you something and you just send you

01:56:50,159 --> 01:56:53,430
policy or something like email's a great
way to do it it's bad for collaboration

7868
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,440
way to do it it's bad for collaboration
 

7869
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,510
way to do it it's bad for collaboration
so you're having a conversation like

01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,030
so there's there's probably a bunch of
people listening to this they're like

7980
01:58:29,030 --> 01:58:29,040
people listening to this they're like
 

7981
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:31,510
people listening to this they're like
uh yeah but i work on a team and they're

7982
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:31,520
uh yeah but i work on a team and they're
 

7983
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,109
uh yeah but i work on a team and they're
all they use is email

7984
01:58:33,109 --> 01:58:33,119
all they use is email
 

7985
01:58:33,119 --> 01:58:34,709
all they use is email
how do you start the revolution from

7986
01:58:34,709 --> 01:58:34,719
how do you start the revolution from
 

7987
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:36,709
how do you start the revolution from
like the ground up yeah well do it

7988
01:58:36,709 --> 01:58:36,719
like the ground up yeah well do it
 

7989
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:39,270
like the ground up yeah well do it
do asymmetric optimization first so

7990
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:39,280
do asymmetric optimization first so
 

7991
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,709
do asymmetric optimization first so
identify all your processes and then

7992
01:58:40,709 --> 01:58:40,719
identify all your processes and then
 

7993
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:42,149
identify all your processes and then
change what you can change

7994
01:58:42,149 --> 01:58:42,159
change what you can change
 

7995
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:44,470
change what you can change
and be socially very careful about it so

7996
01:58:44,470 --> 01:58:44,480
and be socially very careful about it so
 

7997
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:46,229
and be socially very careful about it so
don't necessarily say like okay this is

7998
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:46,239
don't necessarily say like okay this is
 

7999
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:48,310
don't necessarily say like okay this is
a new process we all have to do

8000
01:58:48,310 --> 01:58:48,320
a new process we all have to do
 

8001
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:50,629
a new process we all have to do
you're just you know hey we gotta get

you're just you know hey we gotta get
 

8003
01:58:50,639 --> 01:58:51,830
you're just you know hey we gotta get
this report ready

this report ready
 

8005
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:52,709
this report ready
here's what i think we should do like

8006
01:58:52,709 --> 01:58:52,719
here's what i think we should do like
 

8007
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:54,550
here's what i think we should do like
i'll get a draft into our dropbox folder

8008
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:54,560
i'll get a draft into our dropbox folder

the final version will be ready for them

8030
01:59:13,189 --> 01:59:13,199
the final version will be ready for them
 

8031
01:59:13,199 --> 01:59:14,950
the final version will be ready for them
to take and polish or whatever like the

01:59:16,629 --> 01:59:16,639
i'm glad
 

8037
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:18,629
i'm glad
you know cal has a plan so i just what

8038
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:18,639
you know cal has a plan so i just what
 

8039
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:19,910
you know cal has a plan so i just what
do i need to do i need to edit this

8040
01:59:19,910 --> 01:59:19,920
do i need to do i need to edit this
 

8041
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:21,030
do i need to do i need to edit this
tomorrow whatever right

8042
01:59:21,030 --> 01:59:21,040
tomorrow whatever right
 

8043
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:22,149
tomorrow whatever right
but you've actually pulled them into a

8044
01:59:22,149 --> 01:59:22,159
but you've actually pulled them into a
 

8045
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:23,270
but you've actually pulled them into a
process that means we're going to get

8046
01:59:23,270 --> 01:59:23,280
process that means we're going to get
 

8047
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,870
process that means we're going to get
this report together without having to

8048
01:59:24,870 --> 01:59:24,880
this report together without having to
 

8049
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,390
this report together without having to
just go back and forth so you just

8050
01:59:26,390 --> 01:59:26,400
just go back and forth so you just
 

8051
01:59:26,400 --> 01:59:29,270
just go back and forth so you just
asymmetrically optimize these things and

8052
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:29,280
asymmetrically optimize these things and
 

8053
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:31,189
asymmetrically optimize these things and
then you can begin the conversation

8054
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
then you can begin the conversation
 

8055
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:32,550
then you can begin the conversation
and maybe that's where my book comes in

8056
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:32,560
and maybe that's where my book comes in
 

8057
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,270
and maybe that's where my book comes in
place you just sort of yeah slide it

8058
01:59:35,270 --> 01:59:35,280
place you just sort of yeah slide it
 

8059
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:37,189
place you just sort of yeah slide it
slide it across to buy the book and just

8060
01:59:37,189 --> 01:59:37,199
slide it across to buy the book and just
 

8061
01:59:37,199 --> 01:59:38,470
slide it across to buy the book and just
leave it leave it out

8062
01:59:38,470 --> 01:59:38,480
leave it leave it out
 

8063
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,229
leave it leave it out
give it to everybody on your team okay

8064
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:40,239
give it to everybody on your team okay
 

8065
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:41,750
give it to everybody on your team okay
so we solved the bulk of the email

8066
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:41,760
so we solved the bulk of the email
 

8067
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,790
so we solved the bulk of the email
problem with this

8068
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:42,800
problem with this
 

8069
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:44,629
problem with this
is there a case to be made that even for

8070
01:59:44,629 --> 01:59:44,639
is there a case to be made that even for
 

8071
01:59:44,639 --> 01:59:46,870
is there a case to be made that even for
like communication between you and i

8072
01:59:46,870 --> 01:59:46,880
like communication between you and i
 

8073
01:59:46,880 --> 01:59:50,470
like communication between you and i
we should move away from uh from email

8074
01:59:50,470 --> 01:59:50,480
we should move away from uh from email
 

8075
01:59:50,480 --> 01:59:51,910
we should move away from uh from email
like for example there's a guy i

8076
01:59:51,910 --> 01:59:51,920
like for example there's a guy i
 

8077
01:59:51,920 --> 01:59:52,950
like for example there's a guy i
recently i don't know if you know

8078
01:59:52,950 --> 01:59:52,960
recently i don't know if you know
 

8079
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,629
recently i don't know if you know
comedians but there's a guy named joey

8080
01:59:54,629 --> 01:59:54,639
comedians but there's a guy named joey
 

8081
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:55,430
comedians but there's a guy named joey
diaz

8082
01:59:55,430 --> 01:59:55,440
diaz
 

8083
01:59:55,440 --> 01:59:57,030
diaz
yeah that i've had an interaction with

8084
01:59:57,030 --> 01:59:57,040
yeah that i've had an interaction with
 

8085
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:58,790
yeah that i've had an interaction with
recently and that guy

8086
01:59:58,790 --> 01:59:58,800
recently and that guy
 

8087
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,709
recently and that guy
first of all the sweetest human despite

8088
02:00:00,709 --> 02:00:00,719
first of all the sweetest human despite
 

8089
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:01,830
first of all the sweetest human despite
what his comedy

8090
02:00:01,830 --> 02:00:01,840
what his comedy
 

8091
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:03,270
what his comedy
sounds like he's the sweetest human

8092
02:00:03,270 --> 02:00:03,280
sounds like he's the sweetest human
 

8093
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:05,669
sounds like he's the sweetest human
being and he's a big proponent of just

8094
02:00:05,669 --> 02:00:05,679
being and he's a big proponent of just
 

8095
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:06,390
being and he's a big proponent of just
pick up

8096
02:00:06,390 --> 02:00:06,400
pick up
 

8097
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:08,629
pick up
the phone yeah and call yeah and it

8098
02:00:08,629 --> 02:00:08,639
the phone yeah and call yeah and it
 

8099
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,629
the phone yeah and call yeah and it
makes me so uncomfortable people call me

8100
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
makes me so uncomfortable people call me
 

8101
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:11,990
makes me so uncomfortable people call me
yeah it's like i don't know what to

8102
02:00:11,990 --> 02:00:12,000
yeah it's like i don't know what to
 

8103
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:15,109
yeah it's like i don't know what to
do with this thing uh but it kind of

8104
02:00:15,109 --> 02:00:15,119
do with this thing uh but it kind of
 

8105
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:16,229
do with this thing uh but it kind of
gets everything done

8106
02:00:16,229 --> 02:00:16,239
gets everything done
 

8107
02:00:16,239 --> 02:00:19,109
gets everything done
quicker i think if i remove the anxiety

8108
02:00:19,109 --> 02:00:19,119
quicker i think if i remove the anxiety
 

8109
02:00:19,119 --> 02:00:19,669
quicker i think if i remove the anxiety
from that

8110
02:00:19,669 --> 02:00:19,679
from that
 

8111
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:21,189
from that
is there a case to be made for that or

8112
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:21,199
is there a case to be made for that or
 

8113
02:00:21,199 --> 02:00:23,589
is there a case to be made for that or
this email could still be the most

8114
02:00:23,589 --> 02:00:23,599
this email could still be the most
 

8115
02:00:23,599 --> 02:00:24,790
this email could still be the most
efficient way to do this

8116
02:00:24,790 --> 02:00:24,800
efficient way to do this
 

8117
02:00:24,800 --> 02:00:26,149
efficient way to do this
no i mean look if you if you have to

8118
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
no i mean look if you if you have to
 

8119
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,070
no i mean look if you if you have to
interact with someone there's a lot of

8120
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:28,080
interact with someone there's a lot of
 

8121
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:29,589
interact with someone there's a lot of
efficiency in synchrony

8122
02:00:29,589 --> 02:00:29,599
efficiency in synchrony
 

8123
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:30,550
efficiency in synchrony
right and this is something from

8124
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:30,560
right and this is something from
 

8125
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,070
right and this is something from
distributed system theory where you know

8126
02:00:32,070 --> 02:00:32,080
distributed system theory where you know
 

8127
02:00:32,080 --> 02:00:33,350
distributed system theory where you know
if you go from synchronous to

8128
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:33,360
if you go from synchronous to
 

8129
02:00:33,360 --> 02:00:34,550
if you go from synchronous to
asynchronous networks

8130
02:00:34,550 --> 02:00:34,560
asynchronous networks
 

8131
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,910
asynchronous networks
there's a huge amount of overhead to the

8132
02:00:35,910 --> 02:00:35,920
there's a huge amount of overhead to the
 

8133
02:00:35,920 --> 02:00:37,510
there's a huge amount of overhead to the
asynchrony so actually the protocol is

8134
02:00:37,510 --> 02:00:37,520
asynchrony so actually the protocol is
 

8135
02:00:37,520 --> 02:00:38,870
asynchrony so actually the protocol is
required to solve things

8136
02:00:38,870 --> 02:00:38,880
required to solve things
 

8137
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:40,629
required to solve things
in asynchronous networks are

8138
02:00:40,629 --> 02:00:40,639
in asynchronous networks are
 

8139
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:42,070
in asynchronous networks are
significantly more complicated and

8140
02:00:42,070 --> 02:00:42,080
significantly more complicated and
 

8141
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:42,950
significantly more complicated and
fragile than

8142
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:42,960
fragile than
 

8143
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:44,470
fragile than
synchronous protocols so if we can just

8144
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:44,480
synchronous protocols so if we can just
 

8145
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:46,950
synchronous protocols so if we can just
do real time it's usually better and

8146
02:00:46,950 --> 02:00:46,960
do real time it's usually better and
 

8147
02:00:46,960 --> 02:00:47,910
do real time it's usually better and
also from a

8148
02:00:47,910 --> 02:00:47,920
also from a
 

8149
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:49,189
also from a
interaction like social connection

8150
02:00:49,189 --> 02:00:49,199
interaction like social connection
 

8151
02:00:49,199 --> 02:00:50,390
interaction like social connection
standpoint there's a lot more

8152
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:50,400
standpoint there's a lot more
 

8153
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,910
standpoint there's a lot more
information in the human voice and the

8154
02:00:51,910 --> 02:00:51,920
information in the human voice and the
 

8155
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,030
information in the human voice and the
back and forth

8156
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
back and forth
 

8157
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:55,189
back and forth
uh yeah if you just call so very

8158
02:00:55,189 --> 02:00:55,199
uh yeah if you just call so very
 

8159
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:56,310
uh yeah if you just call so very
generational right

8160
02:00:56,310 --> 02:00:56,320
generational right
 

8161
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:58,229
generational right
like our generation will be comfortable

8162
02:00:58,229 --> 02:00:58,239
like our generation will be comfortable
 

8163
02:00:58,239 --> 02:01:00,070
like our generation will be comfortable
talking on the phone in a way that like

8164
02:01:00,070 --> 02:01:00,080
talking on the phone in a way that like
 

8165
02:01:00,080 --> 02:01:01,910
talking on the phone in a way that like
a younger generation isn't but an older

8166
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
a younger generation isn't but an older
 

8167
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,830
a younger generation isn't but an older
generation is more comfortable with well

8168
02:01:03,830 --> 02:01:03,840
generation is more comfortable with well
 

8169
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:06,070
generation is more comfortable with well
you just call people whereas we so

8203
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:33,830
you can talk to well that's that's one
problem the other one is the

8204
02:01:33,830 --> 02:01:33,840
problem the other one is the
 

8205
02:01:33,840 --> 02:01:34,629
problem the other one is the
introversion

8206
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
introversion
 

8207
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,550
introversion
where i'm just afraid of people and get

8208
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,560
where i'm just afraid of people and get
 

8209
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:37,910
where i'm just afraid of people and get
really stressed like

8210
02:01:37,910 --> 02:01:37,920
really stressed like
 

8211
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:39,910

i freak out and so you picked a good

8212
02:01:39,910 --> 02:01:39,920
i freak out and so you picked a good
 

8213
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,350
i freak out and so you picked a good
line of work

8214
02:01:41,350 --> 02:01:41,360
line of work
 

8215
02:01:41,360 --> 02:01:43,830
line of work
yeah now perhaps it's the goggins thing

8216
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:43,840
yeah now perhaps it's the goggins thing
 

8217
02:01:43,840 --> 02:01:45,510
yeah now perhaps it's the goggins thing
it's like facing your fears or whatever

8218
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:45,520
it's like facing your fears or whatever
 

8219
02:01:45,520 --> 02:01:49,030
it's like facing your fears or whatever
but but it's almost like

8220
02:01:49,030 --> 02:01:49,040
but but it's almost like
 

8221
02:01:49,040 --> 02:01:51,030
but but it's almost like
there's uh it has to do with the

8222
02:01:51,030 --> 02:01:51,040
there's uh it has to do with the
 

8223
02:01:51,040 --> 02:01:52,870
there's uh it has to do with the
timetables thing and the deep work

8224
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:52,880
timetables thing and the deep work
 

8225
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:55,669
timetables thing and the deep work
that the nice thing about the processes

8226
02:01:55,669 --> 02:01:55,679
that the nice thing about the processes
 

8227
02:01:55,679 --> 02:01:56,629
that the nice thing about the processes
is

8228
02:01:56,629 --> 02:01:56,639
is
 

8229
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,870
is
it not only automates sort of uh

8230
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:00,880
it not only automates sort of uh
 

8231
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:03,430
it not only automates sort of uh
automates away the contact switching it

8232
02:02:03,430 --> 02:02:03,440
automates away the contact switching it
 

8233
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:05,510
automates away the contact switching it
ensures you do the important things too

8234
02:02:05,510 --> 02:02:05,520
ensures you do the important things too
 

8235
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,310
ensures you do the important things too
like yeah

8236
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:06,320
like yeah
 

8237
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,470
like yeah
it's like prioritize so the thing is

8238
02:02:08,470 --> 02:02:08,480
it's like prioritize so the thing is
 

8239
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:10,310
it's like prioritize so the thing is
with email

8240
02:02:10,310 --> 02:02:10,320
with email
 

8241
02:02:10,320 --> 02:02:13,510
with email
because everything is done over email

8242
02:02:13,510 --> 02:02:13,520
because everything is done over email
 

8243
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:16,070
because everything is done over email
you can be lazy in the same way with

8244
02:02:16,070 --> 02:02:16,080
you can be lazy in the same way with
 

8245
02:02:16,080 --> 02:02:18,229
you can be lazy in the same way with
like social networks and and do the easy

8246
02:02:18,229 --> 02:02:18,239
like social networks and and do the easy
 

8247
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:19,350
like social networks and and do the easy
things first

8248
02:02:19,350 --> 02:02:19,360
things first
 

8249
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:21,270
things first
that are not that important so the

8250
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:21,280
that are not that important so the
 

8251
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:22,550
that are not that important so the
process also

8252
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
process also
 

8253
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:24,229
process also
enforces that you do the important

8254
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
enforces that you do the important
 

8255
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:26,470
enforces that you do the important
things and for me the important

8256
02:02:26,470 --> 02:02:26,480
things and for me the important
 

8257
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,950
things and for me the important
things is like okay it sounds weird but

8258
02:02:28,950 --> 02:02:28,960
things is like okay it sounds weird but
 

8259
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:30,229
things is like okay it sounds weird but
like social connection

8260
02:02:30,229 --> 02:02:30,239
like social connection
 

8261
02:02:30,239 --> 02:02:31,830
like social connection
no that's one of the most important

8262
02:02:31,830 --> 02:02:31,840
no that's one of the most important
 

8263
02:02:31,840 --> 02:02:34,229
no that's one of the most important
things in all of human existence

8264
02:02:34,229 --> 02:02:34,239
things in all of human existence
 

8265
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,950
things in all of human existence
yeah and doing it the the paradoxical

8266
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:36,960
yeah and doing it the the paradoxical
 

8267
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:37,430
yeah and doing it the the paradoxical
thing

8268
02:02:37,430 --> 02:02:37,440
thing
 

8269
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:39,510
thing
i got into this for digital minimalism

8270
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:39,520
i got into this for digital minimalism
 

8271
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,910
i got into this for digital minimalism
uh the more you sacrifice on behalf of

8272
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:41,920
uh the more you sacrifice on behalf of
 

8273
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:43,189
uh the more you sacrifice on behalf of
the connection the stronger the

8274
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
the connection the stronger the
 

8275
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,149
the connection the stronger the
connection feels

8276
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
connection feels
 

8277
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:45,990
connection feels
right so sacrificing non-trivial time

8278
02:02:45,990 --> 02:02:46,000
right so sacrificing non-trivial time
 

8279
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,149
right so sacrificing non-trivial time
and attention on behalf of someone is

8280
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
and attention on behalf of someone is
 

8281
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:50,070
and attention on behalf of someone is
what tells your brain that this is a

8282
02:02:50,070 --> 02:02:50,080
what tells your brain that this is a
 

8283
02:02:50,080 --> 02:02:52,790
what tells your brain that this is a
a serious relationship which is why

8284
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:52,800
a serious relationship which is why
 

8285
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,790
a serious relationship which is why
social media had this paradoxical effect

8286
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:54,800
social media had this paradoxical effect
 

8287
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:55,430
social media had this paradoxical effect
making people

8288
02:02:55,430 --> 02:02:55,440
making people
 

8289
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,430
making people
feel less social because it took the

8290
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:57,440
feel less social because it took the
 

8291
02:02:57,440 --> 02:02:59,189
feel less social because it took the
friction out of it and so the brain just

8292
02:02:59,189 --> 02:02:59,199
friction out of it and so the brain just
 

8293
02:02:59,199 --> 02:02:59,990
friction out of it and so the brain just
doesn't like yeah

8294
02:02:59,990 --> 02:03:00,000
doesn't like yeah
 

8295
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,830
doesn't like yeah

thing
yeah and this is more fun to listen to

8460

yeah and this is more fun to listen to
 

8461
02:05:34,639 --> 02:05:36,870
yeah and this is more fun to listen to
than a shitty zoom

8462
02:05:36,870 --> 02:05:36,880
than a shitty zoom
 

8463
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:39,510
than a shitty zoom
lecture yeah about their work yeah it's

8464
02:05:39,510 --> 02:05:39,520
lecture yeah about their work yeah it's
 

8465
02:05:39,520 --> 02:05:40,709
lecture yeah about their work yeah it's
like there's something here there's

8466
02:05:40,709 --> 02:05:40,719
like there's something here there's

fun
 

8483
02:05:54,079 --> 02:05:56,149
fun
well that's your innovation i think was

8484
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
well that's your innovation i think was
 

8485
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:57,270
well that's your innovation i think was
we can bring on

8486
02:05:57,270 --> 02:05:57,280
we can bring on
 

8487
02:05:57,280 --> 02:05:59,750
we can bring on
professors yeah and i know joe rogan did

8488
02:05:59,750 --> 02:05:59,760
professors yeah and i know joe rogan did
 

8489
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:00,470
professors yeah and i know joe rogan did
some of that too

8490
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:00,480
some of that too
 

8491
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:04,069
some of that too
but but you know but your professors in

8492
02:06:04,069 --> 02:06:04,079
but but you know but your professors in
 

8493
02:06:04,079 --> 02:06:05,589
but but you know but your professors in
your field like yeah you bring out all

8494
02:06:05,589 --> 02:06:05,599
your field like yeah you bring out all
 

8495
02:06:05,599 --> 02:06:07,270
your field like yeah you bring out all
these mit guys who i remember

8496
02:06:07,270 --> 02:06:07,280
these mit guys who i remember
 

8497
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:08,950
these mit guys who i remember
you know well that's been the big

8498
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:08,960
you know well that's been the big
 

8499
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:11,510
you know well that's been the big
challenge for me is i don't

8500
02:06:11,510 --> 02:06:11,520
challenge for me is i don't
 

8501
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:15,030
challenge for me is i don't
is i feel uh

8502
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:15,040
is i feel uh
 

8503
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,149
is i feel uh
i would i would ask big like

8504
02:06:16,149 --> 02:06:16,159
i would i would ask big like
 

8505
02:06:16,159 --> 02:06:18,310
i would i would ask big like
philosophical questions of

8506
02:06:18,310 --> 02:06:18,320
philosophical questions of
 

8507
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:21,350
philosophical questions of
only people like yourself that are

8508
02:06:21,350 --> 02:06:21,360
only people like yourself that are
 

8509
02:06:21,360 --> 02:06:24,149
only people like yourself that are
like really well public like so for

8510
02:06:24,149 --> 02:06:24,159
like really well public like so for
 

8511
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:25,270
like really well public like so for
example you have a lot of excellent

8512
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:25,280
example you have a lot of excellent
 

8513
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:25,830
example you have a lot of excellent
papers

8514
02:06:25,830 --> 02:06:25,840
papers
 

8515
02:06:25,840 --> 02:06:29,270
papers
on uh you know that a lot has a lot of

8516
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,280
on uh you know that a lot has a lot of
 

8517
02:06:29,280 --> 02:06:29,990
on uh you know that a lot has a lot of
theory in it

8518
02:06:29,990 --> 02:06:30,000
theory in it
 

8519
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,350
theory in it
right and there's some temptation to

8520
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:33,360
right and there's some temptation to
 

8521
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:33,750
right and there's some temptation to
just

8522
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:33,760
just
 

8523
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:35,910
just
go through papers and i think it's

8524
02:06:35,910 --> 02:06:35,920
go through papers and i think it's
 

8525
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:37,189
go through papers and i think it's
possible to actually do that i haven't

8526
02:06:37,189 --> 02:06:37,199
possible to actually do that i haven't
 

8527
02:06:37,199 --> 02:06:39,270
possible to actually do that i haven't
done that much but i think it's possible

8528
02:06:39,270 --> 02:06:39,280
done that much but i think it's possible
 

8529
02:06:39,280 --> 02:06:41,510
done that much but i think it's possible
it just requires a lot of preparation

8530
02:06:41,510 --> 02:06:41,520
it just requires a lot of preparation
 

8531
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:43,189
it just requires a lot of preparation
and i can probably only do that

8532
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:43,199
and i can probably only do that
 

8533
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:45,990
and i can probably only do that
with things that i'm actually like in

8534
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
with things that i'm actually like in
 

8535
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:46,790
with things that i'm actually like in
the field i'm

8536
02:06:46,790 --> 02:06:46,800
the field i'm
 

8537
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:50,229
the field i'm
aware of but there's a dance that

8538
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:50,239
aware of but there's a dance that
 

8539
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:51,750
aware of but there's a dance that
i would love to be able to try to hit

8540
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:51,760
i would love to be able to try to hit
 

8541
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:53,430
i would love to be able to try to hit
right where it's actually getting to the

8542
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:53,440
right where it's actually getting to the
 

8543
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,870
right where it's actually getting to the
core of some interesting ideas as

8544
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:54,880
core of some interesting ideas as
 

8545
02:06:54,880 --> 02:06:56,629
core of some interesting ideas as
opposed to just talking about philosophy

8546
02:06:56,629 --> 02:06:56,639
opposed to just talking about philosophy
 

8547
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:58,870
opposed to just talking about philosophy
yeah at the same time there's a large

8548
02:06:58,870 --> 02:06:58,880
yeah at the same time there's a large
 

8549
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,390
yeah at the same time there's a large
audience for people that just want to be

8550
02:07:00,390 --> 02:07:00,400
audience for people that just want to be
 

8551
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,149
audience for people that just want to be
inspired by

8552
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,159
inspired by
 

8553
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:05,270
inspired by
like by disciplines where they don't

8554
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:05,280
like by disciplines where they don't
 

8555
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:06,790
like by disciplines where they don't
necessarily know the details

8556
02:07:06,790 --> 02:07:06,800
necessarily know the details
 

8557
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:08,069
necessarily know the details
yeah but there's a lot of people that

8558
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
yeah but there's a lot of people that
 

8559
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:10,470
yeah but there's a lot of people that
are like i'm really curious

8560
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:10,480
are like i'm really curious
 

8561
02:07:10,480 --> 02:07:11,910
are like i'm really curious
i've been thinking about pivoting

8562
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:11,920
i've been thinking about pivoting
 

8563
02:07:11,920 --> 02:07:14,550
i've been thinking about pivoting
careers into software engineering

8564
02:07:14,550 --> 02:07:14,560
careers into software engineering
 

8565
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:16,390
careers into software engineering
they would love to hear from people like

8566
02:07:16,390 --> 02:07:16,400
they would love to hear from people like
 

8567
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:17,910
they would love to hear from people like
you about computer science

8568
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:17,920
you about computer science
 

8569
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:19,910
you about computer science
even if it's like theory yeah but just

8570
02:07:19,910 --> 02:07:19,920
even if it's like theory yeah but just
 

8571
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:21,430
even if it's like theory yeah but just
like the idea that you can have big

like the idea that you can have big
 

8573
02:07:21,440 --> 02:07:23,189
like the idea that you can have big
ideas you push them through and it's

8574
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:23,199
ideas you push them through and it's
 

8575
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:23,990
ideas you push them through and it's
interesting

8576

interesting
 

8577
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,750
interesting
you fight for it yeah well there's some

8578
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:25,760
you fight for it yeah well there's some
 

8579
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:28,629
you fight for it yeah well there's some
uh there's what is that computer file

8580
02:07:28,629 --> 02:07:28,639
uh there's what is that computer file
 

8581
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:32,149
uh there's what is that computer file
and uh uh number file these youtube

8582
02:07:32,149 --> 02:07:32,159
and uh uh number file these youtube
 

8583
02:07:32,159 --> 02:07:33,030
and uh uh number file these youtube
channels

8584
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040

talking about like
why this move is better than this move

8598
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:45,440
why this move is better than this move
 

8599
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:46,950
why this move is better than this move
but i love the passion

8600
02:07:46,950 --> 02:07:46,960
but i love the passion
 

8601
02:07:46,960 --> 02:07:48,709
but i love the passion
and the genius of those people and just

8602
02:07:48,709 --> 02:07:48,719
and the genius of those people and just
 

8603
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:49,990
and the genius of those people and just
overhearing it yeah

8604
02:07:49,990 --> 02:07:50,000
overhearing it yeah
 

8605
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:52,069
overhearing it yeah
i don't know why that's so exciting did

8606
02:07:52,069 --> 02:07:52,079
i don't know why that's so exciting did
 

8607

all the yeah shuttle optimized yeah it's
 

8611
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,830
all the yeah shuttle optimized yeah it's
like the hardcore complexity theory

8612
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:57,840
like the hardcore complexity theory
 

8613
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,990
like the hardcore complexity theory
but it's there's an enthusiasm or like

8614
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
but it's there's an enthusiasm or like

a blog he used to yeah he would

8620
02:08:04,870 --> 02:08:04,880
a blog he used to yeah he would
 

8621
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:07,669
a blog he used to yeah he would
he uh and it would just be i'm going all

in
 

8625
02:08:08,079 --> 02:08:10,149
in
on you know here's the new affine group

8626
02:08:10,149 --> 02:08:10,159
on you know here's the new affine group
 

8627
02:08:10,159 --> 02:08:11,669
on you know here's the new affine group
with which you can do whatever but i

8628
02:08:11,669 --> 02:08:11,679
with which you can do whatever but i
 

8629
02:08:11,679 --> 02:08:12,870
with which you can do whatever but i
mean it's just equations

8630
02:08:12,870 --> 02:08:12,880
mean it's just equations
 

8631
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:14,550
mean it's just equations
well in the case of scott anderson he's

8632
02:08:14,550 --> 02:08:14,560
well in the case of scott anderson he's
 

8633

02:08:17,910 --> 02:08:17,920
good he's able to turn on like the
 

8635
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,950
good he's able to turn on like the
inner troll and comedian and so on

8636

8639
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:24,550
he keeps the fun which is the best and
he's a philosophical guy he wrote that

8640
02:08:24,550 --> 02:08:24,560
he's a philosophical guy he wrote that
 

8641
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:25,750
he's a philosophical guy he wrote that
that turns out

8642
02:08:25,750 --> 02:08:25,760
that turns out
 

8643
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:28,870
that turns out
yeah yeah so you know we're exploring

computer science
 

8655
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,589
computer science
that's right i do some of that uh so i

8656
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
that's right i do some of that uh so i
 

8657

problem this was pre-computers
but he was you know he's english so it's

8728
02:09:46,310 --> 02:09:46,320
but he was you know he's english so it's
 

8729
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:47,189
but he was you know he's english so it's
written in english so it's very

8730
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
written in english so it's very
 

8731
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:48,709
written in english so it's very
accessible paper

accessible paper
 

8733
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:50,709
accessible paper
and it's it lays the foundation for all

8734
02:09:50,709 --> 02:09:50,719
and it's it lays the foundation for all
 

8735
02:09:50,719 --> 02:09:52,069
and it's it lays the foundation for all
of theoretical computer science he just

8736
02:09:52,069 --> 02:09:52,079
of theoretical computer science he just
 

8737
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:53,030
of theoretical computer science he just
has this insight

8738
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040
has this insight
 

8739
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,470
has this insight
he's like well if we think about like an

8740
02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:54,480
he's like well if we think about like an
 

8741
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,790
he's like well if we think about like an
algorithm i mean he figures out like all

8742
02:09:56,790 --> 02:09:56,800
algorithm i mean he figures out like all
 

8743
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,229
algorithm i mean he figures out like all
effective procedures or turing machines

8744
02:09:58,229 --> 02:09:58,239
effective procedures or turing machines
 

8745
02:09:58,239 --> 02:09:59,910
effective procedures or turing machines
or basically algorithms we could really

8746
02:09:59,910 --> 02:09:59,920
or basically algorithms we could really
 

8747
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:01,910
or basically algorithms we could really
describe a turing machine with a number

8748
02:10:01,910 --> 02:10:01,920
describe a turing machine with a number
 

8749
02:10:01,920 --> 02:10:03,430
describe a turing machine with a number
which we can now imagine with like

8750
02:10:03,430 --> 02:10:03,440
which we can now imagine with like
 

8751
02:10:03,440 --> 02:10:04,870
which we can now imagine with like
computer code you could just take a

8752
02:10:04,870 --> 02:10:04,880
computer code you could just take a
 

8753
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:05,990
computer code you could just take a
source file and just

8754
02:10:05,990 --> 02:10:06,000
source file and just
 

8755
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:07,669
source file and just
treat the binary version of the file as

8756
02:10:07,669 --> 02:10:07,679
treat the binary version of the file as
 

8757
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:09,270
treat the binary version of the file as
like a really long number right

8758
02:10:09,270 --> 02:10:09,280
like a really long number right
 

8759
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,430
like a really long number right
but it's like every program is just a

8760
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:11,440
but it's like every program is just a
 

8761
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,310
but it's like every program is just a
finite number

8762
02:10:12,310 --> 02:10:12,320
finite number
 

8763
02:10:12,320 --> 02:10:14,310
finite number
it's a natural number and then he

8764
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:14,320
it's a natural number and then he
 

8765
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,830
it's a natural number and then he
realized like one way to think about a

8766
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:15,840
realized like one way to think about a
 

8767
02:10:15,840 --> 02:10:16,470
realized like one way to think about a
problem

8768
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:16,480
problem
 

8769
02:10:16,480 --> 02:10:18,709
problem
is you have and this is like kind of the

8770
02:10:18,709 --> 02:10:18,719
is you have and this is like kind of the
 

8771
02:10:18,719 --> 02:10:20,390
is you have and this is like kind of the
mike sipser approach but you have a sort

8772
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:20,400
mike sipser approach but you have a sort
 

8773
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:20,709
mike sipser approach but you have a sort
of

8774
02:10:20,709 --> 02:10:20,719
of
 

8775
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:22,629
of
uh it's a language so of an infinite

8776
02:10:22,629 --> 02:10:22,639
uh it's a language so of an infinite
 

8777
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:23,990
uh it's a language so of an infinite
number of strings some of them are in

8778
02:10:23,990 --> 02:10:24,000
number of strings some of them are in
 

8779
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:25,109
number of strings some of them are in
the language and some of them aren't but

8780
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:25,119
the language and some of them aren't but
 

8781
02:10:25,119 --> 02:10:26,709
the language and some of them aren't but
basically you can imagine a problem is

8782
02:10:26,709 --> 02:10:26,719
basically you can imagine a problem is
 

8783
02:10:26,719 --> 02:10:29,189
basically you can imagine a problem is
represented as an infinite binary string

8784
02:10:29,189 --> 02:10:29,199
represented as an infinite binary string
 

8785
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:30,870
represented as an infinite binary string
where in every position like a one means

8786
02:10:30,870 --> 02:10:30,880
where in every position like a one means
 

8787
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,310
where in every position like a one means
that string is in the language and zero

8788
02:10:32,310 --> 02:10:32,320
that string is in the language and zero
 

8789
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,510
that string is in the language and zero
means it isn't

8790
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
means it isn't
 

8791
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,229
means it isn't
and then he applied cantor from the 19th

8792
02:10:36,229 --> 02:10:36,239
and then he applied cantor from the 19th
 

8793
02:10:36,239 --> 02:10:36,870
and then he applied cantor from the 19th
century

8794
02:10:36,870 --> 02:10:36,880
century
 

8795
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:38,390
century
and said okay the natural numbers are

8796
02:10:38,390 --> 02:10:38,400
and said okay the natural numbers are
 

8797
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,189
and said okay the natural numbers are
countable so it's accountably infinite

8798
02:10:41,189 --> 02:10:41,199
countable so it's accountably infinite
 

8799
02:10:41,199 --> 02:10:43,990
countable so it's accountably infinite
and infinite binary strings you can use

8800
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
and infinite binary strings you can use
 

8801
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,270
and infinite binary strings you can use
a diagonalization argument to show

8802
02:10:45,270 --> 02:10:45,280
a diagonalization argument to show
 

8803
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:45,910
a diagonalization argument to show
they're they're

8804
02:10:45,910 --> 02:10:45,920
they're they're
 

8805
02:10:45,920 --> 02:10:49,189
they're they're
uh they're uncountable so there's just

8806
02:10:49,189 --> 02:10:49,199
uh they're uncountable so there's just
 

8807
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:51,109
uh they're uncountable so there's just
vastly more problems than there are

8808
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:51,119
vastly more problems than there are
 

8809
02:10:51,119 --> 02:10:52,950
vastly more problems than there are
algorithms so basically anything you can

8810
02:10:52,950 --> 02:10:52,960
algorithms so basically anything you can
 

8811
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:54,149
algorithms so basically anything you can
come up with for the most part almost

8812
02:10:54,149 --> 02:10:54,159
come up with for the most part almost
 

8813
02:10:54,159 --> 02:10:56,149
come up with for the most part almost
certainly is not solvable by a computer

8814
02:10:56,149 --> 02:10:56,159
certainly is not solvable by a computer
 

8815
02:10:56,159 --> 02:10:57,270
certainly is not solvable by a computer
you know and then and then he was like

8816
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,280
you know and then and then he was like
 

8817
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:58,950
you know and then and then he was like
let me give a particular example and he

8818
02:10:58,950 --> 02:10:58,960
let me give a particular example and he
 

8819
02:10:58,960 --> 02:11:00,470
let me give a particular example and he
figured out the very first computability

8820
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:00,480
figured out the very first computability
 

8821
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:01,750
figured out the very first computability
proof and he said let's just walk

8822
02:11:01,750 --> 02:11:01,760
proof and he said let's just walk
 

8823
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:02,790
proof and he said let's just walk
through with a little bit of simple

8824
02:11:02,790 --> 02:11:02,800
through with a little bit of simple
 

8825
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:03,589
through with a little bit of simple
logic

8826
02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:03,599
logic
 

8827
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:05,030
logic
the halting problem can't be solved by

8828
02:11:05,030 --> 02:11:05,040
the halting problem can't be solved by
 

8829
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:07,109
the halting problem can't be solved by
an algorithm and that kicked off the

8830
02:11:07,109 --> 02:11:07,119
an algorithm and that kicked off the
 

8831
02:11:07,119 --> 02:11:07,910
an algorithm and that kicked off the
whole

8832
02:11:07,910 --> 02:11:07,920

02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:13,599
algorithms some things can't be solved
 

8839
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:14,950
algorithms some things can't be solved
by computers and we've just been doing

8840
02:11:14,950 --> 02:11:14,960
by computers and we've just been doing
 

8841
02:11:14,960 --> 02:11:16,229
by computers and we've just been doing
theory on that

8842
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
theory on that
 

8843
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:18,470
theory on that
since the that was the 30s he wrote that

8844
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:18,480
since the that was the 30s he wrote that
 

8845
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,550
since the that was the 30s he wrote that
so proving that something is impossible

8846
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:20,560
so proving that something is impossible
 

8847
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:22,550
so proving that something is impossible
uh this is sort of a more a stricter

8848
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:22,560
uh this is sort of a more a stricter
 

8849
02:11:22,560 --> 02:11:24,069
uh this is sort of a more a stricter
version of that is it like proving

8850
02:11:24,069 --> 02:11:24,079
version of that is it like proving
 

8851
02:11:24,079 --> 02:11:24,950
version of that is it like proving
bounds on

8852
02:11:24,950 --> 02:11:24,960
bounds on
 

8853
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:26,709
bounds on
on the performance of different

8854
02:11:26,709 --> 02:11:26,719
on the performance of different
 

8855
02:11:26,719 --> 02:11:28,069
on the performance of different
algorithms yeah so those are yeah so

8856
02:11:28,069 --> 02:11:28,079
algorithms yeah so those are yeah so
 

8857
02:11:28,079 --> 02:11:30,149
algorithms yeah so those are yeah so
bounds are upper bounds right so you say

8858
02:11:30,149 --> 02:11:30,159
bounds are upper bounds right so you say
 

8859
02:11:30,159 --> 02:11:32,550
bounds are upper bounds right so you say
uh this algorithm does at least this

8860
02:11:32,550 --> 02:11:32,560
uh this algorithm does at least this
 

8861
02:11:32,560 --> 02:11:33,750
uh this algorithm does at least this
well and no worse than this but you're

8862
02:11:33,750 --> 02:11:33,760
well and no worse than this but you're
 

8863
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:35,510
well and no worse than this but you're
looking at a particular algorithm

8864
02:11:35,510 --> 02:11:35,520
looking at a particular algorithm
 

8865
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,149
looking at a particular algorithm
and possibility proof say no algorithm

8866
02:11:38,149 --> 02:11:38,159
and possibility proof say no algorithm
 

8867
02:11:38,159 --> 02:11:39,030
and possibility proof say no algorithm
ever

8868
02:11:39,030 --> 02:11:39,040
ever
 

8869
02:11:39,040 --> 02:11:40,390
ever
could ever solve this problem so no

8870
02:11:40,390 --> 02:11:40,400
could ever solve this problem so no
 

8871
02:11:40,400 --> 02:11:41,669
could ever solve this problem so no
algorithm could ever solve the halting

8872
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
algorithm could ever solve the halting
 

8873
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:42,310
algorithm could ever solve the halting
problem

8874
02:11:42,310 --> 02:11:42,320
problem
 

8875
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:44,950
problem
so it's problem-centric it's it's making

8876
02:11:44,950 --> 02:11:44,960
so it's problem-centric it's it's making
 

8877
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,149
so it's problem-centric it's it's making
something diff

8878
02:11:46,149 --> 02:11:46,159
something diff
 

8879
02:11:46,159 --> 02:11:47,990
something diff
making a conclusive statement about the

8880
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:48,000
making a conclusive statement about the
 

8881
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,470
making a conclusive statement about the
problem and that's somehow satisfying

8882
02:11:50,470 --> 02:11:50,480
problem and that's somehow satisfying
 

8883
02:11:50,480 --> 02:11:51,589
problem and that's somehow satisfying
because it's uh

8884
02:11:51,589 --> 02:11:51,599
because it's uh
 

8885
02:11:51,599 --> 02:11:53,589
because it's uh
just philosophically interesting yeah i

8886
02:11:53,589 --> 02:11:53,599
just philosophically interesting yeah i
 

8887
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:54,709
just philosophically interesting yeah i
mean it all goes back to

8888
02:11:54,709 --> 02:11:54,719
mean it all goes back to
 

8889
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:56,629
mean it all goes back to
you you get back to plato it's all uh

8890
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
you you get back to plato it's all uh
 

8891
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,149
you you get back to plato it's all uh
reductive ad absurdum

8892
02:11:58,149 --> 02:11:58,159
reductive ad absurdum
 

8893
02:11:58,159 --> 02:11:59,589
reductive ad absurdum
so all these arguments have to start the

8894
02:11:59,589 --> 02:11:59,599
so all these arguments have to start the
 

8895
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:01,109
so all these arguments have to start the
only way to do it is there's an infinite

8896
02:12:01,109 --> 02:12:01,119
only way to do it is there's an infinite
 

8897
02:12:01,119 --> 02:12:02,390
only way to do it is there's an infinite
number of solutions you can't go through

8898
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:02,400
number of solutions you can't go through
 

8899
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,310
number of solutions you can't go through
them as you say let's assume

8900
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,320
them as you say let's assume
 

8901
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,550
them as you say let's assume
for the sake of contradiction that there

8902
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:06,560
for the sake of contradiction that there
 

8903
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:08,069
for the sake of contradiction that there
existed something that solves this

8904
02:12:08,069 --> 02:12:08,079
existed something that solves this
 

8905
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:08,870
existed something that solves this
problem

8906
02:12:08,870 --> 02:12:08,880
problem
 

8907
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:10,069
problem
and then you turn the crank of logic

8908
02:12:10,069 --> 02:12:10,079
and then you turn the crank of logic
 

8909
02:12:10,079 --> 02:12:11,750
and then you turn the crank of logic
until you blow up the universe and then

8910
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:11,760
until you blow up the universe and then
 

8911
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:13,030
until you blow up the universe and then
you go back and say okay our original

8912
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:13,040
you go back and say okay our original
 

8913
02:12:13,040 --> 02:12:13,910
you go back and say okay our original

8921
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:20,950
really exciting kind of beautiful thing
it's what i specialize in within

what are distributed i don't know this

what are distributed i don't know this
 

9011
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:45,510
what are distributed i don't know this
come i have no idea and what is smooth

9012
02:13:45,510 --> 02:13:45,520
come i have no idea and what is smooth
 

9013
02:13:45,520 --> 02:13:47,030
come i have no idea and what is smooth
analysis yeah well okay so

9014
02:13:47,030 --> 02:13:47,040
analysis yeah well okay so
 

9015
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:49,430
analysis yeah well okay so
so smooth analysis it's so it wasn't my

9016
02:13:49,430 --> 02:13:49,440
so smooth analysis it's so it wasn't my
 

9017
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,510
so smooth analysis it's so it wasn't my

9019
02:13:51,520 --> 02:13:53,350
idea so spielman and tang
came up with this in the context of

9020
02:13:53,350 --> 02:13:53,360
came up with this in the context of
 

9021
02:13:53,360 --> 02:13:55,270
came up with this in the context of
sequential algorithms so just like

9022
02:13:55,270 --> 02:13:55,280
sequential algorithms so just like
 

9023
02:13:55,280 --> 02:13:56,950
sequential algorithms so just like
uh the normal world of an algorithm that

9024
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:56,960
uh the normal world of an algorithm that
 

9025
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,470
uh the normal world of an algorithm that
runs on a computer

runs on a computer
 

9027
02:13:58,480 --> 02:13:59,750
runs on a computer
and they were they were looking at

9028
02:13:59,750 --> 02:13:59,760
and they were they were looking at
 

9029
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:01,510
and they were they were looking at
there's a well-known algorithm

9030
02:14:01,510 --> 02:14:01,520
there's a well-known algorithm
 

9031
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:02,870
there's a well-known algorithm
called the simplex algorithm but

9032
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:02,880
called the simplex algorithm but
 

9033
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:05,109
called the simplex algorithm but
basically you're trying to whatever find

9034
02:14:05,109 --> 02:14:05,119
basically you're trying to whatever find
 

9035
02:14:05,119 --> 02:14:05,990
basically you're trying to whatever find
a

9036
02:14:05,990 --> 02:14:06,000
a

02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,350
a
hole around a group of points and

9038
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:07,360
hole around a group of points and
 

9039
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:08,709
hole around a group of points and
there's an algorithm that worked really

9040
02:14:08,709 --> 02:14:08,719
there's an algorithm that worked really
 

9041
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:10,229
there's an algorithm that worked really
well in practice

9042
02:14:10,229 --> 02:14:10,239
well in practice
 

9043
02:14:10,239 --> 02:14:11,669
well in practice
but when you analyze it you would say

9044
02:14:11,669 --> 02:14:11,679
but when you analyze it you would say
 

9045
02:14:11,679 --> 02:14:13,109
but when you analyze it you would say
you know i can't guarantee it's going to

9046
02:14:13,109 --> 02:14:13,119
you know i can't guarantee it's going to
 

9047
02:14:13,119 --> 02:14:14,149
you know i can't guarantee it's going to
work well in practice because if you

9048
02:14:14,149 --> 02:14:14,159
work well in practice because if you
 

9049
02:14:14,159 --> 02:14:15,750
work well in practice because if you
have just the right

9050
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:15,760
have just the right
 

9051
02:14:15,760 --> 02:14:18,149
have just the right
inputs this thing could run really long

9052
02:14:18,149 --> 02:14:18,159
inputs this thing could run really long
 

9053
02:14:18,159 --> 02:14:19,830
inputs this thing could run really long
right but in practice it seemed to be

9054
02:14:19,830 --> 02:14:19,840
right but in practice it seemed to be
 

9055
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:20,709
right but in practice it seemed to be
really fast so

9056
02:14:20,709 --> 02:14:20,719
really fast so
 

9057
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:22,310
really fast so
smooth analysis as they came in and they

9058
02:14:22,310 --> 02:14:22,320
smooth analysis as they came in and they
 

9059
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,229
smooth analysis as they came in and they
said let's assume that

02:14:24,229 --> 02:14:24,239
said let's assume that
 

9061
02:14:24,239 --> 02:14:26,149
said let's assume that
a bad guy chooses the inputs it could be

a bad guy chooses the inputs it could be
 

9063
02:14:26,159 --> 02:14:27,669
a bad guy chooses the inputs it could be
anything like really bad ones

9064
02:14:27,669 --> 02:14:27,679
anything like really bad ones
 

9065
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:29,270
anything like really bad ones
and all we're going to do is because and

02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:29,280
and all we're going to do is because and
 

9067

this this lower bound this this idea

9084
02:14:42,149 --> 02:14:42,159
this this lower bound this this idea
 

9085
02:14:42,159 --> 02:14:44,149
this this lower bound this this idea
that it could sometimes run really long

that it could sometimes run really long
 

9087
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,669
that it could sometimes run really long
was a fragile bound because it could

9088
02:14:45,669 --> 02:14:45,679
was a fragile bound because it could
 

9089
02:14:45,679 --> 02:14:47,270
was a fragile bound because it could
only run a really long time if you had

9090
02:14:47,270 --> 02:14:47,280
only run a really long time if you had
 

9091
02:14:47,280 --> 02:14:49,750
only run a really long time if you had
exactly the worst pathological input so

9092
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
exactly the worst pathological input so
 

9093
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,270
exactly the worst pathological input so
then my collaborators and i brought this

9094
02:14:51,270 --> 02:14:51,280
then my collaborators and i brought this
 

9095
02:14:51,280 --> 02:14:52,470
then my collaborators and i brought this
over to the world of distributed

02:14:54,790 --> 02:14:54,800
we brought them over the general lower
 

9101
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:56,149
we brought them over the general lower
bounds right so so in the world of

9102
02:14:56,149 --> 02:14:56,159
bounds right so so in the world of
 

9103
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:57,990
bounds right so so in the world of
dynamic networks

9104
02:14:57,990 --> 02:14:58,000
dynamic networks
 

9105
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,350
dynamic networks
so distributed algorithm is a bunch of

9106
02:14:59,350 --> 02:14:59,360
so distributed algorithm is a bunch of
 

9107
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:01,030
so distributed algorithm is a bunch of
algorithms on different machines talking

9108
02:15:01,030 --> 02:15:01,040
algorithms on different machines talking
 

9109
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:02,310
algorithms on different machines talking
to each other

9110
02:15:02,310 --> 02:15:02,320
to each other
 

9111
02:15:02,320 --> 02:15:03,430
to each other
trying to solve a problem and sometimes

9112
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:03,440
trying to solve a problem and sometimes
 

9113
02:15:03,440 --> 02:15:05,510
trying to solve a problem and sometimes
they're in a network so you imagine them

9114
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:05,520
they're in a network so you imagine them
 

9115
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,270
they're in a network so you imagine them
connected with network links

9116
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:07,280
connected with network links
 

9117
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:09,589
connected with network links
and a dynamic network those can change

9118
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
and a dynamic network those can change
 

9119
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:11,350
and a dynamic network those can change
right so i was talking to you but now i

9120
02:15:11,350 --> 02:15:11,360
right so i was talking to you but now i
 

9121
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:12,310
right so i was talking to you but now i
can't talk to you anymore and i'm

9122
02:15:12,310 --> 02:15:12,320
can't talk to you anymore and i'm
 

9123
02:15:12,320 --> 02:15:13,830
can't talk to you anymore and i'm
connected to a person over here

9124
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:13,840
connected to a person over here
 

9125
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:15,189
connected to a person over here
it's a really hard environment

9126
02:15:15,189 --> 02:15:15,199
it's a really hard environment
 

9127
02:15:15,199 --> 02:15:17,189
it's a really hard environment
mathematically speaking and there's

9128
02:15:17,189 --> 02:15:17,199
mathematically speaking and there's
 

9129
02:15:17,199 --> 02:15:18,870
mathematically speaking and there's
a lot of really strong lower bounds

9130
02:15:18,870 --> 02:15:18,880
a lot of really strong lower bounds
 

9131
02:15:18,880 --> 02:15:20,069
a lot of really strong lower bounds
which you could imagine if the network

9132
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:20,079
which you could imagine if the network
 

9133
02:15:20,079 --> 02:15:22,550
which you could imagine if the network
can change all the time and a bad guy's

9134
02:15:22,550 --> 02:15:22,560
can change all the time and a bad guy's
 

9135
02:15:22,560 --> 02:15:23,350
can change all the time and a bad guy's
doing it

9136
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:23,360
doing it
 

9137
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:24,950
doing it
it's like hard to do things well so

9138
02:15:24,950 --> 02:15:24,960
it's like hard to do things well so
 

9139
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:26,629
it's like hard to do things well so
there's an algorithm running on every

9140
02:15:26,629 --> 02:15:26,639
there's an algorithm running on every
 

9141
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:28,310
there's an algorithm running on every
single node in the network yeah

9142
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:28,320
single node in the network yeah
 

9143
02:15:28,320 --> 02:15:29,589
single node in the network yeah
and then you're trying to say some

9144
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:29,599
and then you're trying to say some
 

9145
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,350
and then you're trying to say some
something of any kind that makes any

9146
02:15:31,350 --> 02:15:31,360
something of any kind that makes any
 

9147
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,430
something of any kind that makes any
kind of definitive sense about

9148
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:33,440
kind of definitive sense about
 

9149
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:34,790
kind of definitive sense about
the performance of that algorithm yeah

9150
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:34,800
the performance of that algorithm yeah
 

9151
02:15:34,800 --> 02:15:36,709
the performance of that algorithm yeah
so like uh we're sorry i just submitted

9152
02:15:36,709 --> 02:15:36,719
so like uh we're sorry i just submitted
 

9153
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:38,149
so like uh we're sorry i just submitted
a new paper on this a couple weeks ago

9154
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
a new paper on this a couple weeks ago
 

9155
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:39,430
a new paper on this a couple weeks ago
and we were looking at a very simple

9156
02:15:39,430 --> 02:15:39,440
and we were looking at a very simple
 

9157
02:15:39,440 --> 02:15:40,069
and we were looking at a very simple
problem there's

9158
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
problem there's
 

9159
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:42,149
problem there's
there's uh some messages in the network

9160
02:15:42,149 --> 02:15:42,159
there's uh some messages in the network
 

9161
02:15:42,159 --> 02:15:44,069
there's uh some messages in the network
we want everyone to get them

9162
02:15:44,069 --> 02:15:44,079
we want everyone to get them
 

9163
02:15:44,079 --> 02:15:47,109
we want everyone to get them
if the network doesn't change you can do

9164
02:15:47,109 --> 02:15:47,119
if the network doesn't change you can do
 

9165
02:15:47,119 --> 02:15:48,470
if the network doesn't change you can do
this pretty well you can pipeline them

9166
02:15:48,470 --> 02:15:48,480
this pretty well you can pipeline them
 

9167
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:50,149
this pretty well you can pipeline them
there's some algorithms that work

9168
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:50,159
there's some algorithms that work
 

9169
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:51,830
there's some algorithms that work
basic algorithms that work really well

9170
02:15:51,830 --> 02:15:51,840
basic algorithms that work really well
 

9171
02:15:51,840 --> 02:15:53,910
basic algorithms that work really well
if network can change every round

9172
02:15:53,910 --> 02:15:53,920
if network can change every round
 

9173
02:15:53,920 --> 02:15:56,870
if network can change every round
there's these lower bounds that says uh

9174
02:15:56,870 --> 02:15:56,880
there's these lower bounds that says uh
 

9175
02:15:56,880 --> 02:15:58,149
there's these lower bounds that says uh
it takes a really long time there's a

9176
02:15:58,149 --> 02:15:58,159
it takes a really long time there's a
 

9177
02:15:58,159 --> 02:15:59,430
it takes a really long time there's a
way that like no matter what algorithm

9178
02:15:59,430 --> 02:15:59,440
way that like no matter what algorithm
 

9179
02:15:59,440 --> 02:16:00,629
way that like no matter what algorithm
you come up with there's a way the

9180
02:16:00,629 --> 02:16:00,639
you come up with there's a way the
 

9181
02:16:00,639 --> 02:16:02,149
you come up with there's a way the
network can change in such a way that

9182
02:16:02,149 --> 02:16:02,159
network can change in such a way that
 

9183
02:16:02,159 --> 02:16:02,709
network can change in such a way that
just

9184
02:16:02,709 --> 02:16:02,719
just
 

9185
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:04,390
just
really slows down your progress

9186
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
really slows down your progress
 

9187
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:06,709
really slows down your progress
basically right so smooth analysis there

9188
02:16:06,709 --> 02:16:06,719
basically right so smooth analysis there
 

9189
02:16:06,719 --> 02:16:08,229
basically right so smooth analysis there
says yeah but that seems like a

9190
02:16:08,229 --> 02:16:08,239
says yeah but that seems like a
 

9191
02:16:08,239 --> 02:16:10,069
says yeah but that seems like a
really you'd have really bad luck if

9192
02:16:10,069 --> 02:16:10,079
really you'd have really bad luck if
 

9193
02:16:10,079 --> 02:16:13,669
really you'd have really bad luck if
your network was changing like exactly

9194
02:16:13,669 --> 02:16:13,679
your network was changing like exactly
 

9195
02:16:13,679 --> 02:16:14,950
your network was changing like exactly
in the right way that you needed to

9196
02:16:14,950 --> 02:16:14,960
in the right way that you needed to
 

9197
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,629
in the right way that you needed to
screw your algorithm so we said what if

9198
02:16:16,629 --> 02:16:16,639
screw your algorithm so we said what if
 

9199
02:16:16,639 --> 02:16:17,669
screw your algorithm so we said what if
we uh

9200
02:16:17,669 --> 02:16:17,679
we uh
 

9201
02:16:17,679 --> 02:16:19,669
we uh
randomly just add or remove a couple

9202
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679
randomly just add or remove a couple
 

9203
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:21,109
randomly just add or remove a couple
edges in every round so the adversary's

9204
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
edges in every round so the adversary's
 

9205
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:22,149
edges in every round so the adversary's
trying to choose the worst possible

9206
02:16:22,149 --> 02:16:22,159
trying to choose the worst possible
 

9207
02:16:22,159 --> 02:16:22,950
trying to choose the worst possible
network we're just

9208
02:16:22,950 --> 02:16:22,960
network we're just
 

9209
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,950
network we're just
tweaking it a little bit and in that

9210
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:24,960
tweaking it a little bit and in that
 

9211
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,390
tweaking it a little bit and in that
case this is a new paper i mean

9212
02:16:26,390 --> 02:16:26,400
case this is a new paper i mean
 

9213
02:16:26,400 --> 02:16:27,669
case this is a new paper i mean
it's a blind submission so maybe i

9214
02:16:27,669 --> 02:16:27,679
it's a blind submission so maybe i
 

9215
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,589
it's a blind submission so maybe i
shouldn't it's not whatever

9216
02:16:29,589 --> 02:16:29,599
shouldn't it's not whatever
 

9217
02:16:29,599 --> 02:16:32,230
shouldn't it's not whatever
um we basically showed an anonymous

9218
02:16:32,230 --> 02:16:32,240
um we basically showed an anonymous
 

9219
02:16:32,240 --> 02:16:33,509
um we basically showed an anonymous
friend of yours submitted a paper

9220
02:16:33,509 --> 02:16:33,519
friend of yours submitted a paper
 

9221
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:35,270
friend of yours submitted a paper
anonymous friend of mine yeah

9222
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:35,280
anonymous friend of mine yeah
 

9223
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:37,830
anonymous friend of mine yeah
yeah whose paper should be accepted so

9224
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:37,840
yeah whose paper should be accepted so
 

9225
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:39,509
yeah whose paper should be accepted so
that even just adding like one random

9226
02:16:39,509 --> 02:16:39,519
that even just adding like one random
 

9227
02:16:39,519 --> 02:16:40,950
that even just adding like one random
edge per round

9228
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:40,960
edge per round
 

9229
02:16:40,960 --> 02:16:43,110
edge per round
you uh the here's the cool thing about

9230
02:16:43,110 --> 02:16:43,120
you uh the here's the cool thing about
 

9231
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:45,110
you uh the here's the cool thing about
the simplest possible solution to this

9232
02:16:45,110 --> 02:16:45,120
the simplest possible solution to this
 

9233
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:45,990
the simplest possible solution to this
problem

9234
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:46,000
problem
 

9235
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,349
problem
blows away that lower bound it does

9236
02:16:47,349 --> 02:16:47,359
blows away that lower bound it does
 

9237
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:48,870
blows away that lower bound it does
really well so that's like a very

9238
02:16:48,870 --> 02:16:48,880
really well so that's like a very
 

9239
02:16:48,880 --> 02:16:50,469
really well so that's like a very
fragile lower bound because we're like

9240
02:16:50,469 --> 02:16:50,479
fragile lower bound because we're like
 

9241
02:16:50,479 --> 02:16:50,950
fragile lower bound because we're like
it's

9242
02:16:50,950 --> 02:16:50,960
it's
 

9243
02:16:50,960 --> 02:16:54,309
it's
it's almost impossible to actually

9244
02:16:54,309 --> 02:16:54,319
it's almost impossible to actually
 

9245
02:16:54,319 --> 02:16:57,030
it's almost impossible to actually
keep things slow i wonder how many lower

9246
02:16:57,030 --> 02:16:57,040
keep things slow i wonder how many lower
 

9247
02:16:57,040 --> 02:16:59,190
keep things slow i wonder how many lower
bounds you can smash

9248
02:16:59,190 --> 02:16:59,200
bounds you can smash
 

9249
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:01,270
bounds you can smash
open with this kind of analysis and show

9250
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
open with this kind of analysis and show
 

9251
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:02,230
open with this kind of analysis and show
that they're fragile

9252
02:17:02,230 --> 02:17:02,240
that they're fragile
 

9253
02:17:02,240 --> 02:17:03,990
that they're fragile
it's my interest yeah because in

9254
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:04,000
it's my interest yeah because in
 

9255
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,509
it's my interest yeah because in
distributed algorithms

9256
02:17:05,509 --> 02:17:05,519
distributed algorithms
 

9257
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:07,270
distributed algorithms
there's a ton of really famous strong

9258
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:07,280
there's a ton of really famous strong
 

9259
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:10,469
there's a ton of really famous strong
lower bounds but things have to go wrong

9260
02:17:10,469 --> 02:17:10,479
lower bounds but things have to go wrong
 

9261
02:17:10,479 --> 02:17:12,790
lower bounds but things have to go wrong
really really wrong for these lower

9262
02:17:12,790 --> 02:17:12,800
really really wrong for these lower
 

9263
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,389
really really wrong for these lower
bound arguments to work

9264
02:17:14,389 --> 02:17:14,399
bound arguments to work
 

9265
02:17:14,399 --> 02:17:15,990
bound arguments to work
and so i like this approach so this this

9266
02:17:15,990 --> 02:17:16,000
and so i like this approach so this this
 

9267
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,910
and so i like this approach so this this
whole notion of fragile versus robust i

9268
02:17:17,910 --> 02:17:17,920
whole notion of fragile versus robust i
 

9269
02:17:17,920 --> 02:17:19,190
whole notion of fragile versus robust i
was like well let's go in and

9270
02:17:19,190 --> 02:17:19,200
was like well let's go in and
 

9271
02:17:19,200 --> 02:17:21,030
was like well let's go in and
just throw a little noise in there and

9272
02:17:21,030 --> 02:17:21,040
just throw a little noise in there and
 

9273
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:22,709
just throw a little noise in there and
if it becomes solvable

9274
02:17:22,709 --> 02:17:22,719
if it becomes solvable
 

9275
02:17:22,719 --> 02:17:23,990
if it becomes solvable
then maybe that lower bound wasn't

9276
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,000
then maybe that lower bound wasn't
 

9277
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:25,349
then maybe that lower bound wasn't
really something we should worry about

9278
02:17:25,349 --> 02:17:25,359
really something we should worry about
 

9279
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:25,830
really something we should worry about
you know

9280
02:17:25,830 --> 02:17:25,840
you know
 

9281
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,589
you know
that's gonna embarrass that's really

9282
02:17:27,589 --> 02:17:27,599
that's gonna embarrass that's really
 

9283
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:29,910
that's gonna embarrass that's really
uncomfortable that's really embarrassing

9284
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:29,920
uncomfortable that's really embarrassing
 

9285
02:17:29,920 --> 02:17:32,230
uncomfortable that's really embarrassing
to a lot of people because okay this is

9286
02:17:32,230 --> 02:17:32,240
to a lot of people because okay this is
 

9287
02:17:32,240 --> 02:17:33,910
to a lot of people because okay this is
the ocd thing with the

9288
02:17:33,910 --> 02:17:33,920
the ocd thing with the
 

9289
02:17:33,920 --> 02:17:36,709
the ocd thing with the
with the spaces is it feels really good

9290
02:17:36,709 --> 02:17:36,719
with the spaces is it feels really good
 

9291
02:17:36,719 --> 02:17:38,950
with the spaces is it feels really good
when you can prove a nice bound

9292
02:17:38,950 --> 02:17:38,960
when you can prove a nice bound
 

9293
02:17:38,960 --> 02:17:41,669
when you can prove a nice bound
and uh if you say that that bond is

9294
02:17:41,669 --> 02:17:41,679
and uh if you say that that bond is
 

9295
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:42,950
and uh if you say that that bond is
fragile

9296
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:42,960
fragile
 

9297
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:44,950
fragile
yeah that that's that's like there's

9298
02:17:44,950 --> 02:17:44,960
yeah that that's that's like there's
 

9299
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,870
yeah that that's that's like there's
going to be a sad kid that walks

9300
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:46,880
going to be a sad kid that walks
 

9301
02:17:46,880 --> 02:17:49,589
going to be a sad kid that walks
uh like with their lunchbox back home

9302
02:17:49,589 --> 02:17:49,599
uh like with their lunchbox back home
 

9303
02:17:49,599 --> 02:17:50,230
uh like with their lunchbox back home
like yeah

9304
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:50,240
like yeah
 

9305
02:17:50,240 --> 02:17:52,549
like yeah
my my lower bond doesn't matter no i

9306
02:17:52,549 --> 02:17:52,559
my my lower bond doesn't matter no i
 

9307
02:17:52,559 --> 02:17:53,990
my my lower bond doesn't matter no i
don't think they care it's all

9308
02:17:53,990 --> 02:17:54,000
don't think they care it's all
 

9309
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:55,270
don't think they care it's all
and i don't know it feels like to me a

9310
02:17:55,270 --> 02:17:55,280
and i don't know it feels like to me a
 

9311
02:17:55,280 --> 02:17:57,270
and i don't know it feels like to me a
lot of this theory is just math muchismo

9312
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:57,280
lot of this theory is just math muchismo
 

9313
02:17:57,280 --> 02:17:58,629
lot of this theory is just math muchismo
yeah it's like whatever this was a hard

9314
02:17:58,629 --> 02:17:58,639
yeah it's like whatever this was a hard
 

9315
02:17:58,639 --> 02:18:00,469
yeah it's like whatever this was a hard
bound to prove yeah do you

9316
02:18:00,469 --> 02:18:00,479
bound to prove yeah do you
 

9317
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:02,230
bound to prove yeah do you
what do you think about that like uh so

9318
02:18:02,230 --> 02:18:02,240
what do you think about that like uh so
 

9319
02:18:02,240 --> 02:18:03,589
what do you think about that like uh so
if you show that something is fragile

9320
02:18:03,589 --> 02:18:03,599
if you show that something is fragile
 

9321
02:18:03,599 --> 02:18:04,549
if you show that something is fragile
that's more important

9322
02:18:04,549 --> 02:18:04,559
that's more important
 

9323
02:18:04,559 --> 02:18:06,549
that's more important
that's really important for in practice

9324
02:18:06,549 --> 02:18:06,559
that's really important for in practice
 

9325
02:18:06,559 --> 02:18:08,150
that's really important for in practice
right uh

9326
02:18:08,150 --> 02:18:08,160
right uh
 

9327
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:09,910
right uh
so do you think kind of theoretical

9328
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:09,920
so do you think kind of theoretical
 

9329
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:11,669
so do you think kind of theoretical
computer science is living its own world

9330
02:18:11,669 --> 02:18:11,679
computer science is living its own world
 

9331
02:18:11,679 --> 02:18:12,950
computer science is living its own world
just like mathematics

9332
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:12,960
just like mathematics
 

9333
02:18:12,960 --> 02:18:15,270
just like mathematics
yeah and their main effort which i think

9334
02:18:15,270 --> 02:18:15,280
yeah and their main effort which i think
 

9335
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:17,190
yeah and their main effort which i think
is very valuable is to develop ideas

9336
02:18:17,190 --> 02:18:17,200
is very valuable is to develop ideas
 

9337
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:18,629
is very valuable is to develop ideas
it's not necessarily

9338
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
it's not necessarily
 

9339
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,230
it's not necessarily
interesting whether it's applicable in

9340
02:18:20,230 --> 02:18:20,240
interesting whether it's applicable in
 

9341
02:18:20,240 --> 02:18:21,669
interesting whether it's applicable in
the real world yeah we don't care about

9342
02:18:21,669 --> 02:18:21,679
the real world yeah we don't care about
 

9343
02:18:21,679 --> 02:18:23,349
the real world yeah we don't care about
the applicability yeah like we kind of

9344
02:18:23,349 --> 02:18:23,359
the applicability yeah like we kind of
 

9345
02:18:23,359 --> 02:18:24,469
the applicability yeah like we kind of
do but not really

9346
02:18:24,469 --> 02:18:24,479
do but not really
 

9347
02:18:24,479 --> 02:18:26,150
do but not really
we're terrible with computers and can't

9348
02:18:26,150 --> 02:18:26,160
we're terrible with computers and can't
 

9349
02:18:26,160 --> 02:18:27,750
we're terrible with computers and can't
do anything useful with computers and we

9350
02:18:27,750 --> 02:18:27,760
do anything useful with computers and we
 

9351
02:18:27,760 --> 02:18:28,790
do anything useful with computers and we
don't know how to code and

9352
02:18:28,790 --> 02:18:28,800
don't know how to code and
 

9353
02:18:28,800 --> 02:18:30,549
don't know how to code and
and you know we're not we're not

9354
02:18:30,549 --> 02:18:30,559
and you know we're not we're not
 

9355
02:18:30,559 --> 02:18:32,629
and you know we're not we're not
productive members of like technological

9356
02:18:32,629 --> 02:18:32,639
productive members of like technological
 

9357
02:18:32,639 --> 02:18:33,589
productive members of like technological
society but

9358
02:18:33,589 --> 02:18:33,599
society but
 

9359
02:18:33,599 --> 02:18:36,709
society but
i do think things percolate exactly you

9360
02:18:36,709 --> 02:18:36,719
i do think things percolate exactly you
 

9361
02:18:36,719 --> 02:18:38,469
i do think things percolate exactly you
percolate from the the world of theory

9362
02:18:38,469 --> 02:18:38,479
percolate from the the world of theory
 

9363
02:18:38,479 --> 02:18:40,230
percolate from the the world of theory
into the world of algorithm design which

9364
02:18:40,230 --> 02:18:40,240
into the world of algorithm design which
 

9365
02:18:40,240 --> 02:18:41,750
into the world of algorithm design which
will pull on the theory and now suddenly

9366
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:41,760
will pull on the theory and now suddenly
 

9367
02:18:41,760 --> 02:18:42,790
will pull on the theory and now suddenly
it's useful

9368
02:18:42,790 --> 02:18:42,800
it's useful
 

9369
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,389
it's useful
uh and then the algorithm design gets

9370
02:18:44,389 --> 02:18:44,399
uh and then the algorithm design gets
 

9371
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:45,669
uh and then the algorithm design gets
pulled into the world of practice where

9372
02:18:45,669 --> 02:18:45,679
pulled into the world of practice where
 

9373
02:18:45,679 --> 02:18:46,709
pulled into the world of practice where
they say well actually we can make this

9374
02:18:46,709 --> 02:18:46,719
they say well actually we can make this
 

9375
02:18:46,719 --> 02:18:47,910
they say well actually we can make this
algorithm a lot better because in

9376
02:18:47,910 --> 02:18:47,920
algorithm a lot better because in
 

9377
02:18:47,920 --> 02:18:49,910
algorithm a lot better because in
practice really these servers do xyz and

9378
02:18:49,910 --> 02:18:49,920
practice really these servers do xyz and
 

9379
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:51,429
practice really these servers do xyz and
now we can make this super efficient

9380
02:18:51,429 --> 02:18:51,439
now we can make this super efficient
 

9381
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:53,750
now we can make this super efficient
and so i do think i mean i tell my i

9382
02:18:53,750 --> 02:18:53,760
and so i do think i mean i tell my i
 

9383
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:55,509
and so i do think i mean i tell my i
teach theory to the phd students at

9384
02:18:55,509 --> 02:18:55,519
teach theory to the phd students at
 

9385
02:18:55,519 --> 02:18:56,309
teach theory to the phd students at
georgetown

9386
02:18:56,309 --> 02:18:56,319
georgetown
 

9387
02:18:56,319 --> 02:18:58,709
georgetown
i show them the sort of funnel of like

9388
02:18:58,709 --> 02:18:58,719
i show them the sort of funnel of like
 

9389
02:18:58,719 --> 02:19:00,150
i show them the sort of funnel of like
okay we're over here doing theory but it

9390
02:19:00,150 --> 02:19:00,160
okay we're over here doing theory but it
 

9391
02:19:00,160 --> 02:19:00,790
okay we're over here doing theory but it
eventually

9392
02:19:00,790 --> 02:19:00,800
eventually
 

9393
02:19:00,800 --> 02:19:02,309
eventually
some of this stuff will percolate down

9394
02:19:02,309 --> 02:19:02,319
some of this stuff will percolate down
 

9395
02:19:02,319 --> 02:19:04,389
some of this stuff will percolate down
in effect at the very end you know a

9396
02:19:04,389 --> 02:19:04,399
in effect at the very end you know a
 

9397
02:19:04,399 --> 02:19:05,349
in effect at the very end you know a
phone

9398
02:19:05,349 --> 02:19:05,359
phone
 

9399
02:19:05,359 --> 02:19:08,389
phone
but it's a long it's a long tunnel but

9400
02:19:08,389 --> 02:19:08,399
but it's a long it's a long tunnel but
 

9401
02:19:08,399 --> 02:19:10,230
but it's a long it's a long tunnel but
the very question you're asking at the

9402
02:19:10,230 --> 02:19:10,240
the very question you're asking at the
 

9403
02:19:10,240 --> 02:19:11,669
the very question you're asking at the
the highest philosophical level is

9404
02:19:11,669 --> 02:19:11,679
the highest philosophical level is
 

9405
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:13,669
the highest philosophical level is
fascinating like if you take a system

9406
02:19:13,669 --> 02:19:13,679
fascinating like if you take a system
 

9407
02:19:13,679 --> 02:19:16,549
fascinating like if you take a system
a distributed system or a network and

9408
02:19:16,549 --> 02:19:16,559
a distributed system or a network and
 

9409
02:19:16,559 --> 02:19:18,309
a distributed system or a network and
introduce a little bit of noise

9410
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:18,319
introduce a little bit of noise
 

9411
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:21,990
introduce a little bit of noise
into it like how many problems of that

9412
02:19:21,990 --> 02:19:22,000
into it like how many problems of that
 

9413
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,190
into it like how many problems of that
nature

9414
02:19:23,190 --> 02:19:23,200
nature
 

9415
02:19:23,200 --> 02:19:25,750
nature
are fundamentally changed by that little

9416
02:19:25,750 --> 02:19:25,760
are fundamentally changed by that little
 

9417
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:27,429
are fundamentally changed by that little
introduction of noise

9418
02:19:27,429 --> 02:19:27,439
introduction of noise
 

9419
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:29,270
introduction of noise
yeah because it's all especially in

9420
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,280
yeah because it's all especially in
 

9421
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:30,790
yeah because it's all especially in
distributed algorithms the model is

9422
02:19:30,790 --> 02:19:30,800
distributed algorithms the model is
 

9423
02:19:30,800 --> 02:19:32,469
distributed algorithms the model is
everything like the way we work is we're

9424
02:19:32,469 --> 02:19:32,479
everything like the way we work is we're
 

9425
02:19:32,479 --> 02:19:33,990
everything like the way we work is we're
incredibly precise about

9426
02:19:33,990 --> 02:19:34,000
incredibly precise about
 

9427
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,070
incredibly precise about
here's exactly it's mathematical here's

9428
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:36,080
here's exactly it's mathematical here's
 

9429
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,750
here's exactly it's mathematical here's
exactly how the network works and it's a

9430
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:37,760
exactly how the network works and it's a
 

9431
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:38,790
exactly how the network works and it's a
state machine

9432
02:19:38,790 --> 02:19:38,800
state machine
 

9433
02:19:38,800 --> 02:19:40,150
state machine
algorithms are state machines there's

9434
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,160
algorithms are state machines there's
 

9435
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,589
algorithms are state machines there's
rounds and schedulers we're super

9436
02:19:41,589 --> 02:19:41,599
rounds and schedulers we're super
 

9437
02:19:41,599 --> 02:19:43,830
rounds and schedulers we're super
precise we can improve lower bounds

9438
02:19:43,830 --> 02:19:43,840
precise we can improve lower bounds
 

9439
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,110
precise we can improve lower bounds
but yeah often those lower those

9440
02:19:45,110 --> 02:19:45,120
but yeah often those lower those
 

9441
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:47,110
but yeah often those lower those
impossibility results really

9442
02:19:47,110 --> 02:19:47,120
impossibility results really
 

9443
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,590
impossibility results really
get at the hard edges of exactly how

9444
02:19:49,590 --> 02:19:49,600
get at the hard edges of exactly how
 

9445
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:51,190
get at the hard edges of exactly how
that model works so we'll we'll see if

9446
02:19:51,190 --> 02:19:51,200
that model works so we'll we'll see if
 

9447
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,030
that model works so we'll we'll see if
this goes so we we published a paper on

9448
02:19:53,030 --> 02:19:53,040
this goes so we we published a paper on
 

9449
02:19:53,040 --> 02:19:54,950
this goes so we we published a paper on
this that paper you mentioned

9450
02:19:54,950 --> 02:19:54,960
this that paper you mentioned
 

9451
02:19:54,960 --> 02:19:56,710
this that paper you mentioned
um that kind of introduced the idea to

9452
02:19:56,710 --> 02:19:56,720
um that kind of introduced the idea to
 

9453
02:19:56,720 --> 02:19:58,389
um that kind of introduced the idea to
the distributed algorithms world and i

9454
02:19:58,389 --> 02:19:58,399
the distributed algorithms world and i
 

9455
02:19:58,399 --> 02:19:59,190
the distributed algorithms world and i
think

9456
02:19:59,190 --> 02:19:59,200
think
 

9457
02:19:59,200 --> 02:20:01,190
think
that's got some traction and there's

9458
02:20:01,190 --> 02:20:01,200
that's got some traction and there's
 

9459
02:20:01,200 --> 02:20:02,469
that's got some traction and there's
been some follow-ups and we've just

9460
02:20:02,469 --> 02:20:02,479
been some follow-ups and we've just
 

9461
02:20:02,479 --> 02:20:03,750
been some follow-ups and we've just
submitted our

9462
02:20:03,750 --> 02:20:03,760
submitted our
 

9463
02:20:03,760 --> 02:20:06,309
submitted our
uh our next i mean honestly the issue

9464
02:20:06,309 --> 02:20:06,319
uh our next i mean honestly the issue
 

9465
02:20:06,319 --> 02:20:07,590
uh our next i mean honestly the issue
with the next is that like the result

9466
02:20:07,590 --> 02:20:07,600
with the next is that like the result
 

9467
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:09,110
with the next is that like the result
fell out so easily

9468
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:09,120
fell out so easily
 

9469
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,710
fell out so easily
and this is just a mathematical machismo

9470
02:20:10,710 --> 02:20:10,720
and this is just a mathematical machismo
 

9471
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:12,710
and this is just a mathematical machismo
problem in these in these fields is

9472
02:20:12,710 --> 02:20:12,720
problem in these in these fields is
 

9473
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,469
problem in these in these fields is
there's a good chance the paper won't be

9474

there's a good chance the paper won't be
 

9475
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:15,830
there's a good chance the paper won't be
accepted because there wasn't

9476
02:20:15,830 --> 02:20:15,840
accepted because there wasn't
 

9477
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,150
accepted because there wasn't
enough mathematical self-flagellation

9478
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
enough mathematical self-flagellation
 

9479
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,349
enough mathematical self-flagellation
that's such a nice

9480
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,359
that's such a nice
 

9481
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:21,750
that's such a nice
finding so even it's just showing that

9482
02:20:21,750 --> 02:20:21,760
finding so even it's just showing that
 

9483
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:22,469
finding so even it's just showing that
very few

very few
 

9485
02:20:22,479 --> 02:20:24,389
very few
just very little bit of noise yeah gonna

9486
02:20:24,389 --> 02:20:24,399
just very little bit of noise yeah gonna
 

9487
02:20:24,399 --> 02:20:25,830
just very little bit of noise yeah gonna
have a dramatic

9488
02:20:25,830 --> 02:20:25,840
have a dramatic
 

9489
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,910
have a dramatic
uh make a dramatic statement about uh it

9490
02:20:27,910 --> 02:20:27,920
uh make a dramatic statement about uh it
 

9491
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:29,270
uh make a dramatic statement about uh it
was a big surprise to us

9492
02:20:29,270 --> 02:20:29,280
was a big surprise to us
 

9493
02:20:29,280 --> 02:20:31,030
was a big surprise to us
but um once we figured out how to show

9494
02:20:31,030 --> 02:20:31,040
but um once we figured out how to show
 

9495
02:20:31,040 --> 02:20:33,990
but um once we figured out how to show
it it's not too hard

9496
02:20:33,990 --> 02:20:34,000
it it's not too hard

02:21:56,640 --> 02:21:57,830
is it tiger martin mit who's tag mark
yeah tech mark right

9582
02:21:57,830 --> 02:21:57,840
yeah tech mark right
 

9583
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,510
yeah tech mark right
so his notion has always been convincing

9584
02:21:59,510 --> 02:21:59,520
so his notion has always been convincing
 

9585
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:01,830
so his notion has always been convincing
to me uh

9586
02:22:01,830 --> 02:22:01,840
to me uh
 

9587
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:03,349
to me uh
that the fact that some of these models

9588
02:22:03,349 --> 02:22:03,359
that the fact that some of these models
 

9589
02:22:03,359 --> 02:22:05,670
that the fact that some of these models
are inscrutable is not fundamental to

9590
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:05,680
are inscrutable is not fundamental to
 

9591
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:06,710
are inscrutable is not fundamental to
them

9592
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:06,720
them
 

9593
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:07,910
them
and that we can we're going to get

9594
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:07,920
and that we can we're going to get
 

9595
02:22:07,920 --> 02:22:09,429
and that we can we're going to get
better and better because in the end you

9596
02:22:09,429 --> 02:22:09,439
better and better because in the end you
 

9597
02:22:09,439 --> 02:22:09,910
better and better because in the end you
know

9598
02:22:09,910 --> 02:22:09,920
know
 

9599
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:11,830
know
the reason why practicing computer

9600
02:22:11,830 --> 02:22:11,840
the reason why practicing computer
 

9601
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:14,150
the reason why practicing computer
scientists often who are doing ai

9602
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:14,160
scientists often who are doing ai
 

9603
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:15,830
scientists often who are doing ai
or working at ai on industry aren't like

9604
02:22:15,830 --> 02:22:15,840
or working at ai on industry aren't like
 

9605
02:22:15,840 --> 02:22:17,670
or working at ai on industry aren't like
worried about so much

9606
02:22:17,670 --> 02:22:17,680
worried about so much
 

9607
02:22:17,680 --> 02:22:19,510
worried about so much
existential threats is because they see

9608
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,520
existential threats is because they see
 

9609
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:21,110
existential threats is because they see
the reality is they're

9610
02:22:21,110 --> 02:22:21,120
the reality is they're
 

9611
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,870
the reality is they're
multiplying matrices with numpy or

9612
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:22,880
multiplying matrices with numpy or
 

9613
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:24,150
multiplying matrices with numpy or
something like this right yeah and

9614
02:22:24,150 --> 02:22:24,160
something like this right yeah and
 

9615
02:22:24,160 --> 02:22:25,750
something like this right yeah and
and tweaking constants and hoping that

9616
02:22:25,750 --> 02:22:25,760
and tweaking constants and hoping that
 

9617
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:27,349
and tweaking constants and hoping that
the classifier fitness

9618
02:22:27,349 --> 02:22:27,359
the classifier fitness
 

9619
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:29,510
the classifier fitness
yeah for god's sakes before the the

9620
02:22:29,510 --> 02:22:29,520
yeah for god's sakes before the the
 

9621
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,030
yeah for god's sakes before the the
submission deadline actually like gets

9622
02:22:31,030 --> 02:22:31,040
submission deadline actually like gets
 

9623
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:32,710
submission deadline actually like gets
above something like it feels like it's

9624
02:22:32,710 --> 02:22:32,720
above something like it feels like it's
 

9625
02:22:32,720 --> 02:22:36,230
above something like it feels like it's
it's linear algebra and and tdm right

9626
02:22:36,230 --> 02:22:36,240
it's linear algebra and and tdm right
 

9627
02:22:36,240 --> 02:22:38,710
it's linear algebra and and tdm right
um but anyways i'm really convinced with

9628
02:22:38,710 --> 02:22:38,720
um but anyways i'm really convinced with
 

9629
02:22:38,720 --> 02:22:40,230
um but anyways i'm really convinced with
his idea that once we understand better

9630
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:40,240
his idea that once we understand better
 

9631
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:41,510
his idea that once we understand better
and better what's going on from a theory

9632
02:22:41,510 --> 02:22:41,520
and better what's going on from a theory
 

9633
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:42,950
and better what's going on from a theory
perspective it's going to make it into

9634
02:22:42,950 --> 02:22:42,960
perspective it's going to make it into
 

9635
02:22:42,960 --> 02:22:44,469
perspective it's going to make it into
an engineering discipline

9636
02:22:44,469 --> 02:22:44,479
an engineering discipline
 

9637
02:22:44,479 --> 02:22:45,910
an engineering discipline
so in my mind where we're going to end

9638
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:45,920
so in my mind where we're going to end
 

9639
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:48,790
so in my mind where we're going to end
up is okay forget these

9640
02:22:48,790 --> 02:22:48,800
up is okay forget these
 

9641
02:22:48,800 --> 02:22:50,469
up is okay forget these
metaphors of neurons and these things

9642
02:22:50,469 --> 02:22:50,479
metaphors of neurons and these things
 

9643
02:22:50,479 --> 02:22:52,469
metaphors of neurons and these things
are going to be get put down into these

9644
02:22:52,469 --> 02:22:52,479
are going to be get put down into these
 

9645
02:22:52,479 --> 02:22:53,270
are going to be get put down into these
mathematical

9646
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,280
mathematical
 

9647
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,190
mathematical
kind of elegant equations differentiable

9648
02:22:55,190 --> 02:22:55,200
kind of elegant equations differentiable
 

9649
02:22:55,200 --> 02:22:57,429
kind of elegant equations differentiable
equations that just kind of work well

9650
02:22:57,429 --> 02:22:57,439
equations that just kind of work well
 

9651
02:22:57,439 --> 02:22:59,110
equations that just kind of work well
and then it's going to be when i need a

9652
02:22:59,110 --> 02:22:59,120
and then it's going to be when i need a
 

9653
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,270
and then it's going to be when i need a
little bit of ai in this thing

9654
02:23:01,270 --> 02:23:01,280
little bit of ai in this thing
 

9655
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:02,950
little bit of ai in this thing
uh plumbing like let's get a little bit

9656
02:23:02,950 --> 02:23:02,960
uh plumbing like let's get a little bit
 

9657
02:23:02,960 --> 02:23:05,670
uh plumbing like let's get a little bit
of a a pattern recognizer with a noise

9658
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:05,680
of a a pattern recognizer with a noise
 

9659
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:07,190
of a a pattern recognizer with a noise
module and let's connect i mean

9660
02:23:07,190 --> 02:23:07,200
module and let's connect i mean
 

9661
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,230
module and let's connect i mean
you know this feel better than me so i

9662
02:23:08,230 --> 02:23:08,240
you know this feel better than me so i
 

9663
02:23:08,240 --> 02:23:10,150
you know this feel better than me so i
don't know if this is like a reasonable

9664
02:23:10,150 --> 02:23:10,160
don't know if this is like a reasonable
 

9665
02:23:10,160 --> 02:23:11,429
don't know if this is like a reasonable
a reasonable prediction but that we're

9666
02:23:11,429 --> 02:23:11,439
a reasonable prediction but that we're
 

9667
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:12,550
a reasonable prediction but that we're
gonna

9668
02:23:12,550 --> 02:23:12,560
gonna
 

9669
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:14,070
gonna
it's gonna become less inscrutable and

9670
02:23:14,070 --> 02:23:14,080
it's gonna become less inscrutable and
 

9671
02:23:14,080 --> 02:23:16,150
it's gonna become less inscrutable and
then it's gonna become more engineerable

9672
02:23:16,150 --> 02:23:16,160
then it's gonna become more engineerable
 

9673
02:23:16,160 --> 02:23:17,990
then it's gonna become more engineerable
and then we're gonna have ai and more

9674
02:23:17,990 --> 02:23:18,000
and then we're gonna have ai and more
 

9675
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:19,030
and then we're gonna have ai and more
things because we're gonna have a little

9676
02:23:19,030 --> 02:23:19,040
things because we're gonna have a little
 

9677
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:19,750
things because we're gonna have a little
bit more

9678
02:23:19,750 --> 02:23:19,760
bit more
 

9679
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:22,630
bit more

02:23:30,870 --> 02:23:30,880
intuition on is
 

9693
02:23:30,880 --> 02:23:32,469
intuition on is
you know neural networks are very large

9694
02:23:32,469 --> 02:23:32,479
you know neural networks are very large
 

9695
02:23:32,479 --> 02:23:34,230
you know neural networks are very large
and they have a lot of

and they have a lot of
it you know we were talking about uh

9698
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:37,600
it you know we were talking about uh
 

9699
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:39,110
it you know we were talking about uh
you know dynamic networks and

9700
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:39,120
you know dynamic networks and
 

9701
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:40,710
you know dynamic networks and

analysis of neural networks
 

9707
02:23:45,439 --> 02:23:48,550
analysis of neural networks
is uh you know you have a lot of nodes

9708
02:23:48,550 --> 02:23:48,560
is uh you know you have a lot of nodes
 

9709
02:23:48,560 --> 02:23:51,110
is uh you know you have a lot of nodes
and you love a lot of edges to be able

9710
02:23:51,110 --> 02:23:51,120
and you love a lot of edges to be able
 

9711
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:52,710
and you love a lot of edges to be able
to interpret and to control different

02:23:52,710 --> 02:23:52,720
to interpret and to control different
 

9713
02:23:52,720 --> 02:23:55,270
to interpret and to control different
things is very difficult there's uh

9714
02:23:55,270 --> 02:23:55,280
things is very difficult there's uh
 

9715
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:57,750
things is very difficult there's uh
uh there's fields and trying to figure

9716
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:57,760
uh there's fields and trying to figure
 

9717
02:23:57,760 --> 02:24:00,870
uh there's fields and trying to figure
out like mathematically how you form

9718
02:24:00,870 --> 02:24:00,880
out like mathematically how you form
 

9719
02:24:00,880 --> 02:24:04,550
out like mathematically how you form
uh clean representations that are like

9720
02:24:04,550 --> 02:24:04,560
uh clean representations that are like
 

9721
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:06,950
uh clean representations that are like
like one node contains all the

9722
02:24:06,950 --> 02:24:06,960
like one node contains all the
 

9723
02:24:06,960 --> 02:24:08,630
like one node contains all the
information about a particular thing and

9724
02:24:08,630 --> 02:24:08,640
information about a particular thing and
 

9725
02:24:08,640 --> 02:24:10,870
information about a particular thing and
no other nodes it's correlated to it so

9726
02:24:10,870 --> 02:24:10,880
no other nodes it's correlated to it so
 

9727
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:11,429
no other nodes it's correlated to it so
like

9728
02:24:11,429 --> 02:24:11,439
like
 

9729
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:13,670
like
it has unique knowledge and like but

9730
02:24:13,670 --> 02:24:13,680
it has unique knowledge and like but
 

9731
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:15,990
it has unique knowledge and like but
that ultimately boils down to trying to

9732
02:24:15,990 --> 02:24:16,000
that ultimately boils down to trying to
 

9733
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:17,270
that ultimately boils down to trying to
simplify this thing

9734
02:24:17,270 --> 02:24:17,280
simplify this thing
 

9735
02:24:17,280 --> 02:24:20,070
simplify this thing
yeah into that goes against its very

9736
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:20,080
yeah into that goes against its very
 

9737
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,510
yeah into that goes against its very
nature which is like

9738
02:24:21,510 --> 02:24:21,520
nature which is like
 

9739
02:24:21,520 --> 02:24:24,950
nature which is like
deeply connected and uh like

9740
02:24:24,950 --> 02:24:24,960
deeply connected and uh like
 

9741
02:24:24,960 --> 02:24:27,990
deeply connected and uh like
dynamic and just you know hundreds of

9742
02:24:27,990 --> 02:24:28,000
dynamic and just you know hundreds of
 

9743
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,910
dynamic and just you know hundreds of
millions billions of nodes

9744
02:24:29,910 --> 02:24:29,920
millions billions of nodes
 

9745
02:24:29,920 --> 02:24:32,790
millions billions of nodes
yeah and in a distributed sense like

9746
02:24:32,790 --> 02:24:32,800
yeah and in a distributed sense like
 

9747
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:34,469
yeah and in a distributed sense like
when you zoom out the thing has a

9748
02:24:34,469 --> 02:24:34,479
when you zoom out the thing has a
 

9749
02:24:34,479 --> 02:24:36,150
when you zoom out the thing has a
representation and understanding of

9750
02:24:36,150 --> 02:24:36,160
representation and understanding of
 

9751
02:24:36,160 --> 02:24:36,790
representation and understanding of
something

9752
02:24:36,790 --> 02:24:36,800
something
 

9753
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:38,389
something
but the individual nodes are just doing

9754
02:24:38,389 --> 02:24:38,399
but the individual nodes are just doing
 

9755
02:24:38,399 --> 02:24:40,389
but the individual nodes are just doing
their little exchanging thing

9756
02:24:40,389 --> 02:24:40,399
their little exchanging thing
 

9757
02:24:40,399 --> 02:24:42,150
their little exchanging thing
and it's the same thing with stephen

9758
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:42,160
and it's the same thing with stephen
 

9759
02:24:42,160 --> 02:24:43,590
and it's the same thing with stephen
wolfram when you talk about cellular

9760
02:24:43,590 --> 02:24:43,600
wolfram when you talk about cellular
 

9761
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:44,309
wolfram when you talk about cellular
automata

9762
02:24:44,309 --> 02:24:44,319
automata
 

9763
02:24:44,319 --> 02:24:46,469
automata
it's very difficult to do math when you

9764
02:24:46,469 --> 02:24:46,479
it's very difficult to do math when you
 

9765
02:24:46,479 --> 02:24:48,309
it's very difficult to do math when you
have a huge collection of distributed

9766
02:24:48,309 --> 02:24:48,319
have a huge collection of distributed
 

9767
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:50,230
have a huge collection of distributed
things each acting on their own

9768
02:24:50,230 --> 02:24:50,240
things each acting on their own
 

9769
02:24:50,240 --> 02:24:53,670
things each acting on their own
and it's almost like it's it feels like

9770
02:24:53,670 --> 02:24:53,680
and it's almost like it's it feels like
 

9771
02:24:53,680 --> 02:24:55,110
and it's almost like it's it feels like
it's almost impossible to do

9772
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:55,120
it's almost impossible to do
 

9773
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:56,790
it's almost impossible to do
any kind of theoretical work in the

9774
02:24:56,790 --> 02:24:56,800
any kind of theoretical work in the
 

9775
02:24:56,800 --> 02:24:58,950
any kind of theoretical work in the
traditional sense it almost becomes

9776
02:24:58,950 --> 02:24:58,960
traditional sense it almost becomes
 

9777
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:00,630
traditional sense it almost becomes
completely

9778
02:25:00,630 --> 02:25:00,640
completely
 

9779
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:03,030
completely
like uh like a biology you become a

9780
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:03,040
like uh like a biology you become a
 

9781
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:04,710
like uh like a biology you become a
biologist as opposed to

9782
02:25:04,710 --> 02:25:04,720
biologist as opposed to
 

9783
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:06,790
biologist as opposed to
yeah a theoretician you just study it

9784
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
yeah a theoretician you just study it
 

9785
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:09,110
yeah a theoretician you just study it
experimentally yeah i i think that's the

9786
02:25:09,110 --> 02:25:09,120
experimentally yeah i i think that's the
 

9787
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:10,550
experimentally yeah i i think that's the
big question i guess right

9788
02:25:10,550 --> 02:25:10,560
big question i guess right
 

9789
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:13,670
big question i guess right
yeah is so so is the large

9790
02:25:13,670 --> 02:25:13,680
yeah is so so is the large
 

9791
02:25:13,680 --> 02:25:15,750
yeah is so so is the large
size and inner connectiveness of the

9792
02:25:15,750 --> 02:25:15,760
size and inner connectiveness of the
 

9793
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:17,670
size and inner connectiveness of the
like a deep learning network

9794
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:17,680
like a deep learning network
 

9795
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:19,349
like a deep learning network
fundamental to that task or are we just

9796
02:25:19,349 --> 02:25:19,359
fundamental to that task or are we just
 

9797
02:25:19,359 --> 02:25:20,870
fundamental to that task or are we just
not very good at it yet because we're

9798
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:20,880
not very good at it yet because we're
 

9799
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:23,429
not very good at it yet because we're
we're using the wrong metaphor i mean

9800
02:25:23,429 --> 02:25:23,439
we're using the wrong metaphor i mean
 

9801
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:24,870
we're using the wrong metaphor i mean
the human brain

9802
02:25:24,870 --> 02:25:24,880
the human brain
 

9803
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,510
the human brain
learns with much fewer examples and and

9804
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:27,520
learns with much fewer examples and and
 

9805
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:28,150
learns with much fewer examples and and
with

9806
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:28,160
with
 

9807
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:29,990
with
much less tuning of the whatever

9808
02:25:29,990 --> 02:25:30,000
much less tuning of the whatever
 

9809
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,349
much less tuning of the whatever
whatever whatever probably that

9810
02:25:31,349 --> 02:25:31,359
whatever whatever probably that
 

9811
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:32,950

networks up and running but

9814
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:34,720
networks up and running but
 

9815
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,469
networks up and running but
yeah so i don't really know but the one

9816
02:25:36,469 --> 02:25:36,479
yeah so i don't really know but the one
 

9817
02:25:36,479 --> 02:25:38,070
yeah so i don't really know but the one
thing i have observed is that the

9818
02:25:38,070 --> 02:25:38,080
thing i have observed is that the
 

9819
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:41,270
thing i have observed is that the
yeah there's a the mundane nature of

9820
02:25:41,270 --> 02:25:41,280
yeah there's a the mundane nature of
 

9821
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:43,590
yeah there's a the mundane nature of
some of the working with these models

9822
02:25:43,590 --> 02:25:43,600
some of the working with these models
 

9823
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:46,630
some of the working with these models
tends to lead people to think that

9824
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:46,640
tends to lead people to think that
 

9825
02:25:46,640 --> 02:25:49,670
tends to lead people to think that
to do it like it could be skynet or it

9826
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
to do it like it could be skynet or it
 

9827
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,510
to do it like it could be skynet or it
could be like a lot of pain to get

9828
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:51,520
could be like a lot of pain to get
 

9829
02:25:51,520 --> 02:25:53,750
could be like a lot of pain to get
you know the thermostat to do what we

9830
02:25:53,750 --> 02:25:53,760
you know the thermostat to do what we
 

9831
02:25:53,760 --> 02:25:55,110
you know the thermostat to do what we
wanted to do and there's a lot of open

9832
02:25:55,110 --> 02:25:55,120
wanted to do and there's a lot of open
 

9833
02:25:55,120 --> 02:25:55,510
wanted to do and there's a lot of open
questions

9834
02:25:55,510 --> 02:25:55,520
questions
 

9835
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,070
questions
yeah in between there and then of course

9836
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,080
yeah in between there and then of course
 

9837
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:58,950
yeah in between there and then of course
the

9838
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:58,960
the
 

9839
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,950

9840
02:26:00,950 --> 02:26:00,960
at the distributors the distributed
 

9841
02:26:00,960 --> 02:26:02,950
at the distributors the distributed

9842
02:26:02,950 --> 02:26:02,960
network
 

9843
02:26:02,960 --> 02:26:05,030
network
of humans they use these systems so like

9844
02:26:05,030 --> 02:26:05,040
of humans they use these systems so like
 

9845
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:06,389
of humans they use these systems so like
you can have

9846
02:26:06,389 --> 02:26:06,399
you can have
 

9847
02:26:06,399 --> 02:26:08,070
you can have
the system itself then the neural

9848
02:26:08,070 --> 02:26:08,080
the system itself then the neural
 

9849
02:26:08,080 --> 02:26:09,670
the system itself then the neural
network but you can also have like

9850
02:26:09,670 --> 02:26:09,680
network but you can also have like
 

9851
02:26:09,680 --> 02:26:10,870
network but you can also have like
little algorithms controlling the

9852
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:10,880
little algorithms controlling the
 

9853
02:26:10,880 --> 02:26:12,150
little algorithms controlling the
behavior of humans which is what you

9854
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:12,160
behavior of humans which is what you
 

9855
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:13,990
behavior of humans which is what you
have with social networks

9856
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:14,000
have with social networks
 

9857
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,469
have with social networks
it's possible that a very what is a

9858
02:26:16,469 --> 02:26:16,479
it's possible that a very what is a
 

9859
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:19,429
it's possible that a very what is a
toaster whatever the opposite of skynet

9860
02:26:19,429 --> 02:26:19,439
toaster whatever the opposite of skynet
 

9861
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:21,030
toaster whatever the opposite of skynet
when taking a scale was used by

9862
02:26:21,030 --> 02:26:21,040
when taking a scale was used by
 

9863
02:26:21,040 --> 02:26:22,710
when taking a scale was used by
individual humans and controlling their

9864
02:26:22,710 --> 02:26:22,720
individual humans and controlling their
 

9865
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:24,790
individual humans and controlling their
behavior can actually have the skynet

9866
02:26:24,790 --> 02:26:24,800
behavior can actually have the skynet
 

9867
02:26:24,800 --> 02:26:27,750
behavior can actually have the skynet
effect yeah so this the scale there we

9868
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:27,760
effect yeah so this the scale there we
 

9869
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:28,950
effect yeah so this the scale there we
might have that now

9870
02:26:28,950 --> 02:26:28,960
might have that now
 

9871
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:30,389
might have that now
we might have that now we just don't

9872
02:26:30,389 --> 02:26:30,399
we might have that now we just don't
 

9873
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:32,230
we might have that now we just don't
know yeah like what has this happened is

9874
02:26:32,230 --> 02:26:32,240
know yeah like what has this happened is
 

9875
02:26:32,240 --> 02:26:33,670
know yeah like what has this happened is
twitter creating a little mini skynet i

9876
02:26:33,670 --> 02:26:33,680
twitter creating a little mini skynet i
 

9877
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:34,230
twitter creating a little mini skynet i
mean

9878
02:26:34,230 --> 02:26:34,240
mean
 

9879
02:26:34,240 --> 02:26:36,550
mean
because what happens it twirls out

9880
02:26:36,550 --> 02:26:36,560
because what happens it twirls out
 

9881
02:26:36,560 --> 02:26:38,870
because what happens it twirls out
ramifications in the world and

9882
02:26:38,870 --> 02:26:38,880
ramifications in the world and
 

9883
02:26:38,880 --> 02:26:40,309
ramifications in the world and
is it really that much different if it's

9884
02:26:40,309 --> 02:26:40,319
is it really that much different if it's
 

9885
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:42,630
is it really that much different if it's
a robot with tentacles

9886
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:42,640
a robot with tentacles
 

9887
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:45,110
a robot with tentacles
or a bunch of servers that yeah and the

9888
02:26:45,110 --> 02:26:45,120
or a bunch of servers that yeah and the
 

9889
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:47,429
or a bunch of servers that yeah and the
destructive effects could be

9890
02:26:47,429 --> 02:26:47,439
destructive effects could be
 

9891
02:26:47,439 --> 02:26:49,590
destructive effects could be
i mean it could be political but it

9892
02:26:49,590 --> 02:26:49,600
i mean it could be political but it
 

9893
02:26:49,600 --> 02:26:50,950
i mean it could be political but it
could also be like you know

9894
02:26:50,950 --> 02:26:50,960
could also be like you know
 

9895
02:26:50,960 --> 02:26:52,150
could also be like you know
you could probably make an interesting

9896
02:26:52,150 --> 02:26:52,160
you could probably make an interesting
 

9897
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:54,469
you could probably make an interesting
case that the virus

9898
02:26:54,469 --> 02:26:54,479
case that the virus
 

9899
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:58,150
case that the virus
the the coronavirus spread on twitter

9900
02:26:58,150 --> 02:26:58,160
the the coronavirus spread on twitter
 

9901
02:26:58,160 --> 02:27:01,510
the the coronavirus spread on twitter
too in the minds of people like the

9902
02:27:01,510 --> 02:27:01,520
too in the minds of people like the
 

9903
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:03,830
too in the minds of people like the
fear and the misinformation in some very

9904
02:27:03,830 --> 02:27:03,840
fear and the misinformation in some very
 

9905
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:04,870
fear and the misinformation in some very
interesting ways

9906
02:27:04,870 --> 02:27:04,880
interesting ways
 

9907
02:27:04,880 --> 02:27:07,429
interesting ways
yeah mixed up and maybe this pandemic

9908
02:27:07,429 --> 02:27:07,439
yeah mixed up and maybe this pandemic
 

9909
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:09,110
yeah mixed up and maybe this pandemic
wasn't sufficiently dangerous to where

9910
02:27:09,110 --> 02:27:09,120
wasn't sufficiently dangerous to where
 

9911
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,349
wasn't sufficiently dangerous to where
that could have created a weird like

9912
02:27:11,349 --> 02:27:11,359
that could have created a weird like
 

9913
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:13,990
that could have created a weird like
on instability but maybe other things

9914
02:27:13,990 --> 02:27:14,000
on instability but maybe other things
 

9915
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,230
on instability but maybe other things
might create instability like somebody

9916
02:27:16,230 --> 02:27:16,240
might create instability like somebody
 

9917
02:27:16,240 --> 02:27:18,230
might create instability like somebody

02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:20,640
somewhere and then maybe the destructive
 

9921
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:21,750
somewhere and then maybe the destructive
aspect of that

9922
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:21,760
aspect of that
 

9923
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:23,750
aspect of that

interesting case study um
 

9947
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,710
interesting case study um
i'm interested in the counterfactual of

9948
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
i'm interested in the counterfactual of
 

9949
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:45,910
i'm interested in the counterfactual of
1995.

9950

02:29:16,309 --> 02:29:16,319
them from doing this
 

10063
02:29:16,319 --> 02:29:18,630
them from doing this
that's like very twittery yeah in a way

10064
02:29:18,630 --> 02:29:18,640
that's like very twittery yeah in a way
 

10065
02:29:18,640 --> 02:29:19,670
that's like very twittery yeah in a way
that in 1995

10066
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:19,680
that in 1995
 

10067
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:22,070
that in 1995
is probably not the way public health

10068
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:22,080
is probably not the way public health
 

10069
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:23,349
is probably not the way public health
officials would be thinking right now

10070
02:29:23,349 --> 02:29:23,359
officials would be thinking right now
 

10071
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:24,550
officials would be thinking right now
it's like well

10072
02:29:24,550 --> 02:29:24,560
it's like well
 

10073
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:26,469
it's like well
this is if we said this about mass but

10074
02:29:26,469 --> 02:29:26,479
this is if we said this about mass but
 

10075
02:29:26,479 --> 02:29:28,070
this is if we said this about mass but
the other team said that about mass we

10076
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,080
the other team said that about mass we
 

10077
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:29,110
the other team said that about mass we
can't give an inch

10078
02:29:29,110 --> 02:29:29,120
can't give an inch
 

10079
02:29:29,120 --> 02:29:30,469
can't give an inch
so we got to be careful and like we

10080
02:29:30,469 --> 02:29:30,479
so we got to be careful and like we
 

10081
02:29:30,479 --> 02:29:31,670
so we got to be careful and like we
can't tell people it's okay after

10082
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:31,680
can't tell people it's okay after
 

10083
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:33,349
can't tell people it's okay after
they're vaccinated because that might

10084
02:29:33,349 --> 02:29:33,359
they're vaccinated because that might
 

10085
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:34,870
they're vaccinated because that might
we're giving them an inch on this and

10086
02:29:34,870 --> 02:29:34,880
we're giving them an inch on this and
 

10087
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:36,630
we're giving them an inch on this and
that's very twittery in my mind right

10088
02:29:36,630 --> 02:29:36,640
that's very twittery in my mind right
 

10089
02:29:36,640 --> 02:29:38,309
that's very twittery in my mind right
that is the the impact of

10090
02:29:38,309 --> 02:29:38,319
that is the the impact of
 

10091
02:29:38,319 --> 02:29:40,230
that is the the impact of
twitter on the way we think about this

10092
02:29:40,230 --> 02:29:40,240
twitter on the way we think about this
 

10093
02:29:40,240 --> 02:29:41,590
twitter on the way we think about this
course which is a dunking culture of

10094
02:29:41,590 --> 02:29:41,600
course which is a dunking culture of
 

10095
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:42,950
course which is a dunking culture of
don't give any inch to the other team

10096
02:29:42,950 --> 02:29:42,960
don't give any inch to the other team
 

10097
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:44,309
don't give any inch to the other team
and it's all about slam dunks where

10098
02:29:44,309 --> 02:29:44,319
and it's all about slam dunks where
 

10099
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:45,349
and it's all about slam dunks where
you're completely right and they're

10100
02:29:45,349 --> 02:29:45,359
you're completely right and they're
 

10101
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:46,230
you're completely right and they're
completely wrong

10102
02:29:46,230 --> 02:29:46,240
completely wrong
 

10103
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:47,910
completely wrong
it's as a rhetorical strategy is

10104
02:29:47,910 --> 02:29:47,920
it's as a rhetorical strategy is
 

10105
02:29:47,920 --> 02:29:49,510
it's as a rhetorical strategy is
incredibly simplistic but it's also the

10106
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:49,520
incredibly simplistic but it's also the
 

10107
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:51,429
incredibly simplistic but it's also the
way that we think right now about

10108
02:29:51,429 --> 02:29:51,439
way that we think right now about
 

10109
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:54,230
way that we think right now about
how we do debate it combined terribly

10110
02:29:54,230 --> 02:29:54,240
how we do debate it combined terribly
 

10111
02:29:54,240 --> 02:29:55,030
how we do debate it combined terribly
with uh

10112
02:29:55,030 --> 02:29:55,040
with uh
 

10113
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:57,349
with uh
election year pandemic yeah election

10114
02:29:57,349 --> 02:29:57,359
election year pandemic yeah election
 

10115
02:29:57,359 --> 02:29:59,030
election year pandemic yeah election
year pandemic i wonder if we can do some

10116
02:29:59,030 --> 02:29:59,040
year pandemic i wonder if we can do some
 

10117
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,950
year pandemic i wonder if we can do some
smooth analysis let's run the simulation

10118
02:30:00,950 --> 02:30:00,960
smooth analysis let's run the simulation
 

10119
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:01,750
smooth analysis let's run the simulation
over a few times

10120
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:01,760
over a few times
 

10121
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:04,710
over a few times
a little bit noise yeah see if it can uh

10122
02:30:04,710 --> 02:30:04,720
a little bit noise yeah see if it can uh
 

10123
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:06,150
a little bit noise yeah see if it can uh
dramatically change the behavior of the

10124
02:30:06,150 --> 02:30:06,160
dramatically change the behavior of the
 

10125
02:30:06,160 --> 02:30:07,110
dramatically change the behavior of the
system

10126
02:30:07,110 --> 02:30:07,120
system
 

10127
02:30:07,120 --> 02:30:09,590
system
okay we talked about your love for

10128
02:30:09,590 --> 02:30:09,600
okay we talked about your love for
 

10129
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:11,670
okay we talked about your love for
proving that something is impossible

10130
02:30:11,670 --> 02:30:11,680
proving that something is impossible
 

10131
02:30:11,680 --> 02:30:13,750
proving that something is impossible
so there's quite a few still open

10132
02:30:13,750 --> 02:30:13,760
so there's quite a few still open
 

10133
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,830
so there's quite a few still open
problems and complexity

10134
02:30:15,830 --> 02:30:15,840
problems and complexity
 

10135
02:30:15,840 --> 02:30:18,790
problems and complexity
of algorithms uh so let me ask does p

10136
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:18,800
of algorithms uh so let me ask does p
 

10137
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:19,270
of algorithms uh so let me ask does p
equal

10138
02:30:19,270 --> 02:30:19,280
equal
 

10139
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:23,270
equal
np probably not probably not

10140
02:30:23,270 --> 02:30:23,280
np probably not probably not
 

10141
02:30:23,280 --> 02:30:27,190
np probably not probably not
if p equals np

10142
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,200
if p equals np
 

10143
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,590
if p equals np
what kind of you know and you'd be

10144
02:30:29,590 --> 02:30:29,600
what kind of you know and you'd be
 

10145
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:31,429
what kind of you know and you'd be
really surprised somebody proves it

10146
02:30:31,429 --> 02:30:31,439
really surprised somebody proves it
 

10147
02:30:31,439 --> 02:30:33,990
really surprised somebody proves it
yeah what would that proof look like and

10148
02:30:33,990 --> 02:30:34,000
yeah what would that proof look like and
 

10149
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,510
yeah what would that proof look like and
why would that even be what would that

10150
02:30:35,510 --> 02:30:35,520
why would that even be what would that
 

10151
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:36,309
why would that even be what would that
mean

10152
02:30:36,309 --> 02:30:36,319
mean
 

10153
02:30:36,319 --> 02:30:38,550
mean
what would that proof look like in what

10154
02:30:38,550 --> 02:30:38,560
what would that proof look like in what
 

10155
02:30:38,560 --> 02:30:39,910
what would that proof look like in what
possible universe could p

10156
02:30:39,910 --> 02:30:39,920
possible universe could p
 

10157
02:30:39,920 --> 02:30:41,750
possible universe could p
equals np is there something insightful

10158
02:30:41,750 --> 02:30:41,760
equals np is there something insightful
 

10159
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:43,349
equals np is there something insightful
you can say there

10160
02:30:43,349 --> 02:30:43,359
you can say there
 

10161
02:30:43,359 --> 02:30:46,070
you can say there
it could it could be true and i mean i'm

10162
02:30:46,070 --> 02:30:46,080
it could it could be true and i mean i'm
 

10163
02:30:46,080 --> 02:30:47,510
it could it could be true and i mean i'm
not a complexity theorist but every

10164
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
not a complexity theorist but every
 

10165
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:49,349
not a complexity theorist but every
complexity theorist i know

10166
02:30:49,349 --> 02:30:49,359
complexity theorist i know
 

10167
02:30:49,359 --> 02:30:51,750
complexity theorist i know
is convinced they're not equal and are

10168
02:30:51,750 --> 02:30:51,760
is convinced they're not equal and are
 

10169
02:30:51,760 --> 02:30:53,110
is convinced they're not equal and are
basically not working on anymore i mean

10170
02:30:53,110 --> 02:30:53,120
basically not working on anymore i mean
 

10171
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:54,469
basically not working on anymore i mean
there is a million dollars at stake if

10172
02:30:54,469 --> 02:30:54,479
there is a million dollars at stake if
 

10173
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:55,830
there is a million dollars at stake if
you can if you can solve the proof it's

10174
02:30:55,830 --> 02:30:55,840
you can if you can solve the proof it's
 

10175
02:30:55,840 --> 02:30:57,670
you can if you can solve the proof it's
one of the millennium prizes

10176
02:30:57,670 --> 02:30:57,680
one of the millennium prizes
 

10177
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:59,750
one of the millennium prizes
okay so here here's how i think the p

10178
02:30:59,750 --> 02:30:59,760
okay so here here's how i think the p
 

10179
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:01,030
okay so here here's how i think the p
not equals mp proof is going to

10180
02:31:01,030 --> 02:31:01,040
not equals mp proof is going to
 

10181
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:01,830
not equals mp proof is going to
eventually

10182
02:31:01,830 --> 02:31:01,840
eventually
 

10183
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:04,389
eventually
happen i think it's going to fall out

10184
02:31:04,389 --> 02:31:04,399
happen i think it's going to fall out
 

10185
02:31:04,399 --> 02:31:05,510
happen i think it's going to fall out
and it's going to be

10186
02:31:05,510 --> 02:31:05,520
and it's going to be
 

10187
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,990
and it's going to be
not super simple but not as hard as

10188
02:31:07,990 --> 02:31:08,000
not super simple but not as hard as
 

10189
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:08,630
not super simple but not as hard as
people think

10190
02:31:08,630 --> 02:31:08,640
people think
 

10191
02:31:08,640 --> 02:31:11,110
people think
because my my theory about a lot of

10192
02:31:11,110 --> 02:31:11,120
because my my theory about a lot of
 

10193
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,469
because my my theory about a lot of
theoretical computer science based on

10194
02:31:12,469 --> 02:31:12,479
theoretical computer science based on
 

10195
02:31:12,479 --> 02:31:12,950
theoretical computer science based on
just

10196
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:12,960
just
 

10197
02:31:12,960 --> 02:31:14,550
just
some results i've done so this is a huge

10198
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:14,560
some results i've done so this is a huge
 

10199
02:31:14,560 --> 02:31:16,230
some results i've done so this is a huge
extrapolation is that

10200
02:31:16,230 --> 02:31:16,240
extrapolation is that
 

10201
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:17,349
extrapolation is that
a lot of what we're doing is just

10202
02:31:17,349 --> 02:31:17,359
a lot of what we're doing is just
 

10203
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:20,630
a lot of what we're doing is just
obfuscating deeper mathematics

10204
02:31:20,630 --> 02:31:20,640
obfuscating deeper mathematics
 

10205
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:22,309
obfuscating deeper mathematics
so like this happens to me a lot not a

10206
02:31:22,309 --> 02:31:22,319
so like this happens to me a lot not a
 

10207
02:31:22,319 --> 02:31:23,590
so like this happens to me a lot not a
lot but it's happened to me a few times

10208
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:23,600
lot but it's happened to me a few times
 

10209
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:24,550
lot but it's happened to me a few times
in my work where

10210
02:31:24,550 --> 02:31:24,560
in my work where
 

10211
02:31:24,560 --> 02:31:26,230
in my work where
yeah we obfuscate it because we say well

10212
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:26,240
yeah we obfuscate it because we say well
 

10213
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:28,150
yeah we obfuscate it because we say well
there's an algorithm and has this much

10214
02:31:28,150 --> 02:31:28,160
there's an algorithm and has this much
 

10215
02:31:28,160 --> 02:31:29,830
there's an algorithm and has this much
you know memory and they're connected on

10216
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:29,840
you know memory and they're connected on
 

10217
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,670
you know memory and they're connected on
a network and okay here's our setup and

10218
02:31:31,670 --> 02:31:31,680
a network and okay here's our setup and
 

10219
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:33,110
a network and okay here's our setup and
now we're trying to see how fast it can

10220
02:31:33,110 --> 02:31:33,120
now we're trying to see how fast it can
 

10221
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:34,389
now we're trying to see how fast it can
solve a problem

10222
02:31:34,389 --> 02:31:34,399
solve a problem
 

10223
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:36,150
solve a problem
and people do bounds about and in the

10224
02:31:36,150 --> 02:31:36,160
and people do bounds about and in the
 

10225
02:31:36,160 --> 02:31:37,510
and people do bounds about and in the
end it turns out that like we were just

10226
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:37,520
end it turns out that like we were just
 

10227
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:39,670
end it turns out that like we were just
obfuscating some underlying

from this in fact it improved a lot of
 

10271
02:32:16,479 --> 02:32:17,670
from this in fact it improved a lot of
them and simplified a lot you could put

02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:38,399
building a code over uh you know if you
 

10297
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:39,590
building a code over uh you know if you
have a distribution on the

the exact same lower bounds fall back
 

10313
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:54,950
the exact same lower bounds fall back
out again right so like this type of

02:32:54,950 --> 02:32:54,960
out again right so like this type of
 

10315
02:32:54,960 --> 02:32:56,309
out again right so like this type of
thing happens there's a there's some

10316
02:32:56,309 --> 02:32:56,319
thing happens there's a there's some
 

10317
02:32:56,319 --> 02:32:57,590

so my sense is what's going to happen is

10328
02:33:07,270 --> 02:33:07,280
so my sense is what's going to happen is
 

10329
02:33:07,280 --> 02:33:09,830
so my sense is what's going to happen is
at some point someone really smart

02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:19,510
with these turing machines trying to
sort of efficiently fall and there will

10340
02:33:19,510 --> 02:33:19,520
sort of efficiently fall and there will
 

10341
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:20,790

it could be ai theorem proverbs kind of

10348
02:33:27,510 --> 02:33:27,520
it could be ai theorem proverbs kind of
 

10349
02:33:27,520 --> 02:33:29,190
it could be ai theorem proverbs kind of
thing it could be yeah i mean not a

02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:29,200
thing it could be yeah i mean not a
 

10351
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:31,590
thing it could be yeah i mean not a
well yeah i mean there's theorem provers

10352
02:33:31,590 --> 02:33:31,600
well yeah i mean there's theorem provers
 

10353
02:33:31,600 --> 02:33:33,510
well yeah i mean there's theorem provers
like what that means now

10354
02:33:33,510 --> 02:33:33,520
like what that means now
 

10355
02:33:33,520 --> 02:33:36,870
like what that means now
which is not fun it's just a bunch of

that but
 

10361
02:33:39,920 --> 02:33:43,349
that but
i take your point yeah yeah so okay

02:33:43,349 --> 02:33:43,359
i take your point yeah yeah so okay
 

10363
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:45,750
i take your point yeah yeah so okay
uh you know on a small tangent on then

uh you know on a small tangent on then
 

10365
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:46,870
uh you know on a small tangent on then
then

10366
02:33:46,870 --> 02:33:46,880
then
 

10367
02:33:46,880 --> 02:33:49,030
then
you're kind of implying that mathematics

02:33:55,110 --> 02:33:55,120
leads back to some kind of ancestral
 

10375
02:33:55,120 --> 02:33:57,270
leads back to some kind of ancestral
a few fundamental ideas that all are

10376
02:33:57,270 --> 02:33:57,280
a few fundamental ideas that all are
 

10377
02:33:57,280 --> 02:33:58,630
a few fundamental ideas that all are
just like

10378
02:33:58,630 --> 02:33:58,640
just like
 

10379
02:33:58,640 --> 02:34:01,830
just like
they're all somehow connected in that

10380
02:34:01,830 --> 02:34:01,840
they're all somehow connected in that
 

10381
02:34:01,840 --> 02:34:03,590
they're all somehow connected in that
sense do you think

10382
02:34:03,590 --> 02:34:03,600
sense do you think
 

10383
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,790
sense do you think
uh math is fundamental to our universe

10384
02:34:06,790 --> 02:34:06,800
uh math is fundamental to our universe
 

10385
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:07,670
uh math is fundamental to our universe
and we're just like

10386
02:34:07,670 --> 02:34:07,680
and we're just like
 

10387
02:34:07,680 --> 02:34:11,030
and we're just like
slowly trying to understand

10388
02:34:11,030 --> 02:34:11,040
slowly trying to understand
 

10389
02:34:11,040 --> 02:34:13,190
slowly trying to understand
these patterns or is is it is it

10390
02:34:13,190 --> 02:34:13,200
these patterns or is is it is it
 

10391
02:34:13,200 --> 02:34:15,110
these patterns or is is it is it
discovered

10392
02:34:15,110 --> 02:34:15,120
discovered
 

10393
02:34:15,120 --> 02:34:18,070
discovered
or is it just a little game that we play

10394
02:34:18,070 --> 02:34:18,080
or is it just a little game that we play
 

10395
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:18,790
or is it just a little game that we play
yeah

10396
02:34:18,790 --> 02:34:18,800
yeah
 

10397
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:21,830
yeah
amongst ourselves to try to fit little

10398
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
amongst ourselves to try to fit little
 

10399
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:23,590
amongst ourselves to try to fit little
patterns to the world

10400
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:23,600
patterns to the world
 

10401
02:34:23,600 --> 02:34:24,870
patterns to the world
yeah that's the question right that's

10402
02:34:24,870 --> 02:34:24,880
yeah that's the question right that's
 

10403
02:34:24,880 --> 02:34:26,630
yeah that's the question right that's
the physicist's question

10404
02:34:26,630 --> 02:34:26,640
the physicist's question
 

10405
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:27,590
the physicist's question
i mean i'm probably i'm in the

10406
02:34:27,590 --> 02:34:27,600
i mean i'm probably i'm in the
 

10407
02:34:27,600 --> 02:34:29,670
i mean i'm probably i'm in the
discovered camp but i don't do

10408
02:34:29,670 --> 02:34:29,680
discovered camp but i don't do
 

10409
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:31,429
discovered camp but i don't do
theoretical physics so i know

10410
02:34:31,429 --> 02:34:31,439
theoretical physics so i know
 

10411
02:34:31,439 --> 02:34:34,309
theoretical physics so i know
they have a they feel like they have a

10412
02:34:34,309 --> 02:34:34,319
they have a they feel like they have a
 

10413
02:34:34,319 --> 02:34:35,429
they have a they feel like they have a
stronger claim to

10414
02:34:35,429 --> 02:34:35,439
stronger claim to
 

10415
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:37,590
stronger claim to
answering that question but you don't

10416
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,600
answering that question but you don't
 

10417
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,190
answering that question but you don't
come back to it everything comes back to

10418
02:34:39,190 --> 02:34:39,200
come back to it everything comes back to
 

10419
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,550
come back to it everything comes back to
it i mean all of physics

10420
02:34:40,550 --> 02:34:40,560
it i mean all of physics
 

10421
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:45,510
it i mean all of physics
the fact that the universe is well okay

10422
02:34:45,510 --> 02:34:45,520
the fact that the universe is well okay
 

10423
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:47,750
the fact that the universe is well okay
it's a complicated question so how how

10424
02:34:47,750 --> 02:34:47,760
it's a complicated question so how how
 

10425
02:34:47,760 --> 02:34:49,270
it's a complicated question so how how
often do you think

10426
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:49,280
often do you think
 

10427
02:34:49,280 --> 02:34:53,030
often do you think
how deeply does this result describe the

10428
02:34:53,030 --> 02:34:53,040
how deeply does this result describe the
 

10429
02:34:53,040 --> 02:34:56,870
how deeply does this result describe the
fundamental reality of nature

10430
02:34:56,870 --> 02:34:56,880
fundamental reality of nature
 

10431
02:34:56,880 --> 02:34:59,510
fundamental reality of nature
so the the the reason i hesitated

10432
02:34:59,510 --> 02:34:59,520
so the the the reason i hesitated
 

10433
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:00,870
so the the the reason i hesitated
because it's something i'm

10434
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:00,880
because it's something i'm
 

10435
02:35:00,880 --> 02:35:02,230
because it's something i'm
i taught the seminar and did a little

10436
02:35:02,230 --> 02:35:02,240
i taught the seminar and did a little
 

10437
02:35:02,240 --> 02:35:03,990
i taught the seminar and did a little
work on what are called biological

10438
02:35:03,990 --> 02:35:04,000
work on what are called biological
 

10439
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:04,950
work on what are called biological
algorithms

10440
02:35:04,950 --> 02:35:04,960
algorithms
 

10441
02:35:04,960 --> 02:35:09,270
algorithms
so there's this notion of

10442
02:35:09,270 --> 02:35:09,280

 

10443
02:35:09,280 --> 02:35:12,389

so physicists used mathematics

10444
02:35:12,389 --> 02:35:12,399
so physicists used mathematics
 

10445
02:35:12,399 --> 02:35:14,950
so physicists used mathematics
to explain the universe right and it was

10446
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:14,960
to explain the universe right and it was
 

10447
02:35:14,960 --> 02:35:16,870
to explain the universe right and it was
unreasonable that mathematics works so

10448
02:35:16,870 --> 02:35:16,880
unreasonable that mathematics works so
 

10449
02:35:16,880 --> 02:35:17,750
unreasonable that mathematics works so
well

10450
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
well
 

10451
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:18,710
well
you know all these differential

10452
02:35:18,710 --> 02:35:18,720
you know all these differential
 

10453
02:35:18,720 --> 02:35:20,870
you know all these differential
equations why does that explain

10454
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:20,880
equations why does that explain
 

10455
02:35:20,880 --> 02:35:22,389
equations why does that explain
all we need to know about thermodynamics

10456
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
all we need to know about thermodynamics
 

10457
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:23,670
all we need to know about thermodynamics
and gravity and all the all these type

10458
02:35:23,670 --> 02:35:23,680
and gravity and all the all these type
 

10459
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:24,630
and gravity and all the all these type
of things well there's this kind

10460
02:35:24,630 --> 02:35:24,640
of things well there's this kind
 

10461
02:35:24,640 --> 02:35:26,389
of things well there's this kind
there's this movement within the

10462
02:35:26,389 --> 02:35:26,399
there's this movement within the
 

10463
02:35:26,399 --> 02:35:27,510
there's this movement within the
intersection of computer science and

10464
02:35:27,510 --> 02:35:27,520
intersection of computer science and
 

10465
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,630
intersection of computer science and
biology

10466
02:35:28,630 --> 02:35:28,640
biology
 

10467
02:35:28,640 --> 02:35:30,230
biology
it's just kind of wolf ramyun i guess

10468
02:35:30,230 --> 02:35:30,240
it's just kind of wolf ramyun i guess
 

10469
02:35:30,240 --> 02:35:32,870
it's just kind of wolf ramyun i guess
really that uh

10470
02:35:32,870 --> 02:35:32,880
really that uh
 

10471
02:35:32,880 --> 02:35:34,790
really that uh
algorithms can be very explanatory right

10472
02:35:34,790 --> 02:35:34,800
algorithms can be very explanatory right
 

10473
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:35,750
algorithms can be very explanatory right
like if you're trying to if you're

10474
02:35:35,750 --> 02:35:35,760
like if you're trying to if you're
 

10475
02:35:35,760 --> 02:35:37,550
like if you're trying to if you're
trying to explain

10476
02:35:37,550 --> 02:35:37,560
trying to explain
 

10477
02:35:37,560 --> 02:35:40,309
trying to explain
parsimoniously something about like an

10478
02:35:40,309 --> 02:35:40,319
parsimoniously something about like an
 

10479
02:35:40,319 --> 02:35:41,830
parsimoniously something about like an
ant colony or something like this you're

10480
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:41,840
ant colony or something like this you're
 

10481
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:42,950
ant colony or something like this you're
not going to

10482
02:35:42,950 --> 02:35:42,960
not going to
 

10483
02:35:42,960 --> 02:35:44,150
not going to
ultimately it's not going to be

10484
02:35:44,150 --> 02:35:44,160
ultimately it's not going to be
 

10485
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:46,230
ultimately it's not going to be
explained as an equation like a physics

10486
02:35:46,230 --> 02:35:46,240
explained as an equation like a physics
 

10487
02:35:46,240 --> 02:35:47,349
explained as an equation like a physics
equation it's going to be explained by

10488
02:35:47,349 --> 02:35:47,359
equation it's going to be explained by
 

10489
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:50,150
equation it's going to be explained by
an algorithm so like this algorithm

10490
02:35:50,150 --> 02:35:50,160
an algorithm so like this algorithm
 

10491
02:35:50,160 --> 02:35:52,630
an algorithm so like this algorithm
run distributedly is going to explain

10492
02:35:52,630 --> 02:35:52,640
run distributedly is going to explain
 

10493
02:35:52,640 --> 02:35:54,230
run distributedly is going to explain
the behavior so

10494
02:35:54,230 --> 02:35:54,240
the behavior so
 

10495
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,510
the behavior so
that's mathematical but not quite

10496
02:35:55,510 --> 02:35:55,520
that's mathematical but not quite
 

10497
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:56,790
that's mathematical but not quite
mathematical but it is if you think

10498
02:35:56,790 --> 02:35:56,800
mathematical but it is if you think
 

10499
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:57,990
mathematical but it is if you think
about an algorithm like a lambda

10500
02:35:57,990 --> 02:35:58,000
about an algorithm like a lambda
 

10501
02:35:58,000 --> 02:35:59,750
about an algorithm like a lambda
calculus which brings you back to the

10502
02:35:59,750 --> 02:35:59,760
calculus which brings you back to the
 

10503
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:01,270
calculus which brings you back to the
the world of mathematics so i'm thinking

10504
02:36:01,270 --> 02:36:01,280
the world of mathematics so i'm thinking
 

10505
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:04,710
the world of mathematics so i'm thinking
out loud here but basically

10506
02:36:04,710 --> 02:36:04,720

 

10507
02:36:04,720 --> 02:36:06,950

abstract math is sort of like

10508
02:36:06,950 --> 02:36:06,960
abstract math is sort of like
 

10509
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,950
abstract math is sort of like
unreasonably effective

10510
02:36:08,950 --> 02:36:08,960
unreasonably effective
 

10511
02:36:08,960 --> 02:36:10,469
unreasonably effective
at explaining a lot of things and that's

10512
02:36:10,469 --> 02:36:10,479
at explaining a lot of things and that's
 

10513
02:36:10,479 --> 02:36:12,070
at explaining a lot of things and that's
just what i feel like i glimpse i'm not

10514
02:36:12,070 --> 02:36:12,080
just what i feel like i glimpse i'm not
 

10515
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:12,710
just what i feel like i glimpse i'm not
a

10516
02:36:12,710 --> 02:36:12,720
a
 

10517
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,230
a
um not like a super well-known

10518
02:36:14,230 --> 02:36:14,240
um not like a super well-known
 

10519
02:36:14,240 --> 02:36:15,910
um not like a super well-known
theoretician i don't have really famous

10520
02:36:15,910 --> 02:36:15,920
theoretician i don't have really famous
 

10521
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:16,790
theoretician i don't have really famous
results

10522
02:36:16,790 --> 02:36:16,800
results
 

10523
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:19,910
results
so even as a sort of middling

10524
02:36:19,910 --> 02:36:19,920
so even as a sort of middling
 

10525
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:22,469
so even as a sort of middling
you know career theoretician i keep

10526
02:36:22,469 --> 02:36:22,479
you know career theoretician i keep
 

10527
02:36:22,479 --> 02:36:23,910
you know career theoretician i keep
encountering this

10528
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:23,920
encountering this
 

10529
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:25,990
encountering this
where we think we're solving some

10530
02:36:25,990 --> 02:36:26,000
where we think we're solving some
 

10531
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,550
where we think we're solving some
problem about computers and algorithms

10532
02:36:28,550 --> 02:36:28,560
problem about computers and algorithms
 

10533
02:36:28,560 --> 02:36:30,469
problem about computers and algorithms
and it's some much deeper underlying

10534
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
and it's some much deeper underlying
 

10535
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:33,030
and it's some much deeper underlying
math it's shannon but shannon is entropy

10536
02:36:33,030 --> 02:36:33,040
math it's shannon but shannon is entropy
 

10537
02:36:33,040 --> 02:36:34,469
math it's shannon but shannon is entropy
but entropy was really

10538
02:36:34,469 --> 02:36:34,479
but entropy was really
 

10539
02:36:34,479 --> 02:36:37,590
but entropy was really
you know goes all the way back to

10540
02:36:37,590 --> 02:36:37,600
you know goes all the way back to
 

10541
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:39,110
you know goes all the way back to
whatever it was boiler all the way back

10542
02:36:39,110 --> 02:36:39,120
whatever it was boiler all the way back
 

10543
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:41,270
whatever it was boiler all the way back
to looking at the early physics and

10544
02:36:41,270 --> 02:36:41,280
to looking at the early physics and
 

10545
02:36:41,280 --> 02:36:43,750
to looking at the early physics and
and it's anyways to me i think it's

10546
02:36:43,750 --> 02:36:43,760
and it's anyways to me i think it's
 

10547
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:44,790
and it's anyways to me i think it's
amazing

10548
02:36:44,790 --> 02:36:44,800
amazing
 

10549
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:46,790
amazing
yeah i mean it but it could be the flip

10550
02:36:46,790 --> 02:36:46,800
yeah i mean it but it could be the flip
 

10551
02:36:46,800 --> 02:36:48,309
yeah i mean it but it could be the flip
side of that could be just our brains

10552
02:36:48,309 --> 02:36:48,319
side of that could be just our brains
 

10553
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:50,389
side of that could be just our brains
draw so much pleasure from the

10554
02:36:50,389 --> 02:36:50,399
draw so much pleasure from the
 

10555
02:36:50,399 --> 02:36:53,190
draw so much pleasure from the
uh deriving generalized theories and

10556
02:36:53,190 --> 02:36:53,200
uh deriving generalized theories and
 

10557
02:36:53,200 --> 02:36:54,870
uh deriving generalized theories and
simplifying the universe

10558
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:54,880
simplifying the universe
 

10559
02:36:54,880 --> 02:36:57,030
simplifying the universe
that we just naturally see that kind of

10560
02:36:57,030 --> 02:36:57,040
that we just naturally see that kind of
 

10561
02:36:57,040 --> 02:36:58,550
that we just naturally see that kind of
simplicity and everything

10562
02:36:58,550 --> 02:36:58,560
simplicity and everything
 

10563
02:36:58,560 --> 02:37:00,469
simplicity and everything
yeah so that's the whole you know newton

10564
02:37:00,469 --> 02:37:00,479
yeah so that's the whole you know newton
 

10565
02:37:00,479 --> 02:37:02,710
yeah so that's the whole you know newton
de einstein right so you can you can say

10566
02:37:02,710 --> 02:37:02,720
de einstein right so you can you can say
 

10567
02:37:02,720 --> 02:37:04,150
de einstein right so you can you can say
this must be right because it's so

10568
02:37:04,150 --> 02:37:04,160
this must be right because it's so
 

10569
02:37:04,160 --> 02:37:05,750
this must be right because it's so
predictive well it's not quite

10570
02:37:05,750 --> 02:37:05,760
predictive well it's not quite
 

10571
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:07,190
predictive well it's not quite
predictive because mercury wobbles a

10572
02:37:07,190 --> 02:37:07,200
predictive because mercury wobbles a
 

10573
02:37:07,200 --> 02:37:08,469
predictive because mercury wobbles a
little bit but i think we have it set

10574
02:37:08,469 --> 02:37:08,479
little bit but i think we have it set
 

10575
02:37:08,479 --> 02:37:09,750
little bit but i think we have it set
and then you turn out

10576
02:37:09,750 --> 02:37:09,760
and then you turn out
 

10577
02:37:09,760 --> 02:37:12,070
and then you turn out
now einstein and then and then you get

10578
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:12,080
now einstein and then and then you get
 

10579
02:37:12,080 --> 02:37:14,230
now einstein and then and then you get
boar like no not einstein it's actually

10580
02:37:14,230 --> 02:37:14,240
boar like no not einstein it's actually
 

10581
02:37:14,240 --> 02:37:15,910
boar like no not einstein it's actually
statistical and yeah so

10582
02:37:15,910 --> 02:37:15,920
statistical and yeah so
 

10583
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:17,990
statistical and yeah so
it's it's hard to also know like where a

10584
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:18,000
it's it's hard to also know like where a
 

10585
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,150
it's it's hard to also know like where a
smooth analysis fits into all that

10586
02:37:20,150 --> 02:37:20,160
smooth analysis fits into all that
 

10587
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:22,070
smooth analysis fits into all that
or a little bit of noi like you can say

10588
02:37:22,070 --> 02:37:22,080
or a little bit of noi like you can say
 

10589
02:37:22,080 --> 02:37:24,150
or a little bit of noi like you can say
something very clean

10590
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,160
something very clean
 

10591
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:26,389
something very clean
about a system and then a little bit of

10592
02:37:26,389 --> 02:37:26,399
about a system and then a little bit of
 

10593
02:37:26,399 --> 02:37:27,190
about a system and then a little bit of
noise

10594
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:27,200
noise
 

10595
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:28,950
noise
like the average case is actually very

10596
02:37:28,950 --> 02:37:28,960
like the average case is actually very
 

10597
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:30,550
like the average case is actually very
different and so

10598
02:37:30,550 --> 02:37:30,560
different and so
 

10599
02:37:30,560 --> 02:37:31,670
different and so
yeah i mean that's where like the

10600
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
yeah i mean that's where like the
 

10601
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,230
yeah i mean that's where like the
quantum mechanics comes in it's like ugh

10602
02:37:34,230 --> 02:37:34,240
quantum mechanics comes in it's like ugh
 

10603
02:37:34,240 --> 02:37:35,670
quantum mechanics comes in it's like ugh
why does that have to be randomness in

10604
02:37:35,670 --> 02:37:35,680
why does that have to be randomness in
 

10605
02:37:35,680 --> 02:37:37,110
why does that have to be randomness in
this yeah it would have through this

10606
02:37:37,110 --> 02:37:37,120
this yeah it would have through this
 

10607
02:37:37,120 --> 02:37:37,670
this yeah it would have through this
complex

10608
02:37:37,670 --> 02:37:37,680
complex
 

10609
02:37:37,680 --> 02:37:41,030
complex
statistics yeah yeah

10610
02:37:41,030 --> 02:37:41,040
statistics yeah yeah
 

10611
02:37:41,040 --> 02:37:43,429
statistics yeah yeah
so to be determined yeah that'll be my

10612
02:37:43,429 --> 02:37:43,439
so to be determined yeah that'll be my
 

10613
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:45,590
so to be determined yeah that'll be my
next book that'd be ambitious the

10614
02:37:45,590 --> 02:37:45,600
next book that'd be ambitious the
 

10615
02:37:45,600 --> 02:37:46,870

productive at work
can i ask you just if it's possible to

10624
02:37:55,990 --> 02:37:56,000
can i ask you just if it's possible to
 

10625
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,429
can i ask you just if it's possible to
do an overview and just

10626
02:37:57,429 --> 02:37:57,439
do an overview and just
 

10627
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:00,710
do an overview and just
some brief comments of wisdom on the

10628
02:38:00,710 --> 02:38:00,720
some brief comments of wisdom on the
 

10629
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:02,790
some brief comments of wisdom on the
process of publishing a book

10630
02:38:02,790 --> 02:38:02,800
process of publishing a book
 

10631
02:38:02,800 --> 02:38:04,309
process of publishing a book
what's that process entail what are the

10632
02:38:04,309 --> 02:38:04,319
what's that process entail what are the
 

10633
02:38:04,319 --> 02:38:05,750
what's that process entail what are the
different options and what's your

10634
02:38:05,750 --> 02:38:05,760
different options and what's your
 

10635
02:38:05,760 --> 02:38:08,630
different options and what's your
recommendation

10636
02:38:08,630 --> 02:38:08,640

 

10637
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:11,270

for somebody that wants to write a book

10638
02:38:11,270 --> 02:38:11,280
for somebody that wants to write a book
 

10639
02:38:11,280 --> 02:38:12,230
for somebody that wants to write a book
like yours

10640
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
like yours
 

10641
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:14,790
like yours
a nonfiction book that discovers

10642
02:38:14,790 --> 02:38:14,800
a nonfiction book that discovers
 

10643
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:17,750
a nonfiction book that discovers
something interesting about this world

10644
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:17,760
something interesting about this world
 

10645
02:38:17,760 --> 02:38:21,429
something interesting about this world
so what i i usually advise is

10646
02:38:21,429 --> 02:38:21,439
so what i i usually advise is
 

10647
02:38:21,439 --> 02:38:25,429
so what i i usually advise is
follow the follow the process as is

10648
02:38:25,429 --> 02:38:25,439
follow the follow the process as is
 

10649
02:38:25,439 --> 02:38:27,830
follow the follow the process as is
don't try to reinvent i think that that

10650
02:38:27,830 --> 02:38:27,840
don't try to reinvent i think that that
 

10651
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:30,230
don't try to reinvent i think that that
happens a lot where

10652
02:38:30,230 --> 02:38:30,240
happens a lot where
 

10653
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:31,590
happens a lot where
you'll try to reinvent the way the

10654
02:38:31,590 --> 02:38:31,600
you'll try to reinvent the way the
 

10655
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:33,270
you'll try to reinvent the way the
publishing industry should work like

10656
02:38:33,270 --> 02:38:33,280
publishing industry should work like
 

10657
02:38:33,280 --> 02:38:35,670
publishing industry should work like
this kind of not like in a business

10658
02:38:35,670 --> 02:38:35,680
this kind of not like in a business
 

10659
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:37,190
this kind of not like in a business
model ways but just like this is what i

10660
02:38:37,190 --> 02:38:37,200
model ways but just like this is what i
 

10661
02:38:37,200 --> 02:38:37,990
model ways but just like this is what i
want to do

10662
02:38:37,990 --> 02:38:38,000
want to do
 

10663
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:39,510
want to do
i want to write a thousand words a day

10664
02:38:39,510 --> 02:38:39,520
i want to write a thousand words a day
 

10665
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:40,870
i want to write a thousand words a day
and i want to do this and i'm going to

10666
02:38:40,870 --> 02:38:40,880
and i want to do this and i'm going to
 

10667
02:38:40,880 --> 02:38:42,710
and i want to do this and i'm going to
put on the internet and

10668
02:38:42,710 --> 02:38:42,720
put on the internet and
 

10669
02:38:42,720 --> 02:38:44,550
put on the internet and
the publishing industry is very specific

10670
02:38:44,550 --> 02:38:44,560
the publishing industry is very specific
 

10671
02:38:44,560 --> 02:38:46,150
the publishing industry is very specific
about how it works

10672
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:46,160
about how it works
 

10673
02:38:46,160 --> 02:38:47,510
about how it works
and so like when i got started writing

10674
02:38:47,510 --> 02:38:47,520
and so like when i got started writing
 

10675
02:38:47,520 --> 02:38:49,030
and so like when i got started writing
books was at a very young age so you

10676
02:38:49,030 --> 02:38:49,040
books was at a very young age so you
 

10677
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:49,750
books was at a very young age so you
know i

10678
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:49,760
know i
 

10679
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:52,230
know i
sold my first book at the age of 21. the

10680
02:38:52,230 --> 02:38:52,240
sold my first book at the age of 21. the
 

10681
02:38:52,240 --> 02:38:53,510
sold my first book at the age of 21. the
way i did that

10682
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:53,520
way i did that
 

10683
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:56,630
way i did that
is i found the family friend that was an

10684
02:38:56,630 --> 02:38:56,640
is i found the family friend that was an
 

10685
02:38:56,640 --> 02:38:59,270
is i found the family friend that was an
agent and i said i'm not trying to make

10686
02:38:59,270 --> 02:38:59,280
agent and i said i'm not trying to make
 

10687
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:00,389
agent and i said i'm not trying to make
you be my agent

10688
02:39:00,389 --> 02:39:00,399
you be my agent
 

10689
02:39:00,399 --> 02:39:02,230
you be my agent
just explain to me how this works not

10690
02:39:02,230 --> 02:39:02,240
just explain to me how this works not
 

10691
02:39:02,240 --> 02:39:03,510
just explain to me how this works not
just how the world works but

10692
02:39:03,510 --> 02:39:03,520
just how the world works but
 

10693
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:05,510
just how the world works but
give me the hard truth about how would a

10694
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:05,520
give me the hard truth about how would a
 

10695
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:06,550
give me the hard truth about how would a
21 year old

10696
02:39:06,550 --> 02:39:06,560
21 year old
 

10697
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:08,070
21 year old
under what conditions could a 21 year

10698
02:39:08,070 --> 02:39:08,080
under what conditions could a 21 year
 

10699
02:39:08,080 --> 02:39:09,190
under what conditions could a 21 year
old sell a book what would that look

10700
02:39:09,190 --> 02:39:09,200
old sell a book what would that look
 

10701
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:10,389
old sell a book what would that look
like and she just explained it to me

10702
02:39:10,389 --> 02:39:10,399
like and she just explained it to me
 

10703
02:39:10,399 --> 02:39:11,750
like and she just explained it to me
well you have to do this and have to be

10704
02:39:11,750 --> 02:39:11,760
well you have to do this and have to be
 

10705
02:39:11,760 --> 02:39:13,190
well you have to do this and have to be
a subject that it made sense for you to

10706
02:39:13,190 --> 02:39:13,200
a subject that it made sense for you to
 

10707
02:39:13,200 --> 02:39:13,830
a subject that it made sense for you to
write

10708
02:39:13,830 --> 02:39:13,840
write
 

10709
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:14,950
write
and you would have to do this type of

10710
02:39:14,950 --> 02:39:14,960
and you would have to do this type of
 

10711
02:39:14,960 --> 02:39:16,630
and you would have to do this type of
writing for the publications to validate

10712
02:39:16,630 --> 02:39:16,640
writing for the publications to validate
 

10713
02:39:16,640 --> 02:39:17,750
writing for the publications to validate
it and blah blah blah and you have to

10714
02:39:17,750 --> 02:39:17,760
it and blah blah blah and you have to
 

10715
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,710
it and blah blah blah and you have to
get the agent first

10716
02:39:18,710 --> 02:39:18,720
get the agent first
 

10717
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:20,630
get the agent first
and i learned the whole game plan and

10718
02:39:20,630 --> 02:39:20,640
and i learned the whole game plan and
 

10719
02:39:20,640 --> 02:39:22,070
and i learned the whole game plan and
then i executed

10720
02:39:22,070 --> 02:39:22,080
then i executed
 

10721
02:39:22,080 --> 02:39:23,910
then i executed
and and so the rough game plan is with

10722
02:39:23,910 --> 02:39:23,920
and and so the rough game plan is with
 

10723
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:26,230
and and so the rough game plan is with
nonfiction you get the agent first

10724
02:39:26,230 --> 02:39:26,240
nonfiction you get the agent first
 

10725
02:39:26,240 --> 02:39:27,670
nonfiction you get the agent first
and the agent's going to sell it to the

10726
02:39:27,670 --> 02:39:27,680
and the agent's going to sell it to the
 

10727
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:29,510
and the agent's going to sell it to the
publishers so like you're never sending

10728
02:39:29,510 --> 02:39:29,520
publishers so like you're never sending
 

10729
02:39:29,520 --> 02:39:31,030
publishers so like you're never sending
something directly to the publishers and

10730
02:39:31,030 --> 02:39:31,040
something directly to the publishers and
 

10731
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:32,389
something directly to the publishers and
non-fiction you're not writing the book

10732
02:39:32,389 --> 02:39:32,399
non-fiction you're not writing the book
 

10733
02:39:32,399 --> 02:39:33,510
non-fiction you're not writing the book
first

10734
02:39:33,510 --> 02:39:33,520
first
 

10735
02:39:33,520 --> 02:39:35,030
first
right the you're going to get an advance

10736
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,040
right the you're going to get an advance
 

10737
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:37,270
right the you're going to get an advance
from the publisher once sold

10738
02:39:37,270 --> 02:39:37,280
from the publisher once sold
 

10739
02:39:37,280 --> 02:39:39,429
from the publisher once sold
and then you're going to do the primary

10740
02:39:39,429 --> 02:39:39,439
and then you're going to do the primary
 

10741
02:39:39,439 --> 02:39:41,110
and then you're going to do the primary
writing of the book in fact it will

10742
02:39:41,110 --> 02:39:41,120
writing of the book in fact it will
 

10743
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:42,790
writing of the book in fact it will
in most circumstances hurt you if you've

10744
02:39:42,790 --> 02:39:42,800
in most circumstances hurt you if you've
 

10745
02:39:42,800 --> 02:39:43,830
in most circumstances hurt you if you've
already written if you've already

10746
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:43,840
already written if you've already
 

10747
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:44,630
already written if you've already
written it yeah

10748
02:39:44,630 --> 02:39:44,640
written it yeah
 

10749
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,150
written it yeah
so you're you're trying to sell well i

10750
02:39:46,150 --> 02:39:46,160
so you're you're trying to sell well i
 

10751
02:39:46,160 --> 02:39:47,830
so you're you're trying to sell well i
guess the agent first you sell to the

10752
02:39:47,830 --> 02:39:47,840
guess the agent first you sell to the
 

10753
02:39:47,840 --> 02:39:49,270
guess the agent first you sell to the
agent and the agent sells it to the

10754
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:49,280
agent and the agent sells it to the
 

10755
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:49,990
agent and the agent sells it to the
publishers

10756
02:39:49,990 --> 02:39:50,000
publishers
 

10757
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:51,670
publishers
it's much easier to get an agent than a

10758
02:39:51,670 --> 02:39:51,680
it's much easier to get an agent than a
 

10759
02:39:51,680 --> 02:39:53,270
it's much easier to get an agent than a
book deal so the thought is

10760
02:39:53,270 --> 02:39:53,280
book deal so the thought is
 

10761
02:39:53,280 --> 02:39:54,870
book deal so the thought is
if you can't get an agent then why would

10762
02:39:54,870 --> 02:39:54,880
if you can't get an agent then why would
 

10763
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:56,870
if you can't get an agent then why would
you so you start with and also

10764
02:39:56,870 --> 02:39:56,880
you so you start with and also
 

10765
02:39:56,880 --> 02:39:58,469
you so you start with and also
and the way this works with a good agent

10766
02:39:58,469 --> 02:39:58,479
and the way this works with a good agent
 

10767
02:39:58,479 --> 02:40:00,230
and the way this works with a good agent
is they know all the editors

10768
02:40:00,230 --> 02:40:00,240
is they know all the editors
 

10769
02:40:00,240 --> 02:40:01,349
is they know all the editors
and they have lunch with the editors and

10770
02:40:01,349 --> 02:40:01,359
and they have lunch with the editors and
 

10771
02:40:01,359 --> 02:40:02,230
and they have lunch with the editors and
they're always just looking what

10772
02:40:02,230 --> 02:40:02,240
they're always just looking what
 

10773
02:40:02,240 --> 02:40:03,349
they're always just looking what
projects you have coming what are you

10774
02:40:03,349 --> 02:40:03,359
projects you have coming what are you
 

10775
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:04,550
projects you have coming what are you
looking for here's one of my authors

10776
02:40:04,550 --> 02:40:04,560
looking for here's one of my authors
 

10777
02:40:04,560 --> 02:40:05,910
looking for here's one of my authors
that's the way all these deals happen

10778
02:40:05,910 --> 02:40:05,920
that's the way all these deals happen
 

10779
02:40:05,920 --> 02:40:07,190
that's the way all these deals happen
it's not you're not emailing a

10780
02:40:07,190 --> 02:40:07,200
it's not you're not emailing a
 

10781
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:08,230
it's not you're not emailing a
manuscript to a

10782
02:40:08,230 --> 02:40:08,240
manuscript to a
 

10783
02:40:08,240 --> 02:40:10,950
manuscript to a
slush pile yeah and so so first of all

10784
02:40:10,950 --> 02:40:10,960
slush pile yeah and so so first of all
 

10785
02:40:10,960 --> 02:40:12,389
slush pile yeah and so so first of all
the agent takes a percentage and then

10786
02:40:12,389 --> 02:40:12,399
the agent takes a percentage and then
 

10787
02:40:12,399 --> 02:40:14,070
the agent takes a percentage and then
the publishers this is where the process

10788
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,080
the publishers this is where the process
 

10789
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,870
the publishers this is where the process
comes in they

10790
02:40:14,870 --> 02:40:14,880
comes in they
 

10791
02:40:14,880 --> 02:40:16,630
comes in they
they take also a cut that's probably

10792
02:40:16,630 --> 02:40:16,640
they take also a cut that's probably
 

10793
02:40:16,640 --> 02:40:18,630
they take also a cut that's probably
ridiculous so if you try to

10794
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:18,640
ridiculous so if you try to
 

10795
02:40:18,640 --> 02:40:21,510
ridiculous so if you try to
reinvent the system you'll probably be

10796
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:21,520
reinvent the system you'll probably be
 

10797
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:22,790
reinvent the system you'll probably be
frustrated by the percentage that

10798
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:22,800
frustrated by the percentage that
 

10799
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:24,550
frustrated by the percentage that
everyone takes relative to how much

10800
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:24,560
everyone takes relative to how much
 

10801
02:40:24,560 --> 02:40:26,070
everyone takes relative to how much
bureaucracy and efficiency

10802
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:26,080
bureaucracy and efficiency
 

10803
02:40:26,080 --> 02:40:27,670
bureaucracy and efficiency
yeah ridiculousness there is in the

10804
02:40:27,670 --> 02:40:27,680
yeah ridiculousness there is in the
 

10805
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:29,830
yeah ridiculousness there is in the
system your recommendation is like

10806
02:40:29,830 --> 02:40:29,840
system your recommendation is like
 

10807
02:40:29,840 --> 02:40:32,870
system your recommendation is like
you're just one ant stop trying to uh

10808
02:40:32,870 --> 02:40:32,880
you're just one ant stop trying to uh
 

10809
02:40:32,880 --> 02:40:35,349
you're just one ant stop trying to uh
build your own ant colony well or or or

10810
02:40:35,349 --> 02:40:35,359
build your own ant colony well or or or
 

10811
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:36,870
build your own ant colony well or or or
if you create your own process for how

10812
02:40:36,870 --> 02:40:36,880
if you create your own process for how
 

10813
02:40:36,880 --> 02:40:37,510
if you create your own process for how
it should work

10814
02:40:37,510 --> 02:40:37,520
it should work
 

10815
02:40:37,520 --> 02:40:39,030
it should work
it's not gonna the book's not gonna get

10816
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:39,040
it's not gonna the book's not gonna get
 

10817
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:40,389
it's not gonna the book's not gonna get
published so so there's a separate

10818
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
published so so there's a separate
 

10819
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:41,830
published so so there's a separate
question the economic question of like

10820
02:40:41,830 --> 02:40:41,840
question the economic question of like
 

10821
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:43,510
question the economic question of like
should i create my own

10822
02:40:43,510 --> 02:40:43,520
should i create my own
 

10823
02:40:43,520 --> 02:40:44,870
should i create my own
like self-publish it or do something

10824
02:40:44,870 --> 02:40:44,880
like self-publish it or do something
 

10825
02:40:44,880 --> 02:40:46,550
like self-publish it or do something
like that but yeah but putting that

10826
02:40:46,550 --> 02:40:46,560
like that but yeah but putting that
 

10827
02:40:46,560 --> 02:40:47,830
like that but yeah but putting that
aside there's a lot of people i

10828
02:40:47,830 --> 02:40:47,840
aside there's a lot of people i
 

10829
02:40:47,840 --> 02:40:48,710
aside there's a lot of people i
encounter

10830
02:40:48,710 --> 02:40:48,720
encounter
 

10831
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:50,150
encounter
that want to publish a book with a main

10832
02:40:50,150 --> 02:40:50,160
that want to publish a book with a main
 

10833
02:40:50,160 --> 02:40:51,990
that want to publish a book with a main
publisher but they invent their own

10834
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,000
publisher but they invent their own
 

10835
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:53,269
publisher but they invent their own
rules for how that works

10836
02:40:53,269 --> 02:40:53,279
rules for how that works
 

10837
02:40:53,279 --> 02:40:55,190
rules for how that works
right so so then the alternative though

10838
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
right so so then the alternative though
 

10839
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:58,550
right so so then the alternative though
is self-publishing and the the downside

10840
02:40:58,550 --> 02:40:58,560
is self-publishing and the the downside
 

10841
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:00,870
is self-publishing and the the downside
there's a lot of downsides it's like

10842
02:41:00,870 --> 02:41:00,880
there's a lot of downsides it's like
 

10843
02:41:00,880 --> 02:41:02,710
there's a lot of downsides it's like
it's almost like publishing an opinion

10844

02:45:11,359 --> 02:45:12,630
i'm losing the thread here or this seems
like it could be longer

11128
02:45:12,630 --> 02:45:12,640
like it could be longer
 

11129
02:45:12,640 --> 02:45:13,910
like it could be longer
whereas the first book i wrote when i

you start a lot of sentences with so uh
you don't use any contractions because

11136
02:45:20,870 --> 02:45:20,880
you don't use any contractions because
 

11137
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:22,469
you don't use any contractions because
i've been doing scientific writing yeah

11138

i've been doing scientific writing yeah
use contractions like you should

11140
02:45:23,590 --> 02:45:23,600
use contractions like you should
 

11141
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:25,269

back and rewrite the whole thing yeah
 

11147

plan right like let's start
 

11367
02:49:02,479 --> 02:49:03,510
plan right like let's start
let's start figuring that out now

11368
02:49:03,510 --> 02:49:03,520
let's start figuring that out now
 

11369
02:49:03,520 --> 02:49:05,510
let's start figuring that out now
because it's not all

11370
02:49:05,510 --> 02:49:05,520
because it's not all
 

11371

gonna happen right
so how are we gonna do this like how do

11388
02:49:21,269 --> 02:49:21,279
so how are we gonna do this like how do

02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:30,150
um then relationships is the that's the
buffer for all of that

11396
02:49:30,150 --> 02:49:30,160
buffer for all of that
 

11397
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:31,670
buffer for all of that
because we're wired for it right i went

11398
02:49:31,670 --> 02:49:31,680
because we're wired for it right i went
 

11399
02:49:31,680 --> 02:49:33,429
because we're wired for it right i went
down this this rabbit hole with digital

11400
02:49:33,429 --> 02:49:33,439
down this this rabbit hole with digital
 

11401
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:34,950
down this this rabbit hole with digital
minimalism i went down this huge rabbit

we take it there's a pretty accepted

11444
02:50:08,870 --> 02:50:08,880
we take it there's a pretty accepted
 

11445
02:50:08,880 --> 02:50:10,309
we take it there's a pretty accepted
theory that the default mode network

11446
02:50:10,309 --> 02:50:10,319
theory that the default mode network
 

11447
02:50:10,319 --> 02:50:11,750
theory that the default mode network
like a lot of what the default mode

11448
02:50:11,750 --> 02:50:11,760
like a lot of what the default mode
 

11449
02:50:11,760 --> 02:50:13,110
like a lot of what the default mode
network is doing so the sort of the

11450
02:50:13,110 --> 02:50:13,120
network is doing so the sort of the
 

11451
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:14,950
network is doing so the sort of the
default state our brain goes into when

default state our brain goes into when
 

11453
02:50:14,960 --> 02:50:16,150
default state our brain goes into when
we're not doing something in particular

11454
02:50:16,150 --> 02:50:16,160
we're not doing something in particular

so i've
 

11467
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:26,950
so i've
more recently the way i think about it

more recently the way i think about it
 

11469
02:50:26,960 --> 02:50:28,630
more recently the way i think about it
is like relationships first

11470
02:50:28,630 --> 02:50:28,640
is like relationships first
 

11471

02:50:32,070 --> 02:50:32,080
putting like and i don't think we put
 

11475
02:50:32,080 --> 02:50:33,510
putting like and i don't think we put
nearly enough time into it i worry that

11476
02:50:33,510 --> 02:50:33,520
nearly enough time into it i worry that
 

11477

saying about the sort of the
existentialist

11826

approach
 

11831
02:55:46,960 --> 02:55:49,030
approach
the one thing that that there is are

11832
02:55:49,030 --> 02:55:49,040
the one thing that that there is are
 

11833
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:50,070
the one thing that that there is are
intimations

11834
02:55:50,070 --> 02:55:50,080
intimations

human haves of
 

11839
02:55:53,920 --> 02:55:55,990
human haves of
somehow this feels right and this feels

02:56:05,349 --> 02:56:05,359
these intimations are a grounding
 

11851
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:07,030
these intimations are a grounding
against arbitrariness

11852
02:56:07,030 --> 02:56:07,040
against arbitrariness
 

11853
02:56:07,040 --> 02:56:07,990
against arbitrariness
like one of the ideas i'm really

have to go way back pre-enlightenment

11898
02:56:47,429 --> 02:56:47,439
have to go way back pre-enlightenment
 

11899
02:56:47,439 --> 02:56:48,870
have to go way back pre-enlightenment
where all this was formed we got messed

11900
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:48,880
where all this was formed we got messed
 

11901
02:56:48,880 --> 02:56:49,670
where all this was formed we got messed
up thinking about

11902
02:56:49,670 --> 02:56:49,680
up thinking about
 

11903
02:56:49,680 --> 02:56:51,590
up thinking about
religion post enlightenment right and

11904
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:51,600
religion post enlightenment right and
 

11905
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:53,590
religion post enlightenment right and
and um

11906
02:56:53,590 --> 02:56:53,600
and um
 

11907
02:56:53,600 --> 02:56:55,030
and um
these were operating systems for making

11908
02:56:55,030 --> 02:56:55,040
these were operating systems for making
 

11909
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:57,830
these were operating systems for making
sense of intimations

11910
02:56:57,830 --> 02:56:57,840
sense of intimations
 

11911
02:56:57,840 --> 02:56:59,190
sense of intimations
the one thing we had were these

11912
02:56:59,190 --> 02:56:59,200
the one thing we had were these
 

11913
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:00,870
the one thing we had were these
different informations of this field

11914
02:57:00,870 --> 02:57:00,880
different informations of this field
 

11915
02:57:00,880 --> 02:57:01,190
different informations of this field
like

11916
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:01,200
like
 

11917
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:04,389
like
ah and mystical experience and this

11918
02:57:04,389 --> 02:57:04,399
ah and mystical experience and this
 

11919
02:57:04,399 --> 02:57:05,750
ah and mystical experience and this
feels some there's something you feel

11920
02:57:05,750 --> 02:57:05,760
feels some there's something you feel
 

11921
02:57:05,760 --> 02:57:07,110
feels some there's something you feel
when you act in a certain way

11922
02:57:07,110 --> 02:57:07,120
when you act in a certain way
 

11923
02:57:07,120 --> 02:57:09,030
when you act in a certain way
and don't act in this other way and it

11924
02:57:09,030 --> 02:57:09,040
and don't act in this other way and it
 

11925
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:10,550
and don't act in this other way and it
was like the scientists who were trying

11926
02:57:10,550 --> 02:57:10,560
was like the scientists who were trying
 

11927
02:57:10,560 --> 02:57:11,110
was like the scientists who were trying
to

11928
02:57:11,110 --> 02:57:11,120
to
 

11929
02:57:11,120 --> 02:57:13,110
to
study and understand the model of the

11930
02:57:13,110 --> 02:57:13,120
study and understand the model of the
 

11931
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:14,630
study and understand the model of the
atom by just looking at

11932
02:57:14,630 --> 02:57:14,640
atom by just looking at
 

11933
02:57:14,640 --> 02:57:15,910
atom by just looking at
experiments and trying to understand

11934
02:57:15,910 --> 02:57:15,920
experiments and trying to understand
 

11935
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,750
experiments and trying to understand
what's going on like the great religions

11936
02:57:17,750 --> 02:57:17,760
what's going on like the great religions
 

11937
02:57:17,760 --> 02:57:19,670
what's going on like the great religions
of the world were basically figuring out

11938
02:57:19,670 --> 02:57:19,680
of the world were basically figuring out
 

11939
02:57:19,680 --> 02:57:20,710
of the world were basically figuring out
how do we make sense of these

11940
02:57:20,710 --> 02:57:20,720
how do we make sense of these
 

11941
02:57:20,720 --> 02:57:22,790
how do we make sense of these
intimations and live in alignment with

11942
02:57:22,790 --> 02:57:22,800
intimations and live in alignment with
 

11943
02:57:22,800 --> 02:57:24,309
intimations and live in alignment with
them and build a life of meaning around

11944
02:57:24,309 --> 02:57:24,319
them and build a life of meaning around
 

11945
02:57:24,319 --> 02:57:24,790
them and build a life of meaning around
that

11946
02:57:24,790 --> 02:57:24,800
that
 

11947
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:26,230
that
what were the tools they were using they

11948
02:57:26,230 --> 02:57:26,240
what were the tools they were using they
 

11949
02:57:26,240 --> 02:57:27,990
what were the tools they were using they
were using ritual they were using belief

11950
02:57:27,990 --> 02:57:28,000
were using ritual they were using belief
 

11951
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:29,429
were using ritual they were using belief
they were using action

11952
02:57:29,429 --> 02:57:29,439
they were using action
 

11953
02:57:29,439 --> 02:57:31,590
they were using action
but all of it was like an os it was like

11954
02:57:31,590 --> 02:57:31,600
but all of it was like an os it was like
 

11955
02:57:31,600 --> 02:57:34,790
but all of it was like an os it was like
a liturgical model of the atom that

11956
02:57:34,790 --> 02:57:34,800
a liturgical model of the atom that
 

11957
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:37,910
a liturgical model of the atom that
hardcoded in so it's it did uh through

11958
02:57:37,910 --> 02:57:37,920
hardcoded in so it's it did uh through
 

11959
02:57:37,920 --> 02:57:39,670
hardcoded in so it's it did uh through
the evolutionary process sometimes

11960
02:57:39,670 --> 02:57:39,680
the evolutionary process sometimes
 

11961
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:40,710
the evolutionary process sometimes
i mean they wouldn't have called it that

11962
02:57:40,710 --> 02:57:40,720
i mean they wouldn't have called it that
 

11963
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:42,790
i mean they wouldn't have called it that
back then or yeah i mean whether

11964
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:42,800
back then or yeah i mean whether
 

11965
02:57:42,800 --> 02:57:44,469
back then or yeah i mean whether
they said who they didn't have that

11966
02:57:44,469 --> 02:57:44,479
they said who they didn't have that
 

11967
02:57:44,479 --> 02:57:45,750
they said who they didn't have that
there's pre-enlightenment they just said

11968
02:57:45,750 --> 02:57:45,760
there's pre-enlightenment they just said
 

11969
02:57:45,760 --> 02:57:46,870
there's pre-enlightenment they just said
this is here

11970
02:57:46,870 --> 02:57:46,880
this is here
 

11971
02:57:46,880 --> 02:57:49,429
this is here
and and the directive is to to try to

11972
02:57:49,429 --> 02:57:49,439
and and the directive is to to try to
 

11973
02:57:49,439 --> 02:57:50,790
and and the directive is to to try to
live in alignment with that

11974
02:57:50,790 --> 02:57:50,800
live in alignment with that
 

11975
02:57:50,800 --> 02:57:52,230
live in alignment with that
well then i want to ask who wrote the

11976
02:57:52,230 --> 02:57:52,240
well then i want to ask who wrote the
 

11977
02:57:52,240 --> 02:57:54,230
well then i want to ask who wrote the
original code yeah so that's so

11978
02:57:54,230 --> 02:57:54,240
original code yeah so that's so
 

11979
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:55,990
original code yeah so that's so
one question yeah so so armstrong lays

11980
02:57:55,990 --> 02:57:56,000
one question yeah so so armstrong lays
 

11981
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,429
one question yeah so so armstrong lays
out this good argument and where it gets

11982
02:57:57,429 --> 02:57:57,439
out this good argument and where it gets
 

11983
02:57:57,439 --> 02:57:58,630
out this good argument and where it gets
really interesting is that

11984
02:57:58,630 --> 02:57:58,640
really interesting is that
 

11985
02:57:58,640 --> 02:58:01,110
really interesting is that
that she emphasizes that all of this was

11986
02:58:01,110 --> 02:58:01,120
that she emphasizes that all of this was
 

11987
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:02,309
that she emphasizes that all of this was
considered ineffable

11988
02:58:02,309 --> 02:58:02,319
considered ineffable
 

11989
02:58:02,319 --> 02:58:04,710
considered ineffable
right so the whole notion and this is

11990
02:58:04,710 --> 02:58:04,720
right so the whole notion and this is
 

11991
02:58:04,720 --> 02:58:05,990
right so the whole notion and this is
like rich in jewish tradition in

11992
02:58:05,990 --> 02:58:06,000
like rich in jewish tradition in
 

11993
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:08,230
like rich in jewish tradition in
particular and also an islamic tradition

11994
02:58:08,230 --> 02:58:08,240
particular and also an islamic tradition
 

11995
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:09,750
particular and also an islamic tradition
we can't comprehend and understand

11996
02:58:09,750 --> 02:58:09,760
we can't comprehend and understand
 

11997
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:11,910
we can't comprehend and understand
what's going on here right and so

11998
02:58:11,910 --> 02:58:11,920
what's going on here right and so
 

11999
02:58:11,920 --> 02:58:13,429
what's going on here right and so
the best we can do to approximate

12000
02:58:13,429 --> 02:58:13,439
the best we can do to approximate
 

12001
02:58:13,439 --> 02:58:14,710
the best we can do to approximate
understanding and live in alignment is

12002
02:58:14,710 --> 02:58:14,720
understanding and live in alignment is
 

12003
02:58:14,720 --> 02:58:16,950
understanding and live in alignment is
we like act as if this is true

12004
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:16,960
we like act as if this is true
 

12005
02:58:16,960 --> 02:58:19,030
we like act as if this is true
do these rituals have these actions or

12006
02:58:19,030 --> 02:58:19,040
do these rituals have these actions or
 

12007
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:21,030
do these rituals have these actions or
whatever post enlightenment a lot of

12008
02:58:21,030 --> 02:58:21,040
whatever post enlightenment a lot of
 

12009
02:58:21,040 --> 02:58:22,630
whatever post enlightenment a lot of
that got

12010
02:58:22,630 --> 02:58:22,640
that got
 

12011
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:25,110
that got
once we learned about enlightenment we

12012
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:25,120
once we learned about enlightenment we
 

12013
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:26,630
once we learned about enlightenment we
grew these suspicions around religion

12014
02:58:26,630 --> 02:58:26,640
grew these suspicions around religion
 

12015
02:58:26,640 --> 02:58:28,550
grew these suspicions around religion
that are very much of the modern era

12016
02:58:28,550 --> 02:58:28,560
that are very much of the modern era
 

12017
02:58:28,560 --> 02:58:29,830
that are very much of the modern era
right so like the

12018
02:58:29,830 --> 02:58:29,840
right so like the
 

12019
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:32,070
right so like the
the karen armstrong like uh sam harris's

12020
02:58:32,070 --> 02:58:32,080
the karen armstrong like uh sam harris's
 

12021
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:33,830
the karen armstrong like uh sam harris's
critique of religion makes no sense

12022
02:58:33,830 --> 02:58:33,840
critique of religion makes no sense
 

12023
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:35,670
critique of religion makes no sense
right the the critiques based on well

12024
02:58:35,670 --> 02:58:35,680
right the the critiques based on well
 

12025
02:58:35,680 --> 02:58:36,950
right the the critiques based on well
this is you're making the ascent to

12026
02:58:36,950 --> 02:58:36,960
this is you're making the ascent to
 

12027
02:58:36,960 --> 02:58:38,389
this is you're making the ascent to
propositions that you think are true for

12028
02:58:38,389 --> 02:58:38,399
propositions that you think are true for
 

12029
02:58:38,399 --> 02:58:39,510
propositions that you think are true for
which you do not have evidence that they

12030
02:58:39,510 --> 02:58:39,520
which you do not have evidence that they
 

12031
02:58:39,520 --> 02:58:39,910
which you do not have evidence that they
are true

12032
02:58:39,910 --> 02:58:39,920
are true
 

12033
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:41,429
are true
like that's an enlightenment thing right

12034
02:58:41,429 --> 02:58:41,439
like that's an enlightenment thing right
 

12035
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:43,590
like that's an enlightenment thing right
this is not the context and this is not

12036
02:58:43,590 --> 02:58:43,600
this is not the context and this is not
 

12037
02:58:43,600 --> 02:58:46,230
this is not the context and this is not
the religion is the rutherford model of

12038
02:58:46,230 --> 02:58:46,240
the religion is the rutherford model of
 

12039
02:58:46,240 --> 02:58:47,990
the religion is the rutherford model of
the atom like it's not actually maybe

12040
02:58:47,990 --> 02:58:48,000
the atom like it's not actually maybe
 

12041
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:48,550
the atom like it's not actually maybe
what

12042
02:58:48,550 --> 02:58:48,560
what
 

12043
02:58:48,560 --> 02:58:50,790
what
is underneath happening but this model

12044
02:58:50,790 --> 02:58:50,800
is underneath happening but this model
 

12045
02:58:50,800 --> 02:58:52,309
is underneath happening but this model
explains why your chemical equations

12046
02:58:52,309 --> 02:58:52,319
explains why your chemical equations
 

12047
02:58:52,319 --> 02:58:53,349
explains why your chemical equations
work and so this is like the way

12048
02:58:53,349 --> 02:58:53,359
work and so this is like the way
 

12049
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:54,950
work and so this is like the way
religion was you you

12050
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:54,960
religion was you you
 

12051
02:58:54,960 --> 02:58:56,550
religion was you you
there's a god we'll call it this this is

12052
02:58:56,550 --> 02:58:56,560
there's a god we'll call it this this is
 

12053
02:58:56,560 --> 02:58:58,150
there's a god we'll call it this this is
how it works we do this ritual we act in

12054
02:58:58,150 --> 02:58:58,160
how it works we do this ritual we act in
 

12055
02:58:58,160 --> 02:58:59,990
how it works we do this ritual we act in
this way it aligns with it just like the

12056
02:58:59,990 --> 02:59:00,000
this way it aligns with it just like the
 

12057
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:01,590
this way it aligns with it just like the
model the atom predicted why

12058
02:59:01,590 --> 02:59:01,600
model the atom predicted why
 

12059
02:59:01,600 --> 02:59:03,190
model the atom predicted why
you know n a and c l is going to become

12060
02:59:03,190 --> 02:59:03,200
you know n a and c l is going to become
 

12061
02:59:03,200 --> 02:59:04,550
you know n a and c l is going to become
salt this predicts that you're going to

12062
02:59:04,550 --> 02:59:04,560
salt this predicts that you're going to
 

12063
02:59:04,560 --> 02:59:05,990
salt this predicts that you're going to
feel and live in alignment right it's

12064
02:59:05,990 --> 02:59:06,000
feel and live in alignment right it's
 

12065
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:07,429
feel and live in alignment right it's
like this beautiful

12066
02:59:07,429 --> 02:59:07,439
like this beautiful
 

12067
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:08,630
like this beautiful
sophisticated theory which actually

12068
02:59:08,630 --> 02:59:08,640
sophisticated theory which actually
 

12069
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,950
sophisticated theory which actually
matches how a lot of great theologians

12070
02:59:10,950 --> 02:59:10,960
matches how a lot of great theologians
 

12071
02:59:10,960 --> 02:59:11,429
matches how a lot of great theologians
have

12072
02:59:11,429 --> 02:59:11,439
have
 

12073
02:59:11,439 --> 02:59:13,590
have
you know thought about it um but then

12074
02:59:13,590 --> 02:59:13,600
you know thought about it um but then
 

12075
02:59:13,600 --> 02:59:15,190
you know thought about it um but then
when you come forward in time yeah maybe

12076
02:59:15,190 --> 02:59:15,200
when you come forward in time yeah maybe
 

12077
02:59:15,200 --> 02:59:16,230
when you come forward in time yeah maybe
it's evolution i mean

12078
02:59:16,230 --> 02:59:16,240
it's evolution i mean
 

12079
02:59:16,240 --> 02:59:18,070
it's evolution i mean
this is like what peterson hints at

12080
02:59:18,070 --> 02:59:18,080
this is like what peterson hints at
 

12081
02:59:18,080 --> 02:59:20,630
this is like what peterson hints at
right like he's basically

12082
02:59:20,630 --> 02:59:20,640
right like he's basically
 

12083
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:23,670
right like he's basically
he's not he he doesn't like to get super

12084
02:59:23,670 --> 02:59:23,680
he's not he he doesn't like to get super
 

12085
02:59:23,680 --> 02:59:24,950
he's not he he doesn't like to get super
pinned down on this but

12086
02:59:24,950 --> 02:59:24,960
pinned down on this but
 

12087
02:59:24,960 --> 02:59:27,269
pinned down on this but
it's kind of seems where he's he's

12088
02:59:27,269 --> 02:59:27,279
it's kind of seems where he's he's
 

12089
02:59:27,279 --> 02:59:28,950
it's kind of seems where he's he's
almost like searching for the words

12090
02:59:28,950 --> 02:59:28,960
almost like searching for the words
 

12091
02:59:28,960 --> 02:59:30,469
almost like searching for the words
he focuses more on like jung and other

12092
02:59:30,469 --> 02:59:30,479
he focuses more on like jung and other
 

12093
02:59:30,479 --> 02:59:32,230
he focuses more on like jung and other
people but uh i mean i know he's very

12094
02:59:32,230 --> 02:59:32,240
people but uh i mean i know he's very
 

12095
02:59:32,240 --> 02:59:33,269
people but uh i mean i know he's very
union but but

12096
02:59:33,269 --> 02:59:33,279
union but but
 

12097
02:59:33,279 --> 02:59:34,950
union but but
that same type of analysis i think

12098
02:59:34,950 --> 02:59:34,960
that same type of analysis i think
 

12099
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:36,710
that same type of analysis i think
roughly speaking like armstrong is sort

12100
02:59:36,710 --> 02:59:36,720
roughly speaking like armstrong is sort
 

12101
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:37,510
roughly speaking like armstrong is sort
of a

12102
02:59:37,510 --> 02:59:37,520
of a
 

12103
02:59:37,520 --> 02:59:39,190
of a
it's kind of like a petersonian analysis

12104
02:59:39,190 --> 02:59:39,200
it's kind of like a petersonian analysis
 

12105
02:59:39,200 --> 02:59:41,190
it's kind of like a petersonian analysis
but she's looking more at the

12106
02:59:41,190 --> 02:59:41,200
but she's looking more at the
 

12107
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:43,750
but she's looking more at the
deep history of religion than uh but

12108
02:59:43,750 --> 02:59:43,760
deep history of religion than uh but
 

12109
02:59:43,760 --> 02:59:45,830
deep history of religion than uh but
yeah he throws in an evolutionary

12110
02:59:45,830 --> 02:59:45,840
yeah he throws in an evolutionary
 

12111
02:59:45,840 --> 02:59:48,389
yeah he throws in an evolutionary
yeah and i wonder what holmen finds i i

12112
02:59:48,389 --> 02:59:48,399
yeah and i wonder what holmen finds i i
 

12113
02:59:48,399 --> 02:59:49,670
yeah and i wonder what holmen finds i i
wonder what the new home is

12114
02:59:49,670 --> 02:59:49,680
wonder what the new home is
 

12115
02:59:49,680 --> 02:59:52,230
wonder what the new home is
if religion dissipates uh what the new

12116
02:59:52,230 --> 02:59:52,240
if religion dissipates uh what the new
 

12117
02:59:52,240 --> 02:59:53,990
if religion dissipates uh what the new
home for these kinds of

12118
02:59:53,990 --> 02:59:54,000
home for these kinds of
 

12119
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,110
home for these kinds of
natural inclinations are uh yeah well

12120
02:59:57,110 --> 02:59:57,120
natural inclinations are uh yeah well
 

12121
02:59:57,120 --> 02:59:58,550
natural inclinations are uh yeah well
there's technology whether

12122
02:59:58,550 --> 02:59:58,560
there's technology whether
 

12123
02:59:58,560 --> 02:59:59,830
there's technology whether
and if it's evolution i mean this is

12124
02:59:59,830 --> 02:59:59,840
and if it's evolution i mean this is
 

12125
02:59:59,840 --> 03:00:03,429
and if it's evolution i mean this is
francis collins book also he's like well

12126
03:00:03,429 --> 03:00:03,439
francis collins book also he's like well
 

12127
03:00:03,439 --> 03:00:05,269
francis collins book also he's like well
that's a religious that could be a very

12128
03:00:05,269 --> 03:00:05,279
that's a religious that could be a very
 

12129
03:00:05,279 --> 03:00:06,870
that's a religious that could be a very
religious notion i don't i think this

12130
03:00:06,870 --> 03:00:06,880
religious notion i don't i think this
 

12131
03:00:06,880 --> 03:00:07,830
religious notion i don't i think this
stuff is interesting i'm not a very

12132
03:00:07,830 --> 03:00:07,840
stuff is interesting i'm not a very
 

12133
03:00:07,840 --> 03:00:09,110
stuff is interesting i'm not a very
religious person but i'm

12134
03:00:09,110 --> 03:00:09,120
religious person but i'm
 

12135
03:00:09,120 --> 03:00:11,830
religious person but i'm
uh i'm thinking it's not a bad idea

12136
03:00:11,830 --> 03:00:11,840
uh i'm thinking it's not a bad idea
 

12137
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:13,510
uh i'm thinking it's not a bad idea
maybe maybe what replaces honestly like

12138
03:00:13,510 --> 03:00:13,520
maybe maybe what replaces honestly like
 

12139
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:15,429
maybe maybe what replaces honestly like
maybe what replaces religion is a return

12140
03:00:15,429 --> 03:00:15,439
maybe what replaces religion is a return
 

12141
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:16,389
maybe what replaces religion is a return
to

12142
03:00:16,389 --> 03:00:16,399
to
 

12143
03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:18,469
to
religion but in this sort of more

12144
03:00:18,469 --> 03:00:18,479
religion but in this sort of more
 

12145
03:00:18,479 --> 03:00:19,750
religion but in this sort of more
sophisticated

12146
03:00:19,750 --> 03:00:19,760
sophisticated
 

12147
03:00:19,760 --> 03:00:21,990
sophisticated
i mean if you went back yeah i mean it's

12148
03:00:21,990 --> 03:00:22,000
i mean if you went back yeah i mean it's
 

12149
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,750
i mean if you went back yeah i mean it's
the issue with like a lot of the the the

12150
03:00:23,750 --> 03:00:23,760
the issue with like a lot of the the the
 

12151
03:00:23,760 --> 03:00:24,790
the issue with like a lot of the the the
recent critiques

12152
03:00:24,790 --> 03:00:24,800
recent critiques
 

12153
03:00:24,800 --> 03:00:27,830
recent critiques
i think is it's a it's a straw man

12154
03:00:27,830 --> 03:00:27,840
i think is it's a it's a straw man
 

12155
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:29,510
i think is it's a it's a straw man
critique in a complicated way right

12156
03:00:29,510 --> 03:00:29,520
critique in a complicated way right
 

12157
03:00:29,520 --> 03:00:30,950
critique in a complicated way right
because the the whole way these

12158
03:00:30,950 --> 03:00:30,960
because the the whole way these
 

12159
03:00:30,960 --> 03:00:32,469
because the the whole way these
the way this works i mean the

12160
03:00:32,469 --> 03:00:32,479
the way this works i mean the
 

12161
03:00:32,479 --> 03:00:33,910
the way this works i mean the

heschl if you're reading these people
they're thinking very sophisticatedly

12168
03:00:38,469 --> 03:00:38,479
they're thinking very sophisticatedly
 

12169
03:00:38,479 --> 03:00:39,910
they're thinking very sophisticatedly
about religion in terms of this it's

12170
03:00:39,910 --> 03:00:39,920
about religion in terms of this it's
 

12171
03:00:39,920 --> 03:00:40,630
about religion in terms of this it's
ineffable

12172
03:00:40,630 --> 03:00:40,640
ineffable
 

12173
03:00:40,640 --> 03:00:42,550
ineffable
and we're just these things and this is

12174
03:00:42,550 --> 03:00:42,560
and we're just these things and this is
 

12175
03:00:42,560 --> 03:00:44,230
and we're just these things and this is
deep it connects us to these things in a

12176
03:00:44,230 --> 03:00:44,240
deep it connects us to these things in a
 

12177
03:00:44,240 --> 03:00:44,950
deep it connects us to these things in a
way that

12178
03:00:44,950 --> 03:00:44,960
way that
 

12179
03:00:44,960 --> 03:00:46,150
way that
puts life in the line man we can't

12180
03:00:46,150 --> 03:00:46,160
puts life in the line man we can't
 

12181
03:00:46,160 --> 03:00:47,349
puts life in the line man we can't
really explain what's going on because

12182
03:00:47,349 --> 03:00:47,359
really explain what's going on because
 

12183
03:00:47,359 --> 03:00:49,510
really explain what's going on because
we our brains can't handle it right

12184
03:00:49,510 --> 03:00:49,520
we our brains can't handle it right
 

12185
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:52,389
we our brains can't handle it right
um for the average person though this

12186
03:00:52,389 --> 03:00:52,399
um for the average person though this
 

12187
03:00:52,399 --> 03:00:54,150
um for the average person though this
notion of live as if is kind of how

12188
03:00:54,150 --> 03:00:54,160
notion of live as if is kind of how
 

12189
03:00:54,160 --> 03:00:55,269
notion of live as if is kind of how
religions work

12190
03:00:55,269 --> 03:00:55,279
religions work
 

12191
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:58,309
religions work
is live as if this is true it's like an

12192
03:00:58,309 --> 03:00:58,319
is live as if this is true it's like an
 

12193
03:00:58,319 --> 03:01:00,870
is live as if this is true it's like an
os for getting in alignment with because

12194
03:01:00,870 --> 03:01:00,880
os for getting in alignment with because
 

12195
03:01:00,880 --> 03:01:01,349
os for getting in alignment with because
through ev

12196
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:01,359
through ev
 

12197
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:03,269
through ev
cultural evolution like you behave in

12198
03:01:03,269 --> 03:01:03,279
cultural evolution like you behave in
 

12199
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:04,630
cultural evolution like you behave in
this way do these rituals live as if

12200
03:01:04,630 --> 03:01:04,640
this way do these rituals live as if
 

12201
03:01:04,640 --> 03:01:06,309
this way do these rituals live as if
this is true um

12202
03:01:06,309 --> 03:01:06,319
this is true um
 

12203
03:01:06,319 --> 03:01:08,950
this is true um
gives you the what the goal you're

12204
03:01:08,950 --> 03:01:08,960
gives you the what the goal you're
 

12205
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:09,910
gives you the what the goal you're
looking for

12206
03:01:09,910 --> 03:01:09,920
looking for
 

12207
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:11,590
looking for
but that's a complicated thing live as

12208
03:01:11,590 --> 03:01:11,600
but that's a complicated thing live as
 

12209
03:01:11,600 --> 03:01:13,269
but that's a complicated thing live as
if this is true because if you

12210
03:01:13,269 --> 03:01:13,279
if this is true because if you
 

12211
03:01:13,279 --> 03:01:15,030
if this is true because if you
especially if you're not a theologian to

12212
03:01:15,030 --> 03:01:15,040
especially if you're not a theologian to
 

12213
03:01:15,040 --> 03:01:16,309
especially if you're not a theologian to
say uh

12214
03:01:16,309 --> 03:01:16,319
say uh
 

12215
03:01:16,319 --> 03:01:17,830
say uh
yeah this is not true in an

12216
03:01:17,830 --> 03:01:17,840
yeah this is not true in an
 

12217
03:01:17,840 --> 03:01:19,349
yeah this is not true in an
enlightenment sense but i'm living as if

12218
03:01:19,349 --> 03:01:19,359
enlightenment sense but i'm living as if
 

12219
03:01:19,359 --> 03:01:20,230
enlightenment sense but i'm living as if
it kind of

12220
03:01:20,230 --> 03:01:20,240
it kind of
 

12221
03:01:20,240 --> 03:01:21,750
it kind of
takes the heat out of it but of course

12222
03:01:21,750 --> 03:01:21,760
takes the heat out of it but of course
 

12223
03:01:21,760 --> 03:01:23,269
takes the heat out of it but of course
it's what people are doing because

12224
03:01:23,269 --> 03:01:23,279
it's what people are doing because
 

12225
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:24,710
it's what people are doing because
you know highly religious people still

12226
03:01:24,710 --> 03:01:24,720
you know highly religious people still
 

12227
03:01:24,720 --> 03:01:27,110
you know highly religious people still
do bad things where if you really were

12228
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:27,120
do bad things where if you really were
 

12229
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:28,309
do bad things where if you really were
you know there's absolutely a hell and

12230
03:01:28,309 --> 03:01:28,319
you know there's absolutely a hell and
 

12231
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:29,429
you know there's absolutely a hell and
i'm definitely going to go to it if i do

12232
03:01:29,429 --> 03:01:29,439
i'm definitely going to go to it if i do
 

12233
03:01:29,439 --> 03:01:31,429
i'm definitely going to go to it if i do
this bad thing you would never have

12234
03:01:31,429 --> 03:01:31,439
this bad thing you would never have
 

12235
03:01:31,439 --> 03:01:32,950
this bad thing you would never have
you know no one would ever murder anyone

12236
03:01:32,950 --> 03:01:32,960
you know no one would ever murder anyone
 

12237
03:01:32,960 --> 03:01:34,469
you know no one would ever murder anyone
if they were an evangelical christian

12238
03:01:34,469 --> 03:01:34,479
if they were an evangelical christian
 

12239
03:01:34,479 --> 03:01:34,950
if they were an evangelical christian
right so

12240
03:01:34,950 --> 03:01:34,960
right so
 

12241
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:36,790
right so
so it's like what this is kind of a

12242
03:01:36,790 --> 03:01:36,800
so it's like what this is kind of a
 

12243
03:01:36,800 --> 03:01:38,230
so it's like what this is kind of a
tangent that i'm i'm

12244
03:01:38,230 --> 03:01:38,240
tangent that i'm i'm
 

12245
03:01:38,240 --> 03:01:40,550
tangent that i'm i'm
i'm on shaky ground here but it's

12246
03:01:40,550 --> 03:01:40,560
i'm on shaky ground here but it's
 

12247
03:01:40,560 --> 03:01:41,349
