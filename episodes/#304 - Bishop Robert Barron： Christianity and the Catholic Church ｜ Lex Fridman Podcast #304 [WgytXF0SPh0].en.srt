but it's really interesting so you say
 

113
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,389

he's not in the genus of being so we
 

119
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,350
he's not in the genus of being so we
talk about god being beyond being and so

so it's not it's not univocal meaning

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,470
down i'm not here or there god is that
whose center is everywhere and whose

486
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,480
whose center is everywhere and whose
 

487
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,310
whose center is everywhere and whose
circumference is nowhere as as the

488
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:50,320
circumference is nowhere as as the
 

489
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,110
circumference is nowhere as as the
mystics put it now can i get a clear and

490
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,120
mystics put it now can i get a clear and
 

491
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,350
mystics put it now can i get a clear and
distinct idea of that no and in a way

492
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
distinct idea of that no and in a way
 

493
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,829
distinct idea of that no and in a way
that's the whole point if i could i'd be

494
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:57,839
that's the whole point if i could i'd be
 

495
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,910
that's the whole point if i could i'd be
talking about a being of some kind

496
00:08:59,910 --> 00:08:59,920
talking about a being of some kind
 

497
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,389
talking about a being of some kind
so to be god is to be to be is to and

498
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
so to be god is to be to be is to and
 

499
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,230
so to be god is to be to be is to and

take off your shoes you're on holy
 

513
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,150
take off your shoes you're on holy
ground because you're not in charge here

ground because you're not in charge here
you're not in command because if you've

516
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,080
you're not in command because if you've
 

517
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,750
you're not in command because if you've
got shoes on

518
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
got shoes on

you can walk wherever you want you can

520
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
you can walk wherever you want you can
 

521
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,110
you can walk wherever you want you can
walk with confidence but you take your

00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:23,120
walk with confidence but you take your
 

523
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,230
walk with confidence but you take your
shoes off you're much more vulnerable

524
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:26,240
shoes off you're much more vulnerable
 

525
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,509
shoes off you're much more vulnerable
and that's appropriate when you're

526
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:27,519
and that's appropriate when you're
 

527
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,350
and that's appropriate when you're
talking about god you know

528
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:29,360
talking about god you know
 

529
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,630
talking about god you know
here's another interesting thing i

530
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:30,640
here's another interesting thing i
 

531
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,550
here's another interesting thing i
didn't think about the burning bush in

532
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
didn't think about the burning bush in
 

533
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,030
didn't think about the burning bush in
this connection before but

534
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,040
this connection before but
 

535
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,870
this connection before but
it's a bush that's on fire but not

536
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
it's a bush that's on fire but not
 

537
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,550
it's a bush that's on fire but not
consumed

538
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:38,560
consumed
 

539
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,030
consumed
is beings are competitive with each

540
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
is beings are competitive with each
 

541
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
is beings are competitive with each
other and so i these can't be in the

542
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
other and so i these can't be in the
 

543
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,150
other and so i these can't be in the
same place at the same time these two

544
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,160
same place at the same time these two
 

545
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,150
same place at the same time these two
beings they're mutually exclusive if you

546
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
beings they're mutually exclusive if you
 

547
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,550
beings they're mutually exclusive if you
want

548
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:48,560

 

549
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,630

but as god comes close to a creature

550
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:52,640
but as god comes close to a creature
 

551
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,670
but as god comes close to a creature
he doesn't destroy it or consume it

552
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
he doesn't destroy it or consume it
 

553
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,430
he doesn't destroy it or consume it
but the creature becomes more beautiful

554
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
but the creature becomes more beautiful
 

555
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,829
but the creature becomes more beautiful
and more radiant right but and see

556
00:09:59,829 --> 00:09:59,839
and more radiant right but and see
 

557
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,069
and more radiant right but and see
compare it to the to the classical gods

558
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:02,079
compare it to the to the classical gods
 

559
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,509
compare it to the to the classical gods
and goddesses when when they come

560
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:03,519
and goddesses when when they come
 

561
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,110
and goddesses when when they come
bursting into

562
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:05,120
bursting into
 

563
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,870
bursting into
life and experience things are

564
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:06,880
life and experience things are
 

565
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,110
life and experience things are
incinerated and people give way and

566
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
incinerated and people give way and
 

567
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,550
incinerated and people give way and
they're overwhelmed

568
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:10,560
they're overwhelmed
 

569
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,710
they're overwhelmed
then there's this biblical idea of god

570
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
then there's this biblical idea of god
 

571
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,030
then there's this biblical idea of god
comes close and sets things on fire but

572
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
comes close and sets things on fire but
 

573
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,870
comes close and sets things on fire but
doesn't burn them up

574
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:16,880
doesn't burn them up
 

575
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,150
doesn't burn them up
and that's because he's not a

576
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,160
and that's because he's not a
 

577
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,310
and that's because he's not a
competitive being in the world if he

578
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
competitive being in the world if he
 

579
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,949
competitive being in the world if he
were a big being then he'd be in this

580
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
were a big being then he'd be in this
 

581
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,389
were a big being then he'd be in this
he'd be competing

582
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:24,399
he'd be competing
 

583
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,910
he'd be competing
for space so to speak on the same

584
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
for space so to speak on the same
 

585
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,829
for space so to speak on the same
ontological grid

586
00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:27,839
ontological grid
 

587
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,990
ontological grid
but he's not like that

588
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,000
but he's not like that
 

589
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,630
but he's not like that
so god can come close

590
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
so god can come close
 

591
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,030
so god can come close
and we come more fully alive

592
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
and we come more fully alive
 

593
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,470
and we come more fully alive
now we're starting to gesture toward the

594
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
now we're starting to gesture toward the
 

595
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,150
now we're starting to gesture toward the
incarnation i mean the central christian

596
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
incarnation i mean the central christian
 

597
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,870
incarnation i mean the central christian
doctrine that god can actually become

598
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:40,880
doctrine that god can actually become
 

599
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,310
doctrine that god can actually become
a human

600
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:42,320
a human
 

601
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,150
a human
without overwhelming the human he

602
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,160
without overwhelming the human he
 

603
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,710
without overwhelming the human he
becomes right so i mean that's that's

604
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:46,720
becomes right so i mean that's that's
 

605
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,030
becomes right so i mean that's that's
kind of the next step but the basic idea

606
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,040
kind of the next step but the basic idea
 

607
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,670
kind of the next step but the basic idea
of god is non-competitively

608
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:51,680
of god is non-competitively
 

609
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,509
of god is non-competitively
transcendent to the world that's another

610
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:53,519
transcendent to the world that's another
 

611
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,069
transcendent to the world that's another
way to get at it

612
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
way to get at it
 

613
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:57,350
way to get at it
non-competitively transcendent to the

614
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:57,360
non-competitively transcendent to the
 

615
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,790
non-competitively transcendent to the
world so it's beyond being as the source

616
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:00,800
world so it's beyond being as the source
 

617
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,870
world so it's beyond being as the source
of being right

618
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
of being right
 

619
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,030
of being right
let me make it maybe more more um

620
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:05,040
let me make it maybe more more um
 

621
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,230
let me make it maybe more more um
imagistic i think a really good analogy

622
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
imagistic i think a really good analogy
 

623
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,069
imagistic i think a really good analogy
would be author to book

624
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
would be author to book
 

625
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,430
would be author to book
right so

626
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:11,440
right so
 

627
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,949
right so
uh like tolkien or someone that writes

628
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
uh like tolkien or someone that writes
 

629
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,670
uh like tolkien or someone that writes
one of these big sprawling

630
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:15,680
one of these big sprawling
 

631
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,110
one of these big sprawling
novels and tolkien is good too because

632
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,120
novels and tolkien is good too because
 

633
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,949
novels and tolkien is good too because
he creates a whole world he creates a

634
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959
he creates a whole world he creates a
 

635
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,030
he creates a whole world he creates a
new nature a new language new history

636
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
new nature a new language new history
 

637
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,470
new nature a new language new history
all that think of you know the thousands

638
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
all that think of you know the thousands
 

639
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,310
all that think of you know the thousands
of characters and the plots and subplots

640
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:24,320
of characters and the plots and subplots
 

641
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,230
of characters and the plots and subplots
and all of it

642
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:26,240
and all of it
 

643
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,670
and all of it
tolkien is utterly responsible for every

644
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
tolkien is utterly responsible for every
 

645
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,470
tolkien is utterly responsible for every

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,430
this
supremely weird claim

862
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,440
supremely weird claim
 

863
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,470
supremely weird claim
that god

864
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
that god
 

865
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,710
that god
becomes one of us god becomes a creature

866
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
becomes one of us god becomes a creature
 

867
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,470
becomes one of us god becomes a creature
but without ceasing to be god and

868
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:30,480
but without ceasing to be god and
 

869
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,910
but without ceasing to be god and
without overwhelming the integrity of

870

without overwhelming the integrity of
 

871
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,430
without overwhelming the integrity of
the creature he becomes

872
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,440
the creature he becomes

what we see in the burning bush that

874
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
what we see in the burning bush that
 

875
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,749
what we see in the burning bush that
principle which obtains across the board

876
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
principle which obtains across the board
 

877
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,829
principle which obtains across the board
so the closer god comes to me the more

878
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
so the closer god comes to me the more
 

879

so the closer god comes to me the more
radiant i become right

radiant i become right
 

881
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,389
radiant i become right
but take that now to the nth degree

882
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:44,399
but take that now to the nth degree
 

883
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,230
but take that now to the nth degree
would be what we mean by the incarnation

884
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
would be what we mean by the incarnation
 

885
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,949
would be what we mean by the incarnation
the incarnation of the son of god

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,269
the incarnation of the son of god
becoming a creature

888
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279

the incarnation you know um
and what follows from that is the

898
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
and what follows from that is the
 

899
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,430
and what follows from that is the
redemption of of all of reality so not

900
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:05,440
redemption of of all of reality so not
 

901
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,350
redemption of of all of reality so not
just of human beings but in becoming

902
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
just of human beings but in becoming
 

903
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,269

937
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,629
well i think it's it's massively
important because it's it's the

important because it's it's the
 

939
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,790
important because it's it's the
divinization principle that god wants to

00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
divinization principle that god wants to
 

941
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,949

the form of a slave being born in the
 

1597
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,230
the form of a slave being born in the
likeness of men but then

1598
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
likeness of men but then
 

1599
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,549
likeness of men but then
he was known to be of human estate

1600
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:26,559
he was known to be of human estate
 

1601
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,110
he was known to be of human estate
and he accepted even death

1602
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,120
and he accepted even death
 

1603
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,350
and he accepted even death
death on a cross and so paul imagines

1604
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,360
death on a cross and so paul imagines
 

1605
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,029
death on a cross and so paul imagines
that the incarnation is this downward

1606
00:28:33,029 --> 00:28:33,039
that the incarnation is this downward
 

1607
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,310
that the incarnation is this downward
journey

1608
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,320
journey
 

1609
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,950
journey
in order to get all of us right all of

1610
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:36,960
in order to get all of us right all of
 

1611
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,789
in order to get all of us right all of
us who were stuck

1612
00:28:38,789 --> 00:28:38,799
us who were stuck
 

1613
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,549
us who were stuck
were stuck in our sin

1614
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
were stuck in our sin
 

1615
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,510
were stuck in our sin
and so again paul says he became sin on

1616
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:43,520
and so again paul says he became sin on
 

1617
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,750
and so again paul says he became sin on
the cross it's a really really powerful

1618
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
the cross it's a really really powerful
 

1619
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,230
the cross it's a really really powerful
idea he wasn't a sinner because then

1620
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,240
idea he wasn't a sinner because then
 

1621
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,590
idea he wasn't a sinner because then
he'd need to be saved too he's not a

1622
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
he'd need to be saved too he's not a
 

1623
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,990
he'd need to be saved too he's not a
sinner but he entered into our

1624
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,000
sinner but he entered into our
 

1625
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,630
sinner but he entered into our
dysfunction in order to pull us back out

1626
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:54,640
dysfunction in order to pull us back out
 

1627
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,590
dysfunction in order to pull us back out
of it

1628
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
of it
 

1629
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,389
of it
so

1630
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
so
 

1631
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,710
so
that's a really powerful message

1632
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
that's a really powerful message
 

1633
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,470
that's a really powerful message
an embodiment

1634
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
an embodiment
 

1635
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,310
an embodiment
uh uh sort of educating the world about

1636
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
uh uh sort of educating the world about
 

1637
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,870
uh uh sort of educating the world about
sin

1638
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880

 

1639
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,110

that said day to day

1640
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,120
that said day to day
 

1641
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,430
that said day to day
there's like uh

1642
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
there's like uh
 

1643
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,750
there's like uh
oscillations in terms of how much

1644
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:13,760
oscillations in terms of how much
 

1645
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,830
oscillations in terms of how much
um each human sends and there's a

1646
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
um each human sends and there's a
 

1647
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,830
um each human sends and there's a
struggle against that

1648
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
struggle against that
 

1649
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,110
struggle against that
so

1650
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
so
 

1651
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,310
so
you know that dog that loses himself

1652
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
you know that dog that loses himself
 

1653
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,669
you know that dog that loses himself
on the beach

1654
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
on the beach
 

1655
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,430
on the beach
may have had a lot of sex with other

1656
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:25,440
may have had a lot of sex with other
 

1657
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,950
may have had a lot of sex with other
dogs leading up to that that was uh

1658
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:28,960
dogs leading up to that that was uh
 

1659
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,350
dogs leading up to that that was uh
maybe not the best dog he could be

1660
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
maybe not the best dog he could be
 

1661
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,669
maybe not the best dog he could be
leading up to that so how you know if

1662
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:33,679
leading up to that so how you know if
 

1663
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,590
leading up to that so how you know if
it's a math equation

1664
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:35,600
it's a math equation
 

1665
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,110
it's a math equation
what does the final

1666
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
what does the final
 

1667
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,590
what does the final
calculation look like in terms of ending

1668
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:39,600
calculation look like in terms of ending
 

1669
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,149
calculation look like in terms of ending
up in heaven what does it mean to live a

1670
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:42,159
up in heaven what does it mean to live a
 

1671
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,269
up in heaven what does it mean to live a
good

1672
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
good
 

1673
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,510
good
life in the end is it

1674
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
life in the end is it
 

1675
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,470
life in the end is it
um

1676
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:46,480
um
 

1677
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,870
um
the average modest thing you do is is

1678
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:48,880
the average modest thing you do is is
 

1679
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,190
the average modest thing you do is is
low can you are you allowed to make

1680
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
low can you are you allowed to make
 

1681
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,389
low can you are you allowed to make
mistakes

1682
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
mistakes
 

1683
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:55,430
mistakes
yeah uh you know the the the metric is

1684
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
yeah uh you know the the the metric is
 

1685
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,389
yeah uh you know the the the metric is
love

1686
00:29:56,389 --> 00:29:56,399
love
 

1687
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,549
love
right and love is not a feeling it's an

1688
00:29:58,549 --> 00:29:58,559
right and love is not a feeling it's an
 

1689
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,750
right and love is not a feeling it's an
act of the will

1690
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
act of the will
 

1691
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,510
act of the will
to will the good of the other that's

1692
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
to will the good of the other that's
 

1693
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,269
to will the good of the other that's
aquinas again to will the good of the

1694
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
aquinas again to will the good of the
 

1695
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,269
aquinas again to will the good of the
other as other and see that's the

1696
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
other as other and see that's the
 

1697
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,350
other as other and see that's the
anti-black hole principle

1698
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:07,360
anti-black hole principle
 

1699
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,909
anti-black hole principle
when i i don't wield the good of the

1700
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:09,919
when i i don't wield the good of the
 

1701
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,389
when i i don't wield the good of the
other as others because if i'm willing

1702
00:30:12,389 --> 00:30:12,399
other as others because if i'm willing
 

1703
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,350
other as others because if i'm willing
you're good because it's good for me so

1704
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
you're good because it's good for me so
 

1705
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,950
you're good because it's good for me so
uh again you know it's good for you that

1706
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:16,960
uh again you know it's good for you that
 

1707
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,549
uh again you know it's good for you that
i'm on this program i guess i'm willing

1708
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:18,559
i'm on this program i guess i'm willing
 

1709
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:19,669
i'm on this program i guess i'm willing
you're good but that's cause it's gonna

1710
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:19,679
you're good but that's cause it's gonna
 

1711
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,909
you're good but that's cause it's gonna
be down to my benefit right that's just

1712
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:21,919
be down to my benefit right that's just
 

1713
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,669
be down to my benefit right that's just
an indirect egotism

1714
00:30:23,669 --> 00:30:23,679
an indirect egotism
 

1715
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:25,669
an indirect egotism
that's why i see love is really rare and

1716
00:30:25,669 --> 00:30:25,679
that's why i see love is really rare and
 

1717
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:27,350
that's why i see love is really rare and
strange that i

1718
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:27,360
strange that i
 

1719
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,190
strange that i
really want

1720
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
really want
 

1721
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,230
really want
what's good for you as other

1722
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:32,240
what's good for you as other
 

1723
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,230
what's good for you as other
so not connected to the black hole

1724
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:34,240
so not connected to the black hole
 

1725
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,789
so not connected to the black hole
tendency of my own prideful ego when

1726
00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:36,799
tendency of my own prideful ego when
 

1727
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,389
tendency of my own prideful ego when
i've broken that

1728
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
i've broken that
 

1729
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,950
i've broken that
i've forgotten self and i've moved into

1730
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
i've forgotten self and i've moved into
 

1731
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,269
i've forgotten self and i've moved into
the space of your own good that's what

1732
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
the space of your own good that's what
 

1733
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,549
the space of your own good that's what
love is now god wants us to be you know

1734
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:46,559
love is now god wants us to be you know
 

1735
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,149
love is now god wants us to be you know
by this they will know that you're my

1736
00:30:48,149 --> 00:30:48,159
by this they will know that you're my
 

1737
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,750
by this they will know that you're my
disciples that you love one another

1738
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
disciples that you love one another
 

1739
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,990
disciples that you love one another
jesus says so that's it

1740
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
jesus says so that's it
 

1741
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,389
jesus says so that's it
now i mean life is

1742
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:54,399
now i mean life is
 

1743
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,310
now i mean life is
ups and downs and back and forth and

1744
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
ups and downs and back and forth and
 

1745
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,590
ups and downs and back and forth and
we're better or worse at that

1746
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,600
we're better or worse at that
 

1747
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,509
we're better or worse at that
the point of the church is to graft us

1748
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:01,519
the point of the church is to graft us
 

1749
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,350
the point of the church is to graft us
onto christ that we might become more

1750
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
onto christ that we might become more
 

1751
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,269
onto christ that we might become more
and more conformed to love but you know

1752
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
and more conformed to love but you know
 

1753
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,710
and more conformed to love but you know
the final calculus i'll leave that to

1754
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720

it's very peculiar because if he is love
 

2113
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,910
it's very peculiar because if he is love
there has to be in his unity

otherwise he isn't loved by his very
 

2121
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,910
otherwise he isn't loved by his very
essence he would love

2122
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:41,920
essence he would love
 

2123
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,750
essence he would love
it would be an attribute of god

2124
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
it would be an attribute of god
 

2125
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,750
it would be an attribute of god
or an action of god but if it's his very

2126
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
or an action of god but if it's his very
 

2127
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,390
or an action of god but if it's his very
nature there has to be lover beloved and

2128
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
nature there has to be lover beloved and

2527
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,910
aquinas says yeah but what maybe that's
a punishment because maybe all that is

2528
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:51,920
a punishment because maybe all that is
 

2529
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,670
a punishment because maybe all that is
leading him away from god and actually

2530
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:53,680
leading him away from god and actually
 

2531
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,349
leading him away from god and actually
that's god's way of punishing him and

2532
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
that's god's way of punishing him and
 

2533
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,030
that's god's way of punishing him and

so that's the only thing go through the
list of you know from sports and and boy

from that evil's permitted to bring
 

3437

about some greater good and we can
 

3439
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,630
about some greater good and we can
sometimes really see it

typically we don't see it but now you
bring another factor into this which is

3446
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:00,160
bring another factor into this which is
 

3447
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,670
bring another factor into this which is
the difference between our minds and

3448

the difference between our minds and
 

3449
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:04,470
the difference between our minds and
god's mind so our minds i mean look even

3450
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:04,480
god's mind so our minds i mean look even
 

3451
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,470
god's mind so our minds i mean look even
they're remarkably capacious but they

they're remarkably capacious but they
 

3453
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,630
they're remarkably capacious but they
take in a tiny tiny tiny swath of of

space and time and even like our eyes
 

3457
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:14,470
space and time and even like our eyes
can only take in so much of the light

ape sensorium that we have that could
 

3463
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,470
ape sensorium that we have that could
just take in a a little tiny bit of

just take in a a little tiny bit of

gesturing toward a more theological
 

3665
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:45,990
gesturing toward a more theological
response the first one is more austerely

response the first one is more austerely
philosophical god permits evil to bring

3668
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
philosophical god permits evil to bring
 

3669
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,990
philosophical god permits evil to bring
about a good but the theological

3670

about a good but the theological
 

3671
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,470
about a good but the theological
response is that's where christ went is

and see the cross
 

3679
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,910
and see the cross
as the limit case of of

3680
01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:01,920
as the limit case of of
 

3681
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,470
as the limit case of of
of evil um

3682
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
of evil um
 

3683
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,549
of evil um
humiliation and cruelty and

3684
01:05:06,549 --> 01:05:06,559
humiliation and cruelty and
 

3685
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,470

institutional injustice and
 

3687
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,549
institutional injustice and
psychological suffering and spiritual

3688
01:05:10,549 --> 01:05:10,559
psychological suffering and spiritual
 

3689
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:13,589
psychological suffering and spiritual
suffering and death it's all there

3690
01:05:13,589 --> 01:05:13,599
suffering and death it's all there
 

3691
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,829
suffering and death it's all there
and that's where the son of god went

3692
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
and that's where the son of god went
 

3693
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,630
and that's where the son of god went
and i would say that's why as a priest i

3694
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:18,640
and i would say that's why as a priest i
 

3695
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,470
and i would say that's why as a priest i
i went there that's my job is to go to

3696
01:05:20,470 --> 01:05:20,480
i went there that's my job is to go to
 

3697
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,470
i went there that's my job is to go to
those places you know so that's the

3698
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:22,480
those places you know so that's the
 

3699
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,670
those places you know so that's the
ultimate

3700
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
ultimate
 

3701
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,069
ultimate
answer to the problem

3702
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
answer to the problem
 

3703
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:27,750
answer to the problem
so there is

3704
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:27,760
so there is
 

3705
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:29,430
so there is
uh we can't

3706
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
uh we can't
 

3707
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,829
uh we can't
comprehend it but there is meaning to

3708
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
comprehend it but there is meaning to
 

3709
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,150
comprehend it but there is meaning to
the suffering and the injustice we

3710
01:05:34,150 --> 01:05:34,160
the suffering and the injustice we
 

3711
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:35,750
the suffering and the injustice we
trusted because

3712
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
trusted because
 

3713
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,510
trusted because
we know on other grounds of god's

3714
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:37,520
we know on other grounds of god's
 

3715
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:39,190
we know on other grounds of god's
existence yeah i i would resist the

3716
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
existence yeah i i would resist the
 

3717
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,349
existence yeah i i would resist the
claim that well this is such a such a

3718
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:41,359
claim that well this is such a such a
 

3719
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,029
claim that well this is such a such a
knock-down argument so now we know there

3720
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
knock-down argument so now we know there
 

3721
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,710
knock-down argument so now we know there
is no god i would say no

3722
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:44,720
is no god i would say no
 

3723
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,910
is no god i would say no
there's all kinds of other rational

3724
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:45,920
there's all kinds of other rational
 

3725
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,150
there's all kinds of other rational
warrants for god and so i

3726
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:48,160
warrants for god and so i
 

3727
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,230
warrants for god and so i
i know that god exists i know that god

3728
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:50,240
i know that god exists i know that god
 

3729
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,309
i know that god exists i know that god
is infinite love and now i got to square

3730
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:52,319
is infinite love and now i got to square
 

3731
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,710
is infinite love and now i got to square
that with this experience and the way i

3732
01:05:54,710 --> 01:05:54,720
that with this experience and the way i
 

3733
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:57,990
that with this experience and the way i
do that is by a trusting confidence

3734
01:05:57,990 --> 01:05:58,000
do that is by a trusting confidence
 

3735
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,470
do that is by a trusting confidence
that god knows what he's about

3736
01:06:00,470 --> 01:06:00,480
that god knows what he's about
 

3737
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:02,710
that god knows what he's about
you know again i know how how inadequate

3738
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:02,720
you know again i know how how inadequate
 

3739
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:03,990
you know again i know how how inadequate
that always seems to anyone who's

3740
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:04,000
that always seems to anyone who's
 

3741
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,230
that always seems to anyone who's
suffering including myself when i'm in

3742
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:06,240
suffering including myself when i'm in
 

3743
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,510
suffering including myself when i'm in
great suffering

3744
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:07,520
great suffering
 

3745
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,349
great suffering
but i think that's the best that we've

3746
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:09,359
but i think that's the best that we've
 

3747
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,510
but i think that's the best that we've
done in the great tradition so if you

3748
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
done in the great tradition so if you
 

3749
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,150
done in the great tradition so if you
were to steal man that

3750
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:14,160
were to steal man that
 

3751
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,109
were to steal man that
case

3752
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:15,119
case
 

3753
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,549
case
against god or the existence of god

3754
01:06:18,549 --> 01:06:18,559
against god or the existence of god
 

3755
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,430
against god or the existence of god
you find the most convincing argument is

3756
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:21,440
you find the most convincing argument is
 

3757
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,670
you find the most convincing argument is
there's evil in the world yeah therefore

3758
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:23,680
there's evil in the world yeah therefore
 

3759
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,270
there's evil in the world yeah therefore
there's no god there's too much of it

3760
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:25,280
there's no god there's too much of it
 

3761
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,549
there's no god there's too much of it
yeah if i were to steal man that

3762
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:26,559
yeah if i were to steal man that
 

3763
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:28,230
yeah if i were to steal man that
argument i do what stephen fry does i

3764
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:28,240
argument i do what stephen fry does i
 

3765
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,309
argument i do what stephen fry does i
would do what dostoevsky's yvonne does i

3766
01:06:30,309 --> 01:06:30,319
would do what dostoevsky's yvonne does i
 

3767
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:31,670
would do what dostoevsky's yvonne does i
i would do exactly that i would say

3768
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:31,680
i would do exactly that i would say
 

3769
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:34,710
i would do exactly that i would say
there's just too much and then if you

3770
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:34,720
there's just too much and then if you
 

3771
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,470
there's just too much and then if you
want to keep pressing it um animal

3772
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:36,480
want to keep pressing it um animal
 

3773
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,910
want to keep pressing it um animal
suffering so we talk about human

3774
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:37,920
suffering so we talk about human
 

3775
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:40,470
suffering so we talk about human
suffering but the suffering of animals

3776
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:40,480
suffering but the suffering of animals
 

3777
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,230
suffering but the suffering of animals
over the eons and so on um isn't there

3778
01:06:44,230 --> 01:06:44,240
over the eons and so on um isn't there
 

3779
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:46,390
over the eons and so on um isn't there
just too much suffering

3781
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,549
just too much suffering
to be reconciled with an infinitely good

3782
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
to be reconciled with an infinitely good
 

3783

well
that's the one it's probably evil the

3806
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:18,240
that's the one it's probably evil the
 

3807
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:20,069
that's the one it's probably evil the
other objection in aquinas which has a

3808
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
other objection in aquinas which has a
 

3809
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,589
other objection in aquinas which has a
lot of contemporary uh resonance is

3810
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
lot of contemporary uh resonance is
 

3811
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,109
lot of contemporary uh resonance is
can we just explain everything through

3812
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
can we just explain everything through
 

3813
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,029
can we just explain everything through
natural causes why would you have to

3814
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
natural causes why would you have to
 

3815
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,430
natural causes why would you have to
invoke a cause beyond the causes in the

3816
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:29,440
invoke a cause beyond the causes in the
 

3817
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,470
invoke a cause beyond the causes in the
world so as i'm trying to explain

3818
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
world so as i'm trying to explain
 

3819
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,029
world so as i'm trying to explain
let's say for aquinas motion causality

3820
01:07:35,029 --> 01:07:35,039
let's say for aquinas motion causality
 

3821
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,950
let's say for aquinas motion causality
you know finality

3822
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
you know finality
 

3823
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,029
you know finality
can i just do that with natural causes

3824
01:07:39,029 --> 01:07:39,039
can i just do that with natural causes
 

3825
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,349
can i just do that with natural causes
wouldn't that suffice to explain it

3826
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:41,359
wouldn't that suffice to explain it
 

3827
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:44,150
wouldn't that suffice to explain it
so i i get like when naturalists

3828
01:07:44,150 --> 01:07:44,160
so i i get like when naturalists
 

3829
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,589
so i i get like when naturalists
are speaking or people that are pure

are speaking or people that are pure
 

3831
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,750
are speaking or people that are pure
materialists they'll just say no that's

3832
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:47,760
materialists they'll just say no that's
 

3833
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,230
materialists they'll just say no that's
perfectly adequate a scientific account

3834
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:50,240
perfectly adequate a scientific account
 

3835
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,190
perfectly adequate a scientific account
of reality is utterly adequate to

um so i would steal man that and say

01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
um so i would steal man that and say
 

3841
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,510
um so i would steal man that and say
well show me why we need something more

well show me why we need something more
 

3843
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,670
well show me why we need something more
and to do that you got to get out of

and to do that you got to get out of
 

3845

plato's cave it seems to me because that

that's the first step out of the cave
and then that leads to the more

for example on the nature being i mean

for example on the nature being i mean
 

3901
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,709
for example on the nature being i mean
so i could i could talk about this thing

so i could i could talk about this thing
 

3903
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,390
so i could i could talk about this thing
as a physical object and i can analyze

as a physical object and i can analyze

01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,550
as a physical object and i can analyze
it at all kinds of levels and follow all

through this thing and
 

3911
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:17,749
through this thing and
fine fine but i'm still in plato's cave

01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,950
but when i step out of that
into the mathematical realm i have

into the mathematical realm i have
 

3921

into the mathematical realm i have
entered a different realm of being seems

to me do you think it's possible for the

to me do you think it's possible for the
 

3925
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,189
to me do you think it's possible for the
cave to expand so large that it

01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
cave to expand so large that it

is it possible to is it possible that
we're just clueless right now in terms

of
 

3935
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,950
of
uh scientifically speaking with most of

3936
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:42,960
uh scientifically speaking with most of
 

3937
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,189
uh scientifically speaking with most of
the world we haven't figured out yet but

3938
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
the world we haven't figured out yet but
 

3939
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:46,550
the world we haven't figured out yet but
do you think it's possible through

3940
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:46,560
do you think it's possible through
 

3941
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:49,910
do you think it's possible through
science to know god just to look outside

3942
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:49,920
science to know god just to look outside
 

3943
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,590
science to know god just to look outside
the world so it's fundamentally the

3944
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
the world so it's fundamentally the
 

3945
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:54,390
the world so it's fundamentally the
limit of the empirical scientific method

limit of the empirical scientific method
 

3947
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,790
limit of the empirical scientific method
is that we can't know some of these

3948
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:56,800
is that we can't know some of these
 

3949
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:58,790
is that we can't know some of these
very big questions no i i can i love

formation experimentation etc as great

3976
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
formation experimentation etc as great
 

3977
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,870

as that is as wonderful as that is but

01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
as that is as wonderful as that is but
 

3979
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,270

it's still i think within plato's cave

3980
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:29,280
it's still i think within plato's cave
 

3981
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:30,950
it's still i think within plato's cave
and that's not to say it's not real it's

3982
01:10:30,950 --> 01:10:30,960
and that's not to say it's not real it's
 

3983
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,390
and that's not to say it's not real it's
just at a relatively low level of

01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400
just at a relatively low level of
 

3985
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,149
just at a relatively low level of
reality um

3986
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:34,159
reality um
 

3987
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:35,669
reality um
you step out of plato's cave when you go

3988
01:10:35,669 --> 01:10:35,679
you step out of plato's cave when you go
 

3989
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,669
you step out of plato's cave when you go
into the pure mathematics

3990
01:10:37,669 --> 01:10:37,679
into the pure mathematics
 

3991
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:38,870
into the pure mathematics
that's right you know that article i

3992
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:38,880
that's right you know that article i
 

3993
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,310
that's right you know that article i
just came across it recently and

3994
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:40,320
just came across it recently and
 

3995
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,990
just came across it recently and
discovered this whole literature around

3996
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,000
discovered this whole literature around
 

3997
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,630
discovered this whole literature around
it is eugene vigner's article in 1960

3998
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
it is eugene vigner's article in 1960
 

3999
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,189
it is eugene vigner's article in 1960
called the

4000
01:10:46,189 --> 01:10:46,199
called the
 

4001
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:47,910
called the
unreasonable

4002
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:47,920
unreasonable
 

4003
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,590
unreasonable
applicability of mathematics to the

4004
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
applicability of mathematics to the
 

4005
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:50,790
applicability of mathematics to the
physical sciences i think that's the

4006
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
physical sciences i think that's the
 

4007
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,390
physical sciences i think that's the
title of it or effectiveness or

4008
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:52,400
title of it or effectiveness or
 

4009
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,310
title of it or effectiveness or
something like that yeah but what's so

4010
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
something like that yeah but what's so
 

4011
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:55,669
something like that yeah but what's so
cool is you know he's not a religious

4012
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
cool is you know he's not a religious
 

4013
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,750
cool is you know he's not a religious
man he was a kind of a secular jew

4014
01:10:57,750 --> 01:10:57,760
man he was a kind of a secular jew
 

4015
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,830
man he was a kind of a secular jew
but yet he uses the word miracle like

4016
01:10:59,830 --> 01:10:59,840
but yet he uses the word miracle like
 

4017
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:01,590
but yet he uses the word miracle like
eight times in that article and because

4018
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
eight times in that article and because
 

4019
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,310
eight times in that article and because
he just is so impressed by the fact that

4020
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:04,320
he just is so impressed by the fact that
 

4021
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:07,910
he just is so impressed by the fact that
high complex mathematics describes

4022
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
high complex mathematics describes
 

4023
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:09,669
high complex mathematics describes
so accurately the physical world and can

4024
01:11:09,669 --> 01:11:09,679
so accurately the physical world and can
 

4025
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:11,830
so accurately the physical world and can
be used to to create things and to

4026
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:11,840
be used to to create things and to
 

4027
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:13,030
be used to to create things and to
manipulate

4028
01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:13,040
manipulate
 

4029
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,189
manipulate
and why should that be true

4030
01:11:15,189 --> 01:11:15,199
and why should that be true
 

4031
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,669
and why should that be true
that there's something very weirdly

4032
01:11:17,669 --> 01:11:17,679
that there's something very weirdly
 

4033
01:11:17,679 --> 01:11:19,430
that there's something very weirdly
mysterious about that relationship you

4034
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
mysterious about that relationship you
 

4035
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,110
mysterious about that relationship you
know and i would say it's because you

4036
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:21,120
know and i would say it's because you
 

4037
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,669
know and i would say it's because you
you stepped into a higher order of being

4038
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:23,679
you stepped into a higher order of being
 

4039
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,350
you stepped into a higher order of being
which is inclusive of a lower level of

4040
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
which is inclusive of a lower level of
 

4041
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,910
which is inclusive of a lower level of
being that's the platonic approach is

4042
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:27,920
being that's the platonic approach is
 

4043
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,510
being that's the platonic approach is
that as you move now i'm going to

4044
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:29,520
that as you move now i'm going to
 

4045
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,870
that as you move now i'm going to
different metaphor you move to higher

4046
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
different metaphor you move to higher
 

4047
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,390
different metaphor you move to higher
levels they're inclusive of the lower

4048
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
levels they're inclusive of the lower
 

4049
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,430
levels they're inclusive of the lower
levels yeah there's some magic there

4050
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,440
levels yeah there's some magic there
 

4051
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,510
levels yeah there's some magic there
that seems to at least in our current

4052
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:37,520
that seems to at least in our current
 

4053
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:38,830
that seems to at least in our current
understanding of

4054
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:38,840
understanding of
 

4055
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,030
understanding of
science uh to be

4056
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:41,040
science uh to be
 

4057
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,270

01:11:45,030 --> 01:11:45,040
the idea of consciousness
 

4061
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,709
the idea of consciousness
can i ask you where do you think the

4062
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
can i ask you where do you think the
 

4063
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:48,630
can i ask you where do you think the
laws of nature come from so i mean sort

4064
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
laws of nature come from so i mean sort
 

4065
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,950
laws of nature come from so i mean sort

i'm just curious where do you think it

4084
01:12:09,669 --> 01:12:09,679
i'm just curious where do you think it
 

4085
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:10,950
i'm just curious where do you think it
comes from

01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:10,960
comes from
 

4087
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,709

01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:53,350
deeper that we're just discovering
all i know from my emotional perspective

4126
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
all i know from my emotional perspective
 

4127
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:56,070
all i know from my emotional perspective
now i am an engineer i'm a robotics ai

4128
01:12:56,070 --> 01:12:56,080
now i am an engineer i'm a robotics ai
 

4129
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,149
now i am an engineer i'm a robotics ai
person from an emotional perspective i

4130
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
person from an emotional perspective i
 

4131
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,470
person from an emotional perspective i
just find the whole thing beautiful yeah

4132
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480
just find the whole thing beautiful yeah
 

4133
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:01,910
just find the whole thing beautiful yeah
but that's really cool to me that's a

4134
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:01,920
but that's really cool to me that's a
 

4135
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,669
but that's really cool to me that's a
very interesting clue

4136
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
very interesting clue
 

4137
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,430
very interesting clue
see one of the arguments for god is

4138
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:05,440
see one of the arguments for god is
 

4139
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,790
see one of the arguments for god is
based on the intelligibility of the

4140
01:13:06,790 --> 01:13:06,800
based on the intelligibility of the
 

4141
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,110
based on the intelligibility of the
world this very it's like vigner it's

4142
01:13:09,110 --> 01:13:09,120
world this very it's like vigner it's
 

4143
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:10,950
world this very it's like vigner it's
very peculiar fact it seems to me that

4144
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:10,960
very peculiar fact it seems to me that
 

4145
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,110
very peculiar fact it seems to me that
the world is so radically intelligible

4146
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:13,120
the world is so radically intelligible
 

4147
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:14,870
the world is so radically intelligible
why should that be true why should it be

4148
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
why should that be true why should it be
 

4149
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,950
why should that be true why should it be
the case that being has this

4150
01:13:16,950 --> 01:13:16,960
the case that being has this
 

4151
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,950
the case that being has this
intelligible structure to it so it

4152
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
intelligible structure to it so it
 

4153
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,510
intelligible structure to it so it
corresponds to an acquiring mind

4154
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
corresponds to an acquiring mind
 

4155
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,510
corresponds to an acquiring mind
so aquinas can say that the

4156
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:23,520
so aquinas can say that the
 

4157
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:26,310
so aquinas can say that the
the intelligible enact is the intellect

4158
01:13:26,310 --> 01:13:26,320
the intelligible enact is the intellect
 

4159
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,910
the intelligible enact is the intellect
and act meaning there's some there's

4160
01:13:27,910 --> 01:13:27,920
and act meaning there's some there's
 

4161
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:30,790
and act meaning there's some there's
some deep correspondence between

4162
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:30,800
some deep correspondence between
 

4163
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:32,630
some deep correspondence between
this and that

4164
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:32,640
this and that
 

4165
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,350
this and that
and it's i'm with vigner that's i think

4166
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
and it's i'm with vigner that's i think
 

4167
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,590
and it's i'm with vigner that's i think
really weird and unreasonable and

4168
01:13:37,590 --> 01:13:37,600
really weird and unreasonable and
 

4169
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:38,870
really weird and unreasonable and
strange

4170
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:38,880
strange
 

4171
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,470
strange
now my answer is because the

4172
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
now my answer is because the
 

4173
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,149
now my answer is because the
the creator of the universe

4174
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:44,159
the creator of the universe
 

4175
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:47,990
the creator of the universe
is a great mind and uh has stamped the

is a great mind and uh has stamped the
 

4177
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,229
is a great mind and uh has stamped the
world with intelligibility

world with intelligibility
 

4179
01:13:50,239 --> 01:13:52,149
world with intelligibility
uh in the beginning was the word right

4180
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159
uh in the beginning was the word right
 

4181
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:53,669
uh in the beginning was the word right
and the word was with god and all things

4182
01:13:53,669 --> 01:13:53,679
and the word was with god and all things
 

4183
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,990
and the word was with god and all things
came to be through the word

4184
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
came to be through the word
 

4185
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,590
came to be through the word
don't we shouldn't picture that so much

4186
01:13:57,590 --> 01:13:57,600
don't we shouldn't picture that so much
 

4187
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:59,669
don't we shouldn't picture that so much
it's a it's gesturing in this very

4188
01:13:59,669 --> 01:13:59,679
it's a it's gesturing in this very
 

4189
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:01,669
it's a it's gesturing in this very
powerful direction

4190
01:14:01,669 --> 01:14:01,679
powerful direction
 

4191
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:04,149
powerful direction
there's an intelligence that has imbued

4192
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
there's an intelligence that has imbued
 

4193
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,350
there's an intelligence that has imbued
the world with intelligibility

4194

the world with intelligibility
 

4195
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,830
the world with intelligibility
and and we discover that you know

4196
01:14:09,830 --> 01:14:09,840
and and we discover that you know
 

4197
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,270
and and we discover that you know
there's something about the simplicity

4198
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
there's something about the simplicity
 

4199
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,110
there's something about the simplicity
of the way the world works that that's

4200
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
of the way the world works that that's
 

4201
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:15,430
of the way the world works that that's
where the beauty comes from

4202
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:15,440
where the beauty comes from
 

4203
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:16,470
where the beauty comes from
and yes

4204
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:16,480
and yes
 

4205
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:17,750
and yes
there's something profound to the

4206
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:17,760
there's something profound to the
 

4207
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,229
there's something profound to the
mechanism whatever that is

4208
01:14:20,229 --> 01:14:20,239
mechanism whatever that is
 

4209
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,350
mechanism whatever that is
um god that brought that to be the

4210
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
um god that brought that to be the
 

4211
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,510
um god that brought that to be the
thought it into being that the world has

4212
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
thought it into being that the world has
 

4213
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,270
thought it into being that the world has
been said when the bible says that god

4214
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
been said when the bible says that god
 

4215
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,350
been said when the bible says that god
god said let there be light and there

4216
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:29,360
god said let there be light and there
 

4217
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,270
god said let there be light and there
was like god said again we don't

4218
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:31,280
was like god said again we don't
 

4219
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:33,430
was like god said again we don't
literalize the poetry but it's

4220
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
literalize the poetry but it's
 

4221
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:35,750
literalize the poetry but it's
it's very rich that god spoke the world

4222
01:14:35,750 --> 01:14:35,760
it's very rich that god spoke the world
 

4223
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,870
it's very rich that god spoke the world
into being

4224
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
into being
 

4225
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,950
into being
so that means it's it's been it's been

4226
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:38,960
so that means it's it's been it's been
 

4227
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,709
so that means it's it's been it's been
imbued with intelligibility from the

4228
01:14:40,709 --> 01:14:40,719
imbued with intelligibility from the
 

4229
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,550
imbued with intelligibility from the
beginning

4230
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:42,560
beginning
 

4231
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:43,669
beginning
they say that you know the condition for

4232
01:14:43,669 --> 01:14:43,679
they say that you know the condition for
 

4233
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:45,830
they say that you know the condition for
the possibility of the of the western

4234
01:14:45,830 --> 01:14:45,840
the possibility of the of the western
 

4235
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,750
the possibility of the of the western
physical sciences was a basically

4236
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:47,760
physical sciences was a basically
 

4237
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,910
physical sciences was a basically
christian idea namely that the world is

4238
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:49,920
christian idea namely that the world is
 

4239
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:51,270
christian idea namely that the world is
not god

4240
01:14:51,270 --> 01:14:51,280
not god
 

4241
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,709
not god
therefore i can i can analyze it

4242
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
therefore i can i can analyze it
 

4243
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,390
therefore i can i can analyze it
experiment upon it i can i don't

4244
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
experiment upon it i can i don't
 

4245
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,390
experiment upon it i can i don't
divinize it i don't have a mystical

4246
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:56,400
divinize it i don't have a mystical
 

4247
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,790
divinize it i don't have a mystical
relationship to the world it's not god

4248
01:14:58,790 --> 01:14:58,800
relationship to the world it's not god
 

4249
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,030
relationship to the world it's not god
but secondly that it's it's absolutely

4250
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:01,040
but secondly that it's it's absolutely
 

4251
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:03,189
but secondly that it's it's absolutely
in every nook and cranny intelligible

4252
01:15:03,189 --> 01:15:03,199
in every nook and cranny intelligible
 

4253
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:05,350
in every nook and cranny intelligible
and those two ideas are correlated to

4254
01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
and those two ideas are correlated to
 

4255
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:07,270
and those two ideas are correlated to
the idea of creation so it's been

4256
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:07,280
the idea of creation so it's been
 

4257
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:09,590
the idea of creation so it's been
created it's not god's other than god

4258
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
created it's not god's other than god
 

4259
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,910
created it's not god's other than god
but yet it's touched in every dimension

4260
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:11,920
but yet it's touched in every dimension
 

4261
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:14,390
but yet it's touched in every dimension
by god's mind and when those two things

4262
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:14,400
by god's mind and when those two things
 

4263
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,030
by god's mind and when those two things
are in place the sciences get underway

4264
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:17,040
are in place the sciences get underway
 

4265
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:18,390
are in place the sciences get underway
you know i don't worship the world

4266
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:18,400
you know i don't worship the world
 

4267
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,430
you know i don't worship the world
anymore

4268
01:15:19,430 --> 01:15:19,440
anymore
 

4269
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,030
anymore
but i'm also utterly confident i can

4270
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:21,040
but i'm also utterly confident i can
 

4271
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,229
but i'm also utterly confident i can
come to know it

4272
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:22,239
come to know it
 

4273
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,470
come to know it
and those are theological ideas

4274
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:24,480
and those are theological ideas
 

4275
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,110
and those are theological ideas
well we live in this world

4276
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:27,120
well we live in this world
 

4277
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,590
well we live in this world
so we can solve quite a lot of problems

4278
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:29,600
so we can solve quite a lot of problems
 

4279
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,910
so we can solve quite a lot of problems
of this world by making the assumption

4280
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
of this world by making the assumption
 

4281
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,550
of this world by making the assumption
that this world is fully understandable

4282
01:15:34,550 --> 01:15:34,560
that this world is fully understandable
 

4283
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:35,990
that this world is fully understandable
and we don't need to worry about what's

4284
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:36,000
and we don't need to worry about what's
 

4285
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,149
and we don't need to worry about what's
outside the world in some sense in order

01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:38,159
outside the world in some sense in order
 

4287
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,910
outside the world in some sense in order
to build bridges and

4288
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:39,920
to build bridges and
 

4289
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,350
to build bridges and
rockets

01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
and computers and all that kind of stuff
 

4293
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,669
and computers and all that kind of stuff
it's only when we get to the questions

4294
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
it's only when we get to the questions
 

4295
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,030
it's only when we get to the questions
that are deeper

4296
01:15:47,030 --> 01:15:47,040
that are deeper
 

4297
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:49,669
that are deeper
about why we're here at all what does it

4298
01:15:49,669 --> 01:15:49,679
about why we're here at all what does it
 

4299
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:51,590
about why we're here at all what does it
mean to be good all those kinds of

stepping out of a cave it's stepping out
 

4311
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,270
stepping out of a cave it's stepping out
of just the purely empirical you know

um
 

4331
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,110
um
why would we call it that why would why

4332
01:16:19,110 --> 01:16:19,120
why would we call it that why would why
 

4333
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,470
why would we call it that why would why
wouldn't we just call it an aggregate

4334
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:20,480
wouldn't we just call it an aggregate
 

4335
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:22,149
wouldn't we just call it an aggregate
it's just an aggregate of stuff it's an

4336
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:22,159
it's just an aggregate of stuff it's an
 

4337
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:23,750
it's just an aggregate of stuff it's an
aggregate of all but we call it a

4338
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:23,760
aggregate of all but we call it a
 

4339
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:26,470
aggregate of all but we call it a
universe and my answer from the

4340
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:26,480
universe and my answer from the
 

4341
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,709
universe and my answer from the
classical metaphysical tradition is it's

4342
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:28,719
classical metaphysical tradition is it's
 

4343
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:31,030
classical metaphysical tradition is it's
the intuition of being so

4344
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
the intuition of being so
 

4345
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,709
the intuition of being so
i immediately experience things here the

4346
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
i immediately experience things here the
 

4347
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,870
i immediately experience things here the
color and shape and i can measure them

4348
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
color and shape and i can measure them
 

4349
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,149
color and shape and i can measure them
but when i've really stepped out of the

4350
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:36,159
but when i've really stepped out of the
 

4351
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:37,110
but when i've really stepped out of the
cave

4352
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:37,120
cave
 

4353
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,110
cave
and i've now engaged beyond mathematics

4354
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
and i've now engaged beyond mathematics
 

4355
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,550
and i've now engaged beyond mathematics
even i'm now into metaphysical

4356
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:40,560
even i'm now into metaphysical
 

4357
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:43,350
even i'm now into metaphysical
reflection i'm interested not just in

4358
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:43,360
reflection i'm interested not just in
 

4359
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:45,270
reflection i'm interested not just in
this thing as an object and how it's

4360
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:45,280
this thing as an object and how it's
 

4361
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,350
this thing as an object and how it's
colored and shaped and what it's atoms

4362
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:47,360
colored and shaped and what it's atoms
 

4363
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,350
colored and shaped and what it's atoms
and quarks and all that are that's fine

4364
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:49,360
and quarks and all that are that's fine
 

4365
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,270
and quarks and all that are that's fine
but i'm interested now and

4366
01:16:51,270 --> 01:16:51,280
but i'm interested now and
 

4367
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,470
but i'm interested now and
what does it mean to say this thing is

4368
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
what does it mean to say this thing is
 

4369
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:53,430
what does it mean to say this thing is
real

4370
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:53,440
real
 

4371
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:55,990
real
so what makes this a being

4372
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:56,000
so what makes this a being
 

4373
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,830
so what makes this a being
and then what are the characteristics of

4374
01:16:57,830 --> 01:16:57,840
and then what are the characteristics of
 

4375
01:16:57,840 --> 01:16:59,750
and then what are the characteristics of
being so not from aristotle to heidegger

4376
01:16:59,750 --> 01:16:59,760
being so not from aristotle to heidegger
 

4377
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,590
being so not from aristotle to heidegger
you know this question of the nature of

4378
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:01,600
you know this question of the nature of
 

4379
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:02,390
you know this question of the nature of
being

4380
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
being
 

4381
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,149
being
but see i would say we call it a

4382
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
but see i would say we call it a
 

4383
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:06,149
but see i would say we call it a
universe because it's turned toward the

4384
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,159
universe because it's turned toward the
 

4385
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:09,030
universe because it's turned toward the
one of being it's this intuition that

4386
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
one of being it's this intuition that
 

4387
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,110
one of being it's this intuition that
whatever from quarks to galaxies to

4388
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:11,120
whatever from quarks to galaxies to
 

4389
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,470
whatever from quarks to galaxies to
whatever

4390
01:17:12,470 --> 01:17:12,480
whatever
 

4391
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:15,189
whatever
give me a billion other universes they

4392
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
give me a billion other universes they
 

4393
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:17,590
give me a billion other universes they
it would still be existence right it's

4394
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
it would still be existence right it's
 

4395
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,350
it would still be existence right it's
turned toward the one

4396
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
turned toward the one
 

4397
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,310
turned toward the one
that being unites our experience

4398
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:22,320
that being unites our experience
 

4399
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,910
that being unites our experience
and so now i'm at the metaphysical level

4400
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:23,920
and so now i'm at the metaphysical level
 

4401
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:25,830
and so now i'm at the metaphysical level
of analysis i've taken another step out

4402
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
of analysis i've taken another step out
 

4403
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,030
of analysis i've taken another step out
of the cave

4404
01:17:27,030 --> 01:17:27,040
of the cave
 

4405
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,709
of the cave
in plato's language i'm at the formal

4406
01:17:28,709 --> 01:17:28,719
in plato's language i'm at the formal
 

4407
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:31,430
in plato's language i'm at the formal
level now beyond mathematics level forms

4408
01:17:31,430 --> 01:17:31,440
level now beyond mathematics level forms
 

4409
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,430
level now beyond mathematics level forms
and and the formal is inclusive of the

4410
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
and and the formal is inclusive of the
 

4411
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,030
and and the formal is inclusive of the
mathematical which is inclusive of the

4415
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,669
physical
and i think that's eugene vigner is that

01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:37,679
and i think that's eugene vigner is that
 

4417
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,590
and i think that's eugene vigner is that
the mathematical includes the physical

01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:39,600
the mathematical includes the physical
 

4419
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:43,590
the mathematical includes the physical
it it is metaphysically prior to it

4420
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:43,600
it it is metaphysically prior to it
 

4421
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,350
it it is metaphysically prior to it
but here we are sitting in the physical

01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:45,360
but here we are sitting in the physical

trying to make sense of why the

01:17:47,030 --> 01:17:47,040
trying to make sense of why the
 

4425
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:48,870
trying to make sense of why the
unreasonable effectiveness of the thing

4426
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:48,880
unreasonable effectiveness of the thing
 

4427
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,070
unreasonable effectiveness of the thing
that's uh

01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:50,080
that's uh

beyond which is the mathematics my

beyond which is the mathematics my

better answer and i as i read vigner he

4434
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
better answer and i as i read vigner he
 

4435
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,550
better answer and i as i read vigner he
wasn't ready to say that

wasn't ready to say that

01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,270
wasn't ready to say that

4967
01:27:16,719 --> 01:27:18,470
as a sort of um child of christianity we
could talk about that but

could talk about that but
 

4969
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,189
could talk about that but
having said all that yes i think they

4970
01:27:21,189 --> 01:27:21,199
having said all that yes i think they
 

4971
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,950
having said all that yes i think they
are expressing

4972
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
are expressing
 

4973
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,750
are expressing
at least the residue of a once deeply

4974
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:25,760

01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,149
integrated christian sense of things
that uh

4978
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:30,159
that uh
 

4979
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,830
that uh
our rights are not created by the

4980
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:31,840
our rights are not created by the
 

4981
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,310
our rights are not created by the
government they're not uh

4982
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
government they're not uh
 

4983
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:36,470
government they're not uh
doled out by the government they come

4984
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:36,480
doled out by the government they come
 

4985
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:38,229
doled out by the government they come
from god and and the other thing i find

4986
01:27:38,229 --> 01:27:38,239
from god and and the other thing i find
 

4987
01:27:38,239 --> 01:27:40,070
from god and and the other thing i find
really interesting is equality because

4988
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:40,080
really interesting is equality because
 

4989
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,270
really interesting is equality because
um

4990
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:41,280
um
 

4991
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:43,030
um
look in classical philosophy political

4992
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,040
look in classical philosophy political
 

4993
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,070
look in classical philosophy political
philosophy plato aristotle cicero

4994
01:27:46,070 --> 01:27:46,080
philosophy plato aristotle cicero
 

4995
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:47,750
philosophy plato aristotle cicero
it's not equality for them it's our

4996
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:47,760
it's not equality for them it's our
 

4997
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:49,990
it's not equality for them it's our
inequality that's really interesting

4998
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,000
inequality that's really interesting
 

4999
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,669
inequality that's really interesting
so plato divides us into these three

5000
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
so plato divides us into these three
 

5001
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,070
so plato divides us into these three
classes and aristotle says only a tiny

5002
01:27:54,070 --> 01:27:54,080
classes and aristotle says only a tiny
 

5003
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,870
classes and aristotle says only a tiny
little coterie of property males of

5004
01:27:56,870 --> 01:27:56,880
little coterie of property males of
 

5005
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,470
little coterie of property males of
sufficient education should be in the

5006
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
sufficient education should be in the
 

5007
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,990
sufficient education should be in the
political life the rest should all be in

5008
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
political life the rest should all be in
 

5009
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,830
political life the rest should all be in
private life you know and then some are

5010
01:28:01,830 --> 01:28:01,840
private life you know and then some are
 

5011
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:04,310
private life you know and then some are
suited for slavery so i mean he divides

5012
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:04,320
suited for slavery so i mean he divides
 

5013
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:06,629
suited for slavery so i mean he divides
us dramatically same with cicero and so

5014
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
us dramatically same with cicero and so
 

5015
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,229
us dramatically same with cicero and so
on um

5016
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:08,239
on um
 

5017
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:09,750
on um
where does this come from this weird

5018
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:09,760
where does this come from this weird
 

5019
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:11,270
where does this come from this weird
idea that we're all

5020
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
idea that we're all
 

5021
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,790
idea that we're all
equal i mean how we're not equal in

5022
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:12,800
equal i mean how we're not equal in
 

5023
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,149
equal i mean how we're not equal in
beauty not equal in strength we're not

5024
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
beauty not equal in strength we're not
 

5025
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:16,229
beauty not equal in strength we're not
equal in moral attainment we're not

5026
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
equal in moral attainment we're not
 

5027
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:17,270
equal in moral attainment we're not
equal in

5028
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:17,280
equal in
 

5029
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,030
equal in
intelligence so

5030
01:28:19,030 --> 01:28:19,040
intelligence so
 

5031
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,350
intelligence so
what is it and i think the residue

5032
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
what is it and i think the residue
 

5033
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:22,790
what is it and i think the residue
especially comes through in that little

5034
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
especially comes through in that little
 

5035
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,590
especially comes through in that little
word

5036
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:23,600
word
 

5037
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:24,950
word
that all men

5038
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
that all men
 

5039
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:27,430
that all men
are created equal

5040
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:27,440
are created equal
 

5041
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,189
are created equal
that's our equality that we're all

5042
01:28:29,189 --> 01:28:29,199
that's our equality that we're all
 

5043
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,070
that's our equality that we're all
equally children of god so take god out

5044
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
equally children of god so take god out
 

5045
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,590
equally children of god so take god out
of the picture i think

5046
01:28:33,590 --> 01:28:33,600
of the picture i think
 

5047
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,870
of the picture i think
we are going to slide rapidly into

5048
01:28:36,870 --> 01:28:36,880
we are going to slide rapidly into
 

5049
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,790
we are going to slide rapidly into
an embrace of inequality now in the

5050
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
an embrace of inequality now in the
 

5051
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,550
an embrace of inequality now in the
classical world yes

5052
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
classical world yes
 

5053
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,629
classical world yes
but heck look at the 20th century i mean

5054
01:28:42,629 --> 01:28:42,639
but heck look at the 20th century i mean
 

5055
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:44,310
but heck look at the 20th century i mean
when god is excluded in a very

5056
01:28:44,310 --> 01:28:44,320
when god is excluded in a very
 

5057
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:45,750
when god is excluded in a very
systematic way

5058
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:45,760
systematic way
 

5059
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,070
systematic way
i think you saw the suspension of rights

5060
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:48,080
i think you saw the suspension of rights
 

5061
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,510
i think you saw the suspension of rights
and the suspension of equality like mad

5062
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:51,520
and the suspension of equality like mad
 

5063
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:54,310
and the suspension of equality like mad
so i think it's very important

5064
01:28:54,310 --> 01:28:54,320
so i think it's very important
 

5065
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,990
so i think it's very important
that god is in the picture and that

5066
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
that god is in the picture and that
 

5067
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,830
that god is in the picture and that
we're a nation under god it matters

5068
01:28:57,830 --> 01:28:57,840
we're a nation under god it matters
 

5069
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:00,149
we're a nation under god it matters
enormously that's not pious boilerplate

5070
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
enormously that's not pious boilerplate
 

5071
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,590
enormously that's not pious boilerplate
that's at the at the rational

5072
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
that's at the at the rational
 

5073
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,750
that's at the at the rational
foundations of our democracy so do you

5074
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:03,760
foundations of our democracy so do you
 

5075

think nietzsche was on to something with

5076
01:29:05,669 --> 01:29:05,679
think nietzsche was on to something with
 

5077
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:07,590
think nietzsche was on to something with
the idea

5078
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:07,600
the idea
 

5079
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:09,669
the idea
looking into the 20th century that god

5080
01:29:09,669 --> 01:29:09,679
looking into the 20th century that god
 

5081
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,229
looking into the 20th century that god
is dead

5082
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
is dead
 

5083
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,310
is dead
that there is uh

5084
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:14,320
that there is uh
 

5085
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,510
that there is uh
a cultural distancing from a belief in

5086
01:29:17,510 --> 01:29:17,520
a cultural distancing from a belief in
 

5087
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:18,950
a cultural distancing from a belief in
god

5088
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:18,960
god
 

5089
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,550
god
yeah you know i'd be so much sympathetic

5090
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
yeah you know i'd be so much sympathetic
 

5091
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:22,390
yeah you know i'd be so much sympathetic
to jordan peterson's reading of of

5092
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:22,400
to jordan peterson's reading of of
 

5093
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:23,990
to jordan peterson's reading of of
nietzsche there namely it's not

5094
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
nietzsche there namely it's not
 

5095
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,390
nietzsche there namely it's not
nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop

5096
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop
 

5097
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,030
nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop
hey god is dead you know it's more of a

5098
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
hey god is dead you know it's more of a
 

5099
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,709
hey god is dead you know it's more of a
lament you know god's dead and we've

5100
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:30,719
lament you know god's dead and we've
 

5101
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:31,990
lament you know god's dead and we've
killed him

5102
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:32,000
killed him
 

5103
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,470
killed him
and uh what will happen in the wake of

5104
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:34,480
and uh what will happen in the wake of
 

5105
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,270
and uh what will happen in the wake of
that

5106
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:35,280
that
 

5107
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,270
that
and i think yeah much of the

5108
01:29:37,270 --> 01:29:37,280
and i think yeah much of the
 

5109
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,669
and i think yeah much of the
totalitarianism of the 20th century

5110
01:29:39,669 --> 01:29:39,679
totalitarianism of the 20th century
 

5111
01:29:39,679 --> 01:29:42,629
totalitarianism of the 20th century
follows from that um

5112
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:42,639
follows from that um
 

5113
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:43,990
follows from that um
that questioning of god and the

5114
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
that questioning of god and the
 

5115
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,709
that questioning of god and the
dismissal of god from from public life

5116
01:29:46,709 --> 01:29:46,719
dismissal of god from from public life
 

5117
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:49,990
dismissal of god from from public life
so i i would be sympathetic with that um

5118
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
so i i would be sympathetic with that um
 

5119
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,830
so i i would be sympathetic with that um
when we're beyond good and evil you know

5120
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:51,840
when we're beyond good and evil you know
 

5121
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:54,229
when we're beyond good and evil you know
and all that's left is the will to power

5122
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
and all that's left is the will to power
 

5123
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:56,629
and all that's left is the will to power
and then why are we surprised that the

5124
01:29:56,629 --> 01:29:56,639
and then why are we surprised that the
 

5125
01:29:56,639 --> 01:29:58,950
and then why are we surprised that the
powerful rise and that they use the

5126
01:29:58,950 --> 01:29:58,960
powerful rise and that they use the
 

5127
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,030
powerful rise and that they use the
power less for their purposes

5128
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:01,040
power less for their purposes
 

5129
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,110
power less for their purposes
when we forget ideas like equality and

5130
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120
when we forget ideas like equality and
 

5131
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:05,430
when we forget ideas like equality and
rights which are grounded in god why are

5132
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:05,440
rights which are grounded in god why are
 

5133
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:07,270
rights which are grounded in god why are
we surprised that that

5134
01:30:07,270 --> 01:30:07,280
we surprised that that
 

5135
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,669
we surprised that that
death camps follow so i think there's a

5136
01:30:09,669 --> 01:30:09,679
death camps follow so i think there's a
 

5137
01:30:09,679 --> 01:30:11,270
death camps follow so i think there's a
correlation there for sure

5138
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,280
correlation there for sure
 

5139
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,870
correlation there for sure
i don't know i believe that there's a

5140
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:12,880
i don't know i believe that there's a
 

5141
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:15,990
i don't know i believe that there's a
capacity to do good in all of us

5142
01:30:15,990 --> 01:30:16,000
capacity to do good in all of us
 

5143
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,910
capacity to do good in all of us
and a capacity to do evil and there's

5144
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:17,920
and a capacity to do evil and there's
 

5145
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:20,310
and a capacity to do evil and there's
something that tends towards good

5146
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
something that tends towards good
 

5147
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,910
something that tends towards good
whatever that is

5148
01:30:21,910 --> 01:30:21,920
whatever that is
 

5149
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,790
whatever that is
i tend to think that if that community

5150
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:24,800
i tend to think that if that community
 

5151
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,030
i tend to think that if that community
that love that we talked about they find

5152
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:27,040
that love that we talked about they find
 

5153
01:30:27,040 --> 01:30:28,950
that love that we talked about they find
each other they find

5154
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
each other they find
 

5155
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:30,550
each other they find
the good

5156
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:30,560
the good
 

5157
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:32,229
the good
if you don't constrain the resources if

5158
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:32,239
if you don't constrain the resources if
 

5159
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,470
if you don't constrain the resources if
you don't push them if you

5160
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:34,480
you don't push them if you
 

5161
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:37,270
you don't push them if you
uh don't artificially create conflict

5162
01:30:37,270 --> 01:30:37,280
uh don't artificially create conflict
 

5163
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,750
uh don't artificially create conflict
through power centers and evil

5164
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:39,760
through power centers and evil
 

5165
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:41,910
through power centers and evil
uh charismatic leaders then people will

5166
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:41,920
uh charismatic leaders then people will
 

5167
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,149
uh charismatic leaders then people will
be good to each other and

5168
01:30:44,149 --> 01:30:44,159
be good to each other and
 

5169
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:46,950
be good to each other and
whether that's god or some other source

whether that's god or some other source

moral meaning

5176
01:30:51,990 --> 01:30:52,000
moral meaning
 

5177
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:53,590
moral meaning
that seems to be essential for a

5178
01:30:53,590 --> 01:30:53,600
that seems to be essential for a
 

5179
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,149
that seems to be essential for a
functioning civilization yeah

5180
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:56,159
functioning civilization yeah
 

5181
01:30:56,159 --> 01:30:57,910
functioning civilization yeah
and it's hard i mean that's what humans

5182
01:30:57,910 --> 01:30:57,920
and it's hard i mean that's what humans
 

5183
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,149
and it's hard i mean that's what humans
are we're searching for what that god is

5184
01:31:00,149 --> 01:31:00,159
are we're searching for what that god is
 

5185
01:31:00,159 --> 01:31:01,669
are we're searching for what that god is
what that means you know what that

5186
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:01,679
what that means you know what that
 

5187
01:31:01,679 --> 01:31:03,110
what that means you know what that
triggers in my mind i wonder if you

5188
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:03,120
triggers in my mind i wonder if you
 

5189
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:05,270
triggers in my mind i wonder if you
agree with this that the modern sciences

5190
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
agree with this that the modern sciences
 

5191
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:06,390
agree with this that the modern sciences
drew their strength from their

5192
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:06,400
drew their strength from their
 

5193
01:31:06,400 --> 01:31:08,310
drew their strength from their
narrowness and what i mean there is is

5194
01:31:08,310 --> 01:31:08,320
narrowness and what i mean there is is
 

5195
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,030
narrowness and what i mean there is is
they almost completely bracketed formal

5196
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:11,040
they almost completely bracketed formal
 

5197
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,629
they almost completely bracketed formal
and final causality in the aristotelian

5198
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
and final causality in the aristotelian
 

5199
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:14,790
and final causality in the aristotelian
sense and they focused on efficient and

5200
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
sense and they focused on efficient and
 

5201
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,110
sense and they focused on efficient and
material causality and that gave as i

5202
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:17,120
material causality and that gave as i
 

5203
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,470
material causality and that gave as i
say great strength but from the

5204
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,480
say great strength but from the
 

5205
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,950
say great strength but from the
narrowness of focus but for aristotle

5206
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:20,960
narrowness of focus but for aristotle
 

5207
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,110
narrowness of focus but for aristotle
the more important causes are the final

5208
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:23,120
the more important causes are the final
 

5209
01:31:23,120 --> 01:31:24,709
the more important causes are the final
and the formal causes

5210
01:31:24,709 --> 01:31:24,719
and the formal causes
 

5211
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,870
and the formal causes
and so final causality there what's

5212
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
and so final causality there what's
 

5213
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:28,149
and so final causality there what's
drawing us

5214
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:28,159
drawing us
 

5215
01:31:28,159 --> 01:31:29,669
drawing us
so for aristotle he'd look at someone

5216
01:31:29,669 --> 01:31:29,679
so for aristotle he'd look at someone
 

5217
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,110
so for aristotle he'd look at someone
like me and say okay

5218
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:31,120
like me and say okay
 

5219
01:31:31,120 --> 01:31:31,990
like me and say okay
you're

5220
01:31:31,990 --> 01:31:32,000
you're
 

5221
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,790
you're
you have a intelligible structure

5222
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:34,800
you have a intelligible structure
 

5223
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:37,030
you have a intelligible structure
and that leads you to seek certain

5224
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,040
and that leads you to seek certain
 

5225
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:38,310
and that leads you to seek certain
things for the perfection of that

5226
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:38,320
things for the perfection of that
 

5227
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,830
things for the perfection of that
structure you know

5228
01:31:39,830 --> 01:31:39,840
structure you know
 

5229
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,990
structure you know
and fair enough that's right so i seek

5230
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:42,000
and fair enough that's right so i seek
 

5231
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,669
and fair enough that's right so i seek
the good right now i'm seeking the good

5232
01:31:43,669 --> 01:31:43,679
the good right now i'm seeking the good

finalities and intelligible forms that

5530
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:51,199
finalities and intelligible forms that
 

5531
01:36:51,199 --> 01:36:53,109
finalities and intelligible forms that
there's a certain form

01:36:53,109 --> 01:36:53,119
there's a certain form
 

5533
01:36:53,119 --> 01:36:54,950
there's a certain form
to human being which includes the

5534
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
to human being which includes the

01:36:56,880 --> 01:36:59,350
physical and includes the sexual it has
a proper finality and so we'd recognize

01:36:59,350 --> 01:36:59,360
a proper finality and so we'd recognize
 

5539
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,070
a proper finality and so we'd recognize
that finality is twofold both unitive

5540
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:02,080
that finality is twofold both unitive
 

5541
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,470
that finality is twofold both unitive
and procreative and so those two we

5542
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:04,480
and procreative and so those two we
 

5543
01:37:04,480 --> 01:37:06,470
and procreative and so those two we
recognize as the appropriate expression

5544
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:06,480
recognize as the appropriate expression
 

5545
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:08,709
recognize as the appropriate expression
of human sexuality so that's why the

5546
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:08,719
of human sexuality so that's why the
 

5547
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,550
of human sexuality so that's why the
church holds to

5548
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560

01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:31,030
their lives from the inside so i mean
all of that i agree with the the bridge

5568
01:37:31,030 --> 01:37:31,040
all of that i agree with the the bridge
 

5569
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,950
all of that i agree with the the bridge
building that we need to do to people

5570
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:32,960
building that we need to do to people
 

5571
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,870
building that we need to do to people
like in the gay community and people in

5572
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
like in the gay community and people in
 

5573
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,030
like in the gay community and people in
in gay marriage and so on so the church

5574
01:37:37,030 --> 01:37:37,040
in gay marriage and so on so the church
 

5575
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,870
in gay marriage and so on so the church
holds to the

5576
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:38,880
holds to the
 

5577
01:37:38,880 --> 01:37:40,790
holds to the
the intelligible structure if you want

5578
01:37:40,790 --> 01:37:40,800
the intelligible structure if you want
 

5579
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:43,510
the intelligible structure if you want
of human sexuality and it reaches out to

5580
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:43,520
of human sexuality and it reaches out to
 

5581
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,590
of human sexuality and it reaches out to
real human beings always in an attitude

5582
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:45,600
real human beings always in an attitude
 

5583
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,070
real human beings always in an attitude
of invitation and love and so on so it's

5584
01:37:48,070 --> 01:37:48,080
of invitation and love and so on so it's
 

5585
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:50,149
of invitation and love and so on so it's
somewhere in there that the church takes

5586
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:50,159
somewhere in there that the church takes
 

5587
01:37:50,159 --> 01:37:51,669
somewhere in there that the church takes
its stance

5588
01:37:51,669 --> 01:37:51,679
its stance
 

5589
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,030
its stance
and then uh so there's probably

5590
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
and then uh so there's probably
 

5591
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:57,750
and then uh so there's probably
variation in the stances that it it

5592
01:37:57,750 --> 01:37:57,760
variation in the stances that it it
 

5593
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,430
variation in the stances that it it
takes so you're saying the institution

5594
01:37:59,430 --> 01:37:59,440
takes so you're saying the institution

of marriage is about the unitive which

5725
01:40:20,159 --> 01:40:22,390
wade and casey i think they were
terrible the casey decision is is

5726
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:22,400
terrible the casey decision is is
 

5727
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,830
terrible the casey decision is is
instructive to me

5728
01:40:23,830 --> 01:40:23,840
instructive to me
 

5729
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:24,950
instructive to me
that

5730
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:24,960
that
 

5731
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,629
that
it belongs to the nature of freedom that

5732
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
it belongs to the nature of freedom that
 

5733
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:28,629
it belongs to the nature of freedom that
that decision says to determine the

5734
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639
that decision says to determine the
 

5735
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:31,030
that decision says to determine the
meaning of one's own life and even i

5736
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
meaning of one's own life and even i
 

5737
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:32,950
meaning of one's own life and even i
don't get the language exactly right but

5738
01:40:32,950 --> 01:40:32,960
don't get the language exactly right but
 

5739
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,550
don't get the language exactly right but
end of the universe

5740
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:34,560
end of the universe
 

5741
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:37,830
end of the universe
like it gives this staggering scope to

5742
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
like it gives this staggering scope to
 

5743
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,669
like it gives this staggering scope to
our freedom that we can determine the

5744
01:40:39,669 --> 01:40:39,679
our freedom that we can determine the
 

5745
01:40:39,679 --> 01:40:41,430
our freedom that we can determine the
meaning see but that's repugnant to

5746
01:40:41,430 --> 01:40:41,440
meaning see but that's repugnant to
 

5747
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:43,270
meaning see but that's repugnant to
everything we've just talked about

5748
01:40:43,270 --> 01:40:43,280
everything we've just talked about
 

5749
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:44,390
everything we've just talked about
that

5750
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
that
 

5751
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,870
that
i'm inventing the meaning of my life and

5752
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
i'm inventing the meaning of my life and
 

5753
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,189
i'm inventing the meaning of my life and
of the universe and so

5754
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
of the universe and so
 

5755
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:51,109
of the universe and so
casey though was instructive in a way

5756
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119
casey though was instructive in a way
 

5757
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:53,830
casey though was instructive in a way
because it it it tips its hat toward the

5758
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
because it it it tips its hat toward the
 

5759
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,030
because it it it tips its hat toward the
problem culturally is that i think in my

5760
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:57,040
problem culturally is that i think in my
 

5761
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:59,510
problem culturally is that i think in my
freedom i can determine everything

5762
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
freedom i can determine everything
 

5763
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,149
freedom i can determine everything
my choice is all that matters and i

5764
01:41:02,149 --> 01:41:02,159
my choice is all that matters and i
 

5765
01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:04,149
my choice is all that matters and i
would say no your choice should be

5766
01:41:04,149 --> 01:41:04,159
would say no your choice should be
 

5767
01:41:04,159 --> 01:41:06,629
would say no your choice should be
correlated to the order of the good it's

5768
01:41:06,629 --> 01:41:06,639
correlated to the order of the good it's
 

5769
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:09,030
correlated to the order of the good it's
not sovereign it doesn't reign

5770
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:09,040
not sovereign it doesn't reign
 

5771
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,430
not sovereign it doesn't reign
sovereignly over being and it makes its

5772
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:11,440
sovereignly over being and it makes its
 

5773
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,910
sovereignly over being and it makes its
own decisions so i think casey was

5774
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:13,920
own decisions so i think casey was
 

5775
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,870
own decisions so i think casey was
terrible law and and it was backing up

5776
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
terrible law and and it was backing up
 

5777
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,870
terrible law and and it was backing up
roe v wade which is terrible law so i

5778
01:41:18,870 --> 01:41:18,880
roe v wade which is terrible law so i
 

5779
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:20,709
roe v wade which is terrible law so i
i'm in favor of the overturning of those

5780
01:41:20,709 --> 01:41:20,719
i'm in favor of the overturning of those
 

5781
01:41:20,719 --> 01:41:22,629
i'm in favor of the overturning of those
i've spoken out that many times now

5782
01:41:22,629 --> 01:41:22,639
i've spoken out that many times now
 

5783
01:41:22,639 --> 01:41:24,470
i've spoken out that many times now

stand

5814
01:41:50,550 --> 01:41:50,560
stand
 

5815
01:41:50,560 --> 01:41:52,310
stand
radically opposed to that it's such an

5816
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:52,320
radically opposed to that it's such an
 

5817
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:53,990
radically opposed to that it's such an
interesting line

5818
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,000
interesting line
 

5819
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,470
interesting line
because if if you believe

5820
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:56,480
because if if you believe
 

5821
01:41:56,480 --> 01:41:58,870
because if if you believe
that there's a it's a line that

5822
01:41:58,870 --> 01:41:58,880
that there's a it's a line that
 

5823
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,990
that there's a it's a line that
struggles with the question of what is

5824
01:42:01,990 --> 01:42:02,000
struggles with the question of what is
 

5825
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,629
struggles with the question of what is
does it mean to be a living being

5826
01:42:04,629 --> 01:42:04,639
does it mean to be a living being
 

5827
01:42:04,639 --> 01:42:06,310
does it mean to be a living being
or to give life

5828
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:06,320
or to give life
 

5829
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:08,070
or to give life
to something

5830
01:42:08,070 --> 01:42:08,080
to something
 

5831
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,430
to something
um because if you believe that at the

5832
01:42:11,430 --> 01:42:11,440
um because if you believe that at the
 

5833
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:13,030
um because if you believe that at the
moment of conception you're you're

5834
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
moment of conception you're you're
 

5835
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:16,629
moment of conception you're you're
basically creating a human life

5836
01:42:16,629 --> 01:42:16,639
basically creating a human life
 

5837
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:19,430
basically creating a human life
then abortion is murder

5838
01:42:19,430 --> 01:42:19,440
then abortion is murder
 

5839
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:21,830
then abortion is murder
and then if you don't

5840
01:42:21,830 --> 01:42:21,840
and then if you don't
 

5841
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:23,350
and then if you don't
then it's a

5842
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
then it's a
 

5843
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,189
then it's a
sort of basic biological choice

5844
01:42:27,189 --> 01:42:27,199
sort of basic biological choice
 

5845
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:28,390
sort of basic biological choice
that's not

5846
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
that's not
 

5847
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,229
that's not
uh taking away of a life

5848
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
uh taking away of a life
 

5849
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,870
uh taking away of a life
and the gap between those two beliefs is

5850
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:32,880
and the gap between those two beliefs is
 

5851
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,270
and the gap between those two beliefs is
so vast yeah it's hard

5852
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
so vast yeah it's hard
 

5853
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,590
so vast yeah it's hard
and yet so fundamental to the question

5854
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:37,600
and yet so fundamental to the question
 

5855
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:39,109
and yet so fundamental to the question
of what it means to be

5856
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:39,119
of what it means to be
 

5857
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:42,149
of what it means to be
alive and the the fundamental question

5858
01:42:42,149 --> 01:42:42,159
alive and the the fundamental question
 

5859
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:44,870
alive and the the fundamental question
about the respect for human life and

5860
01:42:44,870 --> 01:42:44,880
about the respect for human life and
 

5861
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,669
about the respect for human life and
human dignity it's interesting to see

5862
01:42:47,669 --> 01:42:47,679
human dignity it's interesting to see
 

5863
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:49,109
human dignity it's interesting to see
um

5864
01:42:49,109 --> 01:42:49,119
um
 

5865
01:42:49,119 --> 01:42:51,030
um
and also about freedom right you know

5866
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
and also about freedom right you know
 

5867
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,189
and also about freedom right you know
all of those things are mixed in there

5868
01:42:53,189 --> 01:42:53,199
all of those things are mixed in there
 

5869
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:55,590
all of those things are mixed in there
right it's a beautiful struggle maybe

5870
01:42:55,590 --> 01:42:55,600
right it's a beautiful struggle maybe
 

5871
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:57,030
right it's a beautiful struggle maybe

um
 

6081
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:34,390
um
that's why i would say them so find what

6082
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,400
that's why i would say them so find what
 

6083
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,070
that's why i would say them so find what
you're good at that's that's from that's

6084
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:36,080
you're good at that's that's from that's
 

6085
01:46:36,080 --> 01:46:38,550
you're good at that's that's from that's
a tricky one finding what you're good at

6086
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:38,560
a tricky one finding what you're good at
 

6087
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:41,270
a tricky one finding what you're good at
what because it's not just raw skill

6088
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:41,280
what because it's not just raw skill
 

6089
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,510
what because it's not just raw skill
it's also what you connect with yeah and

6090
01:46:43,510 --> 01:46:43,520
it's also what you connect with yeah and
 

6091
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,629
it's also what you connect with yeah and
it's also

6092
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
it's also
 

6093
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:48,149
it's also
um like this iterative process of

6094
01:46:48,149 --> 01:46:48,159
um like this iterative process of
 

6095
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:51,910
um like this iterative process of
if you want to add love to the world

6096
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:51,920
if you want to add love to the world
 

6097
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,189
if you want to add love to the world
you have to

6098
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
you have to
 

6099
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,189
you have to
see how can you be effective at doing

6100
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:55,199
see how can you be effective at doing
 

6101
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:56,550
see how can you be effective at doing
that so it's not just the things you're

6102
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:56,560
that so it's not just the things you're

that so it's not just the things you're
good at there's like

6104
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:58,880
good at there's like

01:46:58,880 --> 01:46:59,750
good at there's like
there's

6106
01:46:59,750 --> 01:46:59,760
there's
 

6107
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,750
there's
you know i'm good at building bridges

6108
01:47:01,750 --> 01:47:01,760
you know i'm good at building bridges
 

6109
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,430
you know i'm good at building bridges
out of toothpicks i'm not exactly sure

6110
01:47:03,430 --> 01:47:03,440
out of toothpicks i'm not exactly sure
 

6111
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,750
out of toothpicks i'm not exactly sure
that's going to be useful for the world

that's going to be useful for the world
then again to push back on that the joy

6114
01:47:08,470 --> 01:47:08,480
then again to push back on that the joy
 

6115
01:47:08,480 --> 01:47:10,790
then again to push back on that the joy
brings me maybe somehow the joy radiates

6116
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
brings me maybe somehow the joy radiates
 

6117
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,310
brings me maybe somehow the joy radiates

true that was a that was a searching
 

6127
01:47:23,199 --> 01:47:25,430
true that was a that was a searching
that's the process of yeah trying stuff

6128
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:25,440
that's the process of yeah trying stuff
 

6129
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,910
that's the process of yeah trying stuff
and figuring it out right and

6130
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
and figuring it out right and
 

6131
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:30,629
and figuring it out right and
ultimately yes asking the question

6132
01:47:30,629 --> 01:47:30,639
ultimately yes asking the question

those kinds of things right i think
 

6141
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:39,189
those kinds of things right i think
that's the name of the game you know but

6142
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:39,199
that's the name of the game you know but
 

6143
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:41,510
that's the name of the game you know but
it's tricky and if we don't have moral

6144
01:47:41,510 --> 01:47:41,520
it's tricky and if we don't have moral
 

6145

and so god can therefore

6346
01:51:02,149 --> 01:51:02,159
and so god can therefore
 

6347
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:04,870
and so god can therefore
re-embody me according to that pattern

6348
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
re-embody me according to that pattern
 

6349
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,790
re-embody me according to that pattern
at a higher pitch what we call the

6350
01:51:06,790 --> 01:51:06,800
at a higher pitch what we call the
 

6351
01:51:06,800 --> 01:51:08,390
at a higher pitch what we call the
resurrected body

6352
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
resurrected body
 

6353
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,270
resurrected body
uh

6354
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
uh
 

6355
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,990
uh
so paul talks about a spiritual body

6356
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
so paul talks about a spiritual body
 

6357
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,990
so paul talks about a spiritual body
his body for sure because he believes in

6358
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:14,000
his body for sure because he believes in
 

6359
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,589
his body for sure because he believes in
the resurrection of jesus

6360
01:51:15,589 --> 01:51:15,599
the resurrection of jesus
 

6361
01:51:15,599 --> 01:51:16,550
the resurrection of jesus
um

6362
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:16,560
um
 

6363
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,149
um
but it's not a body like

6364
01:51:18,149 --> 01:51:18,159
but it's not a body like
 

6365
01:51:18,159 --> 01:51:20,390
but it's not a body like
ours from this world it's a it's a

6366
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
ours from this world it's a it's a
 

6367
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,910
ours from this world it's a it's a
body at a higher pitch

6368
01:51:21,910 --> 01:51:21,920
body at a higher pitch
 

6369
01:51:21,920 --> 01:51:23,270
body at a higher pitch
so something

6370
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
so something
 

6371
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,070
so something
some pattern that's there persists

6372
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:26,080
some pattern that's there persists
 

6373
01:51:26,080 --> 01:51:27,189
some pattern that's there persists
pattern

6374
01:51:27,189 --> 01:51:27,199
pattern
 

6375
01:51:27,199 --> 01:51:29,109
pattern
persists in the mind of god and then is

6376
01:51:29,109 --> 01:51:29,119
persists in the mind of god and then is
 

6377
01:51:29,119 --> 01:51:31,990
persists in the mind of god and then is
used as the ground of the re-embodiment

6378
01:51:31,990 --> 01:51:32,000
used as the ground of the re-embodiment
 

6379
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:33,830
used as the ground of the re-embodiment
of me so it's not like i've just become

6380
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:33,840
of me so it's not like i've just become
 

6381
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:36,629
of me so it's not like i've just become
a platonic form i'm gonna be re-embodied

6382
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
a platonic form i'm gonna be re-embodied
 

6383
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,830
a platonic form i'm gonna be re-embodied
because the christian hope is not for

6384
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:39,840
because the christian hope is not for
 

6385
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:42,070
because the christian hope is not for
platonic escape of soul from matter

6386
01:51:42,070 --> 01:51:42,080
platonic escape of soul from matter
 

6387
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:44,070
platonic escape of soul from matter
that's never the christian hope it's for

6388
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
that's never the christian hope it's for
 

6389
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,709
that's never the christian hope it's for
the resurrection of the body we say

6390
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:46,719
the resurrection of the body we say
 

6391
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:49,030
the resurrection of the body we say
and he said what a fantastic idea well i

6392
01:51:49,030 --> 01:51:49,040
and he said what a fantastic idea well i
 

6393
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:51,830
and he said what a fantastic idea well i
don't know i mean this body is being

6394
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:51,840
don't know i mean this body is being
 

6395
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:53,910
don't know i mean this body is being
reconstituted all the time according to

6396
01:51:53,910 --> 01:51:53,920
reconstituted all the time according to
 

6397
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,149
reconstituted all the time according to
this pattern right it's not the same

6398
01:51:56,149 --> 01:51:56,159
this pattern right it's not the same
 

6399
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:57,030
this pattern right it's not the same
matter

6400
01:51:57,030 --> 01:51:57,040
matter
 

6401
01:51:57,040 --> 01:51:57,990
matter
and so

6402
01:51:57,990 --> 01:51:58,000
and so
 

6403
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,870
and so
might there be an another sort of higher

6404
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
might there be an another sort of higher
 

6405
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,270
might there be an another sort of higher
material that is

6406
01:52:03,270 --> 01:52:03,280
material that is
 

6407
01:52:03,280 --> 01:52:04,709
material that is
organized according to the same pattern

6408
01:52:04,709 --> 01:52:04,719
organized according to the same pattern
 

6409
01:52:04,719 --> 01:52:06,629
organized according to the same pattern
which has been remembered by god so

6410
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:06,639
which has been remembered by god so
 

6411
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,149
which has been remembered by god so
therefore we can hang on to the language

6412
01:52:08,149 --> 01:52:08,159
therefore we can hang on to the language
 

6413
01:52:08,159 --> 01:52:10,310
therefore we can hang on to the language
of body and soul if you want or matter

of body and soul if you want or matter
and form

6416
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:11,679
and form
 

6417
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:12,629
and form
but it's

6418
01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:12,639
but it's
 

6419
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:15,669
but it's
the form remembered by god and then

6420
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:15,679
the form remembered by god and then
 

6421
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:18,310
the form remembered by god and then
it in an embodied way by god that we

6422
01:52:18,310 --> 01:52:18,320
it in an embodied way by god that we
 

6423
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:19,270

what's the ultimate value the value of

6488
01:53:20,870 --> 01:53:20,880
what's the ultimate value the value of
 

6489
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,750
what's the ultimate value the value of
values is god the supreme good right the

6490
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:23,760
values is god the supreme good right the
 

6491

6501
01:53:35,360 --> 01:53:37,189
and who's god god is love so that's why
i would fit the package together that

6502
01:53:37,189 --> 01:53:37,199
i would fit the package together that
 

6503
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:37,910
i would fit the package together that
way

6504
01:53:37,910 --> 01:53:37,920
way
