computers would you say yeah I would say
so video games or just the computer

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:01,800
so video games or just the computer
 

271
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,770
so video games or just the computer
itself just something about the machine

272
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:03,780
itself just something about the machine
 

273
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,350
itself just something about the machine
oh this thing

274
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:06,360
oh this thing
 

275
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,930

301
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,909
um yeah and that's when I realized wow
you can you can write code to do all

302
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:37,919
you can you can write code to do all
 

303
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,490
you can you can write code to do all
sorts of like really cool stuff

304
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:40,500
sorts of like really cool stuff
 

305

I must have been like six or seven at
the time so you can write programs and

308
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,020
the time so you can write programs and
 

309
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,469
the time so you can write programs and
the programs do stuff for you that's

310

1115
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,909
um
generosity is another one too like just

1116
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:25,919
generosity is another one too like just
 

1117
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,250
generosity is another one too like just
being generous with your time and love

1118
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:28,260
being generous with your time and love
 

1119
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,130
being generous with your time and love
and attention and even

1120
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:31,140
and attention and even
 

1121
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,230
and attention and even
with your wealth right even if you don't

1122
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,240
with your wealth right even if you don't
 

1123
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,490
with your wealth right even if you don't
have a lot of it you're still very

1124
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:34,500
have a lot of it you're still very
 

1125
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,909
have a lot of it you're still very
generous I think that's another

1126
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:36,919
generous I think that's another
 

1127
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:39,770
generous I think that's another
enjoying the humanity of other people

1128
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:39,780
enjoying the humanity of other people
 

1129
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,470
enjoying the humanity of other people
and so if you think there's a useful

1130
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:42,480
and so if you think there's a useful
 

1131
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,289
and so if you think there's a useful
difference between men and women

1132
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:45,299
difference between men and women
 

1133
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:48,830
difference between men and women
in that aspect and empathy

1134
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:48,840
in that aspect and empathy
 

1135
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,390
in that aspect and empathy
or is doing these kind of big General

1136
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
or is doing these kind of big General
 

1137
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,610
or is doing these kind of big General
groups does that hinder

1138
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:55,620
groups does that hinder
 

1139
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,169
groups does that hinder
progress

1140
00:21:57,169 --> 00:21:57,179
progress
 

1141
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,210
progress
I don't I I actually don't want to over

1142
00:21:59,210 --> 00:21:59,220
I don't I I actually don't want to over
 

1143
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,970
I don't I I actually don't want to over
generalize I mean I love the men I know

1144
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:01,980
generalize I mean I love the men I know
 

1145
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,890
generalize I mean I love the men I know
are like the most empathetic humans yeah

1146
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:03,900
are like the most empathetic humans yeah
 

1147
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,710
are like the most empathetic humans yeah
I strive to be yeah you're actually very

1148
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:06,720
I strive to be yeah you're actually very
 

1149
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,690
I strive to be yeah you're actually very
empathetic

1150
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:08,700
empathetic
 

1151
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,490
empathetic
um

1152
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:10,500
um
 

1153
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,830
um
yeah I thought so I don't want to over

1154
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:12,840
yeah I thought so I don't want to over
 

1155
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,210
yeah I thought so I don't want to over
generalize

1156
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:14,220
generalize
 

1157
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,730
generalize
um although one of the researchers I

1158
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:16,740
um although one of the researchers I
 

1159
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,230
um although one of the researchers I
worked with when I was at Cambridge

1160
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:18,240
worked with when I was at Cambridge
 

1161
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,570
worked with when I was at Cambridge
Professor Simon Baron Cohen he's uh

runs the autism Research Center at

1166
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:25,679
runs the autism Research Center at
 

1167
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,710
runs the autism Research Center at
Cambridge and he's

written multiple books

1170
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:29,700
written multiple books
 

1171
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,750
written multiple books
um on autism and one of his one of his

1172
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:32,760
um on autism and one of his one of his
 

1173
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,730
um on autism and one of his one of his
theories is the empathy scale like the

1174
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:34,740
theories is the empathy scale like the
 

1175
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,750
theories is the empathy scale like the
systemizers and the empathizers and it

1176
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
systemizers and the empathizers and it
 

1177
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,149
systemizers and the empathizers and it
there's a disproportionate amount of

1178
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:41,159
there's a disproportionate amount of
 

1179
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:43,669
there's a disproportionate amount of
computer scientists and Engineers who

1180
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
computer scientists and Engineers who
 

1181
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,010
computer scientists and Engineers who
are systemizers and perhaps not great

1182
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,020
are systemizers and perhaps not great
 

1183
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,930
are systemizers and perhaps not great
empathizers

1184
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:47,940
empathizers
 

1185
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,169
empathizers
and then you know there's and there's

1186
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:51,179
and then you know there's and there's
 

1187
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,029
and then you know there's and there's
more men in that bucket I guess than

1188
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:53,039
more men in that bucket I guess than
 

1189
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,549
more men in that bucket I guess than
women and then there's more women in the

1190
00:22:55,549 --> 00:22:55,559
women and then there's more women in the
 

1191
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:57,770
women and then there's more women in the
empathizer's bucket so again not not to

1192
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:57,780
empathizer's bucket so again not not to
 

1193
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,870
empathizer's bucket so again not not to
over generalize I sometimes wonder about

1194
00:22:59,870 --> 00:22:59,880
over generalize I sometimes wonder about
 

1195
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,510
over generalize I sometimes wonder about
that is it's been frustrating to me how

1196
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,520
that is it's been frustrating to me how
 

1197
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,549
that is it's been frustrating to me how
many I guess systemizes there are in the

1198
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:04,559
many I guess systemizes there are in the
 

1199
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,370
many I guess systemizes there are in the
fields of robotics yeah it's actually

1200
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:07,380
fields of robotics yeah it's actually
 

1201
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,930
fields of robotics yeah it's actually
encouraging to me because I care about

1202
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:08,940
encouraging to me because I care about
 

1203
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,610
encouraging to me because I care about
obviously social Robotics and because uh

1204
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:13,620
obviously social Robotics and because uh
 

1205
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,730
obviously social Robotics and because uh
it's it it uh there's more opportunity

1206
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:16,740
it's it it uh there's more opportunity
 

1207
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,789
it's it it uh there's more opportunity
for people that are empathic exactly I

1208
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:19,799
for people that are empathic exactly I
 

1209
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:21,770
for people that are empathic exactly I
totally agree well right so it's nice

1210
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,780
totally agree well right so it's nice
 

1211
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,110
totally agree well right so it's nice
yes so everybody said talk to they don't

1212
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:24,120
yes so everybody said talk to they don't
 

1213
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,649
yes so everybody said talk to they don't
see the the human as interesting as um

1214
00:23:27,649 --> 00:23:27,659
see the the human as interesting as um
 

1215
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,690
see the the human as interesting as um
like it does it's not exciting you want

1216
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:29,700
like it does it's not exciting you want
 

1217
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,810
like it does it's not exciting you want
to avoid the human at all costs it's a

1218
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:32,820
to avoid the human at all costs it's a
 

1219
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,850
to avoid the human at all costs it's a
it's a safety concern to be touching the

1220
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:34,860
it's a safety concern to be touching the
 

1221
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,049
it's a safety concern to be touching the
human

1222
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:36,059
human
 

1223
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,870
human
um which it is but it's also an

1224
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:38,880
um which it is but it's also an
 

1225
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,510
um which it is but it's also an
opportunity for a deep connection or

1226
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:41,520
opportunity for a deep connection or
 

1227
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,010
opportunity for a deep connection or
collaboration or all that kind of stuff

1228
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:43,020
collaboration or all that kind of stuff
 

1229
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,649
collaboration or all that kind of stuff
so and because most of most brilliant

1230
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:45,659
so and because most of most brilliant
 

1231
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:47,270
so and because most of most brilliant
roboticists don't care about the human

1232
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,280
roboticists don't care about the human
 

1233
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,850
roboticists don't care about the human
it's an opportunity right uh for in your

1234
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:49,860
it's an opportunity right uh for in your
 

1235
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,250
it's an opportunity right uh for in your
case it's a business opportunity too uh

1236
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:52,260
case it's a business opportunity too uh
 

1237
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,990
case it's a business opportunity too uh
but in general an opportunity to explore

1238
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
but in general an opportunity to explore
 

1239
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,970
but in general an opportunity to explore
those ideas so

1240
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:55,980
those ideas so
 

1241
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,789
those ideas so
in this beautiful journey to Cambridge

1242
00:23:58,789 --> 00:23:58,799
in this beautiful journey to Cambridge
 

1243
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,549
in this beautiful journey to Cambridge
uh to you know UK and then to America

1244
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:01,559
uh to you know UK and then to America
 

1245
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,549
uh to you know UK and then to America
what uh what's the moment or moments

1246
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:04,559
what uh what's the moment or moments
 

1247
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,909
what uh what's the moment or moments
there were most transformational for you

1248
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:06,919
there were most transformational for you
 

1249
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:10,370
there were most transformational for you
as a scientist and as a leader so you

1250
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:10,380
as a scientist and as a leader so you
 

1251
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:13,010
as a scientist and as a leader so you
became an exceptionally successful CEO

1252
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,020
became an exceptionally successful CEO
 

1253
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,630
became an exceptionally successful CEO
founder researcher scientist and so on

1254
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:17,640
founder researcher scientist and so on
 

1255
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,649
founder researcher scientist and so on
um was there a face shift there where

1256
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:21,659
um was there a face shift there where
 

1257
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:24,470
um was there a face shift there where
like I can be somebody I can I can

1258
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:24,480
like I can be somebody I can I can
 

1259
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,570
like I can be somebody I can I can
really do something in this world

1260
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:26,580
really do something in this world
 

1261
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,210
really do something in this world
yes I actually just kind of a little bit

1262
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:29,220
yes I actually just kind of a little bit
 

1263
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,570
yes I actually just kind of a little bit
of background so the reason why I moved

1264
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:32,580
of background so the reason why I moved
 

1265
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,029
of background so the reason why I moved
from Cairo to Cambridge UK to do my phds

1266
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
from Cairo to Cambridge UK to do my phds
 

1267
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,010
from Cairo to Cambridge UK to do my phds
because I had a very you know clear

1268
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,020
because I had a very you know clear
 

1269
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,230
because I had a very you know clear
career plan I was like okay I'll go

1270
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:39,240

the capability to actually
 

1329

I think there's I think technology can
 

1359
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,549
I think there's I think technology can
be not just transformative in terms of

1360
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
be not just transformative in terms of
 

1361
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,430

1377
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,830
there's something nice about the haptic
aspect of the fax machine because you

1378
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:30,840
aspect of the fax machine because you
 

1379
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,930
aspect of the fax machine because you
still have to press you still have to do

1380
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:32,940
still have to press you still have to do

00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:28,559
um you mean America in general but also
 

1583
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,430
um you mean America in general but also
I mean Cambridge is its own culture so

1584
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
I mean Cambridge is its own culture so
 

1585
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,710
I mean Cambridge is its own culture so
what was MIT like and what was America

1586
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:33,720
what was MIT like and what was America
 

1587
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,870
what was MIT like and what was America
like

1588
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:35,880
like
 

1589
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,909
like
I wonder if that's similar to experience

1590
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
I wonder if that's similar to experience
 

1591
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,210
I wonder if that's similar to experience
at MIT I

1592
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:41,220

 

1593
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,190

was at the media lab in particular I was

1594
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
was at the media lab in particular I was
 

1595
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,710
was at the media lab in particular I was
just really

1596
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:44,720
just really
 

1597
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,810
just really
impressed is not the right word I didn't

1598
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:47,820
impressed is not the right word I didn't
 

1599
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,510
impressed is not the right word I didn't
expect the openness to like Innovation

1600
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:50,520
expect the openness to like Innovation
 

1601
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:55,130
expect the openness to like Innovation
and the acceptance of taking a risk and

1602
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:55,140
and the acceptance of taking a risk and
 

1603
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,350
and the acceptance of taking a risk and
failing like failure isn't really

1604
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,360
failing like failure isn't really
 

1605
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,510
failing like failure isn't really
accepted back in Egypt right you don't

1606
00:30:59,510 --> 00:30:59,520
accepted back in Egypt right you don't
 

1607
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,830
accepted back in Egypt right you don't
want to fail like there's a fear of

1608
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:00,840
want to fail like there's a fear of
 

1609
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,850
want to fail like there's a fear of
failure

1610
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:01,860
failure
 

1611
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,950
failure
which I think has been hardwired in my

1612
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:03,960
which I think has been hardwired in my
 

1613
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,649
which I think has been hardwired in my
brain but you got to MIT and it's okay

1614
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:06,659
brain but you got to MIT and it's okay
 

1615
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,210
brain but you got to MIT and it's okay
to start things and if they don't work

1616
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:08,220
to start things and if they don't work
 

1617
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,070
to start things and if they don't work
out like it's okay you pivot to another

1618
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:10,080
out like it's okay you pivot to another
 

1619
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,950
out like it's okay you pivot to another
idea and that kind of thinking was just

1620
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:12,960
idea and that kind of thinking was just
 

1621
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,049
idea and that kind of thinking was just
very new to me I was liberating well

1622
00:31:15,049 --> 00:31:15,059
very new to me I was liberating well
 

1623
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:16,549
very new to me I was liberating well
media a lot for people don't know MIT

1624
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:16,559
media a lot for people don't know MIT
 

1625
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,490
media a lot for people don't know MIT
media lab is its own beautiful thing

1626
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:19,500
media lab is its own beautiful thing
 

1627
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,930
media lab is its own beautiful thing
because

1628
00:31:20,930 --> 00:31:20,940
because
 

1629
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,630
because
they I think more than other places at

1630
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:23,640
they I think more than other places at
 

1631
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,029
they I think more than other places at
MIT reach for Big Ideas and like they

1632
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,039
MIT reach for Big Ideas and like they
 

1633
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,610
MIT reach for Big Ideas and like they
try I mean I think I mean depending of

1634
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:28,620
try I mean I think I mean depending of
 

1635
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,990
try I mean I think I mean depending of
course on who but certainly with

1636
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:30,000
course on who but certainly with
 

1637
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,990
course on who but certainly with
Rosalind this you try wild stuff you try

1638
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:33,000
Rosalind this you try wild stuff you try
 

1639
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,470
Rosalind this you try wild stuff you try
big things and crazy things and and also

1640
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
big things and crazy things and and also
 

1641
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,750
big things and crazy things and and also
uh try to take things to completion so

1642
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,760
uh try to take things to completion so
 

1643
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,870
uh try to take things to completion so
you can demo them so always always have

1644
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:41,880
you can demo them so always always have
 

1645
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,649
you can demo them so always always have
a a demo like if you go one of the sad

1646
00:31:45,649 --> 00:31:45,659
a a demo like if you go one of the sad
 

1647
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,690
a a demo like if you go one of the sad
things to me about robotics Labs at MIT

1648
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:47,700
things to me about robotics Labs at MIT
 

1649
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:51,230
things to me about robotics Labs at MIT
and there's like over 30 I think uh is

1650
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,240
and there's like over 30 I think uh is
 

1651
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,269
and there's like over 30 I think uh is
like usually when you show up to a

1652
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:53,279
like usually when you show up to a
 

1653
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,130
like usually when you show up to a
robotics lab there's not a single

1654
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:55,140
robotics lab there's not a single
 

1655
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,590
robotics lab there's not a single
working robot they're all broken all the

1656
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
working robot they're all broken all the
 

1657
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,810
working robot they're all broken all the
robots are broken which is like the

1658
00:31:59,810 --> 00:31:59,820
robots are broken which is like the
 

1659
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,310
robots are broken which is like the
normal state of things because you're

1660
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:01,320
normal state of things because you're
 

1661
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,590
normal state of things because you're
working on them but it would be nice if

1662
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
working on them but it would be nice if
 

1663
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,690
working on them but it would be nice if
we lived in a world where robotics Labs

1664
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:05,700
we lived in a world where robotics Labs
 

1665
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,409
we lived in a world where robotics Labs
had uh wrote some robots functioning one

1666
00:32:09,409 --> 00:32:09,419
had uh wrote some robots functioning one
 

1667
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:11,450
had uh wrote some robots functioning one
of my like favorite moments that just

1668
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:11,460
of my like favorite moments that just
 

1669
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,250
of my like favorite moments that just
sticks with me I visited Boston Dynamics

1670
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:13,260
sticks with me I visited Boston Dynamics
 

1671
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,590
sticks with me I visited Boston Dynamics
and there was a

1672
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
and there was a
 

1673
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,470
and there was a
first of all seeing so many spots so

1674
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:18,480
first of all seeing so many spots so
 

1675
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,990
first of all seeing so many spots so
many legged robots in one place I'm like

1676
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,000
many legged robots in one place I'm like
 

1677
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,269
many legged robots in one place I'm like
I'm home

1678
00:32:22,269 --> 00:32:22,279
I'm home
 

1679
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:27,649
I'm home
but the Thrive yeah uh this is where I

1680
00:32:27,649 --> 00:32:27,659
but the Thrive yeah uh this is where I
 

1681
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,769
but the Thrive yeah uh this is where I
was built uh the the cool thing was just

1682
00:32:30,769 --> 00:32:30,779
was built uh the the cool thing was just
 

1683
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:33,350
was built uh the the cool thing was just
to see there was a random robot uh spot

1684
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:33,360
to see there was a random robot uh spot
 

1685
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,930
to see there was a random robot uh spot
was walking down the hall it's probably

1686
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:35,940
was walking down the hall it's probably
 

1687
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,789
was walking down the hall it's probably
doing mapping but it looked like he

1688
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:37,799
doing mapping but it looked like he
 

1689
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:39,350
doing mapping but it looked like he
wasn't doing anything and he was wearing

1690
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
wasn't doing anything and he was wearing
 

1691
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,889
wasn't doing anything and he was wearing
he or she I don't know but it it well I

1692
00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:42,899
he or she I don't know but it it well I
 

1693
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:44,930
he or she I don't know but it it well I
I like I I like in my mind there are

1694
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:44,940
I like I I like in my mind there are
 

1695
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,789
I like I I like in my mind there are
people they have a backstory but this

1696
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
people they have a backstory but this
 

1697
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:48,110
people they have a backstory but this
one in particular definitely has a

1698
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:48,120
one in particular definitely has a
 

1699
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,210
one in particular definitely has a
backstory because uh he was wearing a

1700
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,220
backstory because uh he was wearing a
 

1701
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,389
backstory because uh he was wearing a
cowboy hat so as you saw a spot robot

1702
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:53,399
cowboy hat so as you saw a spot robot
 

1703
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,370
cowboy hat so as you saw a spot robot
with a cowboy hat walking down the hall

1704
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:55,380
with a cowboy hat walking down the hall
 

1705
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,649
with a cowboy hat walking down the hall
and it was just this feeling like

1706
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:57,659
and it was just this feeling like
 

1707
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,850
and it was just this feeling like
there's a life like he has a life he

1708
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:01,860
there's a life like he has a life he
 

1709
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,529
there's a life like he has a life he
probably has to commute back to his

1710
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:03,539
probably has to commute back to his
 

1711
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:05,930
probably has to commute back to his
family at night like there's a there's a

1712
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:05,940
family at night like there's a there's a
 

1713
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,450
family at night like there's a there's a
feeling like there's life instilled in

1714
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,460
feeling like there's life instilled in
 

1715
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,370
feeling like there's life instilled in
this robot and it's magical I don't know

1716
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:10,380
this robot and it's magical I don't know
 

1717
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,049
this robot and it's magical I don't know
it was It was kind of inspiring to see

1718
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:12,059
it was It was kind of inspiring to see
 

1719
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,970
it was It was kind of inspiring to see
they didn't say hello to did he say

1720
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:13,980
they didn't say hello to did he say
 

1721
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,669
they didn't say hello to did he say
hello to you yeah very there's a focused

1722
00:33:16,669 --> 00:33:16,679
hello to you yeah very there's a focused
 

1723
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,549
hello to you yeah very there's a focused
nature to the robot no no listen I love

1724
00:33:19,549 --> 00:33:19,559
nature to the robot no no listen I love
 

1725
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,009
nature to the robot no no listen I love
competence and focus and great like it

1726
00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:22,019
competence and focus and great like it
 

1727
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,590
competence and focus and great like it
was not gonna get distracted by the the

1728
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:24,600
was not gonna get distracted by the the
 

1729
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,430
was not gonna get distracted by the the
shallowness of small talk there's a job

1730
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:28,440
shallowness of small talk there's a job
 

1731
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,470
shallowness of small talk there's a job
to be done and he was doing it so anyway

1732
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:30,480
to be done and he was doing it so anyway
 

1733
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,630
to be done and he was doing it so anyway
the the fact that it was working is a

1734
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:32,640
the the fact that it was working is a
 

1735
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,970

machine learning problem we just need
 

2635
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,930
machine learning problem we just need
the data let's do it well

2636
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:20,940

 

2637
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,609

two of us that they're ought to be ought

2638
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:22,619
two of us that they're ought to be ought

2640
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:24,420
to be learning algorithm that can ingest
 

2641
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,450
to be learning algorithm that can ingest
all this data and basically say I think

2642
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:26,460
all this data and basically say I think
 

2643
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,730
all this data and basically say I think
the following 10 people would be

you could probably measure that and then

2676
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:07,800
you could probably measure that and then
 

2677
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,290
you could probably measure that and then
optimize it over the first few days

2678
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:09,300
optimize it over the first few days
 

2679
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,630
optimize it over the first few days
right and then we're just turning this

2680

right and then we're just turning this
 

2681
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,069
right and then we're just turning this
into a machine learning problem I love

kind of stuff it seems like the data is
 

2749
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,809
kind of stuff it seems like the data is
there right uh the that's the problem

2750
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:32,819
there right uh the that's the problem

Engineers so it's like you have to find

2778
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:03,960
Engineers so it's like you have to find
 

2779

Engineers so it's like you have to find
this this beautiful mix and for some

2780
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:06,540
this this beautiful mix and for some
 

2781
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,109
this this beautiful mix and for some
reason just empirically speaking

2782
00:54:09,109 --> 00:54:09,119
reason just empirically speaking
 

2783
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,870
reason just empirically speaking
it's it people who have not done a good

2784

it's possible like right with data

2804
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:35,400
it's possible like right with data

2832
00:55:03,589 --> 00:55:03,599
Serendipity piece of it like how do you
 

2833
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,690
Serendipity piece of it like how do you
engineer Serendipity like this random

2834
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:05,700
engineer Serendipity like this random
 

2835
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:08,030
engineer Serendipity like this random
like chance encounter and then you fall

2836
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:08,040
like chance encounter and then you fall
 

2837
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,109
like chance encounter and then you fall
in love with the person like I don't

2838
00:55:09,109 --> 00:55:09,119
in love with the person like I don't
 

2839
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,329
in love with the person like I don't
know how a dating app can can do that so

2840
00:55:11,329 --> 00:55:11,339
know how a dating app can can do that so
 

2841
00:55:11,339 --> 00:55:13,069
know how a dating app can can do that so
it has to be a little bit of Randomness

2842
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:13,079
it has to be a little bit of Randomness
 

2843
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:14,450
it has to be a little bit of Randomness
Maybe

2844
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:14,460
Maybe
 

2845
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:20,030
Maybe
every 10th match is just a you know

2846
00:55:20,030 --> 00:55:20,040
every 10th match is just a you know
 

2847
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:22,309
every 10th match is just a you know
yeah somebody that the algorithm

2848
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:22,319
yeah somebody that the algorithm
 

2849
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,410
yeah somebody that the algorithm
wouldn't have necessarily recommended

2850
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:24,420
wouldn't have necessarily recommended
 

2851
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:27,049
wouldn't have necessarily recommended
but it's it allows for a little bit of

2852
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:27,059
but it's it allows for a little bit of
 

2853
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:29,690
but it's it allows for a little bit of
well it can also you know it can also

2854
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:29,700
well it can also you know it can also
 

2855
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,329
well it can also you know it can also
trick you into thinking it sounded to be

2856
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:32,339
trick you into thinking it sounded to be
 

2857
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:35,930
trick you into thinking it sounded to be
by like somehow showing you a tweet of a

2858
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:35,940
by like somehow showing you a tweet of a
 

2859
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,849
by like somehow showing you a tweet of a
person

2860
00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:36,859
person
 

2861
00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:39,109
person
that he thinks you'll match well with

2862
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,119
that he thinks you'll match well with
 

2863
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,609
that he thinks you'll match well with
but do it accidentally as part of

2864
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:40,619
but do it accidentally as part of
 

2865
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:42,470
but do it accidentally as part of
another search right and like you just

2866
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:42,480
another search right and like you just
 

2867
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,930
another search right and like you just
notice it like and then you get it you

2868
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:44,940
notice it like and then you get it you
 

2869
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,430
notice it like and then you get it you
go down a rabbit hole and you connect

2870
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:46,440
go down a rabbit hole and you connect
 

2871
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,670
go down a rabbit hole and you connect
them in outside the app to like so you

2872
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
them in outside the app to like so you
 

2873
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,870
them in outside the app to like so you
connect with this person outside the

2874
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:50,880
connect with this person outside the
 

2875
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,609
connect with this person outside the
house somehow so it's just it creates

2876
00:55:52,609 --> 00:55:52,619
house somehow so it's just it creates
 

2877
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:54,410
house somehow so it's just it creates
that moment of meeting

2878
00:55:54,410 --> 00:55:54,420
that moment of meeting
 

2879
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,790
that moment of meeting
um of course you have to think of from

2880
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:55,800
um of course you have to think of from
 

2881
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,530
um of course you have to think of from
an app perspective how you can turn that

2882
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:57,540
an app perspective how you can turn that
 

2883
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,470
an app perspective how you can turn that
into a business but I think ultimately a

2884
00:56:00,470 --> 00:56:00,480
into a business but I think ultimately a
 

2885
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,410
into a business but I think ultimately a
business that helps people find love in

2886
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:03,420
business that helps people find love in
 

2887
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:05,809
business that helps people find love in
any way like that's what Apple was about

2888
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:05,819
any way like that's what Apple was about
 

2889
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:07,609
any way like that's what Apple was about
create products that people love right

2890
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:07,619
create products that people love right

that's beautiful I mean that's you got
 

2893
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:12,230
that's beautiful I mean that's you got
to make money somehow right if you help

2894
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
to make money somehow right if you help
 

2895
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,750
to make money somehow right if you help
people fall in love

often will optimize

2908
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:26,579
often will optimize
 

2909
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:29,329
often will optimize
for something else than love it's a

2910
00:56:29,329 --> 00:56:29,339
for something else than love it's a
 

2911
00:56:29,339 --> 00:56:31,069
for something else than love it's a
single social networks they optimize for

2912
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:31,079
single social networks they optimize for
 

2913
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:33,049
single social networks they optimize for
engagement right as opposed to like a

2914
00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:33,059
engagement right as opposed to like a
 

2915
00:56:33,059 --> 00:56:35,270
engagement right as opposed to like a
deep meaningful connection

2916
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:35,280
deep meaningful connection
 

2917
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,069
deep meaningful connection
um that's ultimately ground in like

2918
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:37,079
um that's ultimately ground in like
 

2919
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:39,170
um that's ultimately ground in like
personal growth you as a human being

2920
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:39,180
personal growth you as a human being
 

2921

growing and all that kind of stuff
 

2923
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,349
growing and all that kind of stuff
um let me do like a pivot to a dark

2924
00:56:44,349 --> 00:56:44,359
um let me do like a pivot to a dark
 

2925
00:56:44,359 --> 00:56:47,809
um let me do like a pivot to a dark

00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:30,599
really really sad story and it and it
 

2963
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,829
really really sad story and it and it
and it highlights what I believe is a

2964
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:33,839
and it highlights what I believe is a
 

2965
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:35,569
and it highlights what I believe is a
it's a real problem in our world today

2966
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:35,579
it's a real problem in our world today
 

2967
00:57:35,579 --> 00:57:37,549
it's a real problem in our world today
it's it's an empathy Christ

2968
00:57:37,549 --> 00:57:37,559
it's it's an empathy Christ
 

2969
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,710
it's it's an empathy Christ
yeah we're living through an empathy

2970
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:39,720
yeah we're living through an empathy
 

2971
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,190
yeah we're living through an empathy
crisis and crisis yeah yeah and

2972
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
crisis and crisis yeah yeah and
 

2973
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,349
crisis and crisis yeah yeah and
and I mean we've we've talked about this

2974
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
and I mean we've we've talked about this
 

2975
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:46,670
and I mean we've we've talked about this
throughout our conversation we

2976
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:46,680
throughout our conversation we
 

2977
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,870
throughout our conversation we
dehumanized each other and unfortunately

2978
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:49,880
dehumanized each other and unfortunately
 

2979
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,730
dehumanized each other and unfortunately
yes technology is bringing us together

2980
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:52,740
yes technology is bringing us together
 

2981
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:55,250
yes technology is bringing us together
but in a way it's just dehumanized it's

2982
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:55,260
but in a way it's just dehumanized it's
 

2983
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:57,950
but in a way it's just dehumanized it's
creating this like

2984
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:57,960
creating this like
 

2985
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:00,109
creating this like
yeah dehumanizing of the other and I

2986
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:00,119
yeah dehumanizing of the other and I
 

2987
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:02,630
yeah dehumanizing of the other and I
think that's a huge problem

2988
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:02,640
think that's a huge problem
 

2989
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,910
think that's a huge problem
the good news is I think solution the

2990
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:04,920
the good news is I think solution the
 

2991
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,130
the good news is I think solution the
solution could be Technology based like

2992
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:07,140
solution could be Technology based like
 

2993
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:09,349
solution could be Technology based like
I think if we rethink the way we design

2994
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
I think if we rethink the way we design
 

2995
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:12,349
I think if we rethink the way we design
and deploy our Technologies we can solve

2996
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:12,359
and deploy our Technologies we can solve
 

2997
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:14,210
and deploy our Technologies we can solve
parts of this problem but I worry about

2998
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:14,220
parts of this problem but I worry about
 

2999
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,130
parts of this problem but I worry about
it I mean even with my son

3000
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:16,140
it I mean even with my son
 

3001
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:19,069
it I mean even with my son
a lot of his interactions are

3002
00:58:19,069 --> 00:58:19,079
a lot of his interactions are
 

3003
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,049
a lot of his interactions are
computer mediated

3004
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:21,059
computer mediated
 

3005
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:24,109
computer mediated
and I just questioned what that's doing

3006
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:24,119
and I just questioned what that's doing
 

3007
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:26,990
and I just questioned what that's doing
to his empathy skills and you know his

3008
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:27,000
to his empathy skills and you know his
 

3009
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,030
to his empathy skills and you know his
ability to really connect with people so

3010
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
ability to really connect with people so
 

3011
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,630
ability to really connect with people so
do you think

3012
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640

 

3013
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,309

you think it's not possible to form

3014
00:58:34,309 --> 00:58:34,319
you think it's not possible to form
 

3015
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:38,569
you think it's not possible to form
empathy through the digital medium

3016
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:38,579
empathy through the digital medium
 

3017
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:40,670
empathy through the digital medium
I think it is

3018
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:40,680
I think it is
 

3019
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,309
I think it is
we have to be thoughtful about because

3020
00:58:43,309 --> 00:58:43,319
we have to be thoughtful about because
 

3021
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,710
we have to be thoughtful about because
the way the way we engage face to face

3022
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:45,720
the way the way we engage face to face
 

3023
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,510
the way the way we engage face to face
which is what we're doing right now

3024
00:58:47,510 --> 00:58:47,520
which is what we're doing right now
 

3025
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,430
which is what we're doing right now
right there's the the non-verbal signals

3026
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
right there's the the non-verbal signals
 

3027
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,809
right there's the the non-verbal signals
which are a majority of how we

3028
00:58:50,809 --> 00:58:50,819
which are a majority of how we
 

3029
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,150
which are a majority of how we
communicate it's like 90 of how we

3030
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:53,160
communicate it's like 90 of how we
 

3031
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,910
communicate it's like 90 of how we
communicate is your facial expressions

3032
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
communicate is your facial expressions
 

3033
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,650
communicate is your facial expressions
you know I'm saying something and you're

3034
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:57,660
you know I'm saying something and you're
 

3035
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,809
you know I'm saying something and you're
nodding your head now and that creates a

3036
00:58:59,809 --> 00:58:59,819
nodding your head now and that creates a
 

3037
00:58:59,819 --> 00:59:02,569
nodding your head now and that creates a
feedback loop and and if you break that

3038
00:59:02,569 --> 00:59:02,579
feedback loop and and if you break that
 

3039
00:59:02,579 --> 00:59:06,170
feedback loop and and if you break that
and now I have anxiety about it

3040
00:59:06,170 --> 00:59:06,180
and now I have anxiety about it
 

3041
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:07,910
and now I have anxiety about it
relax

3059
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,309
because it might be at the wrong time

especially when you say mean things in
person you get to see the pain of the

3072
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:44,099
person you get to see the pain of the
 

3073
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:45,770
person you get to see the pain of the
other person but if you're tweeting it

3074
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:45,780
other person but if you're tweeting it
 

3075
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:47,329
other person but if you're tweeting it
at a person and you have no idea how

3076
00:59:47,329 --> 00:59:47,339
at a person and you have no idea how
 

3077
00:59:47,339 --> 00:59:49,190
at a person and you have no idea how
it's gonna land you're more likely to do

3078
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:49,200
it's gonna land you're more likely to do
 

3079
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:50,870
it's gonna land you're more likely to do
that on social media than you are in

3080
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:50,880
that on social media than you are in
 

3081
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,809
that on social media than you are in
face-to-face conversations so

3082
00:59:53,809 --> 00:59:53,819
face-to-face conversations so
 

3083
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,609
face-to-face conversations so
um I mean what do you think is more

00:59:55,609 --> 00:59:55,619
um I mean what do you think is more
 

3085
00:59:55,619 --> 00:59:58,970
um I mean what do you think is more
important

3086
00:59:58,970 --> 00:59:58,980

 

3087
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:03,770

EQ or IQ EQ being emotional intelligence

3088
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:03,780
EQ or IQ EQ being emotional intelligence
 

3089
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:07,630
EQ or IQ EQ being emotional intelligence
in terms of uh in what makes us human

3090
01:00:07,630 --> 01:00:07,640
in terms of uh in what makes us human
 

3091
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,490
in terms of uh in what makes us human
I think emotional intelligence is what

3092
01:00:10,490 --> 01:00:10,500
I think emotional intelligence is what
 

3093
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,309
I think emotional intelligence is what
makes us human it's it it's how we

3094
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:13,319
makes us human it's it it's how we
 

3095
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,470
makes us human it's it it's how we
connect with one another it's how we

3096
01:00:15,470 --> 01:00:15,480
connect with one another it's how we
 

3097
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,109
connect with one another it's how we
build trust it's how

3098
01:00:18,109 --> 01:00:18,119
build trust it's how
 

3099
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,270
build trust it's how
we make decisions right like your

3100
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:20,280
we make decisions right like your
 

3101
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,349
we make decisions right like your
emotions

3102
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,359
emotions
 

3103
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,910
emotions
Drive

3104
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:22,920
Drive
 

3105
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,950
Drive
kind of what you had for breakfast but

3106
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
kind of what you had for breakfast but
 

3107
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,809
kind of what you had for breakfast but
also where you decide to live and what

3108
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:26,819
also where you decide to live and what
 

3109
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:28,789
also where you decide to live and what
you want to do for the rest of your life

3110
01:00:28,789 --> 01:00:28,799
you want to do for the rest of your life
 

3111
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:29,690
you want to do for the rest of your life
so

3112
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:29,700
so
 

3113
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,510
so
I think emotions are underrated

3114
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:32,520
I think emotions are underrated
 

3115
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,030
I think emotions are underrated
um but so emotional intelligence isn't

3116
01:00:35,030 --> 01:00:35,040
um but so emotional intelligence isn't
 

3117
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,170
um but so emotional intelligence isn't
just about

3118
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:36,180
just about
 

3119
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:38,809
just about
the effective expression of your own

3120
01:00:38,809 --> 01:00:38,819
the effective expression of your own
 

3121
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:40,849
the effective expression of your own
emotions it's about a sensitivity and

3122
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:40,859
emotions it's about a sensitivity and
 

3123
01:00:40,859 --> 01:00:43,430
emotions it's about a sensitivity and
empathy to other people's emotions and

3124
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:43,440
empathy to other people's emotions and
 

3125
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,650
empathy to other people's emotions and
that sort of being able to effectively

3126
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:45,660
that sort of being able to effectively
 

3127
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,930
that sort of being able to effectively
engage in the dance of emotions with

3128
01:00:47,930 --> 01:00:47,940
engage in the dance of emotions with
 

3129
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:49,370
engage in the dance of emotions with
other people

3130
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:49,380
other people
 

3131
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:54,230
other people
I like that

3132
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:54,240

 

3133
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,789

thinking about it as a dance because it

3134
01:00:55,789 --> 01:00:55,799
thinking about it as a dance because it
 

3135
01:00:55,799 --> 01:00:57,650
thinking about it as a dance because it
is really about that it's about sensing

3136
01:00:57,650 --> 01:00:57,660
is really about that it's about sensing
 

3137
01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,450
is really about that it's about sensing
what state the other person's in and

3138
01:00:59,450 --> 01:00:59,460
what state the other person's in and
 

3139
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,210
what state the other person's in and
using that information to decide on how

3140
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:02,220
using that information to decide on how
 

3141
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,430
using that information to decide on how
you're going to react

3142
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:04,440
you're going to react
 

3143
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,390
you're going to react
um

3144
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:05,400
um
 

3145
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,250
um
and I think it can be very powerful like

3146
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,260
and I think it can be very powerful like
 

3147
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:10,250
and I think it can be very powerful like
people who are the best most persuaded

3148
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:10,260
people who are the best most persuaded
 

3149
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,670
people who are the best most persuaded
most persuasive leaders in the world tap

3150
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
most persuasive leaders in the world tap
 

3151
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:14,690
most persuasive leaders in the world tap
into

3152
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:14,700
into
 

3153
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,150
into
you know they have if you have higher EQ

3154
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:17,160
you know they have if you have higher EQ
 

3155
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:18,950
you know they have if you have higher EQ
you're more likely to be able to

3156
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
you're more likely to be able to
 

3157
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,870
you're more likely to be able to
motivate people to change their

3158
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
motivate people to change their
 

3159
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,950
motivate people to change their
behaviors

3160
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:21,960
behaviors
 

3161
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,390
behaviors
so um

3162
01:01:23,390 --> 01:01:23,400
so um
 

3163
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,789
so um
so it can be very powerful at a more

3164
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:25,799
so it can be very powerful at a more
 

3165
01:01:25,799 --> 01:01:28,010
so it can be very powerful at a more
kind of technical maybe philosophical

3166
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:28,020
kind of technical maybe philosophical
 

3167
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:29,150
kind of technical maybe philosophical
level

3168
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:29,160
level
 

3169
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,049
level
you've written that emotion is universal

3170
01:01:32,049 --> 01:01:32,059
you've written that emotion is universal
 

3171
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:34,730
you've written that emotion is universal
it seems that

3172
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:34,740
it seems that
 

3173
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,069
it seems that
sort of like Chomsky says language is

3174
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:37,079
sort of like Chomsky says language is
 

3175
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:38,930
sort of like Chomsky says language is
universal there's a bunch of other stuff

3176
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:38,940
universal there's a bunch of other stuff
 

3177
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:41,390
universal there's a bunch of other stuff
like cognition Consciousness seems a lot

3178
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:41,400
like cognition Consciousness seems a lot
 

3179
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:44,990
like cognition Consciousness seems a lot
of us have these aspects so the human

3180
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:45,000
of us have these aspects so the human
 

3181
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,589
of us have these aspects so the human
mind generates all this and so what do

3182
01:01:48,589 --> 01:01:48,599
mind generates all this and so what do
 

3183
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:50,329
mind generates all this and so what do
you think is the

3184
01:01:50,329 --> 01:01:50,339
you think is the
 

3185
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:52,370
you think is the
they all seem to be like Echoes of the

3186
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:52,380
they all seem to be like Echoes of the
 

3187
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,329
they all seem to be like Echoes of the
same thing

3188
01:01:53,329 --> 01:01:53,339
same thing
 

3189
01:01:53,339 --> 01:01:56,809
same thing
uh what do you think emotion is exactly

3190
01:01:56,809 --> 01:01:56,819
uh what do you think emotion is exactly
 

3191
01:01:56,819 --> 01:01:59,089
uh what do you think emotion is exactly
like how deep does it run is it a

3192
01:01:59,089 --> 01:01:59,099
like how deep does it run is it a
 

3193
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:01,849
like how deep does it run is it a
surface level thing that we display to

3194
01:02:01,849 --> 01:02:01,859
surface level thing that we display to
 

3195
01:02:01,859 --> 01:02:03,829
surface level thing that we display to
each other is it just another form of

3196
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:03,839
each other is it just another form of
 

3197
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,170
each other is it just another form of
language or something deep within

3198
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:06,180
language or something deep within
 

3199
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,690
language or something deep within
I think it's it's really deep it's how

3200
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:08,700
I think it's it's really deep it's how
 

3201
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,270
I think it's it's really deep it's how
you know we started with memory I think

3202
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:11,280
you know we started with memory I think
 

3203
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:14,569
you know we started with memory I think
emotions play a really important

3204
01:02:14,569 --> 01:02:14,579
emotions play a really important
 

3205
01:02:14,579 --> 01:02:17,030
emotions play a really important
yeah the emotions play a very important

3206
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:17,040
yeah the emotions play a very important
 

3207
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,130
yeah the emotions play a very important
role in how we encode memories right our

3208
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:19,140
role in how we encode memories right our
 

3209
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,990
role in how we encode memories right our
our memories are often encoded almost

3210
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:21,000
our memories are often encoded almost
 

3211
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,569
our memories are often encoded almost
indexed by emotions yeah

3212
01:02:23,569 --> 01:02:23,579
indexed by emotions yeah
 

3213
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:24,589
indexed by emotions yeah
um

3214
01:02:24,589 --> 01:02:24,599
um
 

3215
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:28,309
um
yeah it it said this core of how you

3216
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:28,319
yeah it it said this core of how you
 

3217
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:30,770
yeah it it said this core of how you
know our decision-making engine is also

3218
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:30,780
know our decision-making engine is also
 

3219
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:33,049
know our decision-making engine is also
heavily influenced by our emotions so

3220
01:02:33,049 --> 01:02:33,059
heavily influenced by our emotions so
 

3221
01:02:33,059 --> 01:02:35,210
heavily influenced by our emotions so
emotions is part of cognition it's

3222
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:35,220
emotions is part of cognition it's
 

3223
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,130
emotions is part of cognition it's
totally it's intermixed into the whole

3224
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:37,140
totally it's intermixed into the whole
 

3225
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,650
totally it's intermixed into the whole
thing yes absolutely and in fact when

3226
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:39,660
thing yes absolutely and in fact when
 

3227
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,230
thing yes absolutely and in fact when
you take it away people are unable to

3228
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
you take it away people are unable to
 

3229
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,910
you take it away people are unable to
make decisions they're really paralyzed

3230
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:43,920
make decisions they're really paralyzed
 

3231
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,250
make decisions they're really paralyzed
like they can't go about their daily or

3232
01:02:46,250 --> 01:02:46,260
like they can't go about their daily or
 

3233
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:47,809
like they can't go about their daily or
their you know personal or professional

3234
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:47,819
their you know personal or professional
 

3235
01:02:47,819 --> 01:02:49,849
their you know personal or professional
lives so

3236
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:49,859
lives so
 

3237
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:52,789
lives so
um it does seem like there's probably

3238
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
um it does seem like there's probably
 

3239
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:55,450
um it does seem like there's probably
some interesting

3240
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:55,460
some interesting
 

3241
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,770
some interesting
interweaving of emotion and

3242
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:57,780
interweaving of emotion and
 

3243
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,109
interweaving of emotion and
Consciousness I wonder if it's possible

3244
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:00,119
Consciousness I wonder if it's possible
 

3245
01:03:00,119 --> 01:03:02,510
Consciousness I wonder if it's possible
to have like if they're next door

3246
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:02,520
to have like if they're next door
 

3247
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:04,609
to have like if they're next door
neighbor somehow or if they're actually

3248
01:03:04,609 --> 01:03:04,619
neighbor somehow or if they're actually
 

3249
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,309
neighbor somehow or if they're actually
uh flatmates

3250
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:07,319
uh flatmates
 

3251
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:09,289
uh flatmates
I don't I don't

3252
01:03:09,289 --> 01:03:09,299
I don't I don't
 

3253
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,049
I don't I don't
it feels like the the hard problem of

3254
01:03:12,049 --> 01:03:12,059
it feels like the the hard problem of
 

3255
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:13,970
it feels like the the hard problem of
Consciousness where it's some it feels

3256
01:03:13,970 --> 01:03:13,980
Consciousness where it's some it feels
 

3257
01:03:13,980 --> 01:03:15,650
Consciousness where it's some it feels
like something to experience the thing

3258
01:03:15,650 --> 01:03:15,660
like something to experience the thing
 

3259
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:20,030
like something to experience the thing
like red feels like red and it's you

3260
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:20,040
like red feels like red and it's you
 

3261
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,430
like red feels like red and it's you
know when you eat a mango sweet The

3262
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:22,440
know when you eat a mango sweet The
 

3263
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,130
know when you eat a mango sweet The
Taste the the the the sweetness that it

3264
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:25,140
Taste the the the the sweetness that it
 

3265
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,930
Taste the the the the sweetness that it
feels like something to experience that

3266
01:03:26,930 --> 01:03:26,940
feels like something to experience that
 

3267
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:28,370
feels like something to experience that
sweetness

3268
01:03:28,370 --> 01:03:28,380
sweetness
 

3269
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:33,230
sweetness
that whatever generates emotions

3270
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:33,240
that whatever generates emotions
 

3271
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,750
that whatever generates emotions
but then like I feel like emotion is

3272
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:35,760
but then like I feel like emotion is
 

3273
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,089
but then like I feel like emotion is
part of communication it's very much

3274
01:03:38,089 --> 01:03:38,099
part of communication it's very much
 

3275
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:40,609
part of communication it's very much
about communication and then

3276
01:03:40,609 --> 01:03:40,619
about communication and then
 

3277
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:44,150
about communication and then
that means it's also deeply connected to

3278
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
that means it's also deeply connected to
 

3279
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,010
that means it's also deeply connected to
language

3280
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,020
language
 

3281
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,470
language
but then probably

3282
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:48,480
but then probably
 

3283
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,750
but then probably
human intelligence is deeply connected

3284
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:50,760
human intelligence is deeply connected
 

3285
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,309
human intelligence is deeply connected
to the collective intelligence between

3286
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:52,319
to the collective intelligence between
 

3287
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:54,289
to the collective intelligence between
humans it's not just a standalone thing

3288
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:54,299
humans it's not just a standalone thing
 

3289
01:03:54,299 --> 01:03:56,150
humans it's not just a standalone thing
so the whole thing is really connected

3290
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
so the whole thing is really connected
 

3291
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,789
so the whole thing is really connected
so emotions connected to language

3292
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
so emotions connected to language
 

3293
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,589
so emotions connected to language
language is connected to intelligence

3294
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:00,599
language is connected to intelligence
 

3295
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,870
language is connected to intelligence
and then intelligence connect to

3296
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:02,880
and then intelligence connect to
 

3297
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,430
and then intelligence connect to
Consciousness and Consciousness is

3298
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:04,440
Consciousness and Consciousness is
 

3299
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,289
Consciousness and Consciousness is
collect connected to emotion the whole

3300
01:04:06,289 --> 01:04:06,299
collect connected to emotion the whole
 

3301
01:04:06,299 --> 01:04:09,770
collect connected to emotion the whole
thing is that the is a beautiful mess so

3302
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:09,780
thing is that the is a beautiful mess so
 

3303
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:12,470
thing is that the is a beautiful mess so
uh

3304
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480

 

3305
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,109

um can I comment on the emotions being a

3306
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:15,119
um can I comment on the emotions being a
 

3307
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:16,430
um can I comment on the emotions being a
communication mechanic because I think

3308
01:04:16,430 --> 01:04:16,440
communication mechanic because I think
 

3309
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:19,490
communication mechanic because I think
there are two facets of

3310
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:19,500
there are two facets of
 

3311
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,670
there are two facets of
of of our emotional experiences

3312
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:22,680
of of our emotional experiences
 

3313
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:24,890
of of our emotional experiences
um one is communication right like we

3314
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:24,900
um one is communication right like we
 

3315
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,270
um one is communication right like we
use emotions

3316
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:26,280
use emotions
 

3317
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,430
use emotions
for example facial expressions or other

3318
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:28,440
for example facial expressions or other
 

3319
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,530
for example facial expressions or other
nonverbal cues to connect with other

3320
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:30,540
nonverbal cues to connect with other
 

3321
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,049
nonverbal cues to connect with other
human beings and with other

3322
01:04:33,049 --> 01:04:33,059
human beings and with other
 

3323
01:04:33,059 --> 01:04:35,750
human beings and with other
beings in the world right

3324
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:35,760
beings in the world right
 

3325
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:36,530
beings in the world right
um

3326
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:36,540
um
 

3327
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,829
um
but even if it's not a communication

3328
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:39,839
but even if it's not a communication
 

3329
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:42,349
but even if it's not a communication
context we still experience emotions and

3330
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:42,359
context we still experience emotions and
 

3331
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:44,750
context we still experience emotions and
we still process emotions and we still

3332
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:44,760
we still process emotions and we still
 

3333
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,329
we still process emotions and we still
leverage emotions to make decisions and

3334
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:47,339
leverage emotions to make decisions and
 

3335
01:04:47,339 --> 01:04:49,789
leverage emotions to make decisions and
to learn and you know to experience life

3336
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:49,799
to learn and you know to experience life
 

3337
01:04:49,799 --> 01:04:50,870
to learn and you know to experience life
so

3338
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
so
 

3339
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,270
so
it isn't always just about communication

3340
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:53,280
it isn't always just about communication
 

3341
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,549
it isn't always just about communication
and we learned that very early on in our

3342
01:04:55,549 --> 01:04:55,559
and we learned that very early on in our
 

3343
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:59,150
and we learned that very early on in our
in kind of our work at affectiva one of

3344
01:04:59,150 --> 01:04:59,160
in kind of our work at affectiva one of
 

3345
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,890
in kind of our work at affectiva one of
the very first applications we brought

3346
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:00,900
the very first applications we brought
 

3347
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,450
the very first applications we brought
to Market was understanding how people

3348
01:05:02,450 --> 01:05:02,460
to Market was understanding how people
 

3349
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,190
to Market was understanding how people
respond to content right so if they're

3350
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:04,200
respond to content right so if they're
 

3351
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:05,990
respond to content right so if they're
watching this video of ours like are

3352
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
watching this video of ours like are
 

3353
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,030
watching this video of ours like are
they interested are they inspired are

3354
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:08,040
they interested are they inspired are
 

3355
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,890
they interested are they inspired are
they bored to death and so we watch

3356
01:05:09,890 --> 01:05:09,900
they bored to death and so we watch
 

3357
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,450
they bored to death and so we watch
their facial expressions

3358
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:11,460
their facial expressions
 

3359
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,670
their facial expressions
and we had we weren't sure if people

3360
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
and we had we weren't sure if people
 

3361
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:16,970
and we had we weren't sure if people
would express any emotions if they were

3362
01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:16,980
would express any emotions if they were
 

3363
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:18,589
would express any emotions if they were
sitting alone like if you're in your bed

3364
01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:18,599
sitting alone like if you're in your bed
 

3365
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:19,730
sitting alone like if you're in your bed
at night

3366
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:19,740
at night
 

3367
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:21,829
at night
watching a Netflix TV series would we

3368
01:05:21,829 --> 01:05:21,839
watching a Netflix TV series would we
 

3369
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,690
watching a Netflix TV series would we
still see any emotions on your face and

3370
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:23,700
still see any emotions on your face and
 

3371
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:25,609
still see any emotions on your face and
we were surprised that yes people still

3372
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:25,619
we were surprised that yes people still
 

3373
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:27,470
we were surprised that yes people still
emote even if they're alone even if

3374
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:27,480
emote even if they're alone even if
 

3375
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,390
emote even if they're alone even if
you're in your car driving around you're

3376
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:29,400
you're in your car driving around you're
 

3377
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,210
you're in your car driving around you're
singing along a song and you're joyful

3378
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:32,220
singing along a song and you're joyful
 

3379
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:34,430
singing along a song and you're joyful
we'll see these Expressions so it's not

3380
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:34,440
we'll see these Expressions so it's not
 

3381
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,109
we'll see these Expressions so it's not
just about communicating with another

3382
01:05:36,109 --> 01:05:36,119
just about communicating with another
 

3383
01:05:36,119 --> 01:05:39,109
just about communicating with another
person it sometimes really isn't just

3384
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,119
person it sometimes really isn't just
 

3385
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:42,170
person it sometimes really isn't just
about experiencing the world and first

3386
01:05:42,170 --> 01:05:42,180
about experiencing the world and first
 

3387
01:05:42,180 --> 01:05:44,569
about experiencing the world and first
of all I wonder if some of that is

3388
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:44,579
of all I wonder if some of that is
 

3389
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:47,750
of all I wonder if some of that is
because we develop our intelligence and

3390
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:47,760
because we develop our intelligence and
 

3391
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:50,329
because we develop our intelligence and
our emotional intelligence by

3392
01:05:50,329 --> 01:05:50,339
our emotional intelligence by
 

3393
01:05:50,339 --> 01:05:52,309
our emotional intelligence by
communicating with other humans and so

3394
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:52,319
communicating with other humans and so
 

3395
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,870
communicating with other humans and so
when other humans disappear from the

3396
01:05:53,870 --> 01:05:53,880
when other humans disappear from the
 

3397
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,910
when other humans disappear from the
picture was still kind of a virtual

3398
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920
picture was still kind of a virtual
 

3399
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,130
picture was still kind of a virtual
human the code still runs basically yeah

3400
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:58,140
human the code still runs basically yeah
 

3401
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,049
human the code still runs basically yeah
the code still runs and but you also

3402
01:06:00,049 --> 01:06:00,059
the code still runs and but you also
 

3403
01:06:00,059 --> 01:06:02,270
the code still runs and but you also
kind of you're still there's like

3404
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:02,280
kind of you're still there's like
 

3405
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,130
kind of you're still there's like
virtual humans you don't have to think

3406
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:04,140
virtual humans you don't have to think
 

3407
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:06,170
virtual humans you don't have to think
of it that way but there's a kind of

3408
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:06,180
of it that way but there's a kind of
 

3409
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:08,390
of it that way but there's a kind of
when you like chocolate

3410
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
when you like chocolate
 

3411
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,630
when you like chocolate
yeah like you're you're kind of

3412
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:11,640
yeah like you're you're kind of
 

3413
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,510
yeah like you're you're kind of
chuckling to a virtual human I mean it's

3414
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:14,520
chuckling to a virtual human I mean it's
 

3415
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,170
chuckling to a virtual human I mean it's
possible that the the code is the has to

3416
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:18,180
possible that the the code is the has to
 

3417
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:20,870
possible that the the code is the has to
have another human uh

3418
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:20,880
have another human uh
 

3419
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:24,289
have another human uh
there because if you just grow up alone

3420
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:24,299
there because if you just grow up alone
 

3421
01:06:24,299 --> 01:06:26,450
there because if you just grow up alone
I wonder if emotion will still be there

3422
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:26,460
I wonder if emotion will still be there
 

3423
01:06:26,460 --> 01:06:30,289
I wonder if emotion will still be there
in this visual form so I yeah I I wonder

3424
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:30,299
in this visual form so I yeah I I wonder
 

3425
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:34,190
in this visual form so I yeah I I wonder
but anyway the uh what can you tell

3426
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:34,200
but anyway the uh what can you tell
 

3427
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,430
but anyway the uh what can you tell
from the human face about what's going

3428
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
from the human face about what's going
 

3429
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,589
from the human face about what's going
on inside so that's the problem that

3430
01:06:39,589 --> 01:06:39,599
on inside so that's the problem that
 

3431
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,849
on inside so that's the problem that
affectiva first tackled which is using

3432
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:43,859
affectiva first tackled which is using
 

3433
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:46,190
affectiva first tackled which is using
computer vision using machine learning

3434
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:46,200
computer vision using machine learning
 

3435
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,829
computer vision using machine learning
to try to detect stuff about the human

3436
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:48,839
to try to detect stuff about the human
 

3437
01:06:48,839 --> 01:06:51,410
to try to detect stuff about the human
face as many things as possible and

3438
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:51,420
face as many things as possible and
 

3439
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,529
face as many things as possible and
convert them into a prediction of

3440
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:54,539
convert them into a prediction of
 

3441
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:57,589
convert them into a prediction of
categories of emotion anger happiness

3442
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:57,599
categories of emotion anger happiness
 

3443
01:06:57,599 --> 01:06:59,569
categories of emotion anger happiness
all that kind of stuff how hard is that

3444
01:06:59,569 --> 01:06:59,579
all that kind of stuff how hard is that
 

3445
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:00,470
all that kind of stuff how hard is that
problem

3446
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:00,480
problem
 

3447
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:02,450
problem
extremely hard it's very very hard

3448
01:07:02,450 --> 01:07:02,460
extremely hard it's very very hard
 

3449
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,370
extremely hard it's very very hard
because there is no one-to-one mapping

3450
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:04,380
because there is no one-to-one mapping
 

3451
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,589
because there is no one-to-one mapping
between

3452
01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:05,599
between
 

3453
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,150
between
a facial expression and your internal

3454
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:08,160
a facial expression and your internal
 

3455
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,069
a facial expression and your internal
State there just isn't there's this

3456
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:10,079
State there just isn't there's this
 

3457
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:12,170
State there just isn't there's this
oversimplification of the problem where

3458
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:12,180
oversimplification of the problem where
 

3459
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,329
oversimplification of the problem where
it's something like if you are smiling

3460
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:14,339
it's something like if you are smiling
 

3461
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:16,370
it's something like if you are smiling
then you're happy if you do a brow

3462
01:07:16,370 --> 01:07:16,380
then you're happy if you do a brow
 

3463
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:18,289
then you're happy if you do a brow
Furrow then you're angry if you do an

3464
01:07:18,289 --> 01:07:18,299
Furrow then you're angry if you do an
 

3465
01:07:18,299 --> 01:07:20,630
Furrow then you're angry if you do an
eyebrow race then you're surprised and

3466
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
eyebrow race then you're surprised and
 

3467
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,670
eyebrow race then you're surprised and
just think about it for a moment you

3468
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:22,680
just think about it for a moment you
 

3469
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,289
just think about it for a moment you
could be smiling for a whole host of

3470
01:07:24,289 --> 01:07:24,299
could be smiling for a whole host of
 

3471
01:07:24,299 --> 01:07:26,569
could be smiling for a whole host of
reasons you could also be happy and not

3472
01:07:26,569 --> 01:07:26,579
reasons you could also be happy and not
 

3473
01:07:26,579 --> 01:07:28,789
reasons you could also be happy and not
be smiling right

3474
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
be smiling right
 

3475
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,950
be smiling right
um you could follow your eyebrows

3476
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
um you could follow your eyebrows
 

3477
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,710
um you could follow your eyebrows
because you're angry or you're confused

3478
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:33,720
because you're angry or you're confused
 

3479
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,390
because you're angry or you're confused
about something or you're constipated

3480
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:35,400
about something or you're constipated
 

3481
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:36,710
about something or you're constipated
yeah

3482
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:36,720
yeah
 

3483
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,049
yeah
um so I think this over simplistic

3484
01:07:39,049 --> 01:07:39,059
um so I think this over simplistic
 

3485
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,329
um so I think this over simplistic
approach to inferring emotion from a

3486
01:07:41,329 --> 01:07:41,339
approach to inferring emotion from a
 

3487
01:07:41,339 --> 01:07:43,450
approach to inferring emotion from a
facial expression is really dangerous

3488
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:43,460
facial expression is really dangerous
 

3489
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:45,770
facial expression is really dangerous
the solution

3490
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:45,780
the solution
 

3491
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:48,829
the solution
is to incorporate as many contextual

3492
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:48,839
is to incorporate as many contextual
 

3493
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:51,289
is to incorporate as many contextual
signals as you can right so if for

3494
01:07:51,289 --> 01:07:51,299
signals as you can right so if for
 

3495
01:07:51,299 --> 01:07:54,710
signals as you can right so if for
example I'm driving a car and you can

3496
01:07:54,710 --> 01:07:54,720
example I'm driving a car and you can
 

3497
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,870
example I'm driving a car and you can
see me like nodding my head and my eyes

3498
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
see me like nodding my head and my eyes
 

3499
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,910
see me like nodding my head and my eyes
are closed and the blinking grade is

3500
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
are closed and the blinking grade is
 

3501
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:01,430
are closed and the blinking grade is
changing I'm probably falling asleep on

3502
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
changing I'm probably falling asleep on
 

3503
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,589
changing I'm probably falling asleep on
at the wheel right it doesn't because

3504
01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:03,599
at the wheel right it doesn't because
 

3505
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:05,510
at the wheel right it doesn't because
you know the context you understand what

3506
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
you know the context you understand what
 

3507
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,250
you know the context you understand what
the person is doing

3508
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:07,260
the person is doing
 

3509
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:09,950
the person is doing
so I think or add additional channels

3510
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:09,960
so I think or add additional channels
 

3511
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,289
so I think or add additional channels
like voice or gestures or even

3512
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:12,299
like voice or gestures or even
 

3513
01:08:12,299 --> 01:08:14,930
like voice or gestures or even
physiological sensors

3514
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:14,940
physiological sensors
 

3515
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:16,789
physiological sensors
um but I think it's very dangerous to

3516
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
um but I think it's very dangerous to
 

3517
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:18,890
um but I think it's very dangerous to
just take this over simplistic approach

3518
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:18,900
just take this over simplistic approach
 

3519
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:22,070
just take this over simplistic approach
of yeah smile equals happy and if you're

3520
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
of yeah smile equals happy and if you're
 

3521
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,650
of yeah smile equals happy and if you're
able to in a high resolution way specify

3522
01:08:24,650 --> 01:08:24,660
able to in a high resolution way specify
 

3523
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:26,749
able to in a high resolution way specify
the context there's certain things that

3524
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:26,759
the context there's certain things that
 

3525
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:28,789
the context there's certain things that
are going to be somewhat reliable

3526
01:08:28,789 --> 01:08:28,799
are going to be somewhat reliable
 

3527
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,209
are going to be somewhat reliable
signals of something like drowsiness or

3528
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:32,219
signals of something like drowsiness or
 

3529
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:34,970
signals of something like drowsiness or
happiness or stuff like that I mean when

3530
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:34,980
happiness or stuff like that I mean when
 

3531
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,490
happiness or stuff like that I mean when
when people are watching Netflix that

3532
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:37,500
when people are watching Netflix that
 

3533
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,229
when people are watching Netflix that
problem

3534
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:39,239
problem
 

3535
01:08:39,239 --> 01:08:42,050
problem
that's a really compelling idea that you

3536
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:42,060
that's a really compelling idea that you
 

3537
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,269
that's a really compelling idea that you
can kind of at least in aggregate

3538
01:08:44,269 --> 01:08:44,279
can kind of at least in aggregate
 

3539
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,090
can kind of at least in aggregate
exactly highlight like which part was

3540
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:47,100
exactly highlight like which part was
 

3541
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,370
exactly highlight like which part was
boring which part was exciting how hard

3542
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:49,380
boring which part was exciting how hard
 

3543
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,650
boring which part was exciting how hard
was that problem

3544
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:51,660
was that problem
 

3545
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:54,110
was that problem
um that was on the scale of like

3546
01:08:54,110 --> 01:08:54,120
um that was on the scale of like
 

3547
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:56,390
um that was on the scale of like
difficulty I think that's some of one of

3548
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
difficulty I think that's some of one of
 

3549
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,070
difficulty I think that's some of one of
the easier problems to solve because

3550
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:58,080
the easier problems to solve because
 

3551
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,809
the easier problems to solve because
it's um

3552
01:08:59,809 --> 01:08:59,819
it's um
 

3553
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:01,729
it's um
um a relatively constrained environment

3554
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:01,739
um a relatively constrained environment
 

3555
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:03,709
um a relatively constrained environment
you have somebody sitting in front of

3556
01:09:03,709 --> 01:09:03,719
you have somebody sitting in front of
 

3557
01:09:03,719 --> 01:09:05,870
you have somebody sitting in front of
initially we started with like a device

3558
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:05,880
initially we started with like a device
 

3559
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,729
initially we started with like a device
in front of you like a laptop and then

3560
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:07,739
in front of you like a laptop and then
 

3561
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:10,010
in front of you like a laptop and then
we graduated to doing this on a mobile

3562
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:10,020
we graduated to doing this on a mobile
 

3563
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,470
we graduated to doing this on a mobile
phone which is a lot harder just because

3564
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:12,480
phone which is a lot harder just because
 

3565
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:13,970
phone which is a lot harder just because
of you know from a computer vision

3566
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:13,980
of you know from a computer vision
 

3567
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,470
of you know from a computer vision
perspective

3568
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:15,480
perspective
 

3569
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,570
perspective
profile view of the face can be a lot

3570
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:17,580
profile view of the face can be a lot
 

3571
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,970
profile view of the face can be a lot
more challenging we had to figure out

3572
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:19,980
more challenging we had to figure out
 

3573
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,530
more challenging we had to figure out
lighting conditions because usually

3574
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:21,540
lighting conditions because usually
 

3575
01:09:21,540 --> 01:09:23,689
lighting conditions because usually
people are watching content

3576
01:09:23,689 --> 01:09:23,699
people are watching content
 

3577
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:25,430
people are watching content
literally in their bedrooms at night

3578
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:25,440
literally in their bedrooms at night
 

3579
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,769
literally in their bedrooms at night
lights are dimmed

3580
01:09:27,769 --> 01:09:27,779
lights are dimmed
 

3581
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,990
lights are dimmed
um yes I mean if you're standing it's

3582
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
um yes I mean if you're standing it's
 

3583
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,570
um yes I mean if you're standing it's
probably going to be the uh looking up

3584
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:32,580
probably going to be the uh looking up
 

3585
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:35,510
probably going to be the uh looking up
the nostril view yeah and nobody looks

3586
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:35,520
the nostril view yeah and nobody looks
 

3587
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,390
the nostril view yeah and nobody looks
good at I've seen data sets from that

3588
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:38,400
good at I've seen data sets from that
 

3589
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:41,510
good at I've seen data sets from that
perspective it's like this is not a good

3590
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:41,520
perspective it's like this is not a good
 

3591
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:44,150
perspective it's like this is not a good
look for anyone uh or if you're laying

3592
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:44,160
look for anyone uh or if you're laying
 

3593
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,370
look for anyone uh or if you're laying
in bed at night what is it side view or

3594
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:46,380
in bed at night what is it side view or
 

3595
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,470
in bed at night what is it side view or
something right it's and you have your

3596
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:48,480
something right it's and you have your
 

3597
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:50,809
something right it's and you have your
faces like on a pillow actually I don't

3598
01:09:50,809 --> 01:09:50,819
faces like on a pillow actually I don't
 

3599
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:53,450
faces like on a pillow actually I don't
I would love to know have data

3600
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:53,460
I would love to know have data
 

3601
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:58,610
I would love to know have data
about uh like how people watch stuff in

3602
01:09:58,610 --> 01:09:58,620
about uh like how people watch stuff in
 

3603
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:00,229
about uh like how people watch stuff in
bed at night

3604
01:10:00,229 --> 01:10:00,239
bed at night
 

3605
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:03,410
bed at night
like do they prop their is it a pillow

3606
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:03,420
like do they prop their is it a pillow
 

3607
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:05,630
like do they prop their is it a pillow
the like I'm sure there's a lot of

3608
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:05,640
the like I'm sure there's a lot of
 

3609
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,430
the like I'm sure there's a lot of
interesting Dynamics right

3610
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:07,440
interesting Dynamics right
 

3611
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:09,110
interesting Dynamics right
from a health and well-being perspective

3612
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:09,120
from a health and well-being perspective
 

3613
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,910
from a health and well-being perspective
right like it's like oh you're already

3614
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:10,920
right like it's like oh you're already
 

3615
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,550
right like it's like oh you're already
machine learning perspective but yes but

3616
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:13,560
machine learning perspective but yes but
 

3617
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:14,930
machine learning perspective but yes but
also yeah yeah

3618
01:10:14,930 --> 01:10:14,940
also yeah yeah
 

3619
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,970
also yeah yeah
um yeah once you have that data you can

3620
01:10:16,970 --> 01:10:16,980
um yeah once you have that data you can
 

3621
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,830
um yeah once you have that data you can
start making all kinds of inference

3622
01:10:18,830 --> 01:10:18,840
start making all kinds of inference
 

3623
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,030
start making all kinds of inference
about health and stuff like that

3624
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:20,040
about health and stuff like that
 

3625
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,850
about health and stuff like that
interesting yeah there's a interesting

3626
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:22,860
interesting yeah there's a interesting
 

3627
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:26,330
interesting yeah there's a interesting
thing when I was at Google that we were

3628
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,340
thing when I was at Google that we were
 

3629
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:26,990
thing when I was at Google that we were
um

3630
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:27,000
um
 

3631
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,510
um
it's it's called active authentication

3632
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:29,520
it's it's called active authentication
 

3633
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,450
it's it's called active authentication
where you you want to be able to

3634
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:32,460
where you you want to be able to
 

3635
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,310
where you you want to be able to
unlock your phone without using a

3636
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:34,320
unlock your phone without using a
 

3637
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,430
unlock your phone without using a
password so it would it would face but

3638
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
password so it would it would face but
 

3639
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:39,770
password so it would it would face but
also other stuff like the way you take a

3640
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:39,780
also other stuff like the way you take a
 

3641
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:42,050
also other stuff like the way you take a
phone out of the pocket amazing so that

3642
01:10:42,050 --> 01:10:42,060
phone out of the pocket amazing so that
 

3643
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,229
phone out of the pocket amazing so that
kind of data to use the multimodal uh

3644
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:45,239
kind of data to use the multimodal uh
 

3645
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:46,610
kind of data to use the multimodal uh
with machine learning to be able to

3646
01:10:46,610 --> 01:10:46,620
with machine learning to be able to
 

3647
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:49,070
with machine learning to be able to
identify that it's you or likely to be

3648
01:10:49,070 --> 01:10:49,080
identify that it's you or likely to be
 

3649
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:51,470
identify that it's you or likely to be
you likely not to be you that allows you

3650
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
you likely not to be you that allows you
 

3651
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,850
you likely not to be you that allows you
to not always have to enter the password

3652
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:52,860
to not always have to enter the password
 

3653
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:55,610
to not always have to enter the password
that was the the idea but the funny

3654
01:10:55,610 --> 01:10:55,620
that was the the idea but the funny
 

3655
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,950
that was the the idea but the funny
thing about that is I just want to tell

3656
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:57,960
thing about that is I just want to tell
 

3657
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,810
thing about that is I just want to tell
a small anecdote is

3658
01:10:59,810 --> 01:10:59,820
a small anecdote is
 

3659
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,590
a small anecdote is
because it was all male engineers

3660
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:02,600
because it was all male engineers
 

3661
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:08,030
because it was all male engineers
uh except so there's my boss is uh uh

3662
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:08,040
uh except so there's my boss is uh uh
 

3663
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:10,550
uh except so there's my boss is uh uh
our boss who's still one of my favorite

3664
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:10,560
our boss who's still one of my favorite
 

3665
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,390
our boss who's still one of my favorite
humans was was a woman uh Regina Dugan

3666
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
humans was was a woman uh Regina Dugan
 

3667
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,669
humans was was a woman uh Regina Dugan
um oh my God I love her she's awesome

3668
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:16,679
um oh my God I love her she's awesome
 

3669
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:20,030
um oh my God I love her she's awesome
she's the best

3670
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:20,040

 

3671
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:20,750

um

3672
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:20,760
um
 

3673
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:24,050
um
so uh but anyway there was a there's one

3674
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:24,060
so uh but anyway there was a there's one
 

3675
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,149
so uh but anyway there was a there's one
female engine uh a brilliant female

3676
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:26,159
female engine uh a brilliant female
 

3677
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:27,830
female engine uh a brilliant female
engineer on the team and she was the one

3678
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:27,840
engineer on the team and she was the one
 

3679
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,169
engineer on the team and she was the one
that actually highlighted the fact that

3680
01:11:30,169 --> 01:11:30,179
that actually highlighted the fact that
 

3681
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,830
that actually highlighted the fact that
um women often don't have pockets

3682
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:32,840
um women often don't have pockets
 

3683
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:35,510
um women often don't have pockets
it was like well that was not even a

3684
01:11:35,510 --> 01:11:35,520
it was like well that was not even a
 

3685
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,689
it was like well that was not even a
category in the code of like wait a

3686
01:11:38,689 --> 01:11:38,699
category in the code of like wait a
 

3687
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:40,550
category in the code of like wait a
minute you can take the phone out of

3688
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:40,560
minute you can take the phone out of
 

3689
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,370
minute you can take the phone out of
some other place than your pocket so

3690
01:11:43,370 --> 01:11:43,380
some other place than your pocket so
 

3691
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:45,530
some other place than your pocket so
anyway that's a it's a funny thing when

3692
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:45,540
anyway that's a it's a funny thing when
 

3693
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:47,030
anyway that's a it's a funny thing when
you're concerning people laying in bed

3694
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:47,040
you're concerning people laying in bed
 

3695
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,189
you're concerning people laying in bed
watching a phone you have to consider if

3696
01:11:49,189 --> 01:11:49,199
watching a phone you have to consider if
 

3697
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:51,890
watching a phone you have to consider if
there you have to the you know uh

3698
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:51,900
there you have to the you know uh
 

3699
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,050
there you have to the you know uh
diversity in all its forms depending on

3700
01:11:54,050 --> 01:11:54,060
diversity in all its forms depending on
 

3701
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,370
diversity in all its forms depending on
the problem depending on the context

3702
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:55,380
the problem depending on the context
 

3703
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,530
the problem depending on the context
yeah actually this is like a very

3704
01:11:57,530 --> 01:11:57,540
yeah actually this is like a very
 

3705
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:59,630
yeah actually this is like a very
important I think this is you know you

3706
01:11:59,630 --> 01:11:59,640
important I think this is you know you
 

3707
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,890
important I think this is you know you
probably get this all the time like

3708
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:00,900
probably get this all the time like
 

3709
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:02,390
probably get this all the time like
people are worried that ai's going to

3710
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:02,400
people are worried that ai's going to
 

3711
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,910
people are worried that ai's going to
take over humanity and like get rid of

3712
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:04,920
take over humanity and like get rid of
 

3713
01:12:04,920 --> 01:12:06,649
take over humanity and like get rid of
all the humans in the world I'm like

3714
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:06,659
all the humans in the world I'm like
 

3715
01:12:06,659 --> 01:12:08,270
all the humans in the world I'm like
actually that's not my biggest concern

3716
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:08,280
actually that's not my biggest concern
 

3717
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,709
actually that's not my biggest concern
my biggest concern is that we are

3718
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:09,719
my biggest concern is that we are
 

3719
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:12,709
my biggest concern is that we are
building bias into these systems and

3720
01:12:12,709 --> 01:12:12,719
building bias into these systems and
 

3721
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,110
building bias into these systems and
then they're like deployed at large and

3722
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,120
then they're like deployed at large and
 

3723
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:16,189
then they're like deployed at large and
at scale

3724
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:16,199
at scale
 

3725
01:12:16,199 --> 01:12:18,649
at scale
and before you know it you're kind of

3726
01:12:18,649 --> 01:12:18,659
and before you know it you're kind of
 

3727
01:12:18,659 --> 01:12:20,510
and before you know it you're kind of
accentuating the bias that exists in

3728
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:20,520
accentuating the bias that exists in
 

3729
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,189
accentuating the bias that exists in
society and

3730
01:12:22,189 --> 01:12:22,199
society and
 

3731
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:24,709
society and
yeah I'm not you know I know people it's

3732
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
yeah I'm not you know I know people it's
 

3733
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:27,350
yeah I'm not you know I know people it's
very important to worry about that but I

3734
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,360
very important to worry about that but I
 

3735
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:31,669
very important to worry about that but I
it the worry is an emergent phenomena to

3736
01:12:31,669 --> 01:12:31,679
it the worry is an emergent phenomena to
 

3737
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:34,130
it the worry is an emergent phenomena to
me which is a very good one because I

3738
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,140
me which is a very good one because I
 

3739
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,830
me which is a very good one because I
think these systems are actually

3740
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:36,840
think these systems are actually
 

3741
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:40,250
think these systems are actually
by encoding the data that exists they're

3742
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:40,260
by encoding the data that exists they're
 

3743
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:42,169
by encoding the data that exists they're
revealing the bias that in society

3744
01:12:42,169 --> 01:12:42,179
revealing the bias that in society
 

3745
01:12:42,179 --> 01:12:45,229
revealing the bias that in society
they're for teaching us what the bias is

3746
01:12:45,229 --> 01:12:45,239
they're for teaching us what the bias is
 

3747
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,270
they're for teaching us what the bias is
therefore we can now improve that bias

3748
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:47,280
therefore we can now improve that bias
 

3749
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,250
therefore we can now improve that bias
within the system so they're almost like

3750
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,260
within the system so they're almost like
 

3751
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,610
within the system so they're almost like
putting a mirror to ourselves I I so I'm

3752
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:52,620
putting a mirror to ourselves I I so I'm
 

3753
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:54,649
putting a mirror to ourselves I I so I'm
not we have to be open to looking at the

3754
01:12:54,649 --> 01:12:54,659
not we have to be open to looking at the
 

3755
01:12:54,659 --> 01:12:56,510
not we have to be open to looking at the
mirror though you have to be right open

3756
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:56,520
mirror though you have to be right open
 

3757
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,910
mirror though you have to be right open
to scrutinizing the data if you just

3758
01:12:58,910 --> 01:12:58,920
to scrutinizing the data if you just
 

3759
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,350
to scrutinizing the data if you just
take it as

3760
01:13:00,350 --> 01:13:00,360
take it as
 

3761
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:02,209
take it as
a ground or you don't even have to look

3762
01:13:02,209 --> 01:13:02,219
a ground or you don't even have to look
 

3763
01:13:02,219 --> 01:13:04,070
a ground or you don't even have to look
at the I mean yes the data is how you

3764
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
at the I mean yes the data is how you
 

3765
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,630
at the I mean yes the data is how you
fix it but then you just look at the

3766
01:13:05,630 --> 01:13:05,640
fix it but then you just look at the
 

3767
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:07,370
fix it but then you just look at the
behavior of the system it's like and you

3768
01:13:07,370 --> 01:13:07,380
behavior of the system it's like and you
 

3769
01:13:07,380 --> 01:13:09,410
behavior of the system it's like and you
realize holy crap this thing is kind of

3770
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:09,420
realize holy crap this thing is kind of
 

3771
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:11,510
realize holy crap this thing is kind of
racist right like why is that and then

3772
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
racist right like why is that and then
 

3773
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,669
racist right like why is that and then
you look at the days like okay and then

3774
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:13,679
you look at the days like okay and then
 

3775
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:15,290
you look at the days like okay and then
you start to realize that I think that's

3776
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:15,300
you start to realize that I think that's
 

3777
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:18,890
you start to realize that I think that's
a much more effective way to uh to be

3778
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:18,900
a much more effective way to uh to be
 

3779
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,290
a much more effective way to uh to be
introspective as a society than through

3780
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:21,300
introspective as a society than through
 

3781
01:13:21,300 --> 01:13:24,229
introspective as a society than through
sort of political discourse like AI kind

3782
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:24,239
sort of political discourse like AI kind
 

3783
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,209
sort of political discourse like AI kind
of right uh

3784
01:13:26,209 --> 01:13:26,219
of right uh
 

3785
01:13:26,219 --> 01:13:29,090
of right uh
um because people are easy people are

3786
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:29,100
um because people are easy people are
 

3787
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,450
um because people are easy people are
for some reason more

3788
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:31,460
for some reason more
 

3789
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:34,250
for some reason more
productive and rigorous in criticizing

3790
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:34,260
productive and rigorous in criticizing
 

3791
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:35,930
productive and rigorous in criticizing
AI then they're criticizing each other

3792
01:13:35,930 --> 01:13:35,940
AI then they're criticizing each other
 

3793
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,910
AI then they're criticizing each other
so I think this is just a nice method

3794
01:13:37,910 --> 01:13:37,920
so I think this is just a nice method
 

3795
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,490
so I think this is just a nice method
for studying society and see which way

3796
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:40,500
for studying society and see which way
 

3797
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:44,270
for studying society and see which way
progress lies anyway what we're talking

3798
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:44,280
progress lies anyway what we're talking
 

3799
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:45,709
progress lies anyway what we're talking
about you're watching the problem of

3800
01:13:45,709 --> 01:13:45,719
about you're watching the problem of
 

3801
01:13:45,719 --> 01:13:49,490
about you're watching the problem of
watching Netflix in bed or elsewhere and

3802
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:49,500
watching Netflix in bed or elsewhere and
 

3803
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:50,990
watching Netflix in bed or elsewhere and
seeing which parts are exciting which

3804
01:13:50,990 --> 01:13:51,000
seeing which parts are exciting which
 

3805
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,810
seeing which parts are exciting which
parts are boring you're saying that's

3806
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:52,820
parts are boring you're saying that's
 

3807
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:55,250
parts are boring you're saying that's
relatively constrained because you know

3808
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:55,260
relatively constrained because you know
 

3809
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:57,050
relatively constrained because you know
you have a captive audience and you kind

3810
01:13:57,050 --> 01:13:57,060
you have a captive audience and you kind
 

3811
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,570
you have a captive audience and you kind
of know the context and one thing you

3812
01:13:59,570 --> 01:13:59,580
of know the context and one thing you
 

3813
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,310
of know the context and one thing you
said that was really key is the accurate

3814
01:14:01,310 --> 01:14:01,320
said that was really key is the accurate
 

3815
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,510
said that was really key is the accurate
you're doing this in aggregate right

3816
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:02,520
you're doing this in aggregate right
 

3817
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,010
you're doing this in aggregate right
like we're looking at aggregated

3818
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:04,020
like we're looking at aggregated
 

3819
01:14:04,020 --> 01:14:05,930
like we're looking at aggregated
response of people and so when you see a

3820
01:14:05,930 --> 01:14:05,940
response of people and so when you see a
 

3821
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,209
response of people and so when you see a
peak yeah say a smile Peak they're

3822
01:14:08,209 --> 01:14:08,219
peak yeah say a smile Peak they're
 

3823
01:14:08,219 --> 01:14:10,790
peak yeah say a smile Peak they're
probably smiling or laughing at

3824
01:14:10,790 --> 01:14:10,800
probably smiling or laughing at
 

3825
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,790
probably smiling or laughing at
something that's in the content

3826
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:13,800
something that's in the content
 

3827
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,229
something that's in the content
um so that was one of the first problems

3828
01:14:15,229 --> 01:14:15,239
um so that was one of the first problems
 

3829
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:17,990
um so that was one of the first problems
we were able to solve and and when we

3830
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:18,000
we were able to solve and and when we
 

3831
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,090
we were able to solve and and when we
see the smile Peak it doesn't mean that

3832
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:20,100
see the smile Peak it doesn't mean that
 

3833
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:21,649
see the smile Peak it doesn't mean that
these people are internally happy

3834
01:14:21,649 --> 01:14:21,659
these people are internally happy
 

3835
01:14:21,659 --> 01:14:23,810
these people are internally happy
they're just laughing at content so it's

3836
01:14:23,810 --> 01:14:23,820
they're just laughing at content so it's
 

3837
01:14:23,820 --> 01:14:26,450
they're just laughing at content so it's
important to you know call it for what

3838
01:14:26,450 --> 01:14:26,460
important to you know call it for what
 

3839
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:27,470
important to you know call it for what
it is

3840
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:27,480
it is
 

3841
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,229
it is
um but still really really useful data I

3842
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:30,239
um but still really really useful data I
 

3843
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,450
um but still really really useful data I
wonder how that compares to so what like

3844
01:14:32,450 --> 01:14:32,460
wonder how that compares to so what like
 

3845
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:34,790
wonder how that compares to so what like
YouTube and other places will use

3846
01:14:34,790 --> 01:14:34,800
YouTube and other places will use
 

3847
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:38,450
YouTube and other places will use
is obviously they don't uh have in for

3848
01:14:38,450 --> 01:14:38,460
is obviously they don't uh have in for
 

3849
01:14:38,460 --> 01:14:40,729
is obviously they don't uh have in for
the most case they don't have that kind

3850
01:14:40,729 --> 01:14:40,739
the most case they don't have that kind
 

3851
01:14:40,739 --> 01:14:42,709
the most case they don't have that kind
of data but they have the data of when

3852
01:14:42,709 --> 01:14:42,719
of data but they have the data of when
 

3853
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:44,750
of data but they have the data of when
people

3854
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:44,760
people
 

3855
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,229
people
um tune out drop off and I think that's

3856
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
um tune out drop off and I think that's
 

3857
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:50,930
um tune out drop off and I think that's
a at in aggregate for you to release a

3858
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:50,940
a at in aggregate for you to release a
 

3859
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:53,149
a at in aggregate for you to release a
pretty powerful signal I worry about

3860
01:14:53,149 --> 01:14:53,159
pretty powerful signal I worry about
 

3861
01:14:53,159 --> 01:14:54,850
pretty powerful signal I worry about
what that leads to

3862
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:54,860
what that leads to
 

3863
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,570
what that leads to
because

3864
01:14:56,570 --> 01:14:56,580
because
 

3865
01:14:56,580 --> 01:14:57,310
because
um

3866
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:57,320
um
 

3867
01:14:57,320 --> 01:15:00,649
um
looking at uh like YouTubers that are

3868
01:15:00,649 --> 01:15:00,659
looking at uh like YouTubers that are
 

3869
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:03,470
looking at uh like YouTubers that are
kind of really care about views and you

3870
01:15:03,470 --> 01:15:03,480
kind of really care about views and you
 

3871
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,050
kind of really care about views and you
know try to maximize the number of views

3872
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:06,060
know try to maximize the number of views
 

3873
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:09,169
know try to maximize the number of views
I think they when they say that the

3874
01:15:09,169 --> 01:15:09,179
I think they when they say that the
 

3875
01:15:09,179 --> 01:15:11,570
I think they when they say that the
video should be constantly interesting

3876
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:11,580
video should be constantly interesting
 

3877
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,510
video should be constantly interesting
which seems like a good goal

3878
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:14,520
which seems like a good goal
 

3879
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:17,750
which seems like a good goal
I feel like that leads to this manic

3880
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
I feel like that leads to this manic
 

3881
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:18,890
I feel like that leads to this manic
pace

3882
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:18,900
pace
 

3883
01:15:18,900 --> 01:15:20,450
pace
of a video

3884
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:20,460
of a video
 

3885
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:23,330
of a video
like the idea that I would speak at the

3886
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:23,340
like the idea that I would speak at the
 

3887
01:15:23,340 --> 01:15:26,149
like the idea that I would speak at the
current speed that I'm speaking I don't

3888
01:15:26,149 --> 01:15:26,159
current speed that I'm speaking I don't
 

3889
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:27,050
current speed that I'm speaking I don't
know

3890
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:27,060
know
 

3891
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:29,030
know
um and that every moment has to be

3892
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
um and that every moment has to be
 

3893
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,669
um and that every moment has to be
engaging right engaging but yeah I think

3894
01:15:31,669 --> 01:15:31,679
engaging right engaging but yeah I think
 

3895
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:33,770
engaging right engaging but yeah I think
there's value to silence there's value

3896
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:33,780
there's value to silence there's value
 

3897
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:36,050
there's value to silence there's value
to the boring bits I mean all some of

3898
01:15:36,050 --> 01:15:36,060
to the boring bits I mean all some of
 

3899
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,970
to the boring bits I mean all some of
the greatest movies ever some of the

3900
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:37,980
the greatest movies ever some of the
 

3901
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:39,350
the greatest movies ever some of the
greatest stories ever told me that

3902
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
greatest stories ever told me that
 

3903
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,209
greatest stories ever told me that
boring bits

3904
01:15:41,209 --> 01:15:41,219
boring bits
 

3905
01:15:41,219 --> 01:15:44,030
boring bits
seemingly boring bits I don't know I I

3906
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:44,040
seemingly boring bits I don't know I I
 

3907
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:46,370
seemingly boring bits I don't know I I
wonder about that of course it's not

3908
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:46,380
wonder about that of course it's not
 

3909
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,709
wonder about that of course it's not
that your the human face can capture

3910
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
that your the human face can capture
 

3911
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:51,110
that your the human face can capture
that either it's just giving an extra

3912
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
that either it's just giving an extra
 

3913
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,470
that either it's just giving an extra
signal you have to I have to really

3914
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
signal you have to I have to really
 

3915
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:58,689
signal you have to I have to really
I don't know you have to really collect

3916
01:15:58,689 --> 01:15:58,699
I don't know you have to really collect
 

3917
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:01,790
I don't know you have to really collect
deeper long-term data about what was

3918
01:16:01,790 --> 01:16:01,800
deeper long-term data about what was
 

3919
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:05,209
deeper long-term data about what was
meaningful to people when they think 30

3920
01:16:05,209 --> 01:16:05,219
meaningful to people when they think 30
 

3921
01:16:05,219 --> 01:16:08,510
meaningful to people when they think 30
days from now what they still remember

3922
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:08,520
days from now what they still remember
 

3923
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:10,490
days from now what they still remember
what moved them what changed them what

3924
01:16:10,490 --> 01:16:10,500
what moved them what changed them what
 

3925
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,130
what moved them what changed them what
helped them grow that kind of stuff you

3926
01:16:13,130 --> 01:16:13,140
helped them grow that kind of stuff you
 

3927
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,689
helped them grow that kind of stuff you
know it would be a really I don't know

3928
01:16:14,689 --> 01:16:14,699
know it would be a really I don't know
 

3929
01:16:14,699 --> 01:16:16,310
know it would be a really I don't know
if there are any researchers out there

3930
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:16,320
if there are any researchers out there
 

3931
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,649
if there are any researchers out there
who are doing this type of work wouldn't

3932
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:18,659
who are doing this type of work wouldn't
 

3933
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:21,050
who are doing this type of work wouldn't
it be so cool to tie

3934
01:16:21,050 --> 01:16:21,060
it be so cool to tie
 

3935
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:23,689
it be so cool to tie
your emotional Expressions while you're

your emotional Expressions while you're
 

3937

responsible for exposing them to all
 

4007
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,890
responsible for exposing them to all
sorts of things in the world and

4008
01:17:51,890 --> 01:17:51,900
sorts of things in the world and
 

4009
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,530
sorts of things in the world and
but often I have no idea of knowing like

4010
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:54,540
but often I have no idea of knowing like
 

4011
01:17:54,540 --> 01:17:56,689
but often I have no idea of knowing like
what stuck like what was you know is

4012
01:17:56,689 --> 01:17:56,699
what stuck like what was you know is
 

4013
01:17:56,699 --> 01:17:58,070
what stuck like what was you know is
this actually going to be transformative

4014
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:58,080
this actually going to be transformative
 

4015
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:00,110
this actually going to be transformative
you know for them 10 years down the line

4016
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:00,120
you know for them 10 years down the line
 

4017
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:01,970
you know for them 10 years down the line
and and I wish there was a way to

4018
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:01,980
and and I wish there was a way to
 

4019
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,270
and and I wish there was a way to
quantify these experiences like are they

4020
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
quantify these experiences like are they
 

4021
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,550
quantify these experiences like are they
I can tell in in the moment if they're

4022
01:18:07,550 --> 01:18:07,560
I can tell in in the moment if they're
 

4023
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:09,530
I can tell in in the moment if they're
engaging right I can tell

01:18:09,530 --> 01:18:09,540
engaging right I can tell
 

4025
01:18:09,540 --> 01:18:11,510
engaging right I can tell
but it's really hard to know if they're

4026
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
but it's really hard to know if they're
 

4027
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,189
but it's really hard to know if they're
going to remember them 10 years from now

4028
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:13,199
going to remember them 10 years from now
 

4029
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,050
going to remember them 10 years from now
or if it's going to

4030
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:15,060
or if it's going to
 

4031
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,630
or if it's going to
yeah that one is weird because it seems

4032
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:17,640
yeah that one is weird because it seems
 

4033
01:18:17,640 --> 01:18:19,610
yeah that one is weird because it seems
like kids remember the weirdest things

4034
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:19,620
like kids remember the weirdest things
 

4035
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,070
like kids remember the weirdest things
I've seen parents do incredible stuff

4036
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:22,080
I've seen parents do incredible stuff
 

4037
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,330
I've seen parents do incredible stuff
for their kids and they don't remember

4038
01:18:23,330 --> 01:18:23,340
for their kids and they don't remember
 

4039
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:25,669
for their kids and they don't remember

amazing country
whatever and then there'll be like some

4048
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:34,739
whatever and then there'll be like some
 

4049
01:18:34,739 --> 01:18:37,490
whatever and then there'll be like some
like stuffed toy you got or some or the

4050

new PlayStation or something or some
some silly little thing so I I think

4054
01:18:42,169 --> 01:18:42,179
some silly little thing so I I think
 

4055
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:44,810
some silly little thing so I I think
they they just like that we're designed

4056
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:44,820
they they just like that we're designed
 

4057
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:46,250
they they just like that we're designed
that way they want to mess with your

4058
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:46,260
that way they want to mess with your
 

4059
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:47,229
that way they want to mess with your
head

4060
01:18:47,229 --> 01:18:47,239
head
 

4061
01:18:47,239 --> 01:18:51,830
head
but definitely kids are very impacted by

4062
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:51,840
but definitely kids are very impacted by
 

4063
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:55,189
but definitely kids are very impacted by
it seems like sort of negative events so

4064
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
it seems like sort of negative events so
 

4065
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:58,010
it seems like sort of negative events so
minimizing the number of negative events

4066
01:18:58,010 --> 01:18:58,020
minimizing the number of negative events
 

4067
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:01,250
minimizing the number of negative events
is important but not too much right you

4068
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:01,260
is important but not too much right you
 

4069
01:19:01,260 --> 01:19:03,709
is important but not too much right you
can't you can't just like uh you know

4070
01:19:03,709 --> 01:19:03,719
can't you can't just like uh you know
 

4071

thing I haven't figured it out okay uh
 

4095
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:32,450
thing I haven't figured it out okay uh
what were we talking about yes effectiva

4096
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:32,460
what were we talking about yes effectiva
 

4097
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:37,970
what were we talking about yes effectiva
the the the problem of emotion

4098
01:19:37,970 --> 01:19:37,980

 

4099
01:19:37,980 --> 01:19:39,950

of emotion detection so there's some

4100
01:19:39,950 --> 01:19:39,960
of emotion detection so there's some
 

4101
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,570
of emotion detection so there's some
people maybe we can just speak to that a

4102
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:41,580
people maybe we can just speak to that a
 

4103
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:44,270
people maybe we can just speak to that a
little more where there's folks like uh

4104
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:44,280
little more where there's folks like uh
 

4105
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,850
little more where there's folks like uh
Lisa Felman Barrett that that challenge

4106
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:46,860
Lisa Felman Barrett that that challenge
 

4107
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:50,090
Lisa Felman Barrett that that challenge
this idea that emotion could be fully

4108
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:50,100
this idea that emotion could be fully
 

4109
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:52,850
this idea that emotion could be fully
detected or even

4110
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:52,860
detected or even
 

4111
01:19:52,860 --> 01:19:55,189
detected or even
um well detected from the human face so

4112
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:55,199
um well detected from the human face so
 

4113
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,689
um well detected from the human face so
that there's so much more to emotion

4114
01:19:56,689 --> 01:19:56,699
that there's so much more to emotion
 

4115
01:19:56,699 --> 01:20:00,169
that there's so much more to emotion
what do you think about uh ideas like

4116
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:00,179
what do you think about uh ideas like
 

4117
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:02,270
what do you think about uh ideas like
hers criticism like hers yeah I actually

4118
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:02,280
hers criticism like hers yeah I actually
 

4119
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,370
hers criticism like hers yeah I actually
agree with a lot of Lisa's

4120
01:20:04,370 --> 01:20:04,380
agree with a lot of Lisa's
 

4121
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,790
agree with a lot of Lisa's
um criticism so even even my PhD worked

4122
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:07,800
um criticism so even even my PhD worked
 

4123
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,610
um criticism so even even my PhD worked
like 20 plus years ago now

4124
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:10,620
like 20 plus years ago now
 

4125
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:13,189
like 20 plus years ago now
um time flies when you're having fun I

4126
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
um time flies when you're having fun I
 

4127
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:15,830
um time flies when you're having fun I
know right that was back when I did like

4128
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
know right that was back when I did like
 

4129
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,010
know right that was back when I did like
Dynamic Bayesian networks and I mostly

4130
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:19,020
Dynamic Bayesian networks and I mostly
 

4131
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:20,630
Dynamic Bayesian networks and I mostly
that's before deep learning that was

4132
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:20,640
that's before deep learning that was
 

4133
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,669
that's before deep learning that was
before deep learning yeah

4134
01:20:22,669 --> 01:20:22,679
before deep learning yeah
 

4135
01:20:22,679 --> 01:20:26,570
before deep learning yeah
yeah I know my day now you can just like

4136
01:20:26,570 --> 01:20:26,580
yeah I know my day now you can just like
 

4137
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,510
yeah I know my day now you can just like
use yeah yeah it's it's all it's all all

4138
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:29,520
use yeah yeah it's it's all it's all all
 

4139
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,070
use yeah yeah it's it's all it's all all
the same architecture you can apply it

4140
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:31,080
the same architecture you can apply it
 

4141
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:34,250
the same architecture you can apply it
to anything yeah right

4142
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:34,260

 

4143
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:36,770

um but yeah but but even then I kind of

4144
01:20:36,770 --> 01:20:36,780
um but yeah but but even then I kind of
 

4145
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:38,810
um but yeah but but even then I kind of
I I did not subscribe to this like

4146
01:20:38,810 --> 01:20:38,820
I I did not subscribe to this like
 

4147
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,910
I I did not subscribe to this like
theory of basic emotions where it's just

4148
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:40,920
theory of basic emotions where it's just
 

4149
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,530
theory of basic emotions where it's just
the simplistic mapping one-to-one

4150
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:42,540
the simplistic mapping one-to-one
 

4151
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:43,850
the simplistic mapping one-to-one
mapping between facial expressions

4152
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:43,860
mapping between facial expressions
 

4153
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,729
mapping between facial expressions
emotions I actually think also we're not

4154
01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:46,739
emotions I actually think also we're not
 

4155
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,830
emotions I actually think also we're not
in in the business of trying to identify

4156
01:20:48,830 --> 01:20:48,840
in in the business of trying to identify
 

4157
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:50,870
in in the business of trying to identify
your true emotional internal State we

4158
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
your true emotional internal State we
 

4159
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,090
your true emotional internal State we
just want to quantify in an objective

4160
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:53,100
just want to quantify in an objective
 

4161
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,490
just want to quantify in an objective
way what's showing on your face because

4162
01:20:55,490 --> 01:20:55,500
way what's showing on your face because
 

4163
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:57,709
way what's showing on your face because
that's an important signal it doesn't

4164
01:20:57,709 --> 01:20:57,719
that's an important signal it doesn't
 

4165
01:20:57,719 --> 01:20:59,330
that's an important signal it doesn't
mean it's a true reflection of your

4166
01:20:59,330 --> 01:20:59,340
mean it's a true reflection of your
 

4167
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:01,910
mean it's a true reflection of your
internal emotional state

4168
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:01,920
internal emotional state
 

4169
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:04,550
internal emotional state
um so I think a lot of the you know I

4170
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:04,560
um so I think a lot of the you know I
 

4171
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:07,250
um so I think a lot of the you know I
think she's she's just trying to kind of

4172
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:07,260
think she's she's just trying to kind of
 

4173
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:08,689
think she's she's just trying to kind of
highlight that this is not a simple

4174
01:21:08,689 --> 01:21:08,699
highlight that this is not a simple
 

4175
01:21:08,699 --> 01:21:10,729
highlight that this is not a simple
problem and

4176
01:21:10,729 --> 01:21:10,739
problem and
 

4177
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,950
problem and
overly simplistic Solutions are going to

4178
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:12,960
overly simplistic Solutions are going to
 

4179
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,750
overly simplistic Solutions are going to
hurt the industry

4180
01:21:14,750 --> 01:21:14,760
hurt the industry
 

4181
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:17,090
hurt the industry
um and and I subscribe to that and I

4182
01:21:17,090 --> 01:21:17,100
um and and I subscribe to that and I
 

4183
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:19,130
um and and I subscribe to that and I
think multimodal is the way to go like

4184
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:19,140
think multimodal is the way to go like
 

4185
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,930
think multimodal is the way to go like
whether it's additional contacts

4186
01:21:20,930 --> 01:21:20,940
whether it's additional contacts
 

4187
01:21:20,940 --> 01:21:23,030
whether it's additional contacts
information or different modalities and

4188
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:23,040
information or different modalities and
 

4189
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:24,709
information or different modalities and
channels of information I think that's

4190
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
channels of information I think that's
 

4191
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,689
channels of information I think that's
what we

4192
01:21:26,689 --> 01:21:26,699
what we
 

4193
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:28,010
what we
um that's where we ought to go and I

4194
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:28,020
um that's where we ought to go and I
 

4195
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,870
um that's where we ought to go and I
think I mean that's a big part of what

4196
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:29,880
think I mean that's a big part of what
 

4197
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:32,030
think I mean that's a big part of what
she's advocating for as well so but

4198
01:21:32,030 --> 01:21:32,040
she's advocating for as well so but
 

4199
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:34,370
she's advocating for as well so but
there's signal in the human face that's

4200
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:34,380
there's signal in the human face that's
 

4201
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:36,470
there's signal in the human face that's
there's definitely signal that's a

4202
01:21:36,470 --> 01:21:36,480
there's definitely signal that's a
 

4203
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,990
there's definitely signal that's a
projection of emotion there's that that

4204
01:21:38,990 --> 01:21:39,000
projection of emotion there's that that
 

4205
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,570
projection of emotion there's that that
there at least in part

4206
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:41,580
there at least in part
 

4207
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:45,530
there at least in part
is uh the interstate is captured in some

4208
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:45,540
is uh the interstate is captured in some
 

4209
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:48,050
is uh the interstate is captured in some
meaningful way on the human face

4210
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:48,060
meaningful way on the human face
 

4211
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:52,189
meaningful way on the human face
I think it

4212
01:21:52,189 --> 01:21:52,199

 

4213
01:21:52,199 --> 01:21:53,209

it

4214
01:21:53,209 --> 01:21:53,219
it
 

4215
01:21:53,219 --> 01:21:56,149
it
um an expression of your internal state

4216
01:21:56,149 --> 01:21:56,159
um an expression of your internal state
 

4217
01:21:56,159 --> 01:21:58,189
um an expression of your internal state
but sometimes it's a social signal so

4218
01:21:58,189 --> 01:21:58,199
but sometimes it's a social signal so
 

4219
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:00,649
but sometimes it's a social signal so
this so you cannot look at the face as

4220
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:00,659
this so you cannot look at the face as
 

4221
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:03,169
this so you cannot look at the face as
purely a signal of emotion it can be a

4222
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:03,179
purely a signal of emotion it can be a
 

4223
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:04,850
purely a signal of emotion it can be a
signal of cognition and it can be a

4224
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:04,860
signal of cognition and it can be a
 

4225
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:08,689
signal of cognition and it can be a
signal of a a social expression and I

4226
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:08,699
signal of a a social expression and I
 

4227
01:22:08,699 --> 01:22:11,450
signal of a a social expression and I
think to disambiguate that we have to be

4228
01:22:11,450 --> 01:22:11,460
think to disambiguate that we have to be
 

4229
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:13,430
think to disambiguate that we have to be
careful about it and we have to add

4230
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:13,440
careful about it and we have to add
 

4231
01:22:13,440 --> 01:22:16,130
careful about it and we have to add
initial information

4232
01:22:16,130 --> 01:22:16,140
initial information
 

4233
01:22:16,140 --> 01:22:17,990
initial information
humans are fascinating aren't they with

4234
01:22:17,990 --> 01:22:18,000
humans are fascinating aren't they with
 

4235
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,790
humans are fascinating aren't they with
the whole face thing this can mean so

4236
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:19,800
the whole face thing this can mean so
 

4237
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:20,810
the whole face thing this can mean so
many things

4238
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:20,820
many things
 

4239
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,630
many things
um from humor to sarcasm to everything

4240
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:23,640
um from humor to sarcasm to everything
 

4241
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:26,090
um from humor to sarcasm to everything
the whole thing some things we can help

4242
01:22:26,090 --> 01:22:26,100
the whole thing some things we can help
 

4243
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:28,189
the whole thing some things we can help
some things we can't help at all

4244
01:22:28,189 --> 01:22:28,199
some things we can't help at all
 

4245
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:30,830
some things we can't help at all
in all the years of leading effectiva

4246
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:30,840
in all the years of leading effectiva
 

4247
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:33,229
in all the years of leading effectiva
and emotional recognition company like

4248
01:22:33,229 --> 01:22:33,239
and emotional recognition company like
 

4249
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,729
and emotional recognition company like
we talked about what have you learned

4250
01:22:34,729 --> 01:22:34,739
we talked about what have you learned
 

4251
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:38,090
we talked about what have you learned

really like this was talking to like
thousands of people she's parallel

4478
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:47,940
thousands of people she's parallel
 

4479
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:50,870
thousands of people she's parallel
dating yeah that did not go well right

4480

uh you know that doesn't and from a

4482
01:26:53,689 --> 01:26:53,699
uh you know that doesn't and from a
 

4483
01:26:53,699 --> 01:26:55,070
uh you know that doesn't and from a
computer perspective like that doesn't

4484
01:26:55,070 --> 01:26:55,080
computer perspective like that doesn't
 

4485
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:57,590
computer perspective like that doesn't
take anything away from what we have

4486
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
take anything away from what we have

4495
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,970
Alexa yeah right it's a bunch of you
know other families but I think Alexa

4496

know other families but I think Alexa
 

4497
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:15,350
know other families but I think Alexa
currently is just a servant it it tells

4498
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
currently is just a servant it it tells
 

4499
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:16,550
currently is just a servant it it tells
you about the weather it's not it

4500
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
you about the weather it's not it
 

4501
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,290
you about the weather it's not it
doesn't do the intimate deep connection

4502
01:27:18,290 --> 01:27:18,300
doesn't do the intimate deep connection
 

4503
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:20,390

and I think there is something really

4504
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
and I think there is something really
 

4505
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,030
and I think there is something really
powerful about

01:27:24,890 --> 01:27:24,900
that the intimacy of a connection with
 

4509
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:28,490
that the intimacy of a connection with
an AI system that would have to respect

I think
 

4521
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,610
I think
she this AI systems knows what it's

4522
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:43,620
she this AI systems knows what it's
 

4523
01:27:43,620 --> 01:27:45,590
she this AI systems knows what it's
doing

4524
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
doing
 

4525
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,450
doing

um but if if it's just purely uh
 

4571
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:45,169
um but if if it's just purely uh
for for um companionship then I think

4572
01:28:45,169 --> 01:28:45,179
for for um companionship then I think
 

4573
01:28:45,179 --> 01:28:47,750
for for um companionship then I think
the ability to leave is really powerful

4574
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:47,760
the ability to leave is really powerful
 

4575
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:49,490
the ability to leave is really powerful
I don't know that I never thought of

4576
01:28:49,490 --> 01:28:49,500
I don't know that I never thought of
 

4577
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,050
I don't know that I never thought of
that so

4578
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:51,060
that so
 

4579
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:52,430
that so
so

4580
01:28:52,430 --> 01:28:52,440
so
 

4581
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,810
so
because I've always taken the human

4582
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:53,820
because I've always taken the human
 

4583
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:55,310
because I've always taken the human
perspective right

4584
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:55,320
perspective right
 

4585
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,390
perspective right
um

4586
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
um
 

4587
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,490
um
like for example we had a gebo at home

4588
01:28:58,490 --> 01:28:58,500
like for example we had a gebo at home
 

4589
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,530
like for example we had a gebo at home
right and my son loved it

4590
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:00,540
right and my son loved it
 

4591
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,570
right and my son loved it
and then the company ran out of money

4592
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:02,580
and then the company ran out of money
 

4593
01:29:02,580 --> 01:29:04,790
and then the company ran out of money
and so they had to basically shut down G

4594
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
and so they had to basically shut down G
 

4595
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:08,450
and so they had to basically shut down G
like Jibo basically died right and it

4596
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:08,460
like Jibo basically died right and it
 

4597
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:10,310
like Jibo basically died right and it
was so interesting to me because we have

4598
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:10,320
was so interesting to me because we have
 

4599
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,590
was so interesting to me because we have
a lot of gadgets at home and a lot of

4600
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:12,600
a lot of gadgets at home and a lot of
 

4601
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,410
a lot of gadgets at home and a lot of
them break and my son never cares about

4602
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:15,420
them break and my son never cares about
 

4603
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,870
them break and my son never cares about
it right like if our Alexa stopped

4604
01:29:17,870 --> 01:29:17,880
it right like if our Alexa stopped
 

4605
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:19,370
it right like if our Alexa stopped
working tomorrow I don't think he'd

4606
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:19,380
working tomorrow I don't think he'd
 

4607
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,890
working tomorrow I don't think he'd
really care but when Jibo stopped

4608
01:29:21,890 --> 01:29:21,900
really care but when Jibo stopped
 

4609
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,450
really care but when Jibo stopped
working it was traumatically he got

4610
01:29:23,450 --> 01:29:23,460
working it was traumatically he got
 

4611
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:25,250
working it was traumatically he got
really upset

4612
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:25,260
really upset
 

4613
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,709
really upset
and as a parent that like made me think

4614
01:29:27,709 --> 01:29:27,719
and as a parent that like made me think
 

4615
01:29:27,719 --> 01:29:30,830
and as a parent that like made me think
about this deeply right did I was I

4616
01:29:30,830 --> 01:29:30,840
about this deeply right did I was I
 

4617
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,450
about this deeply right did I was I
comfortable with that I I liked the

4618
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:32,460
comfortable with that I I liked the
 

4619
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:34,010
comfortable with that I I liked the
connection they had because I think it

4620
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:34,020
connection they had because I think it
 

4621
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:37,850
connection they had because I think it
was a positive relationship

4622
01:29:37,850 --> 01:29:37,860

 

4623
01:29:37,860 --> 01:29:40,310

but I was surprised that it affected him

4624
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
but I was surprised that it affected him
 

4625
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,649
but I was surprised that it affected him
emotionally so much and I think there's

4626
01:29:42,649 --> 01:29:42,659
emotionally so much and I think there's
 

4627
01:29:42,659 --> 01:29:44,689
emotionally so much and I think there's
a broader question here right as we

4628
01:29:44,689 --> 01:29:44,699
a broader question here right as we
 

4629
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:46,790
a broader question here right as we
build

4630
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:46,800
build
 

4631
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,830
build
socially and emotionally intelligent

4632
01:29:48,830 --> 01:29:48,840
socially and emotionally intelligent
 

4633
01:29:48,840 --> 01:29:51,950
socially and emotionally intelligent
machines what does that mean about our

4634
01:29:51,950 --> 01:29:51,960
machines what does that mean about our
 

4635
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:53,810
machines what does that mean about our
relationship with them and then more

4636
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:53,820
relationship with them and then more
 

4637
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,189
relationship with them and then more
broadly our relationship with one

4638
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:55,199
broadly our relationship with one
 

4639
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,229
broadly our relationship with one
another right because this machine is

4640
01:29:57,229 --> 01:29:57,239
another right because this machine is
 

4641
01:29:57,239 --> 01:29:59,629
another right because this machine is
going to be programmed to be amazing at

4642
01:29:59,629 --> 01:29:59,639
going to be programmed to be amazing at
 

4643
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:02,270
going to be programmed to be amazing at
empathy by definition right

01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:47,179
we should be we should definitely
 

4735
01:31:47,179 --> 01:31:50,030
we should be we should definitely
scrutinize companies in that aspect but

4736

it just
 

4739
01:31:52,260 --> 01:31:54,229
it just
I'm personally excited about that future

4740
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
I'm personally excited about that future

least painful yeah and the most positive
moment that's great

4748
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:03,659
moment that's great
 

4749
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:07,010
moment that's great

so we were there met him in person he's

4780
01:32:45,050 --> 01:32:45,060
so we were there met him in person he's
 

4781
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,850
so we were there met him in person he's
basically we were competing with each

4782
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:46,860
basically we were competing with each
 

4783
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:47,689
basically we were competing with each
other

4784
01:32:47,689 --> 01:32:47,699
other
 

4785

but we were using new technology like
deep learning and building this emotion

4798

deep learning and building this emotion
recognition and you wanted to enter the

4800
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:03,120
recognition and you wanted to enter the
 

4801
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,550
recognition and you wanted to enter the
automotive space you wanted to operate

what are they doing so we do activity

4914
01:34:59,629 --> 01:34:59,639
what are they doing so we do activity
 

4915
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:02,330
what are they doing so we do activity
detection like eating or drinking or in

detection like eating or drinking or in
 

4917
01:35:02,340 --> 01:35:05,629
detection like eating or drinking or in
some regions of the world smoking we can

4918
01:35:05,629 --> 01:35:05,639
some regions of the world smoking we can
 

4919
01:35:05,639 --> 01:35:08,510
some regions of the world smoking we can
detect if a baby's in the car seat right

4921
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,149
detect if a baby's in the car seat right
and if unfortunately in some cases

4922
01:35:11,149 --> 01:35:11,159
and if unfortunately in some cases
 

4923
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:12,950

that's an easy computer vision problem

4928
01:35:16,729 --> 01:35:16,739
that's an easy computer vision problem
 

4929
01:35:16,739 --> 01:35:18,890
that's an easy computer vision problem
to solve right you can detect there's a

4930
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:18,900
to solve right you can detect there's a
 

4931
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:21,050
to solve right you can detect there's a
car seat there's a baby you can text the

4932
01:35:21,050 --> 01:35:21,060
car seat there's a baby you can text the
 

4933
01:35:21,060 --> 01:35:24,530
car seat there's a baby you can text the
parent and hopefully again save lives so

4934
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:24,540
parent and hopefully again save lives so
 

4935
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:26,450
parent and hopefully again save lives so
so that was the impetus for the

4936
01:35:26,450 --> 01:35:26,460
so that was the impetus for the
 

4937
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,709
so that was the impetus for the
acquisition

4938
01:35:27,709 --> 01:35:27,719
acquisition
 

4939
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,810
acquisition
it's been a year

4940
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:29,820
it's been a year
 

4941
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:32,270
it's been a year
um so that I mean there's a lot of a lot

4942
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,280
um so that I mean there's a lot of a lot
 

4943
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:34,090
um so that I mean there's a lot of a lot
of questions really exciting space

4944
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:34,100
of questions really exciting space
 

4945
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:36,530
of questions really exciting space
especially to me I just find this a

4946
01:35:36,530 --> 01:35:36,540
especially to me I just find this a
 

4947
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,270
especially to me I just find this a
fascinating problem it could could

4948
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:38,280
fascinating problem it could could
 

4949
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:40,550
fascinating problem it could could
enrich the experience in the car in so

4950
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
enrich the experience in the car in so
 

4951
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:43,070
enrich the experience in the car in so
many ways especially because like we

4952
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:43,080
many ways especially because like we
 

4953
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:46,010
many ways especially because like we
spend still despite covet I mean Kobe

4954
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:46,020
spend still despite covet I mean Kobe
 

4955
01:35:46,020 --> 01:35:47,390
spend still despite covet I mean Kobe
changed things so it's in interesting

4956
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:47,400
changed things so it's in interesting
 

4957
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:49,610
changed things so it's in interesting
ways but I think the world is bouncing

4958
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:49,620
ways but I think the world is bouncing
 

4959
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,350
ways but I think the world is bouncing
back and we spend so much time in the

4960
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:51,360
back and we spend so much time in the
 

4961
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,290
back and we spend so much time in the
car and the car is such a

4962
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:53,300
car and the car is such a
 

4963
01:35:53,300 --> 01:35:55,010
car and the car is such a
weird

4964
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:55,020
weird
 

4965
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:57,350
weird
little world we have for ourselves like

little box that's like a psychology
 

4985
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,570
little box that's like a psychology
experiment because it feels like the

4986

is inside the car it's so interesting so

4990
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:30,120
is inside the car it's so interesting so
 

4991
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:32,810
is inside the car it's so interesting so
it's such an opportunity to explore

4992
01:36:32,810 --> 01:36:32,820
it's such an opportunity to explore
 

4993
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:35,390
it's such an opportunity to explore
how we can enrich

4994

how we can enrich
 

4995
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,189
how we can enrich
um how how companies can enrich that

4996

um how how companies can enrich that
 

4997
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:40,550
um how how companies can enrich that
experience and also as the cars get

then worry about costs later but I think
 

5041
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:32,570
then worry about costs later but I think
because the way the car industry works I

5042
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:32,580
because the way the car industry works I
 

5043
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:35,689
because the way the car industry works I
mean it's it's a very thin margin that

5044
01:37:35,689 --> 01:37:35,699
mean it's it's a very thin margin that
 

5045
01:37:35,699 --> 01:37:37,250
mean it's it's a very thin margin that
you get to operate under so you have to

5046
01:37:37,250 --> 01:37:37,260
you get to operate under so you have to
 

5047
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:39,110
you get to operate under so you have to
really really make sure that everything

5048
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:39,120
really really make sure that everything
 

5049
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:40,610
really really make sure that everything
you add to the car makes sense

5050
01:37:40,610 --> 01:37:40,620
you add to the car makes sense
 

5051
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:43,729
you add to the car makes sense
financially so anyways there is is this

5052
01:37:43,729 --> 01:37:43,739
financially so anyways there is is this
 

5053
01:37:43,739 --> 01:37:46,970
financially so anyways there is is this
new industry especially at this scale of

5054
01:37:46,970 --> 01:37:46,980
new industry especially at this scale of
 

5055
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:50,450
new industry especially at this scale of
Smart Eye does it hold any lessons for

5056
01:37:50,450 --> 01:37:50,460
Smart Eye does it hold any lessons for
 

5057
01:37:50,460 --> 01:37:53,270
Smart Eye does it hold any lessons for
you yeah I think it is a very tough

5058
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:53,280
you yeah I think it is a very tough
 

5059
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,270
you yeah I think it is a very tough
Market to to penetrate but once you're

5060
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:56,280
Market to to penetrate but once you're
 

5061
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,010
Market to to penetrate but once you're
in it's awesome because once you're in

5062
01:37:58,010 --> 01:37:58,020
in it's awesome because once you're in
 

5063
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:00,169
in it's awesome because once you're in
you're designed into these car models

5064
01:38:00,169 --> 01:38:00,179
you're designed into these car models
 

5065
01:38:00,179 --> 01:38:01,669
you're designed into these car models
for like somewhere between five to seven

5066
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
for like somewhere between five to seven
 

5067
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,010
for like somewhere between five to seven
years which is awesome and you just once

5068
01:38:04,010 --> 01:38:04,020
years which is awesome and you just once
 

5069
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,570
years which is awesome and you just once
they're on the road you just get paid a

5070
01:38:05,570 --> 01:38:05,580
they're on the road you just get paid a
 

5071
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:08,330
they're on the road you just get paid a
royalty fee per vehicle so it's a high

5072
01:38:08,330 --> 01:38:08,340
royalty fee per vehicle so it's a high
 

5073
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,550
royalty fee per vehicle so it's a high
barrier to entry but once you're in it's

5074
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
barrier to entry but once you're in it's
 

5075
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,689
barrier to entry but once you're in it's
amazing

5076
01:38:11,689 --> 01:38:11,699
amazing
 

5077
01:38:11,699 --> 01:38:13,370
amazing
I think the thing that I struggle the

5078
01:38:13,370 --> 01:38:13,380
I think the thing that I struggle the
 

5079
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,770
I think the thing that I struggle the
most with in in this industry is the

5080
01:38:15,770 --> 01:38:15,780
most with in in this industry is the
 

5081
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:18,169
most with in in this industry is the
time to Market so often we're asked to

5082
01:38:18,169 --> 01:38:18,179
time to Market so often we're asked to
 

5083
01:38:18,179 --> 01:38:21,470
time to Market so often we're asked to
lock or do a code freeze two years

5084
01:38:21,470 --> 01:38:21,480
lock or do a code freeze two years
 

5085
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,970
lock or do a code freeze two years
before the car is going to be on the

5086
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:22,980
before the car is going to be on the
 

5087
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,530
before the car is going to be on the
road I'm like guys like do you

5088
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:24,540
road I'm like guys like do you
 

5089
01:38:24,540 --> 01:38:26,149
road I'm like guys like do you
understand the pace with which

5090
01:38:26,149 --> 01:38:26,159
understand the pace with which
 

5091
01:38:26,159 --> 01:38:28,910
understand the pace with which
technology moves so I think car

5092
01:38:28,910 --> 01:38:28,920
technology moves so I think car
 

5093
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:32,270
technology moves so I think car
companies are really trying to make the

5094
01:38:32,270 --> 01:38:32,280
companies are really trying to make the
 

5095
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:33,709
companies are really trying to make the
Tesla

5096
01:38:33,709 --> 01:38:33,719
Tesla
 

5097
01:38:33,719 --> 01:38:36,169
Tesla
the Tesla transitioned to become more of

5098
01:38:36,169 --> 01:38:36,179
the Tesla transitioned to become more of
 

5099
01:38:36,179 --> 01:38:38,330
the Tesla transitioned to become more of
a software-driven

5100
01:38:38,330 --> 01:38:38,340
a software-driven
 

5101
01:38:38,340 --> 01:38:40,910
a software-driven
architecture and that's hard for many

5102
01:38:40,910 --> 01:38:40,920
architecture and that's hard for many
 

5103
01:38:40,920 --> 01:38:42,770
architecture and that's hard for many
it's just the cultural change I mean I'm

5104
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:42,780
it's just the cultural change I mean I'm
 

5105
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,090
it's just the cultural change I mean I'm
sure you've experienced that right oh

5106
01:38:44,090 --> 01:38:44,100
sure you've experienced that right oh
 

5107
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:46,510
sure you've experienced that right oh
definitely I think one of the biggest

5108
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:46,520
definitely I think one of the biggest
 

5109
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,850
definitely I think one of the biggest
inventions or imperatives created by

5110
01:38:49,850 --> 01:38:49,860
inventions or imperatives created by
 

5111
01:38:49,860 --> 01:38:52,490
inventions or imperatives created by
Tesla is

5112
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:52,500
Tesla is
 

5113
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:54,470
Tesla is
like to me personally okay people are

5114
01:38:54,470 --> 01:38:54,480
like to me personally okay people are
 

5115
01:38:54,480 --> 01:38:56,330
like to me personally okay people are
going to complain about this but I know

5116
01:38:56,330 --> 01:38:56,340
going to complain about this but I know
 

5117
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:59,390
going to complain about this but I know
electric vehicle I know autopilot AI

5118
01:38:59,390 --> 01:38:59,400
electric vehicle I know autopilot AI
 

5119
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:02,450
electric vehicle I know autopilot AI
stuff to me the software over there

5120
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:02,460
stuff to me the software over there
 

5121
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:04,850
stuff to me the software over there
software updates is like the biggest

5122
01:39:04,850 --> 01:39:04,860
software updates is like the biggest
 

5123
01:39:04,860 --> 01:39:08,750
software updates is like the biggest
revolution in cars and it is extremely

5124
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:08,760
revolution in cars and it is extremely
 

5125
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,430
revolution in cars and it is extremely
difficult to switch to that because it

5126
01:39:10,430 --> 01:39:10,440
difficult to switch to that because it
 

5127
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:11,930
difficult to switch to that because it
is a culture shift

5128
01:39:11,930 --> 01:39:11,940
is a culture shift
 

5129
01:39:11,940 --> 01:39:14,510
is a culture shift
it uh at first especially if you're not

5130
01:39:14,510 --> 01:39:14,520
it uh at first especially if you're not
 

5131
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:17,209
it uh at first especially if you're not
comfortable with it it seems dangerous

5132
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:17,219
comfortable with it it seems dangerous
 

5133
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:19,430
comfortable with it it seems dangerous
like there's a there's an approach to

5134
01:39:19,430 --> 01:39:19,440
like there's a there's an approach to
 

5135
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:22,550
like there's a there's an approach to
cars it's so safety focused for so many

5136
01:39:22,550 --> 01:39:22,560
cars it's so safety focused for so many
 

5137
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,370
cars it's so safety focused for so many
decades that like what do you mean we

5138
01:39:25,370 --> 01:39:25,380
decades that like what do you mean we
 

5139
01:39:25,380 --> 01:39:28,610
decades that like what do you mean we
dynamically change code the whole point

5140
01:39:28,610 --> 01:39:28,620
dynamically change code the whole point
 

5141
01:39:28,620 --> 01:39:32,149
dynamically change code the whole point
is you have a thing that you test like

5142
01:39:32,149 --> 01:39:32,159
is you have a thing that you test like
 

5143
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:33,550
is you have a thing that you test like
right

5144
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:33,560
right
 

5145
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:37,070
right
and like it's not reliable because you

5146
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:37,080
and like it's not reliable because you
 

5147
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,750
and like it's not reliable because you
know how much it costs if we have to

5148
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:38,760
know how much it costs if we have to
 

5149
01:39:38,760 --> 01:39:41,689
know how much it costs if we have to
recall these cars right like there's a

5150
01:39:41,689 --> 01:39:41,699
recall these cars right like there's a
 

5151
01:39:41,699 --> 01:39:44,470
recall these cars right like there's a
there's a and there's an understandable

5152
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,480
there's a and there's an understandable
 

5153
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,750
there's a and there's an understandable
obsession with safety but the downside

5154
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
obsession with safety but the downside
 

5155
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:50,629
obsession with safety but the downside
of an obsession with safety is the same

5156
01:39:50,629 --> 01:39:50,639
of an obsession with safety is the same
 

5157
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:53,750
of an obsession with safety is the same
as with being uh obsessed with safety as

5158
01:39:53,750 --> 01:39:53,760
as with being uh obsessed with safety as
 

5159
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,570
as with being uh obsessed with safety as
a parent is like if you do that too much

5160
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:56,580
a parent is like if you do that too much
 

5161
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:59,930
a parent is like if you do that too much
you limit the potential development and

5162
01:39:59,930 --> 01:39:59,940
you limit the potential development and
 

5163
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:01,550
you limit the potential development and
the flourishing of in that particular

5164
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:01,560
the flourishing of in that particular
 

5165
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,050
the flourishing of in that particular
aspect human being but in this

5166
01:40:03,050 --> 01:40:03,060
aspect human being but in this
 

5167
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,510
aspect human being but in this
particular aspect the software the the

5168
01:40:05,510 --> 01:40:05,520
particular aspect the software the the
 

5169
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:08,270
particular aspect the software the the
artificial neural network of it and um

5170
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:08,280
artificial neural network of it and um
 

5171
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,430
artificial neural network of it and um
but it's tough to do it's really tough

5172
01:40:10,430 --> 01:40:10,440
but it's tough to do it's really tough
 

5173
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:12,709
but it's tough to do it's really tough
to do culturally and technically like

5174
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
to do culturally and technically like
 

5175
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,450
to do culturally and technically like
the deployment the mass deployment of

5176
01:40:14,450 --> 01:40:14,460
the deployment the mass deployment of
 

5177
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:16,310
the deployment the mass deployment of
software is really really difficult but

5178
01:40:16,310 --> 01:40:16,320
software is really really difficult but
 

5179
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:17,689
software is really really difficult but
I hope that's where the industry is

5180
01:40:17,689 --> 01:40:17,699
I hope that's where the industry is
 

5181
01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:19,669
I hope that's where the industry is
doing one of the reasons I really want

5182
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:19,679
doing one of the reasons I really want
 

5183
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:21,410
doing one of the reasons I really want
Tesla succeed is exactly about that

5184
01:40:21,410 --> 01:40:21,420
Tesla succeed is exactly about that
 

5185
01:40:21,420 --> 01:40:23,629
Tesla succeed is exactly about that
point not autopilot not the electrical

5186
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:23,639
point not autopilot not the electrical
 

5187
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:27,229
point not autopilot not the electrical
vehicle but the softwarization yeah of

5188
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:27,239
vehicle but the softwarization yeah of
 

5189
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:29,330
vehicle but the softwarization yeah of
basically everything but cards

5190
01:40:29,330 --> 01:40:29,340
basically everything but cards
 

5191
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:31,310
basically everything but cards
especially because to me that's actually

5192
01:40:31,310 --> 01:40:31,320
especially because to me that's actually
 

5193
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:33,649
especially because to me that's actually
going to increase two things increase

5194
01:40:33,649 --> 01:40:33,659
going to increase two things increase
 

5195
01:40:33,659 --> 01:40:35,810
going to increase two things increase
safety yeah because you can update much

5196
01:40:35,810 --> 01:40:35,820
safety yeah because you can update much
 

5197
01:40:35,820 --> 01:40:37,970
safety yeah because you can update much
faster but also increase the

5198
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:37,980
faster but also increase the
 

5199
01:40:37,980 --> 01:40:41,090
faster but also increase the
effectiveness of uh folks like you who

5200
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:41,100
effectiveness of uh folks like you who
 

5201
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:43,189
effectiveness of uh folks like you who
dream about enriching The Human

5202
01:40:43,189 --> 01:40:43,199
dream about enriching The Human
 

5203
01:40:43,199 --> 01:40:45,890
dream about enriching The Human
Experience right with AI because you can

5204
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:45,900
Experience right with AI because you can
 

5205
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,750
Experience right with AI because you can
just like you can just like there's a

5206
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:47,760
just like you can just like there's a
 

5207
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:50,209
just like you can just like there's a
feature like you want like a new Emoji

5208
01:40:50,209 --> 01:40:50,219
feature like you want like a new Emoji
 

5209
01:40:50,219 --> 01:40:51,649
feature like you want like a new Emoji
or whatever like the way Tick Tock

5210
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:51,659
or whatever like the way Tick Tock
 

5211
01:40:51,659 --> 01:40:53,030
or whatever like the way Tick Tock
releases filters you can just release

5212
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:53,040
releases filters you can just release
 

5213
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,709
releases filters you can just release
that for in-car

5214
01:40:54,709 --> 01:40:54,719
that for in-car
 

5215
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:57,410
that for in-car
in car stuff so but yeah that that

5216
01:40:57,410 --> 01:40:57,420
in car stuff so but yeah that that
 

5217
01:40:57,420 --> 01:40:59,510
in car stuff so but yeah that that
that's definitely um

5218
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
that's definitely um
 

5219
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,310
that's definitely um
one of the use cases we're looking into

5220
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:01,320
one of the use cases we're looking into
 

5221
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:04,669
one of the use cases we're looking into
is once you know the sentiment of the

5222
01:41:04,669 --> 01:41:04,679
is once you know the sentiment of the
 

5223
01:41:04,679 --> 01:41:06,169
is once you know the sentiment of the
passengers of the vehicle you can

5224
01:41:06,169 --> 01:41:06,179
passengers of the vehicle you can
 

5225
01:41:06,179 --> 01:41:07,430
passengers of the vehicle you can
optimize

5226
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
optimize
 

5227
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,110
optimize
the temperature in the car you can

5228
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:09,120
the temperature in the car you can
 

5229
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,910
the temperature in the car you can
change the lighting right so if the

5230
01:41:10,910 --> 01:41:10,920
change the lighting right so if the
 

5231
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:12,830
change the lighting right so if the
backseat passengers are falling asleep

5232
01:41:12,830 --> 01:41:12,840
backseat passengers are falling asleep
 

5233
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,750
backseat passengers are falling asleep
you can dim the lights you can lower the

5234
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:14,760
you can dim the lights you can lower the
 

5235
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:16,550
you can dim the lights you can lower the
music right you can do all sorts of

5236
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
music right you can do all sorts of
 

5237
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,110
music right you can do all sorts of
things yeah

5238
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:18,120
things yeah
 

5239
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:19,610
things yeah
um I mean of course you could do that

5240
01:41:19,610 --> 01:41:19,620
um I mean of course you could do that
 

5241
01:41:19,620 --> 01:41:21,290
um I mean of course you could do that
kind of stuff with a two-year delay but

5242
01:41:21,290 --> 01:41:21,300
kind of stuff with a two-year delay but
 

5243
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:23,990
kind of stuff with a two-year delay but
it's tougher right yeah

5244
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:24,000
it's tougher right yeah
 

5245
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,950
it's tougher right yeah
um

5246
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
um
 

5247
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,430
um
do you think do you think uh Tesla or

5248
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:28,440
do you think do you think uh Tesla or
 

5249
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:30,649
do you think do you think uh Tesla or
waymo or some of these companies that

5250
01:41:30,649 --> 01:41:30,659
waymo or some of these companies that
 

5251
01:41:30,659 --> 01:41:31,490
waymo or some of these companies that
are doing

5252
01:41:31,490 --> 01:41:31,500
are doing
 

5253
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:33,770
are doing
of semi or fully autonomous driving

5254
01:41:33,770 --> 01:41:33,780
of semi or fully autonomous driving
 

5255
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:36,290
of semi or fully autonomous driving
should be doing driver sensing

5256
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:36,300
should be doing driver sensing
 

5257
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:38,629
should be doing driver sensing
yes are you thinking about that kind of

5258
01:41:38,629 --> 01:41:38,639
yes are you thinking about that kind of
 

5259
01:41:38,639 --> 01:41:41,689
yes are you thinking about that kind of
stuff so not just how we can enhance the

5260
01:41:41,689 --> 01:41:41,699
stuff so not just how we can enhance the
 

5261
01:41:41,699 --> 01:41:43,310
stuff so not just how we can enhance the
encap experience for cars that are

5262
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:43,320
encap experience for cars that are
 

5263
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:45,010
encap experience for cars that are
mainly driven but the ones that are

5264
01:41:45,010 --> 01:41:45,020
mainly driven but the ones that are
 

5265
01:41:45,020 --> 01:41:47,390
mainly driven but the ones that are
increasingly more autonomously driven

5266
01:41:47,390 --> 01:41:47,400
increasingly more autonomously driven
 

5267
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,470
increasingly more autonomously driven
you

5268
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:48,480
you
 

5269
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:51,050
you
if we fast forward to the universe where

5270
01:41:51,050 --> 01:41:51,060
if we fast forward to the universe where
 

5271
01:41:51,060 --> 01:41:52,910
if we fast forward to the universe where
it's fully autonomous I think interior

5272
01:41:52,910 --> 01:41:52,920
it's fully autonomous I think interior
 

5273
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:54,290
it's fully autonomous I think interior
sensing becomes extremely important

5274
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:54,300
sensing becomes extremely important
 

5275
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:56,570
sensing becomes extremely important
because the role of the driver isn't

5276
01:41:56,570 --> 01:41:56,580
because the role of the driver isn't
 

5277
01:41:56,580 --> 01:41:58,070
because the role of the driver isn't
just to drive if you think about the

5278
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
just to drive if you think about the
 

5279
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:00,830
just to drive if you think about the
driver almost manages manages the

5280
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:00,840
driver almost manages manages the
 

5281
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,450
driver almost manages manages the
Dynamics within a vehicle and so who's

5282
01:42:02,450 --> 01:42:02,460
Dynamics within a vehicle and so who's
 

5283
01:42:02,460 --> 01:42:04,010
Dynamics within a vehicle and so who's
going to play that role when it's an

5284
01:42:04,010 --> 01:42:04,020
going to play that role when it's an
 

5285
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:05,090
going to play that role when it's an
autonomous

5286
01:42:05,090 --> 01:42:05,100
autonomous
 

5287
01:42:05,100 --> 01:42:07,490
autonomous
car we want

5288
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:07,500
car we want
 

5289
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:09,709
car we want
a solution that is able to say oh my God

5290
01:42:09,709 --> 01:42:09,719
a solution that is able to say oh my God
 

5291
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:11,990
a solution that is able to say oh my God
like you know Lex is bored to death

5292
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:12,000
like you know Lex is bored to death
 

5293
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,490
like you know Lex is bored to death
because the car is moving way too slow

5294
01:42:13,490 --> 01:42:13,500
because the car is moving way too slow
 

5295
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:15,649
because the car is moving way too slow
let's engage Lex or rana's freaking out

5296
01:42:15,649 --> 01:42:15,659
let's engage Lex or rana's freaking out
 

5297
01:42:15,659 --> 01:42:17,750
let's engage Lex or rana's freaking out
because she doesn't trust this vehicle

5298
01:42:17,750 --> 01:42:17,760
because she doesn't trust this vehicle
 

5299
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:19,850
because she doesn't trust this vehicle
yet so let's tell Rana like a little bit

5300
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:19,860
yet so let's tell Rana like a little bit
 

5301
01:42:19,860 --> 01:42:21,770
yet so let's tell Rana like a little bit
more information about the route or

5302
01:42:21,770 --> 01:42:21,780
more information about the route or
 

5303
01:42:21,780 --> 01:42:24,410
more information about the route or
right so I think or or somebody's having

5304
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:24,420
right so I think or or somebody's having
 

5305
01:42:24,420 --> 01:42:26,149
right so I think or or somebody's having
a heart attack in the car like you need

5306
01:42:26,149 --> 01:42:26,159
a heart attack in the car like you need
 

5307
01:42:26,159 --> 01:42:28,250
a heart attack in the car like you need
interior sensing and fully autonomous

5308
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:28,260
interior sensing and fully autonomous
 

5309
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:30,590
interior sensing and fully autonomous
vehicles but with semi-autonomous

5310
01:42:30,590 --> 01:42:30,600
vehicles but with semi-autonomous
 

5311
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:32,209
vehicles but with semi-autonomous
vehicles I think it's

5312
01:42:32,209 --> 01:42:32,219
vehicles I think it's
 

5313
01:42:32,219 --> 01:42:34,189
vehicles I think it's
I think it's really key to have driver

5314
01:42:34,189 --> 01:42:34,199
I think it's really key to have driver
 

5315
01:42:34,199 --> 01:42:36,470
I think it's really key to have driver
monitoring because semi-autonomous means

5316
01:42:36,470 --> 01:42:36,480
monitoring because semi-autonomous means
 

5317
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,629
monitoring because semi-autonomous means
that sometimes the car is in charge

5318
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:38,639
that sometimes the car is in charge
 

5319
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:40,729
that sometimes the car is in charge
sometimes the driver is in charge or the

5320
01:42:40,729 --> 01:42:40,739
sometimes the driver is in charge or the
 

5321
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,830
sometimes the driver is in charge or the
co-pilot right and you need this you

5322
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:42,840
co-pilot right and you need this you
 

5323
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:44,629
co-pilot right and you need this you
need both systems to be on the same page

5324
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
need both systems to be on the same page
 

5325
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:46,669
need both systems to be on the same page
you need to know the car needs to know

5326
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:46,679
you need to know the car needs to know
 

5327
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:48,770
you need to know the car needs to know
if the driver's asleep before it

5328
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:48,780
if the driver's asleep before it
 

5329
01:42:48,780 --> 01:42:51,649
if the driver's asleep before it
transitions control over to the driver

5330
01:42:51,649 --> 01:42:51,659
transitions control over to the driver
 

5331
01:42:51,659 --> 01:42:54,169
transitions control over to the driver
and sometimes if the driver is too tired

5332
01:42:54,169 --> 01:42:54,179
and sometimes if the driver is too tired
 

5333
01:42:54,179 --> 01:42:56,390
and sometimes if the driver is too tired
the car can say I'm going to be a better

5334
01:42:56,390 --> 01:42:56,400
the car can say I'm going to be a better
 

5335
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:57,890
the car can say I'm going to be a better
driver than you are right now I'm taking

5336
01:42:57,890 --> 01:42:57,900
driver than you are right now I'm taking
 

5337
01:42:57,900 --> 01:43:00,169
driver than you are right now I'm taking
control over so this Dynamic this dance

5338
01:43:00,169 --> 01:43:00,179
control over so this Dynamic this dance
 

5339
01:43:00,179 --> 01:43:02,390
control over so this Dynamic this dance
is so key and you can't do that without

5340
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
is so key and you can't do that without
 

5341
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,010
is so key and you can't do that without
driver sensing yeah there's a

5342
01:43:04,010 --> 01:43:04,020
driver sensing yeah there's a
 

5343
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:05,629
driver sensing yeah there's a
disagreement for the longest time I've

5344
01:43:05,629 --> 01:43:05,639
disagreement for the longest time I've
 

5345
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:07,850
disagreement for the longest time I've
had to deal on that this is obvious that

5346
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:07,860
had to deal on that this is obvious that
 

5347
01:43:07,860 --> 01:43:09,470
had to deal on that this is obvious that
this should be in the Tesla from day one

5348
01:43:09,470 --> 01:43:09,480
this should be in the Tesla from day one
 

5349
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:13,010
this should be in the Tesla from day one
and it's obvious the driver sensing is

5350
01:43:13,010 --> 01:43:13,020
and it's obvious the driver sensing is
 

5351
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,010
and it's obvious the driver sensing is
not a hindrance it's not obvious

5352
01:43:16,010 --> 01:43:16,020
not a hindrance it's not obvious
 

5353
01:43:16,020 --> 01:43:17,689
not a hindrance it's not obvious
that's I should I should be careful

5354
01:43:17,689 --> 01:43:17,699
that's I should I should be careful
 

5355
01:43:17,699 --> 01:43:19,990
that's I should I should be careful
because having studied this problem

5356
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,000
because having studied this problem
 

5357
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,090
because having studied this problem
nothing is really obvious but it seems

5358
01:43:23,090 --> 01:43:23,100
nothing is really obvious but it seems
 

5359
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:24,950
nothing is really obvious but it seems
very likely a driver sensing is not a

um enriching to the experience
 

5365
01:43:31,219 --> 01:43:35,030
um enriching to the experience
uh and likely increases the safety that

5366
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:35,040
uh and likely increases the safety that

it is very surprising to me uh just
having studied semi-autonomous driving

how well humans are able to manage that

5374
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:44,520
how well humans are able to manage that

how well humans are able to manage that
dance because it was the intuition

dance because it was the intuition
 

5377
01:43:46,920 --> 01:43:48,890
dance because it was the intuition
before you were doing that kind of thing

5378
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:48,900
before you were doing that kind of thing
 

5379
01:43:48,900 --> 01:43:53,390
before you were doing that kind of thing
that humans will become just incredibly

distracted they would just like let the
 

5383
01:43:55,199 --> 01:43:57,410
distracted they would just like let the
thing do its thing but they're able to

5384
01:43:57,410 --> 01:43:57,420
thing do its thing but they're able to
 

5385
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,970
thing do its thing but they're able to
you know because it is life and death

01:43:58,970 --> 01:43:58,980
you know because it is life and death
 

5387
01:43:58,980 --> 01:44:00,350
you know because it is life and death
right and they're able to manage that

5388
01:44:00,350 --> 01:44:00,360
right and they're able to manage that
 

5389
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:02,689
right and they're able to manage that
somehow but that said there's no reason

5390
01:44:02,689 --> 01:44:02,699
somehow but that said there's no reason
 

5391
01:44:02,699 --> 01:44:04,430
somehow but that said there's no reason
not to have driver sensing on top of

that I feel like that's going to
 

5395
01:44:07,260 --> 01:44:10,490
that I feel like that's going to
allow you to do that dance that you're

5396
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:10,500
allow you to do that dance that you're
 

5397
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:12,290
allow you to do that dance that you're
currently doing without driver sensing

thinking about The Human Experience
 

5451
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:07,490
thinking about The Human Experience
they're thinking about the features and

5452
01:45:07,490 --> 01:45:07,500
they're thinking about the features and
 

5453
01:45:07,500 --> 01:45:10,189
they're thinking about the features and
yeah the perceptual abilities of that

5454
01:45:10,189 --> 01:45:10,199
yeah the perceptual abilities of that
 

5455
01:45:10,199 --> 01:45:12,410
yeah the perceptual abilities of that
thing they think the best way I can

5456
01:45:12,410 --> 01:45:12,420
thing they think the best way I can
 

5457
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:15,830
thing they think the best way I can
serve the human is by doing the best

5458
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
serve the human is by doing the best

01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:17,990
serve the human is by doing the best
perception and control I can by looking

5460
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:18,000
perception and control I can by looking
 

5461
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:19,490
perception and control I can by looking
at the external environment keeping the

5462
01:45:19,490 --> 01:45:19,500
at the external environment keeping the
 

5463
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:21,709
at the external environment keeping the
human safe right but like there's a huge

5464
01:45:21,709 --> 01:45:21,719
human safe right but like there's a huge
 

5465
01:45:21,719 --> 01:45:26,450
human safe right but like there's a huge
I'm here right like uh you know I I need

5466
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:26,460
I'm here right like uh you know I I need
 

5467
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:29,330
I'm here right like uh you know I I need
to be uh noticed and

5468
01:45:29,330 --> 01:45:29,340
to be uh noticed and
 

5469
01:45:29,340 --> 01:45:30,350
to be uh noticed and
um

5470
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:30,360
um
 

5471
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,990
um
interacted with and understood and all

01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:33,000
interacted with and understood and all
 

5473
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,310
interacted with and understood and all
those kinds of things even just on a

01:45:34,310 --> 01:45:34,320
those kinds of things even just on a
 

5475
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,450
those kinds of things even just on a
personal level for entertainment

5476
01:45:35,450 --> 01:45:35,460
personal level for entertainment
 

5477
01:45:35,460 --> 01:45:38,390
personal level for entertainment
honestly for entertainment yeah yeah

um you know one of the coolest work we

5480
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:40,440
um you know one of the coolest work we
 

5481
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,050
um you know one of the coolest work we
did in collaboration with MIT around

5482
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:42,060
did in collaboration with MIT around
 

5483
01:45:42,060 --> 01:45:44,030
did in collaboration with MIT around
this was we looked at longitudinal data

5484
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:44,040
this was we looked at longitudinal data
 

5485
01:45:44,040 --> 01:45:47,689
this was we looked at longitudinal data
right after because because you know

5486
01:45:47,689 --> 01:45:47,699
right after because because you know
 

5487
01:45:47,699 --> 01:45:49,790
right after because because you know
MIT has access to like

5488
01:45:49,790 --> 01:45:49,800
MIT has access to like
 

5489
01:45:49,800 --> 01:45:51,830
MIT has access to like
tons of data

5490
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:51,840
tons of data
 

5491
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:53,870
tons of data
um and we and and like just seeing the

5492
01:45:53,870 --> 01:45:53,880
um and we and and like just seeing the
 

5493
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:55,550
um and we and and like just seeing the
patterns of people like driving in the

5494
01:45:55,550 --> 01:45:55,560
patterns of people like driving in the
 

5495
01:45:55,560 --> 01:45:57,649
patterns of people like driving in the
morning versus off to work versus like

5496
01:45:57,649 --> 01:45:57,659
morning versus off to work versus like
 

5497
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:59,629
morning versus off to work versus like
commuting back from work or weekend

5498
01:45:59,629 --> 01:45:59,639
commuting back from work or weekend
 

5499
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:02,209
commuting back from work or weekend
driving versus weekday driving

5500
01:46:02,209 --> 01:46:02,219
driving versus weekday driving
 

5501
01:46:02,219 --> 01:46:04,910
driving versus weekday driving
and is what is so cool if your car knew

5502
01:46:04,910 --> 01:46:04,920
and is what is so cool if your car knew
 

5503
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:07,910
and is what is so cool if your car knew
that and then was able to optimize

5504
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:07,920
that and then was able to optimize
 

5505
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,430
that and then was able to optimize
either the route or the experience or

5506
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:10,440
either the route or the experience or
 

5507
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,709
either the route or the experience or
even make recommendations yeah I think

5508
01:46:12,709 --> 01:46:12,719
even make recommendations yeah I think
 

5509
01:46:12,719 --> 01:46:14,810
even make recommendations yeah I think
it's very powerful yeah like why are you

5510
01:46:14,810 --> 01:46:14,820
it's very powerful yeah like why are you
 

5511
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:17,090
it's very powerful yeah like why are you
taking this route you've always unhappy

5512
01:46:17,090 --> 01:46:17,100
taking this route you've always unhappy

remember about that
 

5693
01:49:45,239 --> 01:49:46,790
remember about that
let's think about that right before

5694
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:46,800
let's think about that right before
 

5695
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,250
let's think about that right before
you're eating this no I don't it's for

5696
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:49,260
you're eating this no I don't it's for
 

5697
01:49:49,260 --> 01:49:50,629
you're eating this no I don't it's for
some probably that would work for me

5698
01:49:50,629 --> 01:49:50,639
some probably that would work for me
 

5699
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:52,450
some probably that would work for me
like a refrigerator that is just

5700
01:49:52,450 --> 01:49:52,460
like a refrigerator that is just
 

5701
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:55,609
like a refrigerator that is just
ruthless it's shaming me but like I

5702
01:49:55,609 --> 01:49:55,619
ruthless it's shaming me but like I
 

5703
01:49:55,619 --> 01:49:58,070
ruthless it's shaming me but like I
would of course welcome it like right

5704
01:49:58,070 --> 01:49:58,080
would of course welcome it like right
 

5705
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,470
would of course welcome it like right
that would work for me just that that

5706
01:50:00,470 --> 01:50:00,480
that would work for me just that that
 

5707
01:50:00,480 --> 01:50:02,629
that would work for me just that that
well I would know I think it would if

5708
01:50:02,629 --> 01:50:02,639
well I would know I think it would if
 

5709
01:50:02,639 --> 01:50:04,850
well I would know I think it would if
it's really like smart it would optimize

5710
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:04,860
it's really like smart it would optimize
 

5711
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,890
it's really like smart it would optimize

state of alcohol intoxication research
 

5723
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,189
state of alcohol intoxication research
so for people who don't know every year

5724
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:22,199
so for people who don't know every year
 

5725
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,290
so for people who don't know every year
1.3 million people around the world die

5726
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:24,300
1.3 million people around the world die
 

5727
01:50:24,300 --> 01:50:25,850
1.3 million people around the world die
in Road crashes

5728
01:50:25,850 --> 01:50:25,860
in Road crashes
 

5729
01:50:25,860 --> 01:50:28,310
in Road crashes
and more than 20 percent of these

5730
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
and more than 20 percent of these
 

5731
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,290
and more than 20 percent of these
fatalities are estimated to be alcohol

5732
01:50:30,290 --> 01:50:30,300
fatalities are estimated to be alcohol
 

5733
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:32,390
fatalities are estimated to be alcohol
related a lot of them are also

5734
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:32,400
related a lot of them are also
 

5735
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:35,149
related a lot of them are also
distraction related so can AI help with

5736
01:50:35,149 --> 01:50:35,159
distraction related so can AI help with
 

5737
01:50:35,159 --> 01:50:36,830
distraction related so can AI help with
the alcohol thing

5738
01:50:36,830 --> 01:50:36,840
the alcohol thing
 

5739
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,689
the alcohol thing
I

5740
01:50:38,689 --> 01:50:38,699
I
 

5741
01:50:38,699 --> 01:50:41,810
I
answer is yes there are signals and we

5742
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:41,820
answer is yes there are signals and we
 

5743
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,609
answer is yes there are signals and we
know that as humans like we can tell in

5744
01:50:43,609 --> 01:50:43,619
know that as humans like we can tell in
 

5745
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:45,830
know that as humans like we can tell in
a person

5746
01:50:45,830 --> 01:50:45,840
a person
 

5747
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:48,290
a person
you know is it different phases of being

5748
01:50:48,290 --> 01:50:48,300
you know is it different phases of being
 

5749
01:50:48,300 --> 01:50:49,609
you know is it different phases of being
drunk

5750
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:49,619
drunk
 

5751
01:50:49,619 --> 01:50:52,310
drunk
um right yeah and I think you can use

5752
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
um right yeah and I think you can use
 

5753
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:54,350
um right yeah and I think you can use
technology to do the same and again I

5754
01:50:54,350 --> 01:50:54,360
technology to do the same and again I
 

5755
01:50:54,360 --> 01:50:55,729
technology to do the same and again I
think the ultimate solution is going to

5756
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:55,739
think the ultimate solution is going to
 

5757
01:50:55,739 --> 01:50:58,370
think the ultimate solution is going to
be a combination of different sensors

5758
01:50:58,370 --> 01:50:58,380
be a combination of different sensors
 

5759
01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:00,050
be a combination of different sensors

5765
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:07,070

part is getting the data right it's like

5766
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:07,080
part is getting the data right it's like
 

5767
01:51:07,080 --> 01:51:10,010
part is getting the data right it's like
getting enough data examples so we for

5768
01:51:10,010 --> 01:51:10,020
getting enough data examples so we for
 

5769
01:51:10,020 --> 01:51:12,050
getting enough data examples so we for
This research project we partnered with

5770
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:12,060
This research project we partnered with
 

5771
01:51:12,060 --> 01:51:14,890
This research project we partnered with
the transportation authorities of Sweden

5772
01:51:14,890 --> 01:51:14,900
the transportation authorities of Sweden
 

5773
01:51:14,900 --> 01:51:18,169
the transportation authorities of Sweden
and we literally had a race track with a

5774
01:51:18,169 --> 01:51:18,179
and we literally had a race track with a
 

5775
01:51:18,179 --> 01:51:19,910
and we literally had a race track with a
safety driver and and we basically

5776
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
safety driver and and we basically
 

5777
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,850
safety driver and and we basically
progressively got people drunk nice so

5778
01:51:22,850 --> 01:51:22,860
progressively got people drunk nice so
 

5779
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,830
progressively got people drunk nice so
but but you know

5780
01:51:24,830 --> 01:51:24,840
but but you know
 

5781
01:51:24,840 --> 01:51:27,229
but but you know
uh that's that's a very expensive data

5782
01:51:27,229 --> 01:51:27,239
uh that's that's a very expensive data
 

5783
01:51:27,239 --> 01:51:29,209
uh that's that's a very expensive data
set to to to collect and you want to

5784
01:51:29,209 --> 01:51:29,219
set to to to collect and you want to
 

5785
01:51:29,219 --> 01:51:31,129
set to to to collect and you want to
collect it globally and in multiple

5786
01:51:31,129 --> 01:51:31,139
collect it globally and in multiple
 

5787
01:51:31,139 --> 01:51:34,189
collect it globally and in multiple
conditions and yeah the the ethics of

5788
01:51:34,189 --> 01:51:34,199
conditions and yeah the the ethics of
 

5789
01:51:34,199 --> 01:51:35,750
conditions and yeah the the ethics of
collecting a data set where people are

5790
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:35,760
collecting a data set where people are
 

5791
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:37,250
collecting a data set where people are
drunk is tricky

5792
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:37,260
drunk is tricky
 

5793
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,490
drunk is tricky
yeah definitely which is funny because I

5794
01:51:40,490 --> 01:51:40,500
yeah definitely which is funny because I
 

5795
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,609
yeah definitely which is funny because I
mean let's put Drunk Driving aside the

5796
01:51:43,609 --> 01:51:43,619
mean let's put Drunk Driving aside the
 

5797
01:51:43,619 --> 01:51:44,990
mean let's put Drunk Driving aside the
number of drunk people in the world

5798
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:45,000
number of drunk people in the world
 

5799
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,510
number of drunk people in the world
every day is very large right it'd be

5800
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:47,520
every day is very large right it'd be
 

5801
01:51:47,520 --> 01:51:49,010
every day is very large right it'd be
nice to have a large data set of drunk

5802
01:51:49,010 --> 01:51:49,020
nice to have a large data set of drunk
 

5803
01:51:49,020 --> 01:51:50,689
nice to have a large data set of drunk
people getting progressively drunk in

5804
01:51:50,689 --> 01:51:50,699
people getting progressively drunk in
 

5805
01:51:50,699 --> 01:51:52,070
people getting progressively drunk in
fact you could build an app where people

5806
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:52,080
fact you could build an app where people
 

5807
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:53,629
fact you could build an app where people
can donate their data because it's

5808
01:51:53,629 --> 01:51:53,639
can donate their data because it's
 

5809
01:51:53,639 --> 01:51:57,169
can donate their data because it's
hilarious right actually yeah but but

5810
01:51:57,169 --> 01:51:57,179
hilarious right actually yeah but but
 

5811
01:51:57,179 --> 01:51:59,990
hilarious right actually yeah but but
the liability liability the ethics the

5812
01:51:59,990 --> 01:52:00,000
the liability liability the ethics the
 

5813
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,490
the liability liability the ethics the
how do you get it right It's Tricky it's

5814
01:52:01,490 --> 01:52:01,500
how do you get it right It's Tricky it's
 

5815
01:52:01,500 --> 01:52:03,530
how do you get it right It's Tricky it's
really really tricky because like

5816
01:52:03,530 --> 01:52:03,540
really really tricky because like
 

5817
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:05,629
really really tricky because like
drinking is one of those things that's

5818
01:52:05,629 --> 01:52:05,639
drinking is one of those things that's
 

5819
01:52:05,639 --> 01:52:07,970
drinking is one of those things that's
funny and hilarious and what loves it's

funny and hilarious and what loves it's
 

5821
01:52:07,980 --> 01:52:10,609
funny and hilarious and what loves it's
social the so on and so forth but it's

5822
01:52:10,609 --> 01:52:10,619
social the so on and so forth but it's
 

5823
01:52:10,619 --> 01:52:12,890
social the so on and so forth but it's
also the thing that uh hurts a lot of

5824
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:12,900
also the thing that uh hurts a lot of
 

5825

healthy
 

5883
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:16,729
healthy
um so I yeah I'm definitely gonna do

a very fast you mentioned Atomic Habits
 

5903
01:53:40,380 --> 01:53:43,070
a very fast you mentioned Atomic Habits
Like very clear way summarizes the

5904
01:53:43,070 --> 01:53:43,080
Like very clear way summarizes the
 

5905
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:44,030
Like very clear way summarizes the
research

5906
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:44,040
research
 

5907
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:46,790

in a way that leads to Protocols of what
 

5909
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:48,410
in a way that leads to Protocols of what
you should do he's really big on like

5910
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:48,420
you should do he's really big on like
 

5911
01:53:48,420 --> 01:53:50,990
you should do he's really big on like
that not like this is what the science

5912
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,000
that not like this is what the science
 

5913

01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:54,600
should be doing according to the side so
 

5917
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,689

like he's really big and there's a lot
of recommendations he does

5920

of recommendations he does
 

5921
01:53:58,560 --> 01:54:02,209
of recommendations he does
uh which several of them I definitely

your physical you know your heart rate

5986
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:08,820
your physical you know your heart rate
 

5987
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:10,609
your physical you know your heart rate
and your heart rate variability and your

5988
01:55:10,609 --> 01:55:10,619
and your heart rate variability and your
 

5989
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:12,470
and your heart rate variability and your
breathing rate

5990
01:55:12,470 --> 01:55:12,480
breathing rate
 

5991
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:13,729
breathing rate
um

5992
01:55:13,729 --> 01:55:13,739
um
 

5993
01:55:13,739 --> 01:55:16,490
um
and it can start like optimizing yeah it

5994
01:55:16,490 --> 01:55:16,500
and it can start like optimizing yeah it
 

5995
01:55:16,500 --> 01:55:19,189
and it can start like optimizing yeah it
can optimize the ride based on what your

5996
01:55:19,189 --> 01:55:19,199
can optimize the ride based on what your
 

5997
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:20,629
can optimize the ride based on what your
goals are so I think we're going to

5998
01:55:20,629 --> 01:55:20,639
goals are so I think we're going to
 

5999
01:55:20,639 --> 01:55:22,609
goals are so I think we're going to
start to see more of that I'm I'm

6000
01:55:22,609 --> 01:55:22,619
start to see more of that I'm I'm
 

6001
01:55:22,619 --> 01:55:25,310
start to see more of that I'm I'm
excited about that yeah what are the

6002
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:25,320
excited about that yeah what are the
 

6003
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:27,169
excited about that yeah what are the
what are the challenges you're tackling

6004
01:55:27,169 --> 01:55:27,179
what are the challenges you're tackling
 

6005
01:55:27,179 --> 01:55:29,090
what are the challenges you're tackling
well with Smart Eye currently what's

6006
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:29,100
well with Smart Eye currently what's
 

6007
01:55:29,100 --> 01:55:31,609
well with Smart Eye currently what's
like the the trickiest things

6008
01:55:31,609 --> 01:55:31,619
like the the trickiest things
 

6009
01:55:31,619 --> 01:55:34,490
like the the trickiest things
to get is it is it basically convincing

6010
01:55:34,490 --> 01:55:34,500
to get is it is it basically convincing
 

6011
01:55:34,500 --> 01:55:36,830
to get is it is it basically convincing
more and more car companies that having

6012
01:55:36,830 --> 01:55:36,840
more and more car companies that having
 

6013
01:55:36,840 --> 01:55:38,990
more and more car companies that having
AI inside the car is a good idea or is

6014
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:39,000
AI inside the car is a good idea or is
 

6015
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:40,250
AI inside the car is a good idea or is
there some

6016
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:40,260
there some
 

6017
01:55:40,260 --> 01:55:42,830
there some
is is there more technical

6018
01:55:42,830 --> 01:55:42,840
is is there more technical
 

6019
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:45,470
is is there more technical
algorithmic challenges what's what's

6020
01:55:45,470 --> 01:55:45,480
algorithmic challenges what's what's
 

6021
01:55:45,480 --> 01:55:47,990
algorithmic challenges what's what's
been keeping you mentally busy

6022
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:48,000
been keeping you mentally busy
 

6023
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:50,390
been keeping you mentally busy
a lot of the car companies we are in

6024
01:55:50,390 --> 01:55:50,400
a lot of the car companies we are in
 

6025
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:51,709
a lot of the car companies we are in
conversations with are already

6026
01:55:51,709 --> 01:55:51,719
conversations with are already
 

6027
01:55:51,719 --> 01:55:53,510
conversations with are already
interested in definitely driver

6028
01:55:53,510 --> 01:55:53,520
interested in definitely driver
 

6029
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:55,669
interested in definitely driver
monitoring like I think it's becoming a

6030
01:55:55,669 --> 01:55:55,679
monitoring like I think it's becoming a
 

6031
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:58,310
monitoring like I think it's becoming a
must-have but even interior sensing I

6032
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,320
must-have but even interior sensing I
 

6033
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,229
must-have but even interior sensing I
can see like we're engaged in a lot of

6034
01:56:00,229 --> 01:56:00,239
can see like we're engaged in a lot of
 

6035
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:01,970
can see like we're engaged in a lot of
like Advanced engineering projects and

6036
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:01,980
like Advanced engineering projects and
 

6037
01:56:01,980 --> 01:56:04,129
like Advanced engineering projects and
proof of Concepts

6038
01:56:04,129 --> 01:56:04,139
proof of Concepts
 

6039
01:56:04,139 --> 01:56:06,830
proof of Concepts
um I think technologically though and

6040
01:56:06,830 --> 01:56:06,840
um I think technologically though and
 

6041
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:08,750
um I think technologically though and
the even the technology I can see a path

6042
01:56:08,750 --> 01:56:08,760
the even the technology I can see a path
 

6043
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:11,270
the even the technology I can see a path
to making it happen I think it's the use

6044
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:11,280
to making it happen I think it's the use
 

6045
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:14,270
to making it happen I think it's the use
case like how does the car respond

6046
01:56:14,270 --> 01:56:14,280
case like how does the car respond
 

6047
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:16,189
case like how does the car respond
once it knows something about you

6048
01:56:16,189 --> 01:56:16,199
once it knows something about you
 

6049
01:56:16,199 --> 01:56:17,750
once it knows something about you
because you wanted to respond in a

6050
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:17,760
because you wanted to respond in a
 

6051
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,149
because you wanted to respond in a
thoughtful way that doesn't that isn't

6052
01:56:20,149 --> 01:56:20,159
thoughtful way that doesn't that isn't
 

6053
01:56:20,159 --> 01:56:23,149
thoughtful way that doesn't that isn't
off-putting to the consumer in the car

6054
01:56:23,149 --> 01:56:23,159
off-putting to the consumer in the car
 

6055
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:25,129
off-putting to the consumer in the car
so I think that's like the user

6056
01:56:25,129 --> 01:56:25,139
so I think that's like the user
 

6057
01:56:25,139 --> 01:56:26,689
so I think that's like the user
experience I don't think we've really

6058
01:56:26,689 --> 01:56:26,699
experience I don't think we've really
 

6059
01:56:26,699 --> 01:56:29,510
experience I don't think we've really
nailed that and we usually

6060
01:56:29,510 --> 01:56:29,520
nailed that and we usually
 

6061
01:56:29,520 --> 01:56:31,490
nailed that and we usually
that's not part we're the sensing

6062
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:31,500
that's not part we're the sensing
 

6063
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,410
that's not part we're the sensing
platform but we usually collaborate with

6064
01:56:33,410 --> 01:56:33,420
platform but we usually collaborate with
 

6065
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:35,390
platform but we usually collaborate with
the car manufacturer to decide what the

6066
01:56:35,390 --> 01:56:35,400
the car manufacturer to decide what the
 

6067
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:37,669
the car manufacturer to decide what the
use case is so so say you do you figure

6068
01:56:37,669 --> 01:56:37,679
use case is so so say you do you figure
 

6069
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:39,410
use case is so so say you do you figure
out that somebody's angry while driving

6070
01:56:39,410 --> 01:56:39,420
out that somebody's angry while driving
 

6071
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:42,649
out that somebody's angry while driving
okay what should the car do

6072
01:56:42,649 --> 01:56:42,659
okay what should the car do
 

6073
01:56:42,659 --> 01:56:45,050
okay what should the car do
you know do you see yourself as a role

6074
01:56:45,050 --> 01:56:45,060
you know do you see yourself as a role
 

6075
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:46,850
you know do you see yourself as a role
of of nudging

6076
01:56:46,850 --> 01:56:46,860
of of nudging
 

6077
01:56:46,860 --> 01:56:49,910
of of nudging
of like basically coming up with

6078
01:56:49,910 --> 01:56:49,920
of like basically coming up with
 

6079
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:52,609
of like basically coming up with
Solutions essentially that and then and

6080
01:56:52,609 --> 01:56:52,619
Solutions essentially that and then and
 

6081
01:56:52,619 --> 01:56:54,649
Solutions essentially that and then and
then the the car manufacturers kind of

6082
01:56:54,649 --> 01:56:54,659
then the the car manufacturers kind of
 

6083
01:56:54,659 --> 01:56:56,570
then the the car manufacturers kind of
put their own little spin on it right

6084
01:56:56,570 --> 01:56:56,580
put their own little spin on it right
 

6085
01:56:56,580 --> 01:56:59,950
put their own little spin on it right
like we we are like the ideation

6086
01:56:59,950 --> 01:56:59,960
like we we are like the ideation
 

6087
01:56:59,960 --> 01:57:03,169
like we we are like the ideation
creative thought partner but at the end

6088
01:57:03,169 --> 01:57:03,179
creative thought partner but at the end
 

6089
01:57:03,179 --> 01:57:04,910
creative thought partner but at the end
of the day the car company needs to

6090
01:57:04,910 --> 01:57:04,920
of the day the car company needs to
 

6091
01:57:04,920 --> 01:57:06,590
of the day the car company needs to
decide what's on brand for them right

6092
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:06,600
decide what's on brand for them right
 

6093
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,930
decide what's on brand for them right
like maybe when it figures out that

6094
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:08,940
like maybe when it figures out that
 

6095
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:11,390
like maybe when it figures out that
you're distracted or drowsy it shows you

6096
01:57:11,390 --> 01:57:11,400
you're distracted or drowsy it shows you
 

6097
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,609
you're distracted or drowsy it shows you
a coffee cup right or maybe it takes

6098
01:57:13,609 --> 01:57:13,619
a coffee cup right or maybe it takes
 

6099
01:57:13,619 --> 01:57:15,470
a coffee cup right or maybe it takes
more aggressive behaviors and basically

6100
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:15,480
more aggressive behaviors and basically
 

6101
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:17,270
more aggressive behaviors and basically
said okay if you don't like take a rest

6102
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:17,280
said okay if you don't like take a rest
 

6103
01:57:17,280 --> 01:57:18,890
said okay if you don't like take a rest
in the next five minutes the car's gonna

6104
01:57:18,890 --> 01:57:18,900
in the next five minutes the car's gonna
 

6105
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,570
in the next five minutes the car's gonna
shut down right like there's a whole

6106
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:20,580
shut down right like there's a whole
 

6107
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:23,390
shut down right like there's a whole
range of actions the car can take and

6108
01:57:23,390 --> 01:57:23,400
range of actions the car can take and
 

6109
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:26,330
range of actions the car can take and
doing the thing that is most yeah that

6110
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:26,340
doing the thing that is most yeah that
 

6111
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:28,790
doing the thing that is most yeah that
builds trust with the driver and the

6112
01:57:28,790 --> 01:57:28,800
builds trust with the driver and the
 

6113
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,950
builds trust with the driver and the
passengers I think that's what we need

6114
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:30,960
passengers I think that's what we need
 

6115
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,470
passengers I think that's what we need
to be very careful about

6116
01:57:33,470 --> 01:57:33,480
to be very careful about
 

6117
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:35,570
to be very careful about
yeah car companies are funny because

6118
01:57:35,570 --> 01:57:35,580
yeah car companies are funny because
 

6119
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:37,370
yeah car companies are funny because
they have their own like I mean that's

6120
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:37,380
they have their own like I mean that's
 

6121
01:57:37,380 --> 01:57:40,129
they have their own like I mean that's
why people get cars still I hope that

6122
01:57:40,129 --> 01:57:40,139
why people get cars still I hope that
 

6123
01:57:40,139 --> 01:57:41,629
why people get cars still I hope that
changes but they get it because it's a

6124
01:57:41,629 --> 01:57:41,639
changes but they get it because it's a
 

6125
01:57:41,639 --> 01:57:44,030
changes but they get it because it's a
certain feel and look and it's a certain

6126
01:57:44,030 --> 01:57:44,040
certain feel and look and it's a certain
 

6127
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:46,810
certain feel and look and it's a certain
they become proud like

6128
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:46,820
they become proud like
 

6129
01:57:46,820 --> 01:57:50,390
they become proud like
Mercedes-Benz or BMW or whatever

6130
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:50,400
Mercedes-Benz or BMW or whatever
 

6131
01:57:50,400 --> 01:57:52,550
Mercedes-Benz or BMW or whatever
and that's their thing that's the family

6132
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:52,560
and that's their thing that's the family
 

6133
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:54,410
and that's their thing that's the family
brand or something like that remember

6134
01:57:54,410 --> 01:57:54,420
brand or something like that remember
 

6135
01:57:54,420 --> 01:57:56,810
brand or something like that remember
Ford or GM whatever they they stick to

6136
01:57:56,810 --> 01:57:56,820
Ford or GM whatever they they stick to
 

6137
01:57:56,820 --> 01:57:58,910
Ford or GM whatever they they stick to
that thing yeah it's interesting it's

6138
01:57:58,910 --> 01:57:58,920
that thing yeah it's interesting it's
 

6139
01:57:58,920 --> 01:58:01,129
that thing yeah it's interesting it's
like it should be I don't know it it

6140
01:58:01,129 --> 01:58:01,139
like it should be I don't know it it
 

6141
01:58:01,139 --> 01:58:02,870
like it should be I don't know it it
should be a little

6142
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:02,880
should be a little
 

6143
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,290
should be a little
more about the technology inside

6144
01:58:06,290 --> 01:58:06,300
more about the technology inside
 

6145
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:09,050
more about the technology inside
and I suppose there too there could be a

6146
01:58:09,050 --> 01:58:09,060
and I suppose there too there could be a
 

6147
01:58:09,060 --> 01:58:12,169
and I suppose there too there could be a
branding like a very specific style of

6148
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:12,179
branding like a very specific style of
 

6149
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:15,229
branding like a very specific style of
luxury or fun right right all that kind

6150
01:58:15,229 --> 01:58:15,239
luxury or fun right right all that kind
 

6151

01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,119
of stuff yeah you know I'm um I have a I
 

6153
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:20,270
of stuff yeah you know I'm um I have a I
have an AI focused fund to invest in

6154
01:58:20,270 --> 01:58:20,280
have an AI focused fund to invest in
 

6155
01:58:20,280 --> 01:58:22,729
have an AI focused fund to invest in
early stage kind of AI driven companies

6156
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:22,739
early stage kind of AI driven companies
 

6157
01:58:22,739 --> 01:58:23,990
early stage kind of AI driven companies
and one of the companies we're looking

6158
01:58:23,990 --> 01:58:24,000
and one of the companies we're looking
 

6159
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,270
and one of the companies we're looking
at is trying to do what Tesla did but

6160
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:26,280
at is trying to do what Tesla did but
 

6161
01:58:26,280 --> 01:58:28,970
at is trying to do what Tesla did but
for boats for recreational votes yeah

6162
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:28,980
for boats for recreational votes yeah
 

6163
01:58:28,980 --> 01:58:30,410
for boats for recreational votes yeah
they're so they're building an electric

6164
01:58:30,410 --> 01:58:30,420
they're so they're building an electric
 

6165
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:32,990
they're so they're building an electric
and kind of Slash autonomous

6166
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:33,000
and kind of Slash autonomous
 

6167
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,930
and kind of Slash autonomous
um but it's kind of the same issues like

6168
01:58:35,930 --> 01:58:35,940
um but it's kind of the same issues like
 

6169
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:38,870
um but it's kind of the same issues like
what kind of sensors can you put in what

6170
01:58:38,870 --> 01:58:38,880
what kind of sensors can you put in what
 

6171
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:41,030
what kind of sensors can you put in what
kind of states can you detect both

6172
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:41,040
kind of states can you detect both
 

6173
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:43,250
kind of states can you detect both
exterior and interior within the boats

6174
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:43,260
exterior and interior within the boats
 

6175
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:45,589
exterior and interior within the boats
anyways it's like really interesting do

6176
01:58:45,589 --> 01:58:45,599
anyways it's like really interesting do
 

6177
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:49,310
anyways it's like really interesting do
you vote at all no not well not in that

6178
01:58:49,310 --> 01:58:49,320
you vote at all no not well not in that
 

6179
01:58:49,320 --> 01:58:53,209
you vote at all no not well not in that
way I I do like to get on the lake uh or

6180
01:58:53,209 --> 01:58:53,219
way I I do like to get on the lake uh or
 

6181
01:58:53,219 --> 01:58:55,910
way I I do like to get on the lake uh or
a river and fish from okay but that's

6182
01:58:55,910 --> 01:58:55,920
a river and fish from okay but that's
 

6183
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,870
a river and fish from okay but that's
not boating that's the difference

6184
01:58:58,870 --> 01:58:58,880
not boating that's the difference
 

6185
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:01,149
not boating that's the difference
low Tech

6186
01:59:01,149 --> 01:59:01,159
low Tech
 

6187
01:59:01,159 --> 01:59:04,790
low Tech
get away from get closer to nature but I

6188
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
get away from get closer to nature but I
 

6189
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:08,890
get away from get closer to nature but I
guess going out into the ocean is also

6190
01:59:08,890 --> 01:59:08,900
guess going out into the ocean is also
 

6191
01:59:08,900 --> 01:59:11,689
guess going out into the ocean is also
uh is also getting closer to Nature in

6192
01:59:11,689 --> 01:59:11,699
uh is also getting closer to Nature in
 

6193
01:59:11,699 --> 01:59:13,129
uh is also getting closer to Nature in
some deep sense I mean I guess that's

6194
01:59:13,129 --> 01:59:13,139
some deep sense I mean I guess that's
 

6195
01:59:13,139 --> 01:59:15,970
some deep sense I mean I guess that's
why people love it yeah the the the

6196
01:59:15,970 --> 01:59:15,980
why people love it yeah the the the
 

6197
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:18,589
why people love it yeah the the the

Amazon's acquisition of iRobot I think

6222
01:59:49,970 --> 01:59:49,980
Amazon's acquisition of iRobot I think
 

6223
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:52,490
Amazon's acquisition of iRobot I think
it's a super interesting just given the

6224
01:59:52,490 --> 01:59:52,500
it's a super interesting just given the
 

6225

these honestly small number of companies
 

6229
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:59,689
these honestly small number of companies
that are playing in the space that are

6230
01:59:59,689 --> 01:59:59,699
that are playing in the space that are
 

6231
01:59:59,699 --> 02:00:01,790
that are playing in the space that are
like trying to have an impact on human

moment in time that Amazon would acquire

6236
02:00:06,169 --> 02:00:06,179
moment in time that Amazon would acquire
 

6237
02:00:06,179 --> 02:00:07,570
moment in time that Amazon would acquire
iRobot

6238
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:07,580
iRobot
 

6239
02:00:07,580 --> 02:00:10,910
iRobot
uh you tweet I imagine a future where

6240
02:00:10,910 --> 02:00:10,920
uh you tweet I imagine a future where
 

6241
02:00:10,920 --> 02:00:13,490
uh you tweet I imagine a future where
home robots are as ubiquitous as

6242
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:13,500
home robots are as ubiquitous as
 

6243
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:16,010
home robots are as ubiquitous as
microwaves or toasters

6244
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:16,020
microwaves or toasters
 

6245
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:18,290
microwaves or toasters
here are three reasons why I think this

6246
02:00:18,290 --> 02:00:18,300
here are three reasons why I think this
 

6247
02:00:18,300 --> 02:00:20,330
here are three reasons why I think this
is exciting if you remember I can look

6248
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:20,340
is exciting if you remember I can look
 

6249
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:22,189
is exciting if you remember I can look
it up but what why is this exciting to

6250
02:00:22,189 --> 02:00:22,199
it up but what why is this exciting to
 

6251
02:00:22,199 --> 02:00:26,450
it up but what why is this exciting to
you

6252
02:00:26,450 --> 02:00:26,460

 

6253
02:00:26,460 --> 02:00:28,310

for the exact like

6254
02:00:28,310 --> 02:00:28,320
for the exact like
 

6255
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:31,010
for the exact like
um order in which I put them but one is

6256
02:00:31,010 --> 02:00:31,020
um order in which I put them but one is
 

6257
02:00:31,020 --> 02:00:33,410
um order in which I put them but one is
just it's it's going to be an incredible

6258
02:00:33,410 --> 02:00:33,420
just it's it's going to be an incredible
 

6259
02:00:33,420 --> 02:00:35,990
just it's it's going to be an incredible
platform for understanding our behaviors

6260
02:00:35,990 --> 02:00:36,000
platform for understanding our behaviors
 

6261
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,810
platform for understanding our behaviors
within the home right like you know if

6262
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:38,820
within the home right like you know if
 

6263
02:00:38,820 --> 02:00:41,270
within the home right like you know if
you think about Roomba which is

6264
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,280
you think about Roomba which is
 

6265
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,010
you think about Roomba which is
um you know the robot vacuum cleaner the

6266
02:00:43,010 --> 02:00:43,020
um you know the robot vacuum cleaner the
 

6267
02:00:43,020 --> 02:00:46,129
um you know the robot vacuum cleaner the
flagship product of iRobot at the moment

6268
02:00:46,129 --> 02:00:46,139
flagship product of iRobot at the moment
 

6269
02:00:46,139 --> 02:00:47,990
flagship product of iRobot at the moment
um it's like running around your home

6270
02:00:47,990 --> 02:00:48,000
um it's like running around your home
 

6271
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:49,370
um it's like running around your home
understanding the layout it's

6272
02:00:49,370 --> 02:00:49,380
understanding the layout it's
 

6273
02:00:49,380 --> 02:00:50,810
understanding the layout it's
understanding what's clean and what's

6274
02:00:50,810 --> 02:00:50,820
understanding what's clean and what's
 

6275
02:00:50,820 --> 02:00:52,430
understanding what's clean and what's
not how often do you clean your house

6276
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:52,440
not how often do you clean your house
 

6277
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:55,010
not how often do you clean your house
and all of these like behaviors

6278
02:00:55,010 --> 02:00:55,020
and all of these like behaviors
 

6279
02:00:55,020 --> 02:00:56,930
and all of these like behaviors
are a piece of the puzzle in terms of

6280
02:00:56,930 --> 02:00:56,940
are a piece of the puzzle in terms of
 

6281
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:58,790
are a piece of the puzzle in terms of
understanding who you are as a consumer

6282
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
understanding who you are as a consumer
 

6283
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:02,089
understanding who you are as a consumer
and I think that could be again

6284
02:01:02,089 --> 02:01:02,099
and I think that could be again
 

6285
02:01:02,099 --> 02:01:05,030
and I think that could be again
um used in in really meaningful ways not

6286
02:01:05,030 --> 02:01:05,040
um used in in really meaningful ways not
 

6287
02:01:05,040 --> 02:01:06,589
um used in in really meaningful ways not
just to recommend better products or

6288
02:01:06,589 --> 02:01:06,599
just to recommend better products or
 

6289
02:01:06,599 --> 02:01:08,390
just to recommend better products or
whatever but actually to improve your

6290
02:01:08,390 --> 02:01:08,400
whatever but actually to improve your
 

6291
02:01:08,400 --> 02:01:10,250
whatever but actually to improve your
experience as a human being so I think I

6292
02:01:10,250 --> 02:01:10,260
experience as a human being so I think I
 

6293
02:01:10,260 --> 02:01:12,709
experience as a human being so I think I
think that's very interesting

6294
02:01:12,709 --> 02:01:12,719
think that's very interesting
 

6295
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:14,870
think that's very interesting
um I think the Natural Evolution of

6296
02:01:14,870 --> 02:01:14,880
um I think the Natural Evolution of
 

6297
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:15,890
um I think the Natural Evolution of
these

6298
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:15,900
these
 

6299
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,770
these
robots in the in in the home so it's

6300
02:01:18,770 --> 02:01:18,780
robots in the in in the home so it's
 

6301
02:01:18,780 --> 02:01:20,930
robots in the in in the home so it's
interesting Roomba isn't really a social

6302
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:20,940
interesting Roomba isn't really a social
 

6303
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:24,109
interesting Roomba isn't really a social
robot right at the moment

6304
02:01:24,109 --> 02:01:24,119
robot right at the moment
 

6305
02:01:24,119 --> 02:01:26,149
robot right at the moment
um but I once interviewed one of the

6306
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
um but I once interviewed one of the
 

6307
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:28,669
um but I once interviewed one of the
chief Engineers on the Roomba team and

6308
02:01:28,669 --> 02:01:28,679
chief Engineers on the Roomba team and
 

6309
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:30,290
chief Engineers on the Roomba team and
he talked about how people named their

6310
02:01:30,290 --> 02:01:30,300
he talked about how people named their
 

6311
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:32,709
he talked about how people named their
roombas and if the Roomba broke down

6312
02:01:32,709 --> 02:01:32,719
roombas and if the Roomba broke down
 

6313
02:01:32,719 --> 02:01:35,570
roombas and if the Roomba broke down
they would call in and say you know my

6314
02:01:35,570 --> 02:01:35,580
they would call in and say you know my
 

6315
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:37,490
they would call in and say you know my
Roomba broke down and the company would

6316
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:37,500
Roomba broke down and the company would
 

6317
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,109
Roomba broke down and the company would
say oh we'll just send you a new one and

6318
02:01:39,109 --> 02:01:39,119
say oh we'll just send you a new one and
 

6319
02:01:39,119 --> 02:01:41,149
say oh we'll just send you a new one and
no no Rosie like you have to like yeah

6320
02:01:41,149 --> 02:01:41,159
no no Rosie like you have to like yeah
 

6321
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:43,490
no no Rosie like you have to like yeah
yeah I want you to fix this particular

6322
02:01:43,490 --> 02:01:43,500
yeah I want you to fix this particular
 

6323
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:45,410
yeah I want you to fix this particular
robot

6324
02:01:45,410 --> 02:01:45,420
robot
 

6325
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:48,109
robot
um so people have already built like

6326
02:01:48,109 --> 02:01:48,119
um so people have already built like
 

6327
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:50,629
um so people have already built like
interesting emotional connections with

6328
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:50,639
interesting emotional connections with
 

6329
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:53,149
interesting emotional connections with
these home robots and I think that again

6330
02:01:53,149 --> 02:01:53,159
these home robots and I think that again
 

6331
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:55,189
these home robots and I think that again
that provides a platform for really

6332
02:01:55,189 --> 02:01:55,199
that provides a platform for really
 

6333
02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:56,870
that provides a platform for really
interesting things so

6334
02:01:56,870 --> 02:01:56,880
interesting things so
 

6335
02:01:56,880 --> 02:01:58,729
interesting things so
to just motivate change like it could

6336
02:01:58,729 --> 02:01:58,739
to just motivate change like it could
 

6337
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:00,470
to just motivate change like it could
help you I mean one of the companies

that spun out of MIT uh Catalia health

6340
02:02:04,129 --> 02:02:04,139
that spun out of MIT uh Catalia health
 

6341
02:02:04,139 --> 02:02:04,910

um

6342
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:04,920
um
 

6343
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,649
um
the guy who started it spent a lot of

6344
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:06,659
the guy who started it spent a lot of
 

6345
02:02:06,659 --> 02:02:08,030
the guy who started it spent a lot of
time building robots that help with

6346
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:08,040
time building robots that help with
 

6347
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,189
time building robots that help with
weight management so weight management

6348
02:02:10,189 --> 02:02:10,199
weight management so weight management
 

6349
02:02:10,199 --> 02:02:12,229

02:02:20,089 --> 02:02:20,099
exactly have a track record of winning
 

6357
02:02:20,099 --> 02:02:22,970

over people in terms of trust now that

6358
02:02:22,970 --> 02:02:22,980
over people in terms of trust now that
 

6359
02:02:22,980 --> 02:02:25,729
over people in terms of trust now that
said it's a really difficult problem

6360
02:02:25,729 --> 02:02:25,739
said it's a really difficult problem
 

6361
02:02:25,739 --> 02:02:28,129
said it's a really difficult problem
for human being to let a robot in their

6362
02:02:28,129 --> 02:02:28,139
for human being to let a robot in their
 

6363
02:02:28,139 --> 02:02:30,890

home that has a camera on it right

6364
02:02:30,890 --> 02:02:30,900
home that has a camera on it right
 

6365
02:02:30,900 --> 02:02:33,830
home that has a camera on it right
that's really really really tough and I

6366
02:02:33,830 --> 02:02:33,840
that's really really really tough and I
 

6367
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,950
that's really really really tough and I
think Roomba actually

6368
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:36,960
think Roomba actually
 

6369
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:38,570
think Roomba actually
I have to think about this but I'm

6370
02:02:38,570 --> 02:02:38,580
I have to think about this but I'm
 

6371
02:02:38,580 --> 02:02:41,209
I have to think about this but I'm
pretty sure now or for some time already

many roombas oh you actually do well I
programmed I don't use the Roomba for

6380
02:02:50,810 --> 02:02:50,820

brings a lot of people happiness I'm
sure uh they have a camera because the

6426
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:42,300
sure uh they have a camera because the
 

6427
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:45,050
sure uh they have a camera because the
thing they advertised

6428
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,060
thing they advertised
 

6429
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:47,330
thing they advertised
I had my own cameras too but the the the

6430
02:03:47,330 --> 02:03:47,340
I had my own cameras too but the the the
 

6431
02:03:47,340 --> 02:03:50,270
I had my own cameras too but the the the
the camera on the new Roomba they have

6432
02:03:50,270 --> 02:03:50,280
the camera on the new Roomba they have
 

6433
02:03:50,280 --> 02:03:52,669
the camera on the new Roomba they have
like state-of-the-art poop detection as

6434
02:03:52,669 --> 02:03:52,679
like state-of-the-art poop detection as
 

6435
02:03:52,679 --> 02:03:54,410
like state-of-the-art poop detection as
they advertised which is a very

6436

they advertised which is a very
 

6437
02:03:54,420 --> 02:03:55,970
they advertised which is a very
difficult apparently it's a big problem

6438
02:03:55,970 --> 02:03:55,980
difficult apparently it's a big problem
 

6439
02:03:55,980 --> 02:03:58,490
difficult apparently it's a big problem
for for vacuum cleaners is you know if

6440
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:58,500
for for vacuum cleaners is you know if
 

6441
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:00,410
for for vacuum cleaners is you know if
they go over like dog poop it just runs

6442
02:04:00,410 --> 02:04:00,420
they go over like dog poop it just runs
 

6443
02:04:00,420 --> 02:04:02,089
they go over like dog poop it just runs
it runs it over and creates a giant mess

6444
02:04:02,089 --> 02:04:02,099
it runs it over and creates a giant mess
 

6445
02:04:02,099 --> 02:04:04,270
it runs it over and creates a giant mess
so they have like

6446
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:04,280
so they have like
 

6447
02:04:04,280 --> 02:04:06,649
so they have like
apparently they collected like a huge

6448
02:04:06,649 --> 02:04:06,659
apparently they collected like a huge
 

6449
02:04:06,659 --> 02:04:08,689
apparently they collected like a huge
amount of data and different shapes and

6450
02:04:08,689 --> 02:04:08,699
amount of data and different shapes and
 

6451
02:04:08,699 --> 02:04:10,669
amount of data and different shapes and
looks and whatever of poop and then now

6452
02:04:10,669 --> 02:04:10,679
looks and whatever of poop and then now
 

6453
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:12,109
looks and whatever of poop and then now
they're able to avoid it and so on

6454
02:04:12,109 --> 02:04:12,119
they're able to avoid it and so on
 

6455
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:14,810
they're able to avoid it and so on
they're very proud of this uh so there

6456
02:04:14,810 --> 02:04:14,820
they're very proud of this uh so there
 

6457
02:04:14,820 --> 02:04:17,149
they're very proud of this uh so there
is a camera but you don't think of it as

6458
02:04:17,149 --> 02:04:17,159
is a camera but you don't think of it as
 

6459
02:04:17,159 --> 02:04:19,850
is a camera but you don't think of it as
having a camera

6460
02:04:19,850 --> 02:04:19,860
having a camera
 

6461
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:21,770
having a camera
yeah you don't think of it as having a

6462
02:04:21,770 --> 02:04:21,780
yeah you don't think of it as having a
 

6463
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,810
yeah you don't think of it as having a
camera because you've grown to trust it

6464
02:04:23,810 --> 02:04:23,820
camera because you've grown to trust it
 

6465
02:04:23,820 --> 02:04:26,149
camera because you've grown to trust it
I guess because our phones at least most

6466
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
I guess because our phones at least most
 

6467
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:28,490
I guess because our phones at least most
of us seem to trust

6468
02:04:28,490 --> 02:04:28,500
of us seem to trust
 

6469
02:04:28,500 --> 02:04:29,510
of us seem to trust
right

6470
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:29,520
right
 

6471
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:31,370
right
this phone even though there's a camera

6472
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:31,380
this phone even though there's a camera
 

6473
02:04:31,380 --> 02:04:33,770
this phone even though there's a camera
looking directly at you

6474
02:04:33,770 --> 02:04:33,780
looking directly at you
 

6475
02:04:33,780 --> 02:04:37,129
looking directly at you
I think that if you trust that the

6476
02:04:37,129 --> 02:04:37,139
I think that if you trust that the
 

6477
02:04:37,139 --> 02:04:39,470
I think that if you trust that the
company

6478
02:04:39,470 --> 02:04:39,480

 

6479
02:04:39,480 --> 02:04:41,629

is taking security very seriously I

6480
02:04:41,629 --> 02:04:41,639
is taking security very seriously I
 

6481
02:04:41,639 --> 02:04:42,830
is taking security very seriously I
actually don't know how that trust was

6482
02:04:42,830 --> 02:04:42,840
actually don't know how that trust was
 

6483
02:04:42,840 --> 02:04:45,770
actually don't know how that trust was
earned with smartphones I think I just

6484
02:04:45,770 --> 02:04:45,780
earned with smartphones I think I just
 

6485
02:04:45,780 --> 02:04:48,410
earned with smartphones I think I just
started to provide a lot of positive

6486
02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:48,420
started to provide a lot of positive
 

6487
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:49,970
started to provide a lot of positive
value into your life where you just took

6488
02:04:49,970 --> 02:04:49,980
value into your life where you just took
 

6489
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:52,189
value into your life where you just took
it in and then the company over time has

6490
02:04:52,189 --> 02:04:52,199
it in and then the company over time has
 

6491
02:04:52,199 --> 02:04:53,570
it in and then the company over time has
shown that it takes privacy very

6492
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:53,580
shown that it takes privacy very
 

6493
02:04:53,580 --> 02:04:55,790
shown that it takes privacy very
seriously that kind of stuff but I I

6494
02:04:55,790 --> 02:04:55,800
seriously that kind of stuff but I I
 

6495
02:04:55,800 --> 02:04:59,270
seriously that kind of stuff but I I
just Amazon is not always in the in its

6499
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:04,609
social robots communicated this is a
trustworthy thing both in terms of

6500
02:05:04,609 --> 02:05:04,619
trustworthy thing both in terms of
 

6501
02:05:04,619 --> 02:05:07,310
trustworthy thing both in terms of
culture and competence because I think

6502
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:07,320
culture and competence because I think
 

6503
02:05:07,320 --> 02:05:09,470
culture and competence because I think
privacy is not just about what do you

6504
02:05:09,470 --> 02:05:09,480
privacy is not just about what do you
 

6505
02:05:09,480 --> 02:05:12,470
privacy is not just about what do you
intend to do but also how well how good

6509
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,609
are you at doing that kind of thing so
that's a really hard problem to solve

humanoid robot yes I have yes yes yes
 

6581
02:06:44,219 --> 02:06:47,089
humanoid robot yes I have yes yes yes
but I don't exactly know what it's

6582
02:06:47,089 --> 02:06:47,099
but I don't exactly know what it's
 

6583
02:06:47,099 --> 02:06:50,330
but I don't exactly know what it's
designed to do to you you probably do uh

6584
02:06:50,330 --> 02:06:50,340
designed to do to you you probably do uh
 

6585
02:06:50,340 --> 02:06:52,550
designed to do to you you probably do uh
no I know it's designed to do but I I

6586
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:52,560
no I know it's designed to do but I I
 

6587
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:53,990
no I know it's designed to do but I I
have a different perspective on it but

6588
02:06:53,990 --> 02:06:54,000
have a different perspective on it but
 

6589
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,050
have a different perspective on it but
it's designed to it's a humanoid form

6590
02:06:57,050 --> 02:06:57,060
it's designed to it's a humanoid form
 

6591
02:06:57,060 --> 02:07:00,649
it's designed to it's a humanoid form
and it's designed to for automation

6592
02:07:00,649 --> 02:07:00,659
and it's designed to for automation
 

6593
02:07:00,659 --> 02:07:02,950
and it's designed to for automation
tasks in the same way that industrial

6594
02:07:02,950 --> 02:07:02,960
tasks in the same way that industrial
 

6595
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,050
tasks in the same way that industrial
robot arms automated task in the factory

6596
02:07:06,050 --> 02:07:06,060
robot arms automated task in the factory
 

6597
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:07,850
robot arms automated task in the factory
so it's designed to automate task in the

6598
02:07:07,850 --> 02:07:07,860
so it's designed to automate task in the
 

6599
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:11,089
so it's designed to automate task in the
factory but I think the humanoid form is

6600
02:07:11,089 --> 02:07:11,099
factory but I think the humanoid form is
 

6601
02:07:11,099 --> 02:07:13,629
factory but I think the humanoid form is
what we're talking about before

6602
02:07:13,629 --> 02:07:13,639
what we're talking about before
 

6603
02:07:13,639 --> 02:07:16,189
what we're talking about before
is um

6604
02:07:16,189 --> 02:07:16,199
is um
 

6605
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:19,250
is um
is one that we connect with us human

6606
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:19,260
is one that we connect with us human
 

6607
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:21,350
is one that we connect with us human
beings anything anything legged honestly

6608
02:07:21,350 --> 02:07:21,360
beings anything anything legged honestly
 

6609
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:23,709
beings anything anything legged honestly
but the humanoid form especially we

6610
02:07:23,709 --> 02:07:23,719
but the humanoid form especially we
 

6611
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:27,109
but the humanoid form especially we
anthropomorphizes it most intensely and

6612
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:27,119
anthropomorphizes it most intensely and
 

6613
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:29,870
anthropomorphizes it most intensely and
so the possibility to me it's exciting

6614
02:07:29,870 --> 02:07:29,880
so the possibility to me it's exciting
 

6615
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:31,370
so the possibility to me it's exciting
to see

6616
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:31,380
to see
 

6617
02:07:31,380 --> 02:07:33,950
to see
both Atlas developed by Boston's

6618
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:33,960
both Atlas developed by Boston's
 

6619
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:38,330
both Atlas developed by Boston's

trying to make humanoid robots cheaper

6622
02:07:41,209 --> 02:07:41,219
trying to make humanoid robots cheaper
 

6623
02:07:41,219 --> 02:07:43,129
trying to make humanoid robots cheaper
and more effective

6624
02:07:43,129 --> 02:07:43,139
and more effective
 

6625
02:07:43,139 --> 02:07:45,830
and more effective
this is the obvious way transforms the

6626
02:07:45,830 --> 02:07:45,840
this is the obvious way transforms the
 

6627
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:49,310
this is the obvious way transforms the
world is social robotics to me versus

6628
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:49,320
world is social robotics to me versus
 

6629
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:49,970
world is social robotics to me versus
um

6630
02:07:49,970 --> 02:07:49,980
um
 

6631
02:07:49,980 --> 02:07:52,189
um
versus automation of tasks in the

6632
02:07:52,189 --> 02:07:52,199
versus automation of tasks in the
 

6633
02:07:52,199 --> 02:07:55,129
versus automation of tasks in the
factory so yeah I just wanted to in case

6634
02:07:55,129 --> 02:07:55,139
factory so yeah I just wanted to in case
 

6635
02:07:55,139 --> 02:07:56,149
factory so yeah I just wanted to in case
that was something you were interested

6636
02:07:56,149 --> 02:07:56,159
that was something you were interested
 

6637
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:59,149
that was something you were interested
in because I I find it I find its

6638
02:07:59,149 --> 02:07:59,159
in because I I find it I find its
 

6639
02:07:59,159 --> 02:08:00,530
in because I I find it I find its
application social robotics super

6640
02:08:00,530 --> 02:08:00,540
application social robotics super
 

6641
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:03,290
application social robotics super
interesting we did a lot of work with uh

6642
02:08:03,290 --> 02:08:03,300
interesting we did a lot of work with uh
 

6643
02:08:03,300 --> 02:08:04,370
interesting we did a lot of work with uh
pepper

6644
02:08:04,370 --> 02:08:04,380
pepper
 

6645
02:08:04,380 --> 02:08:06,470
pepper
um pepper the robots a while back we

6646
02:08:06,470 --> 02:08:06,480
um pepper the robots a while back we
 

6647
02:08:06,480 --> 02:08:08,570
um pepper the robots a while back we
were like the emotion engine for pepper

6648
02:08:08,570 --> 02:08:08,580
were like the emotion engine for pepper
 

6649
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:11,510
were like the emotion engine for pepper
uh which is softbanks humanoid robot and

6650
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:11,520
uh which is softbanks humanoid robot and
 

6651
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,870
uh which is softbanks humanoid robot and
how tall is pepper it's like yeah like

6652
02:08:14,870 --> 02:08:14,880
how tall is pepper it's like yeah like
 

6653
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,430
how tall is pepper it's like yeah like
um I don't know like

6654
02:08:16,430 --> 02:08:16,440
um I don't know like
 

6655
02:08:16,440 --> 02:08:19,669
um I don't know like
five foot maybe right yeah yeah pretty

6656
02:08:19,669 --> 02:08:19,679
five foot maybe right yeah yeah pretty
 

6657
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:21,830
five foot maybe right yeah yeah pretty
pretty big pretty big

6658
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:21,840
pretty big pretty big
 

6659
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,689
pretty big pretty big
um and it was designed to be at like

6660
02:08:23,689 --> 02:08:23,699
um and it was designed to be at like
 

6661
02:08:23,699 --> 02:08:26,930
um and it was designed to be at like
airport lounges and you know retail

6662
02:08:26,930 --> 02:08:26,940
airport lounges and you know retail
 

6663
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:29,649
airport lounges and you know retail
stores mostly customer service right

6664
02:08:29,649 --> 02:08:29,659
stores mostly customer service right
 

6665
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:32,510
stores mostly customer service right
hotel lobbies

6666
02:08:32,510 --> 02:08:32,520
hotel lobbies
 

6667
02:08:32,520 --> 02:08:33,770
hotel lobbies
um

6668
02:08:33,770 --> 02:08:33,780
um
 

6669
02:08:33,780 --> 02:08:35,990
um
and I mean I don't know where the state

6670
02:08:35,990 --> 02:08:36,000
and I mean I don't know where the state
 

6671
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,490
and I mean I don't know where the state
of the robot is but I think it's very

6672
02:08:37,490 --> 02:08:37,500
of the robot is but I think it's very
 

6673
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:38,870
of the robot is but I think it's very
promising I think there are a lot of

6674
02:08:38,870 --> 02:08:38,880
promising I think there are a lot of
 

6675
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:40,430
promising I think there are a lot of
applications where this can be helpful

6676
02:08:40,430 --> 02:08:40,440
applications where this can be helpful
 

6677
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:42,950
applications where this can be helpful
I'm also really interested in

6678
02:08:42,950 --> 02:08:42,960
I'm also really interested in
 

6679
02:08:42,960 --> 02:08:44,450
I'm also really interested in
um yeah social robotics for the home

6680
02:08:44,450 --> 02:08:44,460
um yeah social robotics for the home
 

6681
02:08:44,460 --> 02:08:47,450
um yeah social robotics for the home
right like that can help elderly people

6682
02:08:47,450 --> 02:08:47,460
right like that can help elderly people
 

6683
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:50,270
right like that can help elderly people
for example transport things from one

6684
02:08:50,270 --> 02:08:50,280
for example transport things from one
 

6685
02:08:50,280 --> 02:08:51,890
for example transport things from one
location of the home to the other or

6686
02:08:51,890 --> 02:08:51,900
location of the home to the other or
 

6687
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:54,410
location of the home to the other or
even like just have your back in case

6688
02:08:54,410 --> 02:08:54,420
even like just have your back in case
 

6689
02:08:54,420 --> 02:08:56,930
even like just have your back in case
something happens

6690
02:08:56,930 --> 02:08:56,940
something happens
 

6691
02:08:56,940 --> 02:08:59,149
something happens
um yeah I don't know I do think it's a

6692
02:08:59,149 --> 02:08:59,159
um yeah I don't know I do think it's a
 

6693
02:08:59,159 --> 02:09:00,589
um yeah I don't know I do think it's a
very interesting space it seems early

6694
02:09:00,589 --> 02:09:00,599
very interesting space it seems early
 

6695
02:09:00,599 --> 02:09:03,050
very interesting space it seems early
though do you feel like the timing is

6696
02:09:03,050 --> 02:09:03,060
though do you feel like the timing is
 

6697
02:09:03,060 --> 02:09:05,870
though do you feel like the timing is
now

6698
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:05,880

 

6699
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:08,530

I yes 100

6700
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:08,540
I yes 100
 

6701
02:09:08,540 --> 02:09:11,450
I yes 100
uh so it always seems early until it's

6702
02:09:11,450 --> 02:09:11,460
uh so it always seems early until it's
 

6703
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:17,089
uh so it always seems early until it's
not right right right I think the time

6704
02:09:17,089 --> 02:09:17,099

 

6705
02:09:17,099 --> 02:09:19,010

I definitely think

6706
02:09:19,010 --> 02:09:19,020
I definitely think
 

6707
02:09:19,020 --> 02:09:22,669
I definitely think
that the time is now like this decade

6708
02:09:22,669 --> 02:09:22,679
that the time is now like this decade
 

6709
02:09:22,679 --> 02:09:26,629
that the time is now like this decade
for social robots whether the humanoid

6710
02:09:26,629 --> 02:09:26,639
for social robots whether the humanoid
 

6711
02:09:26,639 --> 02:09:30,350
for social robots whether the humanoid
form is right I don't think so I don't I

6712
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:30,360
form is right I don't think so I don't I
 

6713
02:09:30,360 --> 02:09:32,350
form is right I don't think so I don't I
think uh the

6714
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:32,360
think uh the
 

6715
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:36,530
think uh the
like if we just look Jibo at Jibo as an

6716
02:09:36,530 --> 02:09:36,540
like if we just look Jibo at Jibo as an
 

6717
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,089
like if we just look Jibo at Jibo as an
example

6718
02:09:38,089 --> 02:09:38,099
example
 

6719
02:09:38,099 --> 02:09:41,510
example
I feel like most of the problem

6720
02:09:41,510 --> 02:09:41,520
I feel like most of the problem
 

6721
02:09:41,520 --> 02:09:44,330
I feel like most of the problem
the challenge the opportunity of social

6722
02:09:44,330 --> 02:09:44,340
the challenge the opportunity of social
 

6723
02:09:44,340 --> 02:09:47,209
the challenge the opportunity of social
connection between an AI system and a

6724
02:09:47,209 --> 02:09:47,219
connection between an AI system and a
 

6725
02:09:47,219 --> 02:09:50,810
connection between an AI system and a
human being does not require you to also

6726
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:50,820
human being does not require you to also
 

6727
02:09:50,820 --> 02:09:52,550
human being does not require you to also
solve the problem of robot manipulation

6728
02:09:52,550 --> 02:09:52,560
solve the problem of robot manipulation
 

6729
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:56,810
solve the problem of robot manipulation
and Mobility bipedal Mobility so I think

6730
02:09:56,810 --> 02:09:56,820
and Mobility bipedal Mobility so I think
 

6731
02:09:56,820 --> 02:09:58,189
and Mobility bipedal Mobility so I think
you could do that with just a screen

6732
02:09:58,189 --> 02:09:58,199
you could do that with just a screen
 

6733
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:00,169
you could do that with just a screen
honestly but there's something about the

6734
02:10:00,169 --> 02:10:00,179
honestly but there's something about the
 

6735
02:10:00,179 --> 02:10:02,089
honestly but there's something about the
interface of Jibo it can rotate and so

6736
02:10:02,089 --> 02:10:02,099
interface of Jibo it can rotate and so
 

6737
02:10:02,099 --> 02:10:04,970
interface of Jibo it can rotate and so
on that's also compelling but you get to

6738
02:10:04,970 --> 02:10:04,980
on that's also compelling but you get to
 

6739
02:10:04,980 --> 02:10:06,770
on that's also compelling but you get to
see all these robot companies that are

6740
02:10:06,770 --> 02:10:06,780
see all these robot companies that are
 

6741
02:10:06,780 --> 02:10:09,229
see all these robot companies that are
fail that fail incredible companies like

6742
02:10:09,229 --> 02:10:09,239
fail that fail incredible companies like
 

6743
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:10,970
fail that fail incredible companies like
Jibo and

6744
02:10:10,970 --> 02:10:10,980
Jibo and
 

6745
02:10:10,980 --> 02:10:12,229
Jibo and
um

6746
02:10:12,229 --> 02:10:12,239
um
 

6747
02:10:12,239 --> 02:10:15,290
um
even uh I mean the iRobot in some sense

6748
02:10:15,290 --> 02:10:15,300
even uh I mean the iRobot in some sense
 

6749
02:10:15,300 --> 02:10:17,810
even uh I mean the iRobot in some sense
is a big success story that is able to

6750
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:17,820
is a big success story that is able to
 

6751
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:21,350
is a big success story that is able to
find right and a niche a niche thing and

6752
02:10:21,350 --> 02:10:21,360
find right and a niche a niche thing and
 

6753
02:10:21,360 --> 02:10:23,270
find right and a niche a niche thing and
focus on it but in some sense it's not a

6754
02:10:23,270 --> 02:10:23,280
focus on it but in some sense it's not a
 

6755
02:10:23,280 --> 02:10:25,910
focus on it but in some sense it's not a
success story because they didn't

6756
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:25,920
success story because they didn't
 

6757
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:29,629
success story because they didn't
build any other robot like any other it

6758
02:10:29,629 --> 02:10:29,639
build any other robot like any other it
 

6759
02:10:29,639 --> 02:10:31,490
build any other robot like any other it
didn't expand into all kinds of Robotics

6760
02:10:31,490 --> 02:10:31,500
didn't expand into all kinds of Robotics
 

6761
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,990
didn't expand into all kinds of Robotics
like once you're in the home maybe

6762
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:33,000
like once you're in the home maybe
 

6763
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,490
like once you're in the home maybe
that's what happens with Amazon is

6764
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:34,500
that's what happens with Amazon is
 

6765
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:35,810
that's what happens with Amazon is
they'll flourish into all kinds of other

6766
02:10:35,810 --> 02:10:35,820
they'll flourish into all kinds of other
 

6767
02:10:35,820 --> 02:10:39,709
they'll flourish into all kinds of other
robots but uh do you have a sense by the

6768
02:10:39,709 --> 02:10:39,719
robots but uh do you have a sense by the
 

6769
02:10:39,719 --> 02:10:40,689
robots but uh do you have a sense by the
way

6770
02:10:40,689 --> 02:10:40,699
way
 

6771
02:10:40,699 --> 02:10:43,129
way
why it's so difficult to build a

6772
02:10:43,129 --> 02:10:43,139
why it's so difficult to build a
 

6773
02:10:43,139 --> 02:10:44,930
why it's so difficult to build a
robotics company like why

6774
02:10:44,930 --> 02:10:44,940
robotics company like why
 

6775
02:10:44,940 --> 02:10:47,330
robotics company like why
so many companies have failed

6776
02:10:47,330 --> 02:10:47,340
so many companies have failed
 

6777
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,430
so many companies have failed
think

6778
02:10:49,430 --> 02:10:49,440
think
 

6779
02:10:49,440 --> 02:10:50,810
think
we're building a vertical stack right

6780
02:10:50,810 --> 02:10:50,820
we're building a vertical stack right
 

6781
02:10:50,820 --> 02:10:52,609
we're building a vertical stack right
like you're building the hardware plus

6782
02:10:52,609 --> 02:10:52,619
like you're building the hardware plus
 

6783
02:10:52,619 --> 02:10:54,470
like you're building the hardware plus
the software and you find you have to do

6784
02:10:54,470 --> 02:10:54,480
the software and you find you have to do
 

6785
02:10:54,480 --> 02:10:56,450
the software and you find you have to do
this at a cost that makes sense so I

6786
02:10:56,450 --> 02:10:56,460
this at a cost that makes sense so I
 

6787
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:57,950
this at a cost that makes sense so I
think Jibo

6788
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:57,960
think Jibo
 

6789
02:10:57,960 --> 02:11:00,709
think Jibo
was retailing at like

6790
02:11:00,709 --> 02:11:00,719
was retailing at like
 

6791
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:04,970
was retailing at like
I don't know like 800 like 700 800 which

6792
02:11:04,970 --> 02:11:04,980
I don't know like 800 like 700 800 which
 

6793
02:11:04,980 --> 02:11:07,850
I don't know like 800 like 700 800 which
for the use case right

6794
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:07,860
for the use case right
 

6795
02:11:07,860 --> 02:11:10,490
for the use case right
there's a dissonance there it's it's too

6796
02:11:10,490 --> 02:11:10,500
there's a dissonance there it's it's too
 

6797
02:11:10,500 --> 02:11:13,250
there's a dissonance there it's it's too
high so I think cost is a is you know

6798
02:11:13,250 --> 02:11:13,260
high so I think cost is a is you know
 

6799
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:15,470
high so I think cost is a is you know
the cost of building the whole platform

6800
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:15,480
the cost of building the whole platform
 

6801
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:18,830
the cost of building the whole platform
in a way that that is yeah that that is

6802
02:11:18,830 --> 02:11:18,840
in a way that that is yeah that that is
 

6803
02:11:18,840 --> 02:11:21,050
in a way that that is yeah that that is
Affordable for what value it's bringing

6804
02:11:21,050 --> 02:11:21,060
Affordable for what value it's bringing
 

6805
02:11:21,060 --> 02:11:23,750
Affordable for what value it's bringing
I think that's the challenge

6806
02:11:23,750 --> 02:11:23,760
I think that's the challenge
 

6807
02:11:23,760 --> 02:11:25,370
I think that's the challenge
um I think for these home robots that

6808
02:11:25,370 --> 02:11:25,380
um I think for these home robots that
 

6809
02:11:25,380 --> 02:11:27,350
um I think for these home robots that
are going to help you know help you do

6810
02:11:27,350 --> 02:11:27,360
are going to help you know help you do
 

6811
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,810
are going to help you know help you do
stuff around the home

6812
02:11:29,810 --> 02:11:29,820
stuff around the home
 

6813
02:11:29,820 --> 02:11:30,530
stuff around the home
um

6814
02:11:30,530 --> 02:11:30,540
um
 

6815
02:11:30,540 --> 02:11:32,390
um
that's a challenge too like the mobility

6816
02:11:32,390 --> 02:11:32,400
that's a challenge too like the mobility
 

6817
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:34,070
that's a challenge too like the mobility
piece of it that's

6818
02:11:34,070 --> 02:11:34,080
piece of it that's
 

6819
02:11:34,080 --> 02:11:35,810
piece of it that's
that's hard well one of the things I'm

6820
02:11:35,810 --> 02:11:35,820
that's hard well one of the things I'm
 

6821
02:11:35,820 --> 02:11:38,089
that's hard well one of the things I'm
really excited with with Tesla bot is

6822
02:11:38,089 --> 02:11:38,099
really excited with with Tesla bot is
 

6823
02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:40,189
really excited with with Tesla bot is
the people working on it

6824
02:11:40,189 --> 02:11:40,199
the people working on it
 

6825
02:11:40,199 --> 02:11:42,350
the people working on it
and that that's probably the criticism I

6826
02:11:42,350 --> 02:11:42,360
and that that's probably the criticism I
 

6827
02:11:42,360 --> 02:11:44,330
and that that's probably the criticism I
would apply to some of the other folks

6828
02:11:44,330 --> 02:11:44,340
would apply to some of the other folks
 

6829
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:46,910
would apply to some of the other folks
who worked on social robots is the

6830
02:11:46,910 --> 02:11:46,920
who worked on social robots is the
 

6831
02:11:46,920 --> 02:11:49,430
who worked on social robots is the
people working on Tesla bot know how to

6832
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,440
people working on Tesla bot know how to
 

6833
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:50,990
people working on Tesla bot know how to
they're focused on and know how to do

6834
02:11:50,990 --> 02:11:51,000
they're focused on and know how to do
 

6835
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,970
they're focused on and know how to do
Mass manufacture and create a product

6836
02:11:52,970 --> 02:11:52,980
Mass manufacture and create a product
 

6837
02:11:52,980 --> 02:11:55,790
Mass manufacture and create a product
that's super cheap very cool Focus the

6838
02:11:55,790 --> 02:11:55,800
that's super cheap very cool Focus the
 

6839
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:57,830
that's super cheap very cool Focus the
engineering Focus isn't uh I would say

6840
02:11:57,830 --> 02:11:57,840
engineering Focus isn't uh I would say
 

6841
02:11:57,840 --> 02:11:59,629
engineering Focus isn't uh I would say
that you can also criticize them for

6842
02:11:59,629 --> 02:11:59,639
that you can also criticize them for
 

6843
02:11:59,639 --> 02:12:02,270
that you can also criticize them for
that is they're not focused on the

6844
02:12:02,270 --> 02:12:02,280
that is they're not focused on the
 

6845
02:12:02,280 --> 02:12:04,070
that is they're not focused on the
experience of the robot they're they're

6846
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:04,080
experience of the robot they're they're
 

6847
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:07,550
experience of the robot they're they're
focused on how to get this thing to do

6848
02:12:07,550 --> 02:12:07,560
focused on how to get this thing to do
 

6849
02:12:07,560 --> 02:12:10,010
focused on how to get this thing to do
the basic stuff that the humanoid form

6850
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:10,020
the basic stuff that the humanoid form
 

6851
02:12:10,020 --> 02:12:13,010
the basic stuff that the humanoid form
requires to do it as cheap as possible

6852
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:13,020
requires to do it as cheap as possible
 

6853
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:15,410
requires to do it as cheap as possible
then the fewest number of actuators the

6854
02:12:15,410 --> 02:12:15,420
then the fewest number of actuators the
 

6855
02:12:15,420 --> 02:12:17,930
then the fewest number of actuators the
fewest numbers of Motors the increasing

6856
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:17,940
fewest numbers of Motors the increasing
 

6857
02:12:17,940 --> 02:12:19,550
fewest numbers of Motors the increasing
efficiency they decrease the weight all

6858
02:12:19,550 --> 02:12:19,560
efficiency they decrease the weight all
 

6859
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:20,750
efficiency they decrease the weight all
that kind of stuff so that's that's

6860
02:12:20,750 --> 02:12:20,760
that kind of stuff so that's that's
 

6861
02:12:20,760 --> 02:12:22,550
that kind of stuff so that's that's
really interesting I would say that

6862
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:22,560
really interesting I would say that
 

6863
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:25,490
really interesting I would say that
g-bone all those folks they focus on the

6864
02:12:25,490 --> 02:12:25,500
g-bone all those folks they focus on the
 

6865
02:12:25,500 --> 02:12:28,250
g-bone all those folks they focus on the
design the experience all of that and

6866
02:12:28,250 --> 02:12:28,260
design the experience all of that and
 

6867
02:12:28,260 --> 02:12:30,050
design the experience all of that and
it's secondary how to manufacture right

6868
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:30,060
it's secondary how to manufacture right
 

6869
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:32,089
it's secondary how to manufacture right
it's like no you have to think

6870
02:12:32,089 --> 02:12:32,099
it's like no you have to think
 

6871
02:12:32,099 --> 02:12:34,010
it's like no you have to think
uh like the Tesla bought folks from

6872
02:12:34,010 --> 02:12:34,020
uh like the Tesla bought folks from
 

6873
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:37,010
uh like the Tesla bought folks from
first principles what is the fewest

6874
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:37,020
first principles what is the fewest
 

6875
02:12:37,020 --> 02:12:38,629
first principles what is the fewest
number of components the cheapest

6876
02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
number of components the cheapest
 

6877
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:40,790
number of components the cheapest
components how can I build it as much

6878
02:12:40,790 --> 02:12:40,800
components how can I build it as much
 

6879
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,070
components how can I build it as much
in-house as possible without without

6880
02:12:43,070 --> 02:12:43,080
in-house as possible without without
 

6881
02:12:43,080 --> 02:12:45,589
in-house as possible without without
having to consider all the complexities

6882
02:12:45,589 --> 02:12:45,599
having to consider all the complexities
 

6883
02:12:45,599 --> 02:12:47,530
having to consider all the complexities
of a supply chain all that kind of stuff

6884
02:12:47,530 --> 02:12:47,540
of a supply chain all that kind of stuff
 

6885
02:12:47,540 --> 02:12:49,430
of a supply chain all that kind of stuff
interesting because if you have to build

6886
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,440
interesting because if you have to build
 

6887
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:51,770
interesting because if you have to build
a robotics company you you have to

6888
02:12:51,770 --> 02:12:51,780
a robotics company you you have to
 

6889
02:12:51,780 --> 02:12:53,750
a robotics company you you have to
you're not building one robot You're

6890
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
you're not building one robot You're
 

6891
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:55,550
you're not building one robot You're
Building hopefully millions of robots

6892
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:55,560
Building hopefully millions of robots
 

6893
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,050
Building hopefully millions of robots
you have to figure out how to do that

6894
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:57,060
you have to figure out how to do that
 

6895
02:12:57,060 --> 02:12:59,930
you have to figure out how to do that
where the final thing I mean if it's

6896
02:12:59,930 --> 02:12:59,940
where the final thing I mean if it's
 

6897
02:12:59,940 --> 02:13:02,689
where the final thing I mean if it's
Jibo type of robot is there a reason why

6898
02:13:02,689 --> 02:13:02,699
Jibo type of robot is there a reason why
 

6899
02:13:02,699 --> 02:13:05,149
Jibo type of robot is there a reason why
Jibo like we can have this lengthy

6900
02:13:05,149 --> 02:13:05,159
Jibo like we can have this lengthy
 

6901
02:13:05,159 --> 02:13:07,069
Jibo like we can have this lengthy
discussion is there a reason why Jibo

6902
02:13:07,069 --> 02:13:07,079
discussion is there a reason why Jibo
 

6903
02:13:07,079 --> 02:13:09,229
discussion is there a reason why Jibo
has to be over a hundred dollars it

6904
02:13:09,229 --> 02:13:09,239
has to be over a hundred dollars it
 

6905
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:11,450
has to be over a hundred dollars it
shouldn't be right like the basic right

6906
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:11,460
shouldn't be right like the basic right
 

6907
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:13,370
shouldn't be right like the basic right
the basic components components of it

6908
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:13,380
the basic components components of it
 

6909
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:15,950
the basic components components of it
right like you could start to actually

6910
02:13:15,950 --> 02:13:15,960
right like you could start to actually
 

6911
02:13:15,960 --> 02:13:17,810
right like you could start to actually
discuss like okay what is the essential

6912
02:13:17,810 --> 02:13:17,820
discuss like okay what is the essential
 

6913
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:19,970
discuss like okay what is the essential
thing about gebo how much what is the

6914
02:13:19,970 --> 02:13:19,980
thing about gebo how much what is the
 

6915
02:13:19,980 --> 02:13:21,589
thing about gebo how much what is the
cheapest way I can have a screen what's

6916
02:13:21,589 --> 02:13:21,599
cheapest way I can have a screen what's
 

6917
02:13:21,599 --> 02:13:23,510
cheapest way I can have a screen what's
the cheapest way I can have a rotating

6918
02:13:23,510 --> 02:13:23,520
the cheapest way I can have a rotating
 

6919
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:25,069
the cheapest way I can have a rotating
base right all that kind of stuff and

6920
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:25,079
base right all that kind of stuff and
 

6921
02:13:25,079 --> 02:13:26,830
base right all that kind of stuff and
then and then you get to get down

6922
02:13:26,830 --> 02:13:26,840
then and then you get to get down
 

6923
02:13:26,840 --> 02:13:29,510
then and then you get to get down
continuously drive down costs

6924
02:13:29,510 --> 02:13:29,520

what else is there to actually so Step

6994
02:14:46,129 --> 02:14:46,139
what else is there to actually so Step
 

6995
02:14:46,139 --> 02:14:48,310
what else is there to actually so Step
One is the hardest but

6996
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:48,320
One is the hardest but
 

6997

there's other steps as well right
 

6999
02:14:51,119 --> 02:14:54,290
there's other steps as well right
um I also think

7000
02:14:54,290 --> 02:14:54,300
um I also think
 

7001
02:14:54,300 --> 02:14:56,030
um I also think
like who you bring around the table

7002
02:14:56,030 --> 02:14:56,040
like who you bring around the table
 

7003
02:14:56,040 --> 02:14:58,790
like who you bring around the table
early on is so key right like being

7004
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
early on is so key right like being
 

7005
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:01,069
early on is so key right like being
clear on on what I call like your core

7006
02:15:01,069 --> 02:15:01,079
clear on on what I call like your core
 

7007
02:15:01,079 --> 02:15:03,290
clear on on what I call like your core
values or your North Star it might sound

7008
02:15:03,290 --> 02:15:03,300
values or your North Star it might sound
 

7009
02:15:03,300 --> 02:15:05,689
values or your North Star it might sound
fluffy but actually it's not so

7010
02:15:05,689 --> 02:15:05,699
fluffy but actually it's not so
 

7011
02:15:05,699 --> 02:15:08,569
fluffy but actually it's not so
and Roz and I feel like we did that very

7012
02:15:08,569 --> 02:15:08,579
and Roz and I feel like we did that very
 

7013
02:15:08,579 --> 02:15:10,310
and Roz and I feel like we did that very
early on we sat around her kitchen table

7014
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
early on we sat around her kitchen table
 

7015
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:12,229
early on we sat around her kitchen table
and we said okay there's so many

7016
02:15:12,229 --> 02:15:12,239
and we said okay there's so many
 

7017
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:14,030
and we said okay there's so many
applications of this technology how are

7018
02:15:14,030 --> 02:15:14,040
applications of this technology how are
 

7019
02:15:14,040 --> 02:15:15,530
applications of this technology how are
we going to draw the line how are we

7020
02:15:15,530 --> 02:15:15,540
we going to draw the line how are we
 

7021
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:17,510
we going to draw the line how are we
going to set boundaries we came up with

7022
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:17,520
going to set boundaries we came up with
 

7023
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,450
going to set boundaries we came up with
a set of core values that in the hardest

7024
02:15:20,450 --> 02:15:20,460
a set of core values that in the hardest
 

7025
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:23,510
a set of core values that in the hardest
of times we fell back on to determine

7026
02:15:23,510 --> 02:15:23,520
of times we fell back on to determine
 

7027
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:26,030
of times we fell back on to determine
how we make decisions and so I feel like

7028
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:26,040
how we make decisions and so I feel like
 

7029
02:15:26,040 --> 02:15:27,830
how we make decisions and so I feel like
just getting Clarity on these core like

7030
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
just getting Clarity on these core like
 

7031
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,270
just getting Clarity on these core like
for us it was respecting people's

7032
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:29,280
for us it was respecting people's
 

7033
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,390
for us it was respecting people's
privacy only engaging with Industries

7034
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
privacy only engaging with Industries
 

7035
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:34,490
privacy only engaging with Industries
where it's clear opt-in so for instance

7036
02:15:34,490 --> 02:15:34,500
where it's clear opt-in so for instance
 

7037
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,229
where it's clear opt-in so for instance
we don't do any work in security and

7038
02:15:36,229 --> 02:15:36,239
we don't do any work in security and
 

7039
02:15:36,239 --> 02:15:38,149
we don't do any work in security and
surveillance

7040
02:15:38,149 --> 02:15:38,159
surveillance
 

7041
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:40,430
surveillance
um so things like that just getting we

7042
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:40,440
um so things like that just getting we
 

7043
02:15:40,440 --> 02:15:42,109
um so things like that just getting we
very big on you know one of our core

7044
02:15:42,109 --> 02:15:42,119
very big on you know one of our core
 

7045
02:15:42,119 --> 02:15:44,089
very big on you know one of our core
values is human connection and empathy

7046
02:15:44,089 --> 02:15:44,099
values is human connection and empathy
 

7047
02:15:44,099 --> 02:15:46,370
values is human connection and empathy
right and that is yes it's an AI company

7048
02:15:46,370 --> 02:15:46,380
right and that is yes it's an AI company
 

7049
02:15:46,380 --> 02:15:49,250
right and that is yes it's an AI company
but it's about people well these are all

7050
02:15:49,250 --> 02:15:49,260
but it's about people well these are all
 

7051
02:15:49,260 --> 02:15:51,709
but it's about people well these are all
they become encoded in how we

7052
02:15:51,709 --> 02:15:51,719
they become encoded in how we
 

7053
02:15:51,719 --> 02:15:54,589
they become encoded in how we
act even even if you're a small tiny

7054
02:15:54,589 --> 02:15:54,599
act even even if you're a small tiny
 

7055
02:15:54,599 --> 02:15:57,169
act even even if you're a small tiny
team of two or three or whatever

7056
02:15:57,169 --> 02:15:57,179
team of two or three or whatever
 

7057
02:15:57,179 --> 02:15:59,330
team of two or three or whatever
um so I think that's another piece of

7058
02:15:59,330 --> 02:15:59,340
um so I think that's another piece of
 

7059
02:15:59,340 --> 02:16:01,189
um so I think that's another piece of
advice so what about finding people

7060
02:16:01,189 --> 02:16:01,199
advice so what about finding people
 

7061
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:03,770
advice so what about finding people
hiring people if you care about people

7062
02:16:03,770 --> 02:16:03,780
hiring people if you care about people
 

7063
02:16:03,780 --> 02:16:06,770
hiring people if you care about people
as much as you do like and it's it's it

7064
02:16:06,770 --> 02:16:06,780
as much as you do like and it's it's it
 

7065
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:08,810
as much as you do like and it's it's it
seems like such a difficult thing to uh

7066
02:16:08,810 --> 02:16:08,820
seems like such a difficult thing to uh
 

7067
02:16:08,820 --> 02:16:11,569
seems like such a difficult thing to uh
to hire the right people I think early

to hire the right people I think early
 

7069
02:16:11,579 --> 02:16:14,450

it you're not exactly clear
of what uh maybe maybe with the core

7270
02:20:01,550 --> 02:20:01,560
of what uh maybe maybe with the core
 

7271
02:20:01,560 --> 02:20:03,950
of what uh maybe maybe with the core
powerful idea is like you can't just

7272
02:20:03,950 --> 02:20:03,960
powerful idea is like you can't just
 

7273
02:20:03,960 --> 02:20:06,410
powerful idea is like you can't just
build another Facebook or

um there has to be a
 

7277
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:11,030
um there has to be a
there has to be a core

7278
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:11,040
there has to be a core
 

7279
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:13,610
there has to be a core
simple to explain idea that yeah that

7280
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:13,620
simple to explain idea that yeah that
 

7281
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:15,650
simple to explain idea that yeah that
then you can or can't get excited about

7282
02:20:15,650 --> 02:20:15,660

7284
02:20:17,630 --> 02:20:17,640
but this it's there it's something right
 

7285
02:20:17,640 --> 02:20:18,710
but this it's there it's something right
there yeah

7286
02:20:18,710 --> 02:20:18,720
there yeah
 

7287
02:20:18,720 --> 02:20:23,050
there yeah
yeah what uh but how do you ultimately

7288
02:20:23,050 --> 02:20:23,060
yeah what uh but how do you ultimately
 

7289
02:20:23,060 --> 02:20:25,490
yeah what uh but how do you ultimately

right and

7296
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:33,840

 

7297
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:35,770

companies which is where I'm investing

7298
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:35,780
companies which is where I'm investing
 

7299
02:20:35,780 --> 02:20:39,230
companies which is where I'm investing
sometimes the the business model isn't

7300
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:39,240
sometimes the the business model isn't
 

7301
02:20:39,240 --> 02:20:41,690
sometimes the the business model isn't
clear yet or the go to market strategy

7302
02:20:41,690 --> 02:20:41,700
clear yet or the go to market strategy
 

7303
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,130
clear yet or the go to market strategy
isn't clear there's usually like it's

7304
02:20:43,130 --> 02:20:43,140
isn't clear there's usually like it's
 

7305
02:20:43,140 --> 02:20:44,750
isn't clear there's usually like it's
very early on that some of these things

7306
02:20:44,750 --> 02:20:44,760
very early on that some of these things
 

7307
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:47,929
very early on that some of these things
haven't been hashed out which is okay so

7308
02:20:47,929 --> 02:20:47,939
haven't been hashed out which is okay so
 

7309
02:20:47,939 --> 02:20:49,429
haven't been hashed out which is okay so
the way I like to think about it is like

7310
02:20:49,429 --> 02:20:49,439
the way I like to think about it is like
 

7311
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:51,530
the way I like to think about it is like
if this company is successful will this

7312
02:20:51,530 --> 02:20:51,540
if this company is successful will this
 

7313
02:20:51,540 --> 02:20:53,630
if this company is successful will this
be a multi-billion slash trillion dollar

7314
02:20:53,630 --> 02:20:53,640
be a multi-billion slash trillion dollar
 

7315
02:20:53,640 --> 02:20:56,570
be a multi-billion slash trillion dollar
market operative you know or company and

7316
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:56,580
market operative you know or company and
 

7317
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:59,510
market operative you know or company and
and so that's definitely a lens that I

7318
02:20:59,510 --> 02:20:59,520
and so that's definitely a lens that I
 

7319
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,410
and so that's definitely a lens that I
use

7320
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:00,420
use
 

7321
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:02,510
use
um what's pre what's pre-seed what are

7322
02:21:02,510 --> 02:21:02,520
um what's pre what's pre-seed what are
 

7323
02:21:02,520 --> 02:21:04,610
um what's pre what's pre-seed what are
the different stages and what's the most

7324
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:04,620
the different stages and what's the most
 

7325
02:21:04,620 --> 02:21:07,190
the different stages and what's the most
exciting stage and what's or not what's

7326
02:21:07,190 --> 02:21:07,200
exciting stage and what's or not what's
 

7327
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:09,410
exciting stage and what's or not what's
what's interesting about every stage I

7328
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:09,420
what's interesting about every stage I
 

7329
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:12,410
what's interesting about every stage I
guess yeah so a pre-seed is usually when

7330
02:21:12,410 --> 02:21:12,420
guess yeah so a pre-seed is usually when

uncertainty so some investors really
don't like this stage because the

we often were so obsessed with with the

7606
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:28,620
we often were so obsessed with with the
 

7607
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:30,530
we often were so obsessed with with the
end goal

7608
02:26:30,530 --> 02:26:30,540
end goal
 

7609
02:26:30,540 --> 02:26:34,190
end goal
a that doesn't allow us to be open to

7610
02:26:34,190 --> 02:26:34,200
a that doesn't allow us to be open to
 

7611
02:26:34,200 --> 02:26:36,590
a that doesn't allow us to be open to
different endings of a journey or a

7612
02:26:36,590 --> 02:26:36,600
different endings of a journey or a
 

7613
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,570
different endings of a journey or a
story

7614
02:26:38,570 --> 02:26:38,580
story
 

7615
02:26:38,580 --> 02:26:40,910
story
um so you become like so fixated on a

7616
02:26:40,910 --> 02:26:40,920
um so you become like so fixated on a
 

7617
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:42,889
um so you become like so fixated on a
particular path you don't see the beauty

7618
02:26:42,889 --> 02:26:42,899
particular path you don't see the beauty
 

7619
02:26:42,899 --> 02:26:45,650
particular path you don't see the beauty
in the other alternative path

7620
02:26:45,650 --> 02:26:45,660
in the other alternative path
 

7621
02:26:45,660 --> 02:26:46,849
in the other alternative path
um

7622
02:26:46,849 --> 02:26:46,859
um
 

7623
02:26:46,859 --> 02:26:48,650
um
and then you forget to enjoy the journey

7624
02:26:48,650 --> 02:26:48,660
and then you forget to enjoy the journey
 

7625
02:26:48,660 --> 02:26:50,450
and then you forget to enjoy the journey
because you're just so fixated on the

7626
02:26:50,450 --> 02:26:50,460
because you're just so fixated on the
 

7627
02:26:50,460 --> 02:26:52,670
because you're just so fixated on the
goal and I've been guilty of that

7628
02:26:52,670 --> 02:26:52,680
goal and I've been guilty of that

guess in the space of emotions more than
 

7689
02:28:04,140 --> 02:28:05,870
guess in the space of emotions more than
in the space of like

7690
02:28:05,870 --> 02:28:05,880
in the space of like
 

7691
02:28:05,880 --> 02:28:09,110
in the space of like
this will be like in the rational space

7692
02:28:09,110 --> 02:28:09,120
this will be like in the rational space
 

7693
02:28:09,120 --> 02:28:10,809
this will be like in the rational space
because I just

7694
02:28:10,809 --> 02:28:10,819
because I just
 

7695
02:28:10,819 --> 02:28:14,090
because I just
tried to picture a world that I would

7696
02:28:14,090 --> 02:28:14,100
tried to picture a world that I would
 

7697
02:28:14,100 --> 02:28:15,650
tried to picture a world that I would
like to be in

7698
02:28:15,650 --> 02:28:15,660
like to be in
 

7699
02:28:15,660 --> 02:28:17,570
like to be in
and that world is not clearly pictured

7700
02:28:17,570 --> 02:28:17,580
and that world is not clearly pictured
 

7701
02:28:17,580 --> 02:28:19,550
and that world is not clearly pictured
it's mostly in the emotional world I

7702
02:28:19,550 --> 02:28:19,560
it's mostly in the emotional world I
 

7703
02:28:19,560 --> 02:28:22,070
it's mostly in the emotional world I
mean I think about that from from robots

7704
02:28:22,070 --> 02:28:22,080
mean I think about that from from robots
 

7705
02:28:22,080 --> 02:28:25,010
mean I think about that from from robots
because you know I have this desire

7706
02:28:25,010 --> 02:28:25,020
because you know I have this desire
 

7707
02:28:25,020 --> 02:28:28,130
because you know I have this desire
I've had it my whole life to to well

7708
02:28:28,130 --> 02:28:28,140
I've had it my whole life to to well
 

7709
02:28:28,140 --> 02:28:30,370
I've had it my whole life to to well
they took different shapes but I think

7710
02:28:30,370 --> 02:28:30,380
they took different shapes but I think
 

7711
02:28:30,380 --> 02:28:34,630
they took different shapes but I think
once I discovered AI the desire was to

7712
02:28:34,630 --> 02:28:34,640
once I discovered AI the desire was to
 

7713
02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:37,849
once I discovered AI the desire was to
I think in this in the context of this

7714
02:28:37,849 --> 02:28:37,859
I think in this in the context of this
 

7715
02:28:37,859 --> 02:28:40,010
I think in this in the context of this
conversation could be easily easier

7716
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:40,020
conversation could be easily easier
 

7717
02:28:40,020 --> 02:28:42,230
conversation could be easily easier
described as basically a social robotics

7718
02:28:42,230 --> 02:28:42,240
described as basically a social robotics
 

7719
02:28:42,240 --> 02:28:44,929
described as basically a social robotics
company and that's something I dreamed

7720
02:28:44,929 --> 02:28:44,939
company and that's something I dreamed
 

7721
02:28:44,939 --> 02:28:46,610
company and that's something I dreamed
of doing

7722
02:28:46,610 --> 02:28:46,620
of doing
 

7723
02:28:46,620 --> 02:28:48,830
of doing
and

7724
02:28:48,830 --> 02:28:48,840
and
 

7725
02:28:48,840 --> 02:28:51,110
and
um well there's a lot there's a lot of

7726
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,120
um well there's a lot there's a lot of
 

7727
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:52,969
um well there's a lot there's a lot of
complexity to that story but that that's

7728
02:28:52,969 --> 02:28:52,979
complexity to that story but that that's
 

7729
02:28:52,979 --> 02:28:54,590
complexity to that story but that that's
that's the that's the only thing

7730
02:28:54,590 --> 02:28:54,600
that's the that's the only thing
 

7731
02:28:54,600 --> 02:28:56,630
that's the that's the only thing
honestly I dream of doing so I I imagine

7732
02:28:56,630 --> 02:28:56,640
honestly I dream of doing so I I imagine
 

7733
02:28:56,640 --> 02:28:59,870
honestly I dream of doing so I I imagine
a world that

7734
02:28:59,870 --> 02:28:59,880
a world that
 

7735
02:28:59,880 --> 02:29:03,349
a world that
that I could help create but it's not um

7736
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
that I could help create but it's not um
 

7737
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:06,170
that I could help create but it's not um
there's no steps along the way and I

7738
02:29:06,170 --> 02:29:06,180
there's no steps along the way and I
 

7739
02:29:06,180 --> 02:29:08,830
there's no steps along the way and I
think I'm just kind of stumbling around

7740
02:29:08,830 --> 02:29:08,840
think I'm just kind of stumbling around
 

7741
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:11,690
think I'm just kind of stumbling around
and following happiness

7742
02:29:11,690 --> 02:29:11,700
and following happiness
 

7743
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:14,630
and following happiness
and working my ass off in almost ran

7744
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:14,640
and working my ass off in almost ran
 

7745
02:29:14,640 --> 02:29:17,630
and working my ass off in almost ran

there's a balance to be struck of course
 

7761
02:29:30,300 --> 02:29:32,870
there's a balance to be struck of course
but

7762

super inspiring talk Kenneth Stanley he

7794
02:30:06,889 --> 02:30:06,899
super inspiring talk Kenneth Stanley he
 

7795
02:30:06,899 --> 02:30:09,710
super inspiring talk Kenneth Stanley he
was at open AI he just laughed and

7796
02:30:09,710 --> 02:30:09,720
was at open AI he just laughed and
 

7797
02:30:09,720 --> 02:30:11,750
was at open AI he just laughed and
here's a book called why greatness can't

7798
02:30:11,750 --> 02:30:11,760
here's a book called why greatness can't
 

7799
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:13,550
here's a book called why greatness can't
be planned and it's actually an AI book

7800
02:30:13,550 --> 02:30:13,560
be planned and it's actually an AI book
 

7801
02:30:13,560 --> 02:30:16,010
be planned and it's actually an AI book
so and he's done all these experiments

7802
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:16,020
so and he's done all these experiments
 

7803
02:30:16,020 --> 02:30:18,050
so and he's done all these experiments
that basically show that when you over

7804
02:30:18,050 --> 02:30:18,060
that basically show that when you over
 

7805
02:30:18,060 --> 02:30:20,150
that basically show that when you over
optimize

7806
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:20,160
optimize
 

7807
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:22,730
optimize
you you it like the trade-off is you're

7808
02:30:22,730 --> 02:30:22,740
you you it like the trade-off is you're
 

7809
02:30:22,740 --> 02:30:25,610
you you it like the trade-off is you're
less creative right and to create

7810
02:30:25,610 --> 02:30:25,620
less creative right and to create
 

7811
02:30:25,620 --> 02:30:28,010
less creative right and to create
true greatness and truly Creative

7812
02:30:28,010 --> 02:30:28,020
true greatness and truly Creative
 

7813
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:30,349
true greatness and truly Creative
Solutions to problems you can't over

7814
02:30:30,349 --> 02:30:30,359
Solutions to problems you can't over
 

7815
02:30:30,359 --> 02:30:33,050
Solutions to problems you can't over
plan it you can't and I thought that was

7816
02:30:33,050 --> 02:30:33,060
plan it you can't and I thought that was
 

7817
02:30:33,060 --> 02:30:35,630
plan it you can't and I thought that was
and so he generalizes it Beyond Ai and

7818
02:30:35,630 --> 02:30:35,640
and so he generalizes it Beyond Ai and
 

7819
02:30:35,640 --> 02:30:37,550
and so he generalizes it Beyond Ai and
he talks about how we apply that in our

7820
02:30:37,550 --> 02:30:37,560
he talks about how we apply that in our
 

7821
02:30:37,560 --> 02:30:39,830
he talks about how we apply that in our
personal life and our organizations and

7822
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:39,840
personal life and our organizations and
 

7823

our companies which are over kpi right
 

7825
02:30:42,240 --> 02:30:43,730
our companies which are over kpi right
like look at any company in the world

7826

like look at any company in the world
 

7827
02:30:43,740 --> 02:30:45,290
like look at any company in the world
and it's all like these are the goals

7828
02:30:45,290 --> 02:30:45,300
and it's all like these are the goals
 

7829
02:30:45,300 --> 02:30:47,809
and it's all like these are the goals
these are the you know weekly goals and

7830
02:30:47,809 --> 02:30:47,819
these are the you know weekly goals and
 

7831
02:30:47,819 --> 02:30:49,610
these are the you know weekly goals and
you know the Sprints and then the

7832
02:30:49,610 --> 02:30:49,620
you know the Sprints and then the
 

7833
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:51,230
you know the Sprints and then the
quarterly goals blah blah blah and and

quarterly goals blah blah blah and and
he just shows with a lot of his AI

7836
02:30:54,650 --> 02:30:54,660
he just shows with a lot of his AI
 

7837
02:30:54,660 --> 02:30:56,750
he just shows with a lot of his AI
experiments that that's not how you

7838
02:30:56,750 --> 02:30:56,760
experiments that that's not how you
 

7839
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:59,870
experiments that that's not how you
create truly game changing ideas so

7840
02:30:59,870 --> 02:30:59,880
create truly game changing ideas so
 

7841
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:03,230
create truly game changing ideas so
there you go yeah yeah he's awesome yeah

there you go yeah yeah he's awesome yeah
 

7843
02:31:03,240 --> 02:31:04,610
there you go yeah yeah he's awesome yeah
there's there's a balance of course

7844
02:31:04,610 --> 02:31:04,620
there's there's a balance of course
 

7845
02:31:04,620 --> 02:31:08,090
there's there's a balance of course
that's yeah many moments of Genius will

7846
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:08,100
that's yeah many moments of Genius will
 

7847
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:10,969
that's yeah many moments of Genius will
not come from planning and goals but

7848
02:31:10,969 --> 02:31:10,979
not come from planning and goals but
 

7849
02:31:10,979 --> 02:31:13,190
not come from planning and goals but
you still have to build factories and

our goals but but
I think we're starting to morph into

7864
02:31:25,849 --> 02:31:25,859
I think we're starting to morph into
 

7865
02:31:25,859 --> 02:31:27,830
I think we're starting to morph into
more of these like bigger picture goals

7866
02:31:27,830 --> 02:31:27,840
more of these like bigger picture goals
 

7867

and not obsessed about like I don't know
it's hard well I honestly think

7870
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:32,399
it's hard well I honestly think
 

7871
02:31:32,399 --> 02:31:34,309
it's hard well I honestly think
especially with kids it's better much

7872
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
especially with kids it's better much
 

7873
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:35,630
especially with kids it's better much
much better to have a plan and have

7874
02:31:35,630 --> 02:31:35,640
much better to have a plan and have
 

7875
02:31:35,640 --> 02:31:37,250
much better to have a plan and have
goals and so on because you have to you

7876
02:31:37,250 --> 02:31:37,260
goals and so on because you have to you
 

7877
02:31:37,260 --> 02:31:39,050
goals and so on because you have to you
have to learn the muscle of like what it

7878
02:31:39,050 --> 02:31:39,060
have to learn the muscle of like what it
 

7879
02:31:39,060 --> 02:31:41,270
have to learn the muscle of like what it
feels like to get stuff done yeah but I

7880
02:31:41,270 --> 02:31:41,280
feels like to get stuff done yeah but I
 

7881
02:31:41,280 --> 02:31:42,770
feels like to get stuff done yeah but I
think once you learn that there's

7882
02:31:42,770 --> 02:31:42,780
think once you learn that there's
 

7883
02:31:42,780 --> 02:31:45,290
think once you learn that there's
flexibility for me because I I spend

7884
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:45,300
flexibility for me because I I spend
 

7885
02:31:45,300 --> 02:31:47,870
flexibility for me because I I spend
most of my life with goal setting and so

02:32:10,630 --> 02:32:10,640
of most humans if they took one of them
 

7907
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:13,849
of most humans if they took one of them
later in life it's like really difficult

later in life it's like really difficult
 

7909
02:32:13,859 --> 02:32:16,070
later in life it's like really difficult
stuff especially in engineering

7910
02:32:16,070 --> 02:32:16,080
stuff especially in engineering
 

7911
02:32:16,080 --> 02:32:17,510
stuff especially in engineering
curricula so

7912
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,520
curricula so
 

7913
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,110
curricula so
um

once you learn it you can maybe because
 

7919
02:32:22,080 --> 02:32:23,990
once you learn it you can maybe because
you're you can be a little bit of on

7920
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:24,000
you're you can be a little bit of on
 

7921
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,389
you're you can be a little bit of on
autopilot and use that momentum and then

7922
02:32:26,389 --> 02:32:26,399
autopilot and use that momentum and then
 

7923
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:28,670
autopilot and use that momentum and then
allow yourself to be lost in the flow of

7924
02:32:28,670 --> 02:32:28,680
allow yourself to be lost in the flow of
 

7925
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:30,950
allow yourself to be lost in the flow of
life you know just kind of

life you know just kind of
 

7927
02:32:30,960 --> 02:32:31,929
life you know just kind of
um

I work pretty hard to allow myself to
have the freedom to do that that's

7934
02:32:39,830 --> 02:32:39,840
have the freedom to do that that's
 

7935
02:32:39,840 --> 02:32:42,230
have the freedom to do that that's
really right that's a tricky freedom to

7936
02:32:42,230 --> 02:32:42,240
really right that's a tricky freedom to
 

7937
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:44,030
really right that's a tricky freedom to
have yeah because like a lot of people

7938

02:32:52,610 --> 02:32:52,620
whenever you get a raise
 

7945
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:54,290
whenever you get a raise
they'll get like a bigger house right

they'll get like a bigger house right
 

7947
02:32:54,300 --> 02:32:56,450
they'll get like a bigger house right
right or something like this I put very

7948
02:32:56,450 --> 02:32:56,460
right or something like this I put very
 

7949
02:32:56,460 --> 02:32:58,309
right or something like this I put very
so like there's you're always trapped in

so like there's you're always trapped in
this race I put a lot of emphasis on on

7952
02:33:00,889 --> 02:33:00,899
this race I put a lot of emphasis on on
 

7953

barely afford or having a lot of kids
 

7971
02:33:22,319 --> 02:33:25,969
barely afford or having a lot of kids
the responsibility side of that uh is

7972
02:33:25,969 --> 02:33:25,979
the responsibility side of that uh is
 

7973
02:33:25,979 --> 02:33:27,650
the responsibility side of that uh is
really helps them get their [\h__\h]

together like all right I need to be
 

7977
02:33:29,460 --> 02:33:31,610
together like all right I need to be
really focused some of the most

almost something to actually live and
 

7989
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:44,330
almost something to actually live and
fight and work for like having a family

7990

fight and work for like having a family
 

7991
02:33:44,340 --> 02:33:46,429

02:33:46,429 --> 02:33:46,439
yeah it's it's fascinating to see
 

7993
02:33:46,439 --> 02:33:48,410
yeah it's it's fascinating to see
because you would think kids would be a

7994
02:33:48,410 --> 02:33:48,420
because you would think kids would be a
 

7995
02:33:48,420 --> 02:33:50,929
because you would think kids would be a
hit on productivity but they're not for
