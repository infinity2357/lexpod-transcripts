of just my this sounds very dramatic but
 

283
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,590
of just my this sounds very dramatic but

me the driving must have been crazy

286
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:55,520
me the driving must have been crazy
 

287
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,909
me the driving must have been crazy
because driving in italy is rough the

288
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:57,919
because driving in italy is rough the
 

289
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,590
because driving in italy is rough the
driving was crazy i did most of it and

290
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:01,600
driving was crazy i did most of it and
 

291
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,150
driving was crazy i did most of it and
it would be really interesting driving

292
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
it would be really interesting driving
 

293
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,790
it would be really interesting driving
through places like florence or even

294
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,800
through places like florence or even
 

295
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,870
through places like florence or even
through uh the beach areas that were

296
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
through uh the beach areas that were
 

297
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,029
through uh the beach areas that were
super windy because they're two-way

298
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:11,039
super windy because they're two-way
 

299
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,870
super windy because they're two-way
streets that should really only be one

300
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
streets that should really only be one
 

301
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,029
streets that should really only be one
way so you'd be driving this huge van

302
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:15,039
way so you'd be driving this huge van
 

303
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,270
way so you'd be driving this huge van
and then another car comes on a cliff

304
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
and then another car comes on a cliff
 

305
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,950
and then another car comes on a cliff
and you're just waiting for it to slowly

306
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
and you're just waiting for it to slowly
 

307
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,230
and you're just waiting for it to slowly
pass so

308
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:20,240
pass so
 

309
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,070
pass so
it took all of my focus and

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:22,080
it took all of my focus and
 

311
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,390
it took all of my focus and
concentration to drive well in italy but

312
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
concentration to drive well in italy but
 

313

it was actually really relaxing because
 

315
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,790
it was actually really relaxing because
the hardest thing about uh

316
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
the hardest thing about uh
 

317
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,870
the hardest thing about uh
making a lot of videos online is you're

318
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
making a lot of videos online is you're
 

319
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,550
making a lot of videos online is you're
always thinking about it what's coming

320
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:32,560
always thinking about it what's coming
 

321

the other way i think about it is
it is the skill to learn how to

1218

you could pull things off um but there's

1558
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:27,679
you could pull things off um but there's
 

1559
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,190
you could pull things off um but there's
also a limit it's more like you've had

1560
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
also a limit it's more like you've had
 

1561
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,190
also a limit it's more like you've had
one drink or two drink but then it goes

1562
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,200
one drink or two drink but then it goes
 

1563
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,549
one drink or two drink but then it goes
beyond that and then you just start

1564
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:32,559
beyond that and then you just start
 

1565
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,390
beyond that and then you just start
missing tactics and it's not worth it

1566
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:34,400
missing tactics and it's not worth it
 

1567

three-hour game it's gonna get old but i

1590
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
three-hour game it's gonna get old but i
 

1591
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,390
three-hour game it's gonna get old but i
think in short time controls it's

1592
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:00,400
think in short time controls it's
 

1593
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,830
think in short time controls it's
amazing yeah it does definitely has to

1594
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:01,840
amazing yeah it does definitely has to
 

1595
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,669
amazing yeah it does definitely has to
be blitz it has to be where it's more

1596
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:03,679
be blitz it has to be where it's more
 

1597
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:05,669
be blitz it has to be where it's more
intuition rather than sitting in

1598
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
intuition rather than sitting in
 

1599
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:06,950
intuition rather than sitting in
calculus this is probably like

1600
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:06,960
calculus this is probably like
 

1601
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,549
calculus this is probably like
negatively affecting your ability to

1602
00:27:08,549 --> 00:27:08,559
negatively affecting your ability to
 

1603
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:10,230
negatively affecting your ability to
calculate absolutely

1604
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:10,240
calculate absolutely
 

1605
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,750
calculate absolutely
how much when you guys play when you

1606
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:11,760
how much when you guys play when you
 

1607
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,110
how much when you guys play when you
look at the chess board how much of it

1608
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,120
look at the chess board how much of it
 

1609
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,230
look at the chess board how much of it
is calculation how much of it is

1610
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:16,240
is calculation how much of it is
 

1611
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,750
is calculation how much of it is
intuition how much of it is memorized

1612
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
intuition how much of it is memorized
 

1613
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,430
intuition how much of it is memorized
openings

1614
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:21,440
openings
 

1615
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,310
openings
um

1616
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
um
 

1617
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,190
um
it really depends between short form

1618
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
it really depends between short form
 

1619
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,269
it really depends between short form
chess so five minutes three minutes one

1620
00:27:27,269 --> 00:27:27,279
chess so five minutes three minutes one
 

1621
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,110
chess so five minutes three minutes one
minute and classical chess what's your

1622
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,120
minute and classical chess what's your
 

1623
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,950
minute and classical chess what's your
favorite to play i love playing blitz

1624
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
favorite to play i love playing blitz
 

1625
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,350
favorite to play i love playing blitz
now because that's most of what i do and

1626
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:33,360
now because that's most of what i do and
 

1627
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,870
now because that's most of what i do and
that's actually how i got into chess

1628
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
that's actually how i got into chess
 

1629
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,230
that's actually how i got into chess
streaming because i couldn't spend

1630
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,240
streaming because i couldn't spend
 

1631
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,750
streaming because i couldn't spend
entire weekends or weeks playing

1632
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:37,760
entire weekends or weeks playing
 

1633
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,830
entire weekends or weeks playing
tournaments i would just while i was in

1634
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
tournaments i would just while i was in
 

1635
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,149
tournaments i would just while i was in
college log on and play these long blitz

1636
00:27:42,149 --> 00:27:42,159
college log on and play these long blitz
 

1637
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,029
college log on and play these long blitz
or bullet sessions and it's very fast so

1638
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:45,039
or bullet sessions and it's very fast so
 

1639
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,630
or bullet sessions and it's very fast so
you don't have time to go

1640
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:46,640
you don't have time to go
 

1641
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,190
you don't have time to go
calculate as deeply you basically have

1642
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,200
calculate as deeply you basically have
 

1643
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,669
calculate as deeply you basically have
to calculate short lines pretty quickly

1644
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:51,679
to calculate short lines pretty quickly
 

1645
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,430
to calculate short lines pretty quickly
and a lot of it is pattern recognition

1646
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:53,440
and a lot of it is pattern recognition
 

1647
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,830
and a lot of it is pattern recognition
and intuition um that's three minutes

1648
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:55,840
and intuition um that's three minutes
 

1649
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,990
and intuition um that's three minutes
you said three minutes yeah okay cool

1650
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,000
you said three minutes yeah okay cool
 

1651
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,070
you said three minutes yeah okay cool
and so for that it's just it's basically

1652
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
and so for that it's just it's basically
 

1653
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,630
and so for that it's just it's basically
intuition a lot of it is intuition yeah

1654
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:02,640
intuition a lot of it is intuition yeah
 

1655
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,070
intuition a lot of it is intuition yeah
see i saw on the streams you actually

1656
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
see i saw on the streams you actually
 

1657
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,750
see i saw on the streams you actually
keep talking while playing chess it

1658
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
keep talking while playing chess it
 

1659
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,350
keep talking while playing chess it
seems like yeah that's my result that

1660
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
seems like yeah that's my result that
 

1661
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,190
seems like yeah that's my result that
doesn't help my results it doesn't help

1662
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:09,200
doesn't help my results it doesn't help
 

1663
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,430
doesn't help my results it doesn't help
the content not the game yeah exactly

1664
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
the content not the game yeah exactly
 

1665
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,510
the content not the game yeah exactly
but you can still do it because i i it

1666
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:13,520
but you can still do it because i i it
 

1667
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,789
but you can still do it because i i it
feels like how can you possibly

1668
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
feels like how can you possibly
 

1669
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,510
feels like how can you possibly
concentrate while talking it's because

1670
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
concentrate while talking it's because
 

1671
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,830
concentrate while talking it's because
so much of it is intuition you're not

1672
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:19,840
so much of it is intuition you're not
 

1673
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,110
so much of it is intuition you're not
while you're talking you're thinking

1674
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,120
while you're talking you're thinking
 

1675
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,630
while you're talking you're thinking
about that topic but then you just come

1676
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:22,640
about that topic but then you just come
 

1677
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,630
about that topic but then you just come
to the board and you just understand

1678
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:24,640
to the board and you just understand
 

1679
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,470
to the board and you just understand
what you should be doing here and then

1680
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
what you should be doing here and then
 

1681
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,070
what you should be doing here and then
sometimes you get in trouble because

1682
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
sometimes you get in trouble because
 

1683
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,669
sometimes you get in trouble because
you're talking and you have now lost

1684
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
you're talking and you have now lost
 

1685
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,950
you're talking and you have now lost
half of your time you have a minute and

1686
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:30,960
half of your time you have a minute and
 

1687
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,470
half of your time you have a minute and
a half your opponent has three and

1688
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,480
a half your opponent has three and
 

1689
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,430
a half your opponent has three and
you're kind of at a disadvantage um

1690
00:28:35,430 --> 00:28:35,440
you're kind of at a disadvantage um
 

1691
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,870
you're kind of at a disadvantage um
but that kind of goes to show that

1692
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
but that kind of goes to show that
 

1693
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,549
but that kind of goes to show that
that's how blitz chess usually works

1694
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:38,559
that's how blitz chess usually works
 

1695
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,230
that's how blitz chess usually works
whereas classical is very different

1696
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,240
whereas classical is very different
 

1697
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,149
whereas classical is very different
which of you is better at chess i mean

1698
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:42,159
which of you is better at chess i mean
 

1699
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,630
which of you is better at chess i mean
let's do it this way can you

1700
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
let's do it this way can you
 

1701
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,710
let's do it this way can you
um andrea can you say

1702
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
um andrea can you say
 

1703
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,669
um andrea can you say
what is

1704
00:28:47,669 --> 00:28:47,679
what is
 

1705
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,750
what is
in which way is alex stronger than you

1706
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:49,760
in which way is alex stronger than you
 

1707
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,830
in which way is alex stronger than you
which way is she weaker than you not

1708
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
which way is she weaker than you not
 

1709
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,909
which way is she weaker than you not
physically in in terms of the ch in

1710
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:53,919
physically in in terms of the ch in
 

1711
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,029
physically in in terms of the ch in
terms of chess

1712
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
terms of chess
 

1713
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:55,990
terms of chess
um

1714
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,000
um
 

1715
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,230
um
well yes of course she is higher rated

1716
00:28:58,230 --> 00:28:58,240
well yes of course she is higher rated
 

1717
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,909
well yes of course she is higher rated
but when we do play

1718
00:28:59,909 --> 00:28:59,919
but when we do play
 

1719
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,669
but when we do play
um i think her strengths against me

1720
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
um i think her strengths against me
 

1721
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,590
um i think her strengths against me
where she really gets me is the end game

1722
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
where she really gets me is the end game
 

1723
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,990
where she really gets me is the end game
she has stronger end games so she can

1724
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,000
she has stronger end games so she can
 

1725
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,909
she has stronger end games so she can
and i actually have a stronger opening

1726
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:07,919
and i actually have a stronger opening
 

1727
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,909
and i actually have a stronger opening
um but as soon as she's i'm supposed to

1728
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:09,919
um but as soon as she's i'm supposed to
 

1729
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,470
um but as soon as she's i'm supposed to
say what is good about you not you

1730
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
say what is good about you not you
 

1731
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,470
say what is good about you not you
yeah i'm getting there well see this is

1732
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:14,480
yeah i'm getting there well see this is
 

1733
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,149
yeah i'm getting there well see this is
the same because don't worry it's

1734
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:16,159
the same because don't worry it's
 

1735
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,470
the same because don't worry it's
related okay because if i can i can get

1736
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:18,480
related okay because if i can i can get
 

1737
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,909
related okay because if i can i can get
an advantage in the beginning of the

1738
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
an advantage in the beginning of the
 

1739
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,430
an advantage in the beginning of the
game but as soon as she starts trading

1740
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:21,440
game but as soon as she starts trading
 

1741
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,430
game but as soon as she starts trading
pieces down like my confidence drops

1742
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:23,440
pieces down like my confidence drops
 

1743
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,590
pieces down like my confidence drops
because i know that the end game is the

1744
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:25,600
because i know that the end game is the
 

1745
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,430
because i know that the end game is the
hardest part of the game and the longest

1746
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:27,440
hardest part of the game and the longest
 

1747
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,269
hardest part of the game and the longest
and that's where she ends up beating me

1748
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:29,279
and that's where she ends up beating me
 

1749
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,430
and that's where she ends up beating me
so her end game is her

1750
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:31,440
so her end game is her
 

1751
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,789
so her end game is her
i think really what makes a difference

1752
00:29:32,789 --> 00:29:32,799
i think really what makes a difference
 

1753
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,389
i think really what makes a difference
and she sounds like her

1754
00:29:34,389 --> 00:29:34,399
and she sounds like her
 

1755
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,789
and she sounds like her
psychological warfare is better too

1756
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
psychological warfare is better too
 

1757
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,630
psychological warfare is better too
because if you're getting nervous that

1758
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
because if you're getting nervous that
 

1759
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,149
because if you're getting nervous that
is that but it's harder to play against

1760
00:29:40,149 --> 00:29:40,159
is that but it's harder to play against
 

1761
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,070
is that but it's harder to play against
higher rated players same how you know

1762
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,080
higher rated players same how you know
 

1763
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,310
higher rated players same how you know
magnus and former world championship

1764
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:44,320
magnus and former world championship
 

1765
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,389
magnus and former world championship
champions have that psychological edge

1766
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
champions have that psychological edge
 

1767
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,669
champions have that psychological edge
so i think it's always going to be

1768
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
so i think it's always going to be
 

1769
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,510
so i think it's always going to be
different for andrea because she knows

1770
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:49,520
different for andrea because she knows
 

1771
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,510
different for andrea because she knows
statistically she should be winning

1772
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:51,520
statistically she should be winning
 

1773
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,190
statistically she should be winning
something like one in four games but she

1774
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,200
something like one in four games but she
 

1775
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,190
something like one in four games but she
usually does better than that because

1776
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:55,200
usually does better than that because
 

1777
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,909
usually does better than that because
she's very distracting and talks a lot

1778
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
she's very distracting and talks a lot
 

1779
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,830
she's very distracting and talks a lot
that does help what does it feel like to

1780
00:29:59,830 --> 00:29:59,840
that does help what does it feel like to
 

1781
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,750
that does help what does it feel like to
play a higher rated player

1782
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:01,760
play a higher rated player
 

1783
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,870
play a higher rated player
what's the experience of that

1784
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
what's the experience of that
 

1785
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,630
what's the experience of that
in like uh

1786
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
in like uh
 

1787
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,710
in like uh
playing somebody like magnus

1788
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
playing somebody like magnus
 

1789
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,789
playing somebody like magnus
so it depends on how much higher rated

1790
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:10,799
so it depends on how much higher rated
 

1791
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,630
so it depends on how much higher rated
than you they are if it's someone who's

1792
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:12,640
than you they are if it's someone who's
 

1793
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,990
than you they are if it's someone who's
like between me and andrea let's say

1794
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,000
like between me and andrea let's say
 

1795
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,149
like between me and andrea let's say
it's a 200 point difference

1796
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:16,159
it's a 200 point difference
 

1797
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:17,669
it's a 200 point difference
you know they should win but at least

1798
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:17,679
you know they should win but at least
 

1799
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,750

my brain just went blank because the i

1812
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:33,039
my brain just went blank because the i
 

1813
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,110
my brain just went blank because the i
just know that i'm so unlikely to win

1814
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,120
just know that i'm so unlikely to win
 

1815
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,710
just know that i'm so unlikely to win
that i couldn't even play the game

1816
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
that i couldn't even play the game
 

1817
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,549
that i couldn't even play the game
properly when it's that much of a

1818
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
properly when it's that much of a
 

1819
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,669
properly when it's that much of a
difference where they should be winning

00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:39,679
difference where they should be winning
 

1821
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,310
difference where they should be winning
like 99 of the time

1822
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,320
like 99 of the time
 

1823
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,070
like 99 of the time
but that's like psychological so you're

1824
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,080
but that's like psychological so you're
 

1825
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,430
but that's like psychological so you're
saying that's the biggest experience

1826
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:45,440
saying that's the biggest experience
 

1827
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,389
saying that's the biggest experience
it's like

1828
00:30:46,389 --> 00:30:46,399
it's like
 

1829
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,310
it's like
actually knowing the numbers and

1830
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,320
actually knowing the numbers and
 

1831
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,830
actually knowing the numbers and
statistically thinking there's no way i

1832

statistically thinking there's no way i
 

1833
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,510
statistically thinking there's no way i
can win but i meant like is there a

suffocating feeling like positionally

1836
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:53,760
suffocating feeling like positionally
 

1837
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,310
suffocating feeling like positionally
you feel like you're constantly

1838
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:56,320
you feel like you're constantly
 

1839
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,750
you feel like you're constantly
under attack

1840
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:57,760
under attack
 

1841
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,669
under attack
you just feel like you're slowly getting

1842
00:30:59,669 --> 00:30:59,679
you just feel like you're slowly getting
 

1843
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,750
you just feel like you're slowly getting
outsmarted and the worst is when you

1844
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
outsmarted and the worst is when you
 

1845
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,669
outsmarted and the worst is when you
don't even know what you're doing wrong

1846
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:03,679
don't even know what you're doing wrong
 

1847
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:05,430
don't even know what you're doing wrong
you come out of that you're like

1848
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
you come out of that you're like
 

1849

you come out of that you're like
i thought i was doing great and i got

1850
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
i thought i was doing great and i got
 

1851
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,510
i thought i was doing great and i got
slowly squeezed i didn't understand what

1852
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:09,520
slowly squeezed i didn't understand what
 

1853
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,190
slowly squeezed i didn't understand what
was going on and you're just kind of

1854
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
was going on and you're just kind of
 

1855
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,350
was going on and you're just kind of
baffled it's kind of like watching alpha

1856
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:13,360
baffled it's kind of like watching alpha
 

1857
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,590
baffled it's kind of like watching alpha
zero beat up stock fish and you don't

1858
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:15,600
zero beat up stock fish and you don't
 

1859
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,590
zero beat up stock fish and you don't
really understand why it's making

1860
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:17,600
really understand why it's making
 

1861
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,110
really understand why it's making
certain moves or how it thought of the

1862
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,120
certain moves or how it thought of the
 

1863
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,110
certain moves or how it thought of the
plan you just see it slowly getting the

1864
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
plan you just see it slowly getting the
 

1865
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,669
plan you just see it slowly getting the
position better and that's what it feels

1866
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:23,679
position better and that's what it feels
 

1867
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,510
position better and that's what it feels
like i i would add

1868
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,520
like i i would add
 

1869
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,269
like i i would add
it's kind of different for me if they're

1870
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:27,279
it's kind of different for me if they're
 

1871
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,029
it's kind of different for me if they're
someone who's significantly higher rated

1872
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
someone who's significantly higher rated
 

1873
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,870
someone who's significantly higher rated
so let's say more than like 300 points

1874
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
so let's say more than like 300 points
 

1875
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,549
so let's say more than like 300 points
or you're playing magnus

what i notice is i just feel lost

1878
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
what i notice is i just feel lost
 

1879
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,389
what i notice is i just feel lost
straight as soon as i don't know my

1880
00:31:36,389 --> 00:31:36,399
straight as soon as i don't know my
 

1881
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,470
straight as soon as i don't know my
preparation because they know so many

1882
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:38,480
preparation because they know so many
 

1883
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,909
preparation because they know so many
opening lines that they're going to know

00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:39,919
opening lines that they're going to know
 

1885
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,590
opening lines that they're going to know
the best line to beat you that you

1886
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:41,600
the best line to beat you that you
 

1887
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,590
the best line to beat you that you
haven't studied so then on move 10

1888
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
haven't studied so then on move 10
 

1889
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,149
haven't studied so then on move 10
you're like he already has a maybe plus

1890
00:31:46,149 --> 00:31:46,159
you're like he already has a maybe plus
 

1891
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,710
you're like he already has a maybe plus
.5 advantage which is really small but

1892
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:48,720
.5 advantage which is really small but
 

1893
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,950
.5 advantage which is really small but
for someone with such a significant

1894
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:50,960
for someone with such a significant
 

1895
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,630
for someone with such a significant
skill level you know you already lost at

1896
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
skill level you know you already lost at
 

1897
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,269
skill level you know you already lost at
that point and it's like a third of the

1898
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279
that point and it's like a third of the
 

1899
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,190
that point and it's like a third of the

it's hard to defend as a human when

2060
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:47,919
it's hard to defend as a human when
 

2061
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,069
it's hard to defend as a human when
you're being attacked but if you don't

2062
00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:50,079
you're being attacked but if you don't
 

2063
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,909
you're being attacked but if you don't
pull off the attack as black then you're

2064
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:51,919
pull off the attack as black then you're
 

2065
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:53,829
pull off the attack as black then you're
just gonna end up being lost in the end

2066
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
just gonna end up being lost in the end
 

2067
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,909
just gonna end up being lost in the end
game so it's like a very asymmetrical

2068
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
game so it's like a very asymmetrical
 

2069
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,550
game so it's like a very asymmetrical
position it's very asymmetrical although

2070
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
position it's very asymmetrical although
 

2071
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,470
position it's very asymmetrical although
a lot of people now stop playing into

2072
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
a lot of people now stop playing into
 

2073
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,710
a lot of people now stop playing into
the classical kings indian even though

2074
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:02,720
the classical kings indian even though
 

2075
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,950
the classical kings indian even though
computers give it a big advantage and

2076
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
computers give it a big advantage and
 

2077
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,790
computers give it a big advantage and
they play these slower lines in the

2078
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
they play these slower lines in the
 

2079
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,589
they play these slower lines in the
king's indian which are less fun to play

2080
00:35:09,589 --> 00:35:09,599
king's indian which are less fun to play
 

2081
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:11,510
king's indian which are less fun to play
what's slower mean it takes a longer

2082
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:11,520
what's slower mean it takes a longer
 

2083
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,190
what's slower mean it takes a longer
time to like

they basically don't let you get as much

2088
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
they basically don't let you get as much
 

2089
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,390
they basically don't let you get as much
of a kingside attack because they try

2090

of a kingside attack because they try
 

2091
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,710
of a kingside attack because they try
opening up the center and then you have

2092
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:22,720
opening up the center and then you have
 

2093
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,630
opening up the center and then you have
no weaknesses but you're just slowly

2094
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
no weaknesses but you're just slowly
 

2095
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,870
no weaknesses but you're just slowly

sometimes which is called hanging pawns
 

2133
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,990
sometimes which is called hanging pawns
when you have two pawns right next to

when you have two pawns right next to
 

2135
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,829
when you have two pawns right next to
each other with no other pawns to defend

each other with no other pawns to defend
 

2137
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:09,510
each other with no other pawns to defend
them yeah um so it it is a value valid

2138
00:36:09,510 --> 00:36:09,520
them yeah um so it it is a value valid
 

2139
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,710
them yeah um so it it is a value valid
point and actually as black you're

2140
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:10,720
point and actually as black you're
 

2141
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,470
point and actually as black you're
trying to break apart these pawns or get

2142
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
trying to break apart these pawns or get
 

2143
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,630
trying to break apart these pawns or get
them to push and create some holes into

2144
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
them to push and create some holes into
 

2145
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,750
them to push and create some holes into
the position

2146
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:15,760
the position
 

2147
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,790
the position
but it's

2148
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:16,800
but it's
 

2149
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,950
but it's
a trade-off and that's a lot of what

2150
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
a trade-off and that's a lot of what
 

2151

a trade-off and that's a lot of what
chess openings are about

chess openings are about
 

2153
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,550
chess openings are about
you get more space but you'll also end

2154
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:22,560
you get more space but you'll also end
 

2155
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,990
you get more space but you'll also end
up having to protect your pawns

2156
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,000
up having to protect your pawns
 

2157
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,750
up having to protect your pawns
potentially or move them forward to the

potentially or move them forward to the
 

2159
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,270
potentially or move them forward to the
point where they're overextended and

2160
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:27,280
point where they're overextended and
 

2161
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,349
point where they're overextended and
plus pawns being vulnerable it's kind of

2162
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:29,359
plus pawns being vulnerable it's kind of
 

2163
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:31,190
plus pawns being vulnerable it's kind of
fun this it's like there's more stuff in

2164
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
fun this it's like there's more stuff in
 

2165
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,430
fun this it's like there's more stuff in
danger they're not because if it's if

2166

principles for white is get your pawns

2180
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:46,960
principles for white is get your pawns
 

2181
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,710
principles for white is get your pawns
in the center so i'd say

2182
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
in the center so i'd say
 

2183
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,790
in the center so i'd say
like this is actually preferable for

2184
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:50,800
like this is actually preferable for
 

2185

principles there we go because this is a
very good learning okay

2190
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:57,920

 

2191

okay
so then you want to develop your pieces

2298
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:45,440
so then you want to develop your pieces
 

2299
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,870
so then you want to develop your pieces
so in the beginning of the game you want

2300
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
so in the beginning of the game you want
 

2301
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,630
so in the beginning of the game you want
to take out the bishops and knights

2302
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:48,640
to take out the bishops and knights
 

2303
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,470
to take out the bishops and knights
first because you don't want to start

2304
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:50,480
first because you don't want to start
 

2305
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,990
first because you don't want to start
with the most valuable piece like the

2306
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
with the most valuable piece like the
 

2307
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:52,950
with the most valuable piece like the
queen

2308
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:52,960
queen
 

2309
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,069
queen
because then it'll become a

2310
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:54,079
because then it'll become a
 

2311
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:55,750
because then it'll become a
vulnerability and it'll get attacked

2312
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:55,760
vulnerability and it'll get attacked
 

2313
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,109
vulnerability and it'll get attacked
very early on

2314
00:38:57,109 --> 00:38:57,119
very early on
 

2315
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,270
very early on
and the reason you're taking up these

2316
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
and the reason you're taking up these
 

2317
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,950
and the reason you're taking up these
two pieces first is because you want to

2318
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:00,960
two pieces first is because you want to
 

2319
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,589
two pieces first is because you want to
castle your king so you can move a night

2320
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
castle your king so you can move a night
 

2321
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,270
castle your king so you can move a night
move or a bishop move and that's

2322
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:05,280
move or a bishop move and that's
 

2323
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,910
move or a bishop move and that's
considered developing yeah so if at this

2324
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
considered developing yeah so if at this
 

2325
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,109
considered developing yeah so if at this
stage not

2326
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
stage not
 

2327
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,910
stage not
like even before getting a few pawns out

2328
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:11,920
like even before getting a few pawns out
 

2329
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,190
like even before getting a few pawns out
you usually

2330
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,200
you usually
 

2331
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,870
you usually
want to start with getting a pawn

2332
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:14,880
want to start with getting a pawn
 

2333
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,470
want to start with getting a pawn
because you want to get space in the

2334
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,480
because you want to get space in the
 

2335
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,950
because you want to get space in the
center but also when you push pawns it

2336
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
center but also when you push pawns it
 

2337
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,430
center but also when you push pawns it
helps free up some of your pieces

2338
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:21,440
helps free up some of your pieces
 

2339
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,390
helps free up some of your pieces
um

2340
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:22,400
um
 

2341
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,790
um
so usually start with one pawn first and

2342
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
so usually start with one pawn first and
 

2343
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,390
so usually start with one pawn first and
then you can start taking out your minor

2344
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:26,400
then you can start taking out your minor
 

2345
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,150
then you can start taking out your minor
pieces which is the bishop in the night

2346
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,160
pieces which is the bishop in the night
 

2347

i can develop my own knight and defend
it as well

2374
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:53,520
it as well
 

2375
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,270
it as well
okay and now for people just listening

2376
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:55,280
okay and now for people just listening
 

2377
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,829
okay and now for people just listening
there's two pawns that just came out to

2378
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:57,839
there's two pawns that just came out to
 

2379
00:39:57,839 --> 00:39:59,990
there's two pawns that just came out to
meet each other and a couple of nights

2380
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,000
meet each other and a couple of nights
 

2381
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,710
meet each other and a couple of nights
we love the chess card

2382
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
we love the chess card
 

2383
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,150
we love the chess card
the pawns met after midnight yeah yeah

2384
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,160
the pawns met after midnight yeah yeah
 

2385
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,310
the pawns met after midnight yeah yeah
i'm gonna romanticize the game a bit

2386
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:08,320
i'm gonna romanticize the game a bit
 

2387
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,030
i'm gonna romanticize the game a bit
exactly uh okay cool so

2388
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
exactly uh okay cool so
 

2389
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,030
exactly uh okay cool so
so like there's uh

2390
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
so like there's uh
 

2391
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,390
so like there's uh
if you bring out the bishops with the

2392
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,400
if you bring out the bishops with the
 

2393
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,589
if you bring out the bishops with the
knights you're matching that with the

2394
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
knights you're matching that with the
 

2395
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:18,230
knights you're matching that with the
other uh the black is going to match it

2396
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:18,240
other uh the black is going to match it
 

2397
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,310
other uh the black is going to match it
whatever you're attacking with yeah

2398
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:20,320
whatever you're attacking with yeah
 

2399
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,470
whatever you're attacking with yeah
can't defend it i could develop your

2400
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
can't defend it i could develop your
 

2401
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,550
can't defend it i could develop your
bishop or your knight whatever you'd

2402
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:24,560
bishop or your knight whatever you'd
 

2403
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,349
bishop or your knight whatever you'd
like

2404
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:25,359
like
 

2405
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,150
like
oh no now you gave him options oh right

2406
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
oh no now you gave him options oh right
 

2407
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,950
oh no now you gave him options oh right
yeah

2408
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:28,960
yeah
 

2409
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,990
yeah
there you go

2410
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,000
there you go
 

2411
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,910
there you go
now i am attacking the pawn in the

2412
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
now i am attacking the pawn in the
 

2413
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,510
now i am attacking the pawn in the
center which is what you were afraid

2414
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
center which is what you were afraid
 

2415
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,829
center which is what you were afraid
about before but let's see how you

2416
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
about before but let's see how you
 

2417
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,430
about before but let's see how you
defend it here

2418
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440

 

2419
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,910

by doing this symmetrical thing bringing

2420
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:43,920
by doing this symmetrical thing bringing
 

2421
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,750
by doing this symmetrical thing bringing
out the knight on the other side and

2422
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
out the knight on the other side and
 

2423
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,670
out the knight on the other side and
actually your other move was good as

2424
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:47,680
actually your other move was good as
 

2425
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,270
actually your other move was good as
well defending with the pawn because

2426
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:49,280
well defending with the pawn because
 

2427
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,030
well defending with the pawn because
then you're freeing up space for your

2428
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,040
then you're freeing up space for your
 

2429
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,190
then you're freeing up space for your
bishop so you're basically trying to

2430
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:53,200
bishop so you're basically trying to
 

2431
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,030
bishop so you're basically trying to
develop your pieces as quickly as

2432
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
develop your pieces as quickly as
 

2433
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,349
develop your pieces as quickly as
possible put your pawns in the center

2434
00:40:57,349 --> 00:40:57,359
possible put your pawns in the center
 

2435
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:59,589
possible put your pawns in the center
and then get your king to safety and

2436
00:40:59,589 --> 00:40:59,599
and then get your king to safety and
 

2437
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,150
and then get your king to safety and
that's usually the basic opening tips

2438
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:02,160
that's usually the basic opening tips
 

2439
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,069
that's usually the basic opening tips
that you get it is kind of

2440
00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:04,079
that you get it is kind of
 

2441
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,150
that you get it is kind of
counterintuitive that safety is in the

2442
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,160
counterintuitive that safety is in the
 

2443
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,950
counterintuitive that safety is in the
corner of the board for kings

2444
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
corner of the board for kings
 

2445
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,870
corner of the board for kings
that was always confusing to me but you

2446
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
that was always confusing to me but you
 

2447
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,109
that was always confusing to me but you
know three pawns in front though you

2448
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:13,119
know three pawns in front though you
 

2449
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,190
know three pawns in front though you
typically don't push those

2450
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
typically don't push those
 

2451
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,589
typically don't push those
maybe like one maybe i'll go one square

2452
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
maybe like one maybe i'll go one square
 

2453
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:18,309
maybe like one maybe i'll go one square
but

2454
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
but
 

2455
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,390
but
these are will be like the wall of

2456
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
these are will be like the wall of
 

2457
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,630
these are will be like the wall of
defense that keep them safe but another

2458
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:22,640
defense that keep them safe but another
 

2459
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,270
defense that keep them safe but another
way to also think about it is um your

2460
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
way to also think about it is um your
 

2461
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,430
way to also think about it is um your
pieces usually want to point towards the

2462
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:27,440
pieces usually want to point towards the
 

2463
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,270
pieces usually want to point towards the
center if you have a knight closer to

2464
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
center if you have a knight closer to
 

2465
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,430
center if you have a knight closer to
the center then closer to the side it

2466
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:31,440
the center then closer to the side it
 

2467
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,910
the center then closer to the side it
actually has more squares it can go to

2468
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
actually has more squares it can go to
 

2469
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,150
actually has more squares it can go to
so a huge part of it is just wanting to

2470
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:36,160
so a huge part of it is just wanting to
 

2471
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,990
so a huge part of it is just wanting to
have flexibility for where your pieces

2472
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,000
have flexibility for where your pieces
 

2473
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,109
have flexibility for where your pieces
go so more pieces are going to be able

2474
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
go so more pieces are going to be able
 

2475
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,670
go so more pieces are going to be able
to make threats in the center or even

2476
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:43,680
to make threats in the center or even
 

2477
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,910
to make threats in the center or even
open up the position so since that's

2478
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:45,920
open up the position so since that's
 

2479
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,510
open up the position so since that's
where it's most likely

2480
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
where it's most likely
 

2481
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,349
where it's most likely
to open you want your king somewhere

2482
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
to open you want your king somewhere
 

2483
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,190
to open you want your king somewhere
where the position will stay closed so

2484
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
where the position will stay closed so
 

2485
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,870
where the position will stay closed so
that you have the pawns to defend you

2486
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:52,880
that you have the pawns to defend you
 

2487
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,030
that you have the pawns to defend you
know there is like rules like this but i

2488
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:55,040
know there is like rules like this but i
 

2489
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,950
know there is like rules like this but i
always wonder because i build chess

2490
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:56,960
always wonder because i build chess
 

2491
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,109
always wonder because i build chess
engines but then

2492
00:41:59,109 --> 00:41:59,119
engines but then
 

2493
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,510
engines but then
you start to wonder like why is it that

2494
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:01,520
you start to wonder like why is it that
 

2495
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,430
you start to wonder like why is it that
positionally these things are good like

2496
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:03,440
positionally these things are good like
 

2497
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,270
positionally these things are good like
you've built up an intuition about it

2498
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:05,280
you've built up an intuition about it
 

2499
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,430
you've built up an intuition about it
but i wish and that's the thing that

2500
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
but i wish and that's the thing that
 

2501
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,950
but i wish and that's the thing that
would be amazing if engines could

2502
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:08,960
would be amazing if engines could
 

2503
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,069
would be amazing if engines could
explain

2504
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,079
explain
 

2505
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,309
explain
why is this kind of thing better than

2506
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
why is this kind of thing better than
 

2507
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,910
why is this kind of thing better than
this kind of thing you start to build up

2508
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
this kind of thing you start to build up
 

2509
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,470
this kind of thing you start to build up
an intuition but if i'm just like know

2510
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
an intuition but if i'm just like know
 

2511
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,870
an intuition but if i'm just like know
nothing about chess it feels confusing

2512
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:18,880
nothing about chess it feels confusing
 

2513
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,109
nothing about chess it feels confusing
that cornering your king

2514
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:21,119
that cornering your king
 

2515
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,390
that cornering your king
like getting them

2516
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:22,400
like getting them
 

2517
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,829
like getting them
uh

2518
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
uh
 

2519
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,910
uh
like trapped here like it feels like you

2520
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:25,920
like trapped here like it feels like you
 

2521
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,910
like trapped here like it feels like you
could get check made it easier there if

2522
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:27,920
could get check made it easier there if
 

2523
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,349
could get check made it easier there if
i was just using like dumb intuition but

2524
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:31,359
i was just using like dumb intuition but
 

2525
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:33,270
i was just using like dumb intuition but
it seems like that's not the case

2526
00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:33,280
it seems like that's not the case
 

2527
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,069
it seems like that's not the case
i imagine maybe because alpha zero

2528
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
i imagine maybe because alpha zero
 

2529
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,750
i imagine maybe because alpha zero
learned by playing games against itself

2530
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:37,760
learned by playing games against itself
 

2531
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,910
learned by playing games against itself
right yeah and i imagine if you have a

2532
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:39,920
right yeah and i imagine if you have a
 

2533
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,230
right yeah and i imagine if you have a
lot of games then you do build intuition

2534
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:42,240
lot of games then you do build intuition
 

2535
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,670
lot of games then you do build intuition
because if you were to keep your king in

2536
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:43,680
because if you were to keep your king in
 

2537
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,030
because if you were to keep your king in
the center you just see that in those

2538
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,040
the center you just see that in those
 

2539
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,550
the center you just see that in those
games you're dealing with threats a lot

2540
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:46,560
games you're dealing with threats a lot
 

2541
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,829
games you're dealing with threats a lot
more often

2542
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:47,839
more often
 

2543
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,710
more often
um but yeah they're shortcut rules and

2544
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:50,720
um but yeah they're shortcut rules and
 

2545
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,230
um but yeah they're shortcut rules and
this doesn't even mean it's the best way

2546
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:52,240
this doesn't even mean it's the best way
 

2547
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,950
this doesn't even mean it's the best way
to play chess as we've seen with

2548
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:54,960
to play chess as we've seen with
 

2549
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,630
to play chess as we've seen with
alpha zero kind of changing the rules of

2550
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:56,640
alpha zero kind of changing the rules of
 

2551
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,510
alpha zero kind of changing the rules of
the game a little bit but as a human

2552
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
the game a little bit but as a human
 

2553
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,190
the game a little bit but as a human
to learn it from scratch is a lot more

2554
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:01,200
to learn it from scratch is a lot more
 

2555
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,190
to learn it from scratch is a lot more
difficult than to start with principles

2556
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
difficult than to start with principles
 

2557
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,670
difficult than to start with principles
so that's why beginners usually learn

2558
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
so that's why beginners usually learn
 

2559
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,430
so that's why beginners usually learn
chess this way

2560
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:07,440
chess this way
 

2561
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,430
chess this way
yeah but because you're playing other

2562
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
yeah but because you're playing other
 

2563
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,430
yeah but because you're playing other
humans and the other humans have also

2564
00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:11,440
humans and the other humans have also
 

2565
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,950
humans and the other humans have also
operated under different principles and

2566
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:12,960
operated under different principles and
 

2567
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,230
operated under different principles and
that's why

2568
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,240
that's why
 

2569
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,230
that's why
people that come up now that are

2570
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:16,240
people that come up now that are
 

2571
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,390
people that come up now that are
training with engines

2572
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:18,400
training with engines
 

2573
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,390
training with engines
are just going to be much better at than

2574
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,400
are just going to be much better at than
 

2575
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,150
are just going to be much better at than
the people of the past because they're

2576
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
the people of the past because they're
 

2577
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,750
the people of the past because they're
going to have they're going to try out

2578
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:23,760
going to have they're going to try out
 

2579
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,430
going to have they're going to try out
weirder ideas that go against the

2580
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
weirder ideas that go against the
 

2581
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,950
weirder ideas that go against the
principles of old right and they're

2582
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:26,960
principles of old right and they're
 

2583
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,349
principles of old right and they're
gonna do like weird stuff including

2584
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
gonna do like weird stuff including
 

2585
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,270
gonna do like weird stuff including
sacrifices and stuff like that yeah and

2586
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
sacrifices and stuff like that yeah and
 

2587
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,109
sacrifices and stuff like that yeah and
i also think that's why alpha zero was

2588
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:33,119
i also think that's why alpha zero was
 

2589
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,990
i also think that's why alpha zero was
so shocking because stockfish was using

2590
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
so shocking because stockfish was using
 

2591
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,470
so shocking because stockfish was using
an opening database so it was already

2592
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
an opening database so it was already
 

2593
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,550
an opening database so it was already
based off of knowledge that humans have

2594
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
based off of knowledge that humans have
 

2595
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,990
based off of knowledge that humans have
from playing chess for years that we

2596
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
from playing chess for years that we
 

2597
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,190
from playing chess for years that we
just thought is how you're supposed to

2598
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:43,200
just thought is how you're supposed to
 

2599
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,190
just thought is how you're supposed to
play whereas alpha zero just learned

2600
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
play whereas alpha zero just learned
 

2601
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,270
play whereas alpha zero just learned
from playing the game so many times and

2602
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:47,280
from playing the game so many times and
 

2603
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,670
from playing the game so many times and
came up with very novel opening ideas

2604
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:49,680
came up with very novel opening ideas
 

2605
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,829
came up with very novel opening ideas
were you impressed by alpha have you

2606
00:43:51,829 --> 00:43:51,839
were you impressed by alpha have you
 

2607
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,430
were you impressed by alpha have you
have you seen some of the games i have

2608
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:53,440
have you seen some of the games i have
 

2609
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,270
have you seen some of the games i have
seen some of the games i think

2610
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:55,280
seen some of the games i think
 

2611
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,510
seen some of the games i think
impressed bewildered

2612
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
impressed bewildered
 

2613
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,390
impressed bewildered
and uh motivated were the three things i

2614
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:00,400
and uh motivated were the three things i
 

2615
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,670
and uh motivated were the three things i
experienced i think magnus said uh he

2616
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:03,680
experienced i think magnus said uh he
 

2617
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,829
experienced i think magnus said uh he
was also impressed that

2618
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:05,839
was also impressed that
 

2619
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,829
was also impressed that
it could easily be mistaken for

2620
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:07,839
it could easily be mistaken for
 

2621
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,829
it could easily be mistaken for
creativity that's this trash talk

2622
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
creativity that's this trash talk
 

2623
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,670
creativity that's this trash talk
towards the ai that was a beautiful

2624
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:11,680
towards the ai that was a beautiful
 

2625
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,270
towards the ai that was a beautiful
sentence i i was listening to the

2626
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:13,280
sentence i i was listening to the
 

2627
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,309
sentence i i was listening to the
podcast

2628
00:44:14,309 --> 00:44:14,319
podcast
 

2629
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,589
podcast
i mean

2630
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
i mean
 

2631
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,190
i mean
as a human i agree with him because you

2632
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:17,200
as a human i agree with him because you
 

2633
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,190
as a human i agree with him because you
don't want to give the machine the the

2634
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:19,200
don't want to give the machine the the
 

2635
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,829
don't want to give the machine the the
power of creativity but

2636
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:21,839
power of creativity but
 

2637
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:23,589
power of creativity but
if it looks creative

2638
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:23,599
if it looks creative
 

2639
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,829
if it looks creative
get give it give it a compliment that's

2640
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
get give it give it a compliment that's
 

2641
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:27,430
get give it give it a compliment that's
that's fair

2642
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
that's fair
 

2643
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,710
that's fair
i know that you're being nice to the

2644
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:28,720
i know that you're being nice to the
 

2645
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,950
i know that you're being nice to the
machines in case they are ever looking

2646
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960
machines in case they are ever looking
 

2647
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,309
machines in case they are ever looking
back through this

2648
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:32,319
back through this
 

2649
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,990
back through this
what else is there what other principles

2650
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:34,000
what else is there what other principles
 

2651
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,109
what else is there what other principles
are there for the um the opening you can

2652
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:37,119
are there for the um the opening you can
 

2653
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,470
are there for the um the opening you can
go a little bit

2654
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:38,480
go a little bit
 

2655
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,309
go a little bit
more forward let's say and yeah we can

2656
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:40,319
more forward let's say and yeah we can
 

2657
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,910
more forward let's say and yeah we can
finish full of development positions

2658
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:41,920
finish full of development positions
 

2659
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,109
finish full of development positions
like this

2660
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
like this
 

2661
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,030
like this
let's just say you developed all of your

2662
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
let's just say you developed all of your
 

2663
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,069
let's just say you developed all of your
pieces

2664
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:46,079
pieces
 

2665
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:46,870
pieces
um

2666
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
um
 

2667
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,430
um
so that's like a really nice

2668
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
so that's like a really nice
 

2669
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,589
so that's like a really nice
like nobody nobody took any pieces and

2670
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
like nobody nobody took any pieces and
 

2671
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,750
like nobody nobody took any pieces and
we're just in a nice positional thing

2672
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
we're just in a nice positional thing
 

2673
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,990
we're just in a nice positional thing
yeah so it's not actually a very

2674
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:56,000
yeah so it's not actually a very
 

2675
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,670
yeah so it's not actually a very
accurate yes

2676
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:57,680
accurate yes
 

2677
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,030
accurate yes
i could put a different one on the board

2678
00:44:59,030 --> 00:44:59,040
i could put a different one on the board
 

2679
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,270
i could put a different one on the board
but usually after you've developed all

2680
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
but usually after you've developed all
 

2681
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,550
but usually after you've developed all
of your pieces

2682
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
of your pieces
 

2683
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,630
of your pieces
um you want to get your queen out a

2684
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:04,640
um you want to get your queen out a
 

2685
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,870
um you want to get your queen out a
little bit to connect your rooks and you

2686
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
little bit to connect your rooks and you
 

2687
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,790
little bit to connect your rooks and you
also start thinking about certain pawn

2688
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:08,800
also start thinking about certain pawn
 

2689
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,030
also start thinking about certain pawn
pushes and getting more space

2690
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:11,040
pushes and getting more space
 

2691
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,510
pushes and getting more space
but another good tip is just can you

2692
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:13,520
but another good tip is just can you
 

2693
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,750
but another good tip is just can you
improve the position of your pieces

2694
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:15,760
improve the position of your pieces
 

2695
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,510
improve the position of your pieces
think about timing so if you've already

2696
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:17,520
think about timing so if you've already
 

2697
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,430
think about timing so if you've already
moved a piece once and there's a piece

2698
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
moved a piece once and there's a piece
 

2699
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,790
moved a piece once and there's a piece
that hasn't moved at all then you want

2700
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:20,800
that hasn't moved at all then you want
 

2701
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,390
that hasn't moved at all then you want
to focus on the piece that hasn't moved

2702
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:22,400
to focus on the piece that hasn't moved
 

2703
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,270
to focus on the piece that hasn't moved
at all

2704
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,280
at all
 

2705
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,270
at all
to be able to have it more likely to

2706
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:25,280
to be able to have it more likely to
 

2707
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,510
to be able to have it more likely to
jump into the game right so don't move

2708
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:27,520
jump into the game right so don't move
 

2709
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:29,349
jump into the game right so don't move
pieces multiple times exactly like try

2710
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:29,359
pieces multiple times exactly like try
 

2711
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,349
pieces multiple times exactly like try
to move it to the most optimal position

2712
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:31,359
to move it to the most optimal position
 

2713
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,950
to move it to the most optimal position
yeah yeah that makes sense what uh

2714
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
yeah yeah that makes sense what uh
 

2715
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,069
yeah yeah that makes sense what uh
so what's the indian so i think we kind

2719
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,069
of went over it but why did you ever say
why you like it so much because that's

2720
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:42,079
why you like it so much because that's
 

2721
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,990
why you like it so much because that's
weird because it's king-sized i liked it

2722
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:44,000
weird because it's king-sized i liked it
 

2723
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,430
weird because it's king-sized i liked it
because it's a very fun aggressive

2724
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:47,440
because it's a very fun aggressive
 

2725
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,150
because it's a very fun aggressive
defense where you're just throwing your

2726
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
defense where you're just throwing your
 

2727
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,190
defense where you're just throwing your
pieces towards white and there's so many

2728
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
pieces towards white and there's so many
 

2729
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,589
pieces towards white and there's so many
sacrificing opportunities

2730
00:45:55,589 --> 00:45:55,599
sacrificing opportunities
 

2731
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,589
sacrificing opportunities
and for some reason tactical games

2732
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:57,599
and for some reason tactical games
 

2733
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,589
and for some reason tactical games
always feel like the most beautiful the

wouldn't pan out and i would just
 

2747
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,190
wouldn't pan out and i would just
struggle the rest of the game having no

struggle the rest of the game having no
 

2749

or does everybody yeah if you're
 

2873
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,309
or does everybody yeah if you're
studying openings and you know this line

2874
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:24,319
studying openings and you know this line
 

2875
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,950
studying openings and you know this line
as white you just you automatically get

2876
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
as white you just you automatically get
 

2877
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:28,630
as white you just you automatically get
the upper edge and that's kind of how

2878
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:28,640
the upper edge and that's kind of how
 

2879
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,790
the upper edge and that's kind of how
openings develop you start having

2880
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:30,800
openings develop you start having
 

2881
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,030
openings develop you start having
players trying new lines and then you

2882
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:33,040
players trying new lines and then you
 

2883
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,109
players trying new lines and then you
see ones and then everybody adopts it if

2884
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
see ones and then everybody adopts it if
 

2885
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,950
see ones and then everybody adopts it if
they think it's the best one but yeah so

2886
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
they think it's the best one but yeah so
 

2887
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,790
they think it's the best one but yeah so
hikaru is really known for his

2888
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
hikaru is really known for his
 

2889
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:41,349
hikaru is really known for his
aggressive style of play

2890
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:41,359
aggressive style of play
 

2891
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,190
aggressive style of play
black hero yeah hikaru is black here so

2892
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
black hero yeah hikaru is black here so
 

2893
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:45,109
black hero yeah hikaru is black here so
he's playing the king's indian

2894
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
he's playing the king's indian
 

2895
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,430
he's playing the king's indian
and as you can see in this position

2896
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
and as you can see in this position
 

2897
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,309
and as you can see in this position
white already has a lot a huge center

2898
00:48:50,309 --> 00:48:50,319
white already has a lot a huge center
 

2899
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,150
white already has a lot a huge center
advantage but what hikaru is going to

2900
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:52,160
advantage but what hikaru is going to
 

2901
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:54,470
advantage but what hikaru is going to
start doing even with the next move is

2902
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
start doing even with the next move is
 

2903
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,390
start doing even with the next move is
bringing all of his pieces towards the

2904
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
bringing all of his pieces towards the
 

2905
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,030
bringing all of his pieces towards the
white king side because his plan is to

2906
00:48:59,030 --> 00:48:59,040
white king side because his plan is to
 

2907
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,790
white king side because his plan is to
start pushing his pawns towards the

2908
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
start pushing his pawns towards the
 

2909
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,109
start pushing his pawns towards the
white king and this ignore the attacks

2910
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:03,119
white king and this ignore the attacks
 

2911
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:05,670
white king and this ignore the attacks
that's a great example of a dream attack

2912
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:05,680
that's a great example of a dream attack
 

2913
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,190
that's a great example of a dream attack
with the king's indian so there's a

2914
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
with the king's indian so there's a
 

2915
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,750
with the king's indian so there's a
complete asymmetry towards the king side

2916
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
complete asymmetry towards the king side
 

2917
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,829
complete asymmetry towards the king side
on the left side of the board is a ton

2918
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
on the left side of the board is a ton
 

2919
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,710
on the left side of the board is a ton
of pieces yeah exactly um

2920
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:14,720
of pieces yeah exactly um
 

2921
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,150
of pieces yeah exactly um
wow he moved the night like three times

2922
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
wow he moved the night like three times
 

2923
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,750
wow he moved the night like three times
in a row

2924
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
in a row
 

2925
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,109
in a row
and that's what you need to do because

2926
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:19,119
and that's what you need to do because
 

2927
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,870
and that's what you need to do because
you have to move the knight in order to

2928
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
you have to move the knight in order to
 

2929
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,109
you have to move the knight in order to
make space for your pawn so again this

2930
00:49:23,109 --> 00:49:23,119
make space for your pawn so again this
 

2931
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,190
make space for your pawn so again this
is why it's so counter-intuitive and

2932
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:25,200
is why it's so counter-intuitive and
 

2933
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,870
is why it's so counter-intuitive and
stockfish doesn't like it you're putting

2934
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:26,880
stockfish doesn't like it you're putting
 

2935
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,030
stockfish doesn't like it you're putting
almost most of your pieces on the back

2936
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:29,040
almost most of your pieces on the back
 

2937
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,030
almost most of your pieces on the back
rank and you're pushing your king side

2938
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,040
rank and you're pushing your king side
 

2939
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,710
rank and you're pushing your king side
pawns and you're blocking your own dark

2940
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:32,720
pawns and you're blocking your own dark
 

2941
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:35,270
pawns and you're blocking your own dark
squared bishop so none of it makes sense

2942
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
squared bishop so none of it makes sense
 

2943
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,589
squared bishop so none of it makes sense
you're mimicking it that's awesome um

2944
00:49:37,589 --> 00:49:37,599
you're mimicking it that's awesome um
 

2945
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,430
you're mimicking it that's awesome um
okay so yeah here you see white going

2946
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
okay so yeah here you see white going
 

2947
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,670
okay so yeah here you see white going
for queen side attack black going for

2948
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
for queen side attack black going for
 

2949
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,030
for queen side attack black going for
the king side attack and you can keep

2950
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,040
the king side attack and you can keep
 

2951
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,710
the king side attack and you can keep
going a little bit and i'll wait to

2952
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:44,720
going a little bit and i'll wait to
 

2953
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,990
going a little bit and i'll wait to
where he starts with the pretty

2954
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:46,000
where he starts with the pretty
 

2955
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,589
where he starts with the pretty
sacrifices

2956
00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:47,599
sacrifices
 

2957
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,069
sacrifices
it's more fun to analyze games in person

2958
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
it's more fun to analyze games in person
 

2959
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,670
it's more fun to analyze games in person
than on the computer i think yeah okay

2960
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:53,680
than on the computer i think yeah okay
 

2961
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:56,710
than on the computer i think yeah okay
okay so here hikaru is preparing the

2962
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:56,720
okay so here hikaru is preparing the
 

2963
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,710
okay so here hikaru is preparing the
attack and what i really like about this

2964
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:58,720
attack and what i really like about this
 

2965
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,230
attack and what i really like about this
game is that he finds these tactics that

2966
00:50:02,230 --> 00:50:02,240
game is that he finds these tactics that
 

2967
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,990
game is that he finds these tactics that
are not necessarily what a computer

2968
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:04,000
are not necessarily what a computer
 

2969
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,790
are not necessarily what a computer
would go for but it's very hard to face

2970
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:06,800
would go for but it's very hard to face
 

2971
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,549
would go for but it's very hard to face
as a human and that's why a lot of

2972
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
as a human and that's why a lot of
 

2973
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,150
as a human and that's why a lot of
people play the king's indian because in

2974
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:10,160
people play the king's indian because in
 

2975
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,990
people play the king's indian because in
in practice it's hard to defend against

2976
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
in practice it's hard to defend against
 

2977
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,589
in practice it's hard to defend against
so we can keep moving a little bit

2978
00:50:13,589 --> 00:50:13,599
so we can keep moving a little bit
 

2979
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,549
so we can keep moving a little bit
forward

2980
00:50:16,549 --> 00:50:16,559

 

2981
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,870

okay

2982
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:18,880

 

2983
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,710

yep so white is just continuing the king

2984
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
yep so white is just continuing the king
 

2985
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,950
yep so white is just continuing the king
side plan now it's the first is that

2986
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
side plan now it's the first is that
 

2987
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,309
side plan now it's the first is that
like the first piece i think that's

2988
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
like the first piece i think that's
 

2989
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,069
like the first piece i think that's
taken in the game yep that's the first

2990
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:26,079
taken in the game yep that's the first
 

2991
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,109
taken in the game yep that's the first
trade so it begins exactly hikaru had to

2992
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
trade so it begins exactly hikaru had to
 

2993
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,710
trade so it begins exactly hikaru had to
pause his attack for a little bit to

2994
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
pause his attack for a little bit to
 

2995
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,030
pause his attack for a little bit to
just make sure that white didn't have

2996
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
just make sure that white didn't have
 

2997
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,510
just make sure that white didn't have
two dire threats on the queen side so

2998
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
two dire threats on the queen side so
 

2999
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,510
two dire threats on the queen side so
cool to see the asymmetry of this thing

3000
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:37,520
cool to see the asymmetry of this thing
 

3001
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,349
cool to see the asymmetry of this thing
exactly that's what's beautiful about

3002
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:39,359
exactly that's what's beautiful about
 

3003
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,190
exactly that's what's beautiful about
this and just one thing to highlight

3004
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
this and just one thing to highlight
 

3005
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,670
this and just one thing to highlight
because his his rook move here is very

3006
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:43,680
because his his rook move here is very
 

3007
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,670
because his his rook move here is very
bizarre and typically like a computer

3008
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:45,680
bizarre and typically like a computer
 

3009
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,910
bizarre and typically like a computer
probably didn't like this but the ideas

3010
00:50:47,910 --> 00:50:47,920
probably didn't like this but the ideas
 

3011
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,510
probably didn't like this but the ideas
are very interesting because this is a

3012
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:49,520
are very interesting because this is a
 

3013
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,270
are very interesting because this is a
major weakness for black that they're

3014
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
major weakness for black that they're
 

3015
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,589
major weakness for black that they're
coming to attack and he's also making

3016
00:50:53,589 --> 00:50:53,599
coming to attack and he's also making
 

3017
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,430
coming to attack and he's also making
room for his bishop to come backwards

3018
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:55,440
room for his bishop to come backwards
 

3019
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,109
room for his bishop to come backwards
and challenge so this is like a

3020
00:50:57,109 --> 00:50:57,119
and challenge so this is like a
 

3021
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,870
and challenge so this is like a
human-like maneuver that computer i

3022
00:50:58,870 --> 00:50:58,880
human-like maneuver that computer i
 

3023
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,309
human-like maneuver that computer i
think computers would like this though

3024
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:00,319
think computers would like this though
 

3025
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:01,670
think computers would like this though
because you have you'd have to move it

3026
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:01,680
because you have you'd have to move it
 

3027
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,430
because you have you'd have to move it
regardless because he has he takes the

3028
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,440
regardless because he has he takes the
 

3029
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,790
regardless because he has he takes the
pawn here and his rook would be under

3030
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:04,800
pawn here and his rook would be under
 

3031
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,670
pawn here and his rook would be under
attack yeah well have you looked at it

3032
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:07,680
attack yeah well have you looked at it
 

3033
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,270
attack yeah well have you looked at it
when i actually studied this as a line

3034
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,280
when i actually studied this as a line
 

3035
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,870
when i actually studied this as a line
and this right away isn't the best move

3036
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
and this right away isn't the best move
 

3037
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,630
and this right away isn't the best move
current computer so actually that's a

3038
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
current computer so actually that's a
 

3039
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:13,990
current computer so actually that's a
good question did you guys when you

3040
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
good question did you guys when you
 

3041
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,750
good question did you guys when you
study games use your own mind but do you

3042
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:15,760
study games use your own mind but do you
 

3043
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,910
study games use your own mind but do you
also use computers to

3044
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:17,920
also use computers to
 

3045
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,910
also use computers to
build up your intuition of like looking

3046
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:19,920
build up your intuition of like looking
 

3047
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,510
build up your intuition of like looking
at a position like this and what would a

3048
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
at a position like this and what would a
 

3049
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,349
at a position like this and what would a
computer do and then try to understand

3050
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
computer do and then try to understand
 

3051
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,349
computer do and then try to understand
why it wants to do that when i was

3052
00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:25,359
why it wants to do that when i was
 

3053
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,829
why it wants to do that when i was
studying seriously i would try to use my

3054
00:51:27,829 --> 00:51:27,839
studying seriously i would try to use my
 

3055
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,829
studying seriously i would try to use my
own mind because you're never going to

3056
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
own mind because you're never going to
 

3057
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:31,589
own mind because you're never going to
get the exact same position so you

3058
00:51:31,589 --> 00:51:31,599
get the exact same position so you
 

3059
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,990
get the exact same position so you
really need to notice trends and often

3060
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
really need to notice trends and often
 

3061
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,510
really need to notice trends and often
computers will give you moves that are

3062
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:35,520
computers will give you moves that are
 

3063
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,230
computers will give you moves that are
only specific to that position because

3064
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
only specific to that position because
 

3065
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,829
only specific to that position because
of a certain tactic

3066
00:51:39,829 --> 00:51:39,839
of a certain tactic
 

3067
00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:42,549
of a certain tactic
um but i do use computers to check what

3068
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
um but i do use computers to check what
 

3069
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:43,910
um but i do use computers to check what
i did and make sure i didn't make any

3070
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:43,920
i did and make sure i didn't make any
 

3071
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,829
i did and make sure i didn't make any
obvious blunder that i might have missed

3072
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:45,839
obvious blunder that i might have missed
 

3073
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,270
obvious blunder that i might have missed
what does a computer tell you just like

3074
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
what does a computer tell you just like
 

3075
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,349
what does a computer tell you just like
what what is the best move or does it

3076
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
what what is the best move or does it
 

3077
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:50,470
what what is the best move or does it
give you

3078
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:50,480
give you
 

3079
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,630
give you
any kind of explanation of why it

3080
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:52,640
any kind of explanation of why it
 

3081
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,630
any kind of explanation of why it
doesn't tell you why but it gives you

3082
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:54,640
doesn't tell you why but it gives you
 

3083
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,950
doesn't tell you why but it gives you
the different valuations of the position

3084
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:56,960
the different valuations of the position
 

3085
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,470
the different valuations of the position
like black is

3086
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
like black is
 

3087
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,630
like black is
down a half pawn here or something like

3088
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
down a half pawn here or something like
 

3089
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,750
down a half pawn here or something like
that um but it hints you towards what

3090
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:03,760
that um but it hints you towards what
 

3091
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,190
that um but it hints you towards what
the right move is and then it's on you

3092
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:05,200
the right move is and then it's on you
 

3093
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,430
the right move is and then it's on you
to figure out why and you could usually

3094
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:07,440
to figure out why and you could usually
 

3095
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,349
to figure out why and you could usually
figure out why if not right away than

3096
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:09,359
figure out why if not right away than
 

3097
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:10,630
figure out why if not right away than
just by going through a few moves and

3098
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:10,640
just by going through a few moves and
 

3099
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,870
just by going through a few moves and
being like oh okay that makes sense i

3100
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
being like oh okay that makes sense i
 

3101
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,870
being like oh okay that makes sense i
feel like a computer will take you down

3102
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:14,880
feel like a computer will take you down
 

3103
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,030
feel like a computer will take you down
with some weird lines potentially

3104
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:17,040
with some weird lines potentially
 

3105
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,270
with some weird lines potentially
like sacrifice like why the hell am i

3106
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
like sacrifice like why the hell am i
 

3107
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,870
like sacrifice like why the hell am i
sacrificing this

3108
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:20,880
sacrificing this
 

3109
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,710
sacrificing this
well we'll get to the pretty sacrifice

3110
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
well we'll get to the pretty sacrifice
 

3111
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:24,390
well we'll get to the pretty sacrifice
soon um

3112
00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:24,400
soon um
 

3113
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,309
soon um
so we could just keep playing bonds are

3114
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
so we could just keep playing bonds are
 

3115
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:29,190
so we could just keep playing bonds are
being pushed forward yeah

3116
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:29,200
being pushed forward yeah
 

3117
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,150
being pushed forward yeah
and hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen

3118
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
and hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen
 

3119
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,030
and hikaru is kind of ignoring the queen
side attack here um they basically both

3120
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:35,040
side attack here um they basically both
 

3121
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,270
side attack here um they basically both
only reply to each other's plan when

3122
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:37,280
only reply to each other's plan when
 

3123
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,190
only reply to each other's plan when
they have to

3124
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
they have to
 

3125
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,790
they have to
this is where you convert all the

3126
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
this is where you convert all the
 

3127
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,829
this is where you convert all the
podcast viewers to youtube yeah they

3128
00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:43,839
podcast viewers to youtube yeah they
 

3129
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,589
podcast viewers to youtube yeah they
have no idea what we're talking about

3130
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:45,599
have no idea what we're talking about
 

3131
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:48,069
have no idea what we're talking about
right now there is a zen like experience

3132
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:48,079
right now there is a zen like experience
 

3133
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,390
right now there is a zen like experience
of just like listening and imagining the

3134
00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:50,400
of just like listening and imagining the
 

3135
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,390
of just like listening and imagining the
board just imagine the pieces on the

3136
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
board just imagine the pieces on the
 

3137
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,150
board just imagine the pieces on the
ceiling yeah you should we should be

3138
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:54,160
ceiling yeah you should we should be
 

3139
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,829
ceiling yeah you should we should be
calling them out and then people will be

3140
00:52:55,829 --> 00:52:55,839
calling them out and then people will be
 

3141
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,270
calling them out and then people will be
freaking out even more am i supposed to

3142
00:52:57,270 --> 00:52:57,280
freaking out even more am i supposed to
 

3143
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,069
freaking out even more am i supposed to
keep track of what the position is

3144
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:02,079

 

3145
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,589

how hard is blindfold just have you

3146
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
how hard is blindfold just have you
 

3147
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:05,510
how hard is blindfold just have you
tried like are you able to keep them

3148
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
tried like are you able to keep them
 

3149
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,390
tried like are you able to keep them
i've played blindfold chest before um

3150
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:08,400
i've played blindfold chest before um
 

3151
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,990
i've played blindfold chest before um
for me it's pretty hard it's not a

3152
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,000
for me it's pretty hard it's not a
 

3153
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,510
for me it's pretty hard it's not a
muscle that i've trained as much and i'm

3154
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,520
muscle that i've trained as much and i'm
 

3155
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,549
muscle that i've trained as much and i'm
very visual when it comes to chess um

3156
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:14,559
very visual when it comes to chess um
 

3157
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,109
very visual when it comes to chess um
but it is one as a top player that

3158
00:53:17,109 --> 00:53:17,119
but it is one as a top player that
 

3159
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,670
but it is one as a top player that
starts becoming very second nature for

3160
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:19,680
starts becoming very second nature for
 

3161
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,430
starts becoming very second nature for
you actually this is what

3162
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:21,440
you actually this is what
 

3163
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,349
you actually this is what
i talked to magnus about this

3164
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:23,359
i talked to magnus about this
 

3165
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,589
i talked to magnus about this
um maybe i was again influenced by

3166
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:25,599
um maybe i was again influenced by
 

3167
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:26,950
um maybe i was again influenced by
queen's gambit what do you actually

3168
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:26,960
queen's gambit what do you actually
 

3169
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,030
queen's gambit what do you actually
visualize when it's in your head

3170
00:53:29,030 --> 00:53:29,040
visualize when it's in your head
 

3171
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,270
visualize when it's in your head
so for magnus it was a boring 2d board

3172
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
so for magnus it was a boring 2d board
 

3173
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,790
so for magnus it was a boring 2d board
right are you do you have some kind of

3174
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:32,800
right are you do you have some kind of
 

3175
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,870
right are you do you have some kind of
that's every chess player no you don't

3176
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:34,880
that's every chess player no you don't
 

3177
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,630
that's every chess player no you don't
have like because you know some chess

3178
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:36,640
have like because you know some chess
 

3179
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:38,870
have like because you know some chess
like uh computer games you can do all

3180
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:38,880
like uh computer games you can do all
 

3181
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,349
like uh computer games you can do all
kinds of skins and like yeah like fancy

3182
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:41,359
kinds of skins and like yeah like fancy
 

3183
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,870
kinds of skins and like yeah like fancy
stuff you don't have anything sadly i

3184
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,880
stuff you don't have anything sadly i
 

3185
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,589
stuff you don't have anything sadly i
don't have like a cool 3d warrior mode

3186
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:45,599
don't have like a cool 3d warrior mode
 

3187
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,910
don't have like a cool 3d warrior mode
on it's just a chess baseboard in my

3188
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:47,920
on it's just a chess baseboard in my
 

3189
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,870
on it's just a chess baseboard in my
head

3190
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:48,880
head
 

3191
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,630
head
because you don't yeah you can't use

3192
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:50,640
because you don't yeah you can't use
 

3193
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,109
because you don't yeah you can't use
your brain power for adding colors to it

3194
00:53:53,109 --> 00:53:53,119
your brain power for adding colors to it
 

3195
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:54,470
your brain power for adding colors to it
because you already have to keep track

3196
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:54,480
because you already have to keep track
 

3197
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,870
because you already have to keep track
of the pieces it's one board at a time

3198
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:56,880
of the pieces it's one board at a time
 

3199
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,430
of the pieces it's one board at a time
yes okay the current position yeah i bet

3200
00:53:59,430 --> 00:53:59,440
yes okay the current position yeah i bet
 

3201
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,750
yes okay the current position yeah i bet
every chest i wonder if there's any who

3202
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
every chest i wonder if there's any who
 

3203
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,069
every chest i wonder if there's any who
there's certain players who are really

3204
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
there's certain players who are really
 

3205
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:05,910
there's certain players who are really
good and they can even play blindfold

3206
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
good and they can even play blindfold
 

3207
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,589
good and they can even play blindfold
chess and play multiple games at the

3208
00:54:07,589 --> 00:54:07,599
chess and play multiple games at the
 

3209
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,589
chess and play multiple games at the
same time um

3210
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
same time um
 

3211
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:11,430
same time um
so i would be curious how they do it but

3212
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:11,440
so i would be curious how they do it but
 

3213
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,030
so i would be curious how they do it but
usually when you're thinking of one game

3214
00:54:13,030 --> 00:54:13,040
usually when you're thinking of one game
 

3215
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,390
usually when you're thinking of one game
that's the only one

3216
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:14,400
that's the only one
 

3217
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,589
that's the only one
in your mind yeah but you have to do

3218
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:15,599
in your mind yeah but you have to do
 

3219
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,069
in your mind yeah but you have to do
this operation where you move one piece

3220
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:20,079
this operation where you move one piece
 

3221
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:22,230
this operation where you move one piece
you're doing like the branch analysis

3222
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
you're doing like the branch analysis
 

3223
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,589
you're doing like the branch analysis
like yeah

3224
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:23,599
like yeah
 

3225
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,549
like yeah
and so

3226
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:24,559
and so
 

3227
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,270
and so
uh you still have to somehow visualize

3228
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:27,280
uh you still have to somehow visualize
 

3229
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,829
uh you still have to somehow visualize
the the branching process

3230
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:29,839
the the branching process
 

3231
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:31,750
the the branching process
um and not forget stuff maybe that's

3232
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:31,760
um and not forget stuff maybe that's
 

3233
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,549
um and not forget stuff maybe that's
like constant memory recall or something

3234
00:54:34,549 --> 00:54:34,559
like constant memory recall or something
 

3235
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,829
like constant memory recall or something
you're always looking one board at a

3236
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:35,839
you're always looking one board at a
 

3237
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,349
you're always looking one board at a
time but and you're also oh because

3238
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
time but and you're also oh because
 

3239
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,190
time but and you're also oh because
you're also looking in the future yeah

3240
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
you're also looking in the future yeah
 

3241
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,670
you're also looking in the future yeah
yeah and then you have to backtrack

3242
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
yeah and then you have to backtrack
 

3243
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,349
yeah and then you have to backtrack
you're keeping the position in your

3244
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
you're keeping the position in your
 

3245
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,950
you're keeping the position in your
memory so you're remembering where all

3246
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:44,960
memory so you're remembering where all
 

3247
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,630
memory so you're remembering where all
the pieces are and then you're playing

3248
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:46,640
the pieces are and then you're playing
 

3249
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,710
the pieces are and then you're playing
it out on one board and then you can

3250
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:48,720
it out on one board and then you can
 

3251
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,790
it out on one board and then you can
come back to the initial one that you

3252
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:50,800
come back to the initial one that you
 

3253
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,470
come back to the initial one that you
started with that you kind of just keep

3254
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:52,480
started with that you kind of just keep
 

3255
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,150
started with that you kind of just keep
in your brain and it's also easier to

3256
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:54,160
in your brain and it's also easier to
 

3257
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,990
in your brain and it's also easier to
come back to it once you've played a

3258
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:56,000
come back to it once you've played a
 

3259
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,510
come back to it once you've played a
position from it

3260
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:57,520
position from it
 

3261
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,109
position from it
i feel like it's that

3262
00:55:01,109 --> 00:55:01,119
i feel like it's that
 

3263
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:02,950
i feel like it's that
memory recall

3264
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:02,960
memory recall
 

3265
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,829
memory recall
that gets you to blunder so i'll like

3266
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:05,839
that gets you to blunder so i'll like
 

3267
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,589
that gets you to blunder so i'll like
see that i'm being attacked by certain

3268
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:07,599
see that i'm being attacked by certain
 

3269
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:08,950
see that i'm being attacked by certain
things

3270
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
things
 

3271
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,430
things
but then because i get so exhausted

3272
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
but then because i get so exhausted
 

3273
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,030
but then because i get so exhausted
thinking about a different thing i

3274
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
thinking about a different thing i
 

3275
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,670
thinking about a different thing i
forget i actually forget about an entire

3276
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
forget i actually forget about an entire
 

3277
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,950
forget i actually forget about an entire
branch of things that i was supposed to

3278
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:16,960
branch of things that i was supposed to
 

3279
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,790
branch of things that i was supposed to
be worried about it happens very often

3280
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:18,800
be worried about it happens very often
 

3281
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,870
be worried about it happens very often
yeah if you spend a bunch of time

3282
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:20,880
yeah if you spend a bunch of time
 

3283
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,109
yeah if you spend a bunch of time
calculating in a position let's say like

3284
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:23,119
calculating in a position let's say like
 

3285
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,230
calculating in a position let's say like
when you're really in trouble and you're

3286
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
when you're really in trouble and you're
 

3287
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,630
when you're really in trouble and you're
spending 15 20 minutes calculating

3288
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
spending 15 20 minutes calculating
 

3289
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,230
spending 15 20 minutes calculating
you'll forget about something that you

3290
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:28,240
you'll forget about something that you
 

3291
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,230
you'll forget about something that you
spotted like oh if i do these two three

3292
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:30,240
spotted like oh if i do these two three
 

3293
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,069
spotted like oh if i do these two three
moves i'll walk into a trap because

3294
00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:32,079
moves i'll walk into a trap because
 

3295
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,349
moves i'll walk into a trap because
you've looked at so many lines and then

3296
00:55:33,349 --> 00:55:33,359
you've looked at so many lines and then
 

3297
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:34,710
you've looked at so many lines and then
you play it and then you see it and

3298
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
you play it and then you see it and
 

3299
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,549
you play it and then you see it and
you're like oh i i looked at it and i

3300
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:36,559
you're like oh i i looked at it and i
 

3301
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,870
you're like oh i i looked at it and i
saw it but i forgot about it yeah

3302
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
saw it but i forgot about it yeah
 

3303
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,950
saw it but i forgot about it yeah
it's often called tunneling where you're

3304
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:40,960
it's often called tunneling where you're
 

3305
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,870
it's often called tunneling where you're
just looking so deeply on one thing you

3306
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:42,880
just looking so deeply on one thing you
 

3307
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,950
just looking so deeply on one thing you
forget about the rest of the board

3308
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
forget about the rest of the board
 

3309
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,030
forget about the rest of the board
and it's the worst when at least in a

3310
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
and it's the worst when at least in a
 

3311
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,430
and it's the worst when at least in a
beginner level there's like a

3312
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440

3372
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:44,240
and open up the position because if you
 

3373
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,910
and open up the position because if you
don't do that here as black and don't

don't do that here as black and don't
 

3375
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,349
don't do that here as black and don't
get some kind of attack you are

3376
00:56:47,349 --> 00:56:47,359

completely lost on the queen side and
 

3379
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:51,270
completely lost on the queen side and
also you've pushed all of your own king

3380
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
also you've pushed all of your own king
 

3381
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,630
also you've pushed all of your own king
side pawns so you're going to be in

3382
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:52,640
side pawns so you're going to be in
 

3383
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,710
side pawns so you're going to be in
danger so it's one of those do or die

3384
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:54,720
danger so it's one of those do or die
 

3385
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,870
danger so it's one of those do or die
moments oh okay so that that's what

3386
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:56,880
moments oh okay so that that's what
 

3387
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,390
moments oh okay so that that's what
makes it all in because the king is wide

3388
00:56:58,390 --> 00:56:58,400
makes it all in because the king is wide
 

3389
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,990
makes it all in because the king is wide
open yeah yeah the king is wide open and

3390
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,000
open yeah yeah the king is wide open and
 

3391
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,750
open yeah yeah the king is wide open and
you all of white's pieces are pointed

3392
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:03,760
you all of white's pieces are pointed
 

3393
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,109
you all of white's pieces are pointed
towards the queen side too where you're

3394
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,119
towards the queen side too where you're
 

3395
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,710
towards the queen side too where you're
also cramped so it's the attack

3396
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
also cramped so it's the attack
 

3397
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,030
also cramped so it's the attack
primarily by black done by the two pawns

3398
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:09,040
primarily by black done by the two pawns
 

3399
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,710
primarily by black done by the two pawns
and then and the knight and the light

3400
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:10,720
and then and the knight and the light
 

3401
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,549
and then and the knight and the light
squared bishop is always extremely

3402
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:12,559
squared bishop is always extremely
 

3403
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:14,069
squared bishop is always extremely
important so you don't want to trade

3404
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
important so you don't want to trade
 

3405
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,670
important so you don't want to trade
this in the king's indian because it's

3406
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:15,680
this in the king's indian because it's
 

3407
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:18,309
this in the king's indian because it's
very helpful for a lot of attacks

3408
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:18,319
very helpful for a lot of attacks
 

3409
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:19,510
very helpful for a lot of attacks
even though it's on the other side of

3410
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
even though it's on the other side of
 

3411
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,030
even though it's on the other side of
the board i guess it can go all the way

3412
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
the board i guess it can go all the way
 

3413
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,030
the board i guess it can go all the way
across in in

3414
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
across in in
 

3415
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,030
across in in
like i i'm not sure what it's doing here

3416
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
like i i'm not sure what it's doing here
 

3417
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,309
like i i'm not sure what it's doing here
but probably threatening like for

3418
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:26,319
but probably threatening like for
 

3419
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:29,109
but probably threatening like for
example if if it was another move black

3420
00:57:29,109 --> 00:57:29,119
example if if it was another move black
 

3421
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,309
example if if it was another move black
could have played would be something

3422
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:30,319
could have played would be something
 

3423
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:32,710
could have played would be something
like bishop h3 where if you take the

3424
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
like bishop h3 where if you take the
 

3425
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,349
like bishop h3 where if you take the
bishop you actually get mated on g2

3426
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:35,359
bishop you actually get mated on g2
 

3427
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:37,430
bishop you actually get mated on g2
with what so let's say you take here and

3428
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:37,440
with what so let's say you take here and
 

3429
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,349
with what so let's say you take here and
then you could push the pawn and then it

3430
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
then you could push the pawn and then it
 

3431
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:40,870
then you could push the pawn and then it
would be checkmate

3432
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:40,880
would be checkmate
 

3433
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,870
would be checkmate
so you're kind of using your bishop to

3434
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
so you're kind of using your bishop to
 

3435
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,309
so you're kind of using your bishop to
sacrifice

3436
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,319
sacrifice
 

3437
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:45,829
sacrifice
against whites

3438
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
against whites
 

3439
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,270
against whites
king side pawns

3440
00:57:47,270 --> 00:57:47,280
king side pawns
 

3441
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,829
king side pawns
yeah i'll be freaking out if the bishop

3442
00:57:49,829 --> 00:57:49,839
yeah i'll be freaking out if the bishop
 

3443
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:51,750
yeah i'll be freaking out if the bishop
did that exactly what are they up to

3444
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
did that exactly what are they up to
 

3445
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,750
did that exactly what are they up to
right and that's the thing this position

3446
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:53,760
right and that's the thing this position
 

3447
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,829
right and that's the thing this position
looks very scary as white because all of

3448
00:57:55,829 --> 00:57:55,839
looks very scary as white because all of
 

3449
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,430
looks very scary as white because all of
black's pawns are starting to come

3450
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
black's pawns are starting to come
 

3451
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,430
black's pawns are starting to come
towards you and it's one of those things

3452
00:57:59,430 --> 00:57:59,440
towards you and it's one of those things
 

3453
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,390
towards you and it's one of those things
where

3454
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:00,400
where
 

3455
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,390
where
humans do start to worry in these

3456
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
humans do start to worry in these
 

3457
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,230
humans do start to worry in these
positions whereas computers obviously

3458
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:04,240
positions whereas computers obviously
 

3459
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,750
positions whereas computers obviously
can just calculate the best line and

3460
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
can just calculate the best line and
 

3461
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,510
can just calculate the best line and
maybe the attack doesn't go through so

3462
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:07,520
maybe the attack doesn't go through so
 

3463
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,109
maybe the attack doesn't go through so
you're saying the computer might say

3464
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
you're saying the computer might say
 

3465
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,270
you're saying the computer might say
that the white is actually a slight

3466
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:11,280
that the white is actually a slight
 

3467
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,589
that the white is actually a slight
favorite here yeah especially exactly

3468
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:13,599
favorite here yeah especially exactly
 

3469
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:15,430
favorite here yeah especially exactly
okay so then uh

3470
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:15,440
okay so then uh
 

3471

the threatening right and they're also
 

3547
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,630
the threatening right and they're also
opening up the position to bring more of

3548
00:59:36,630 --> 00:59:36,640
opening up the position to bring more of
 

3549
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,390
opening up the position to bring more of
the pieces in but that

the pieces in but that
 

3551
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,549
the pieces in but that
the pawns kind of help break open the

00:59:40,549 --> 00:59:40,559
the pawns kind of help break open the
 

3553
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:42,789

king side but they can't checkmate by
 

3555
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:44,710
king side but they can't checkmate by
themselves so after the pawns come in

3556
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:44,720
themselves so after the pawns come in
 

3557
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,910
themselves so after the pawns come in
that's when you need to start bringing

3558
00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:45,920
that's when you need to start bringing
 

3559
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,910
that's when you need to start bringing
in pieces as well which you will see uh

3560
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:47,920
in pieces as well which you will see uh

hikaru do here okay there you go he puts

3562
00:59:50,549 --> 00:59:50,559
hikaru do here okay there you go he puts
 

3563
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,630
hikaru do here okay there you go he puts
more sacrifices so this was actually

3564
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:52,640
more sacrifices so this was actually
 

3565
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,349
more sacrifices so this was actually
another beautiful sacrifice in the game

3566
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
another beautiful sacrifice in the game
 

3567
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,230
another beautiful sacrifice in the game
um

3568
00:59:56,230 --> 00:59:56,240

3569
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,549
um
but then puts the king in check with the

3570
00:59:58,549 --> 00:59:58,559
but then puts the king in check with the
 

3571
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:00,390
but then puts the king in check with the
pawn right that and the pawn is going to

3572
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
pawn right that and the pawn is going to
 

3573
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,630
pawn right that and the pawn is going to
be given here for free but the idea is

3574
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:02,640
be given here for free but the idea is
 

3575
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,870
be given here for free but the idea is
you're giving your own peace because you

don't i don't know when
like he from his gut knows that this is

3786
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
like he from his gut knows that this is
 

3787
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,430
like he from his gut knows that this is
supposed to be a draw but he still plays

3788
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:49,440
supposed to be a draw but he still plays
 

3789
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,029
supposed to be a draw but he still plays
on yeah i mean

3790
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
on yeah i mean
 

3791
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,829
on yeah i mean
that is one where it could theoretically

3792
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:53,839
that is one where it could theoretically
 

3793
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:56,069
that is one where it could theoretically
be a draw but it could be very hard to

3794
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:56,079
be a draw but it could be very hard to
 

3795
01:03:56,079 --> 01:03:58,230
be a draw but it could be very hard to
defend because it's a hard technique to

3796
01:03:58,230 --> 01:03:58,240
defend because it's a hard technique to
 

3797
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,710
defend because it's a hard technique to
know as a human and especially in that

3798
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:00,720
know as a human and especially in that
 

3799
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:03,349
know as a human and especially in that
game i know that uh nepo was also in

3800
01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
game i know that uh nepo was also in
 

3801
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,510
game i know that uh nepo was also in
time pressure which makes it even harder

3802
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
time pressure which makes it even harder
 

3803
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:07,109
time pressure which makes it even harder
so in situations like that you should

3804
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
so in situations like that you should
 

3805
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:09,029
so in situations like that you should
always continue it's more where an

3806
01:04:09,029 --> 01:04:09,039
always continue it's more where an
 

3807
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:10,390
always continue it's more where an
engine would give you something like

3808
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:10,400
engine would give you something like
 

3809
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,589
engine would give you something like
plus 10 or something where it's not just

3810
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:13,599
plus 10 or something where it's not just
 

3811
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,589
plus 10 or something where it's not just
clearly a win but anybody would know how

3812
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
clearly a win but anybody would know how
 

3813
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,950
clearly a win but anybody would know how
to win and that's where you're usually

3814
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
to win and that's where you're usually
 

3815
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,710
to win and that's where you're usually
supposed to resign

3816
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
supposed to resign
 

3817
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,390
supposed to resign
so what do you find beautiful about this

3818
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:20,400
so what do you find beautiful about this
 

3819
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,470
so what do you find beautiful about this
game is it the uh

3820
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:22,480
game is it the uh
 

3821
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,510
game is it the uh
the the attacking chess and just the the

3822
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:25,520
the the attacking chess and just the the
 

3823
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:28,789
the the attacking chess and just the the
asymmetry of it it's the asymmetry

3824
01:04:28,789 --> 01:04:28,799
asymmetry of it it's the asymmetry
 

3825
01:04:28,799 --> 01:04:32,309
asymmetry of it it's the asymmetry
and it's the fact that this is the dream

3826
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
and it's the fact that this is the dream
 

3827
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,470
and it's the fact that this is the dream
for the king's indian uh where you're

3828
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:34,480
for the king's indian uh where you're
 

3829
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,309
for the king's indian uh where you're
able to get a beautiful attack and

3830
01:04:36,309 --> 01:04:36,319
able to get a beautiful attack and
 

3831
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:38,829
able to get a beautiful attack and
there's also those two really nice

3832
01:04:38,829 --> 01:04:38,839
there's also those two really nice
 

3833
01:04:38,839 --> 01:04:40,950
there's also those two really nice
sacrifices where

3834
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:40,960
sacrifices where
 

3835
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,029
sacrifices where
black just continuously kept putting

3836
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
black just continuously kept putting
 

3837
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,870
black just continuously kept putting
pressure on white's king to the point

3838
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:44,880
pressure on white's king to the point
 

3839
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:46,950
pressure on white's king to the point
where he was able to win material

3840
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:46,960
where he was able to win material
 

3841
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,190
where he was able to win material
and the best part of it is that if the

3842
01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:49,200
and the best part of it is that if the
 

3843
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:50,870
and the best part of it is that if the
attack didn't work out black would have

3844
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
attack didn't work out black would have
 

3845
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:53,349
attack didn't work out black would have
been completely lost

3846
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
been completely lost
 

3847
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:54,789
been completely lost
how often does that happen by the way

3848
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:54,799
how often does that happen by the way
 

3849
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:57,029
how often does that happen by the way
like as an attacking player you like how

3850
01:04:57,029 --> 01:04:57,039
like as an attacking player you like how
 

3851
01:04:57,039 --> 01:04:58,069
like as an attacking player you like how
often do you put yourself in the

3852
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
often do you put yourself in the
 

3853
01:04:58,079 --> 01:04:59,589
often do you put yourself in the
position of like

3854
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
position of like
 

3855
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,829
position of like
i'm screwed unless this works out on an

3856
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:01,839
i'm screwed unless this works out on an
 

3857
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,309
i'm screwed unless this works out on an
online chest more than i should and it's

3858
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
online chest more than i should and it's
 

3859
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:06,230
online chest more than i should and it's
usually when i sacrifice i know it's

3860
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:06,240
usually when i sacrifice i know it's
 

3861
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:09,430
usually when i sacrifice i know it's
either gonna work or i'm lost

3862
01:05:09,430 --> 01:05:09,440
either gonna work or i'm lost
 

3863
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:11,910
either gonna work or i'm lost
and those are the most fun

3864
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
and those are the most fun
 

3865
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:13,750
and those are the most fun
positions to play usually but in

3866
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
positions to play usually but in
 

3867
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,829
positions to play usually but in
tournaments if you're doing a sacrifice

3868
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
tournaments if you're doing a sacrifice
 

3869
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,390
tournaments if you're doing a sacrifice
you're playing it with 100 confidence

3870
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:18,400
you're playing it with 100 confidence
 

3871
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,750
you're playing it with 100 confidence
because you're taking the time to

3872
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:19,760
because you're taking the time to
 

3873
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,510
because you're taking the time to
calculate it but yeah when you have

3874
01:05:21,510 --> 01:05:21,520
calculate it but yeah when you have
 

3875
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,950
calculate it but yeah when you have
three minutes you don't have time so you

3876
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:22,960
three minutes you don't have time so you
 

3877
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,230
three minutes you don't have time so you
take a whim and you follow your

3878
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
take a whim and you follow your
 

3879
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:27,430
take a whim and you follow your
intuition or you find out later or

3880
01:05:27,430 --> 01:05:27,440
intuition or you find out later or
 

3881
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:29,430
intuition or you find out later or
you're very confident it'll work and you

3882
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
you're very confident it'll work and you
 

3883
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,190
you're very confident it'll work and you
haven't calculated all the way until the

3884
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
haven't calculated all the way until the
 

3885
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,789
haven't calculated all the way until the
end but you've calculated to the point

3886
01:05:32,789 --> 01:05:32,799
end but you've calculated to the point
 

3887
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,029
end but you've calculated to the point
where you have enough in exchange for

3888
01:05:35,029 --> 01:05:35,039
where you have enough in exchange for
 

3889
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,309
where you have enough in exchange for
the sack and you think you could play

3890
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:36,319
the sack and you think you could play
 

3891
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,829
the sack and you think you could play
that position uh how do you train chess

3892
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
that position uh how do you train chess
 

3893
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,109
that position uh how do you train chess
these days

position because you're also a creator

3902
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400

3909
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,510
do you try to put in time of like daily
practice

3910
01:05:55,510 --> 01:05:55,520
practice
 

3911
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,150
practice
i don't train chess anymore when i'm

3912
01:05:58,150 --> 01:05:58,160
i don't train chess anymore when i'm
 

3913
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,109
i don't train chess anymore when i'm
focusing on creating i do if i'm

3914
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:01,119
focusing on creating i do if i'm
 

3915
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,510
focusing on creating i do if i'm
preparing for a tournament but back in

3916
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:03,520
preparing for a tournament but back in
 

3917
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,510
preparing for a tournament but back in
the day i would train very tournament

3918
01:06:05,510 --> 01:06:05,520
the day i would train very tournament
 

3919
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,910
the day i would train very tournament
very seriously for tournaments and

3920
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:07,920
very seriously for tournaments and
 

3921
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,150
very seriously for tournaments and
the way it would work is i do opening

3922
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160
the way it would work is i do opening
 

3923
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,910
the way it would work is i do opening
preparation for a specific tournament

3924
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:11,920
preparation for a specific tournament
 

3925
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,510
preparation for a specific tournament
because that's when you really need to

3926
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:13,520
because that's when you really need to
 

3927
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,750
because that's when you really need to
have those lines memorized and you could

3928
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:15,760
have those lines memorized and you could
 

3929
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,910
have those lines memorized and you could
also prepare for specific opponents and

3930
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:17,920
also prepare for specific opponents and
 

3931
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,990
also prepare for specific opponents and
i would do tactics to make sure i stay

3932
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:20,000
i would do tactics to make sure i stay
 

3933
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,829
i would do tactics to make sure i stay
sharp so those are the two things i

3934
01:06:21,829 --> 01:06:21,839
sharp so those are the two things i
 

3935
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:23,349
sharp so those are the two things i
would do every single day for a

3936
01:06:23,349 --> 01:06:23,359
would do every single day for a
 

3937
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,109
would do every single day for a
tournament and then mix up the rest with

3938
01:06:25,109 --> 01:06:25,119
tournament and then mix up the rest with
 

3939
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:26,710
tournament and then mix up the rest with
like maybe some end games maybe some

3940
01:06:26,710 --> 01:06:26,720
like maybe some end games maybe some
 

3941
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,589
like maybe some end games maybe some

like uh like a random puzzle thing
 

3949
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:36,950
like uh like a random puzzle thing
yeah i would just train puzzles for at

3950
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960
yeah i would just train puzzles for at
 

3951
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,829
yeah i would just train puzzles for at
least like 30 to 60 minutes or books and

3952
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:39,839
least like 30 to 60 minutes or books and
 

3953
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,190
least like 30 to 60 minutes or books and
sometimes you were

3954
01:06:41,190 --> 01:06:41,200
sometimes you were
 

3955
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,630
sometimes you were
and there's different kinds of puzzles

3956
01:06:42,630 --> 01:06:42,640
and there's different kinds of puzzles
 

3957
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,069
and there's different kinds of puzzles
one you could train for pattern

3958
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:44,079
one you could train for pattern
 

3959
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,430
one you could train for pattern
recognition where you're supposed to go

3960
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,440
recognition where you're supposed to go
 

3961
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,190
recognition where you're supposed to go
through them very quickly and that's

3962
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:47,200
through them very quickly and that's
 

3963
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,309
through them very quickly and that's
just so that when you're playing the

3964
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
just so that when you're playing the
 

3965
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,990
just so that when you're playing the
game if your mind is tired it's still

3966

keeping
 

3969
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,270
keeping
track of things a little bit more easily

3970
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:53,280
track of things a little bit more easily
 

3971
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,190
track of things a little bit more easily
and then there's where you're practicing

3972
01:06:55,190 --> 01:06:55,200
and then there's where you're practicing
 

3973
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,789
and then there's where you're practicing
your combination and those sometimes

3974
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
your combination and those sometimes
 

3975
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,549
your combination and those sometimes
take like 20 minutes to find because you

3976
01:06:58,549 --> 01:06:58,559
take like 20 minutes to find because you
 

3977
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:00,710
take like 20 minutes to find because you
have to just calculate a lot and it's

3978
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
have to just calculate a lot and it's
 

3979
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,990
have to just calculate a lot and it's
more like making sure that you've

3980
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:02,000
more like making sure that you've

01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,669
suffering so like
you it's not about the like you should

4100
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
you it's not about the like you should
 

4101
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,590
you it's not about the like you should
be thinking you should be doing

4102
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:03,600
be thinking you should be doing
 

4103
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,510
be thinking you should be doing
calculating so it's the opposite of what

4104
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
calculating so it's the opposite of what
 

4105
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,189
calculating so it's the opposite of what
magnus said like

4106
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
magnus said like
 

4107
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:08,550
magnus said like
you should be doing a lot of time it

4108
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
you should be doing a lot of time it
 

4109
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,070
you should be doing a lot of time it
doesn't matter what the puzzle is or

4110
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
doesn't matter what the puzzle is or
 

4111
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,749
doesn't matter what the puzzle is or
whatever the hell you're doing but you

4112
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:11,759
whatever the hell you're doing but you
 

4113
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:13,829
whatever the hell you're doing but you
should be like doing that difficult

4114
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:13,839
should be like doing that difficult
 

4115
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:15,510
should be like doing that difficult
calculation that's how you get better

4116
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:15,520
calculation that's how you get better
 

4117
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,030
calculation that's how you get better
yeah it really depends what you're

4118
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,040
yeah it really depends what you're
 

4119
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,309
yeah it really depends what you're
training because i used to think the

4120
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:18,319
training because i used to think the
 

4121
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,910
training because i used to think the
same but it depends what you're weak

4122
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
same but it depends what you're weak
 

4123
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:20,789
same but it depends what you're weak
you're at because if you're doing the

4124
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:20,799
you're at because if you're doing the
 

4125
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:22,709
you're at because if you're doing the
really difficult puzzles you're training

4126
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
really difficult puzzles you're training
 

4127
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,030
really difficult puzzles you're training
for like visualization and calculating

4128
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:25,040
for like visualization and calculating
 

4129
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:26,630
for like visualization and calculating
more moves ahead than you typically

4130
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,640
more moves ahead than you typically
 

4131
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,709
more moves ahead than you typically
would which maybe you wouldn't get into

4132
01:09:28,709 --> 01:09:28,719
would which maybe you wouldn't get into
 

4133
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,189
would which maybe you wouldn't get into
that as often in a regular game because

4134
01:09:31,189 --> 01:09:31,199
that as often in a regular game because
 

4135
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:32,870
that as often in a regular game because
typically you run into like three to

4136
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
typically you run into like three to
 

4137
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,789
typically you run into like three to
four tactics which are actually the

4138
01:09:34,789 --> 01:09:34,799
four tactics which are actually the
 

4139
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:38,229
four tactics which are actually the
easier and more fun ones to solve so it

4140
01:09:38,229 --> 01:09:38,239
easier and more fun ones to solve so it
 

4141
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:40,630
easier and more fun ones to solve so it
really depends and on top of that as a

4142
01:09:40,630 --> 01:09:40,640
really depends and on top of that as a
 

4143
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,110
really depends and on top of that as a
hobbyist your motivation is very

4144
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:43,120
hobbyist your motivation is very
 

4145
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,709
hobbyist your motivation is very
different than when you're playing from

4146
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:44,719
different than when you're playing from
 

4147
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:47,030
different than when you're playing from
a young age and have pretty high

4148
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:47,040
a young age and have pretty high
 

4149
01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:48,789
a young age and have pretty high
competitive ambition

4150
01:09:48,789 --> 01:09:48,799
competitive ambition
 

4151
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:49,829
competitive ambition
and

4152
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,839
and
 

4153
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:52,149
and
a lot of people who are new to chess

4154
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:52,159
a lot of people who are new to chess
 

4155
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,070
a lot of people who are new to chess
you could basically work on anything and

4156
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
you could basically work on anything and
 

4157
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,510
you could basically work on anything and
still improve

4158
01:09:55,510 --> 01:09:55,520
still improve
 

4159
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,669

the only time we're playing each other
 

4567
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,189
the only time we're playing each other
is when we're setting up in the park and

4568
01:17:01,189 --> 01:17:01,199
is when we're setting up in the park and
 

4569
01:17:01,199 --> 01:17:03,430
is when we're setting up in the park and
we don't have opponents yet and we need

4570
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:03,440
we don't have opponents yet and we need
 

4571
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:05,030
we don't have opponents yet and we need
content so we just play each other until

4572
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:05,040
content so we just play each other until
 

4573
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,110
content so we just play each other until
people show up but we always put stakes

4574
01:17:07,110 --> 01:17:07,120
people show up but we always put stakes
 

4575
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,790
people show up but we always put stakes
on the line which makes it more very

4576
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:08,800
on the line which makes it more very
 

4577
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:09,750
on the line which makes it more very
interesting because otherwise it

4578
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:09,760
interesting because otherwise it
 

4579
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,950
interesting because otherwise it
wouldn't be fun to play each other if

4739
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,270
incredibly well and then that also
happened before

4740
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:57,280
happened before
 

4741
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:00,149
happened before

01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:18,470
was in the interesting ideas
um yeah taking big risks it's cool to

4760
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
um yeah taking big risks it's cool to
 

4761
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,790
um yeah taking big risks it's cool to
see a 13 year old do that yeah

4762

01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
uh what about the you you mentioned that
 

4765
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,669
uh what about the you you mentioned that
his match against uh

4766
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
his match against uh
 

4767
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:26,550
his match against uh

taimana from their 71 candidates match
 

4771
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,430
taimana from their 71 candidates match
was interesting in some way why is it

4772
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:31,440
was interesting in some way why is it
 

4773
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,430
was interesting in some way why is it
interesting to you

4774
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
interesting to you
 

4775
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,790
interesting to you
i'm move 45 i'm looking at some notes

4776
01:20:36,790 --> 01:20:36,800
i'm move 45 i'm looking at some notes
 

4777
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,270
i'm move 45 i'm looking at some notes
this is with the bishop e3 i think i

4778
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
this is with the bishop e3 i think i
 

4779
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,030
this is with the bishop e3 i think i
know which one you're talking about um

4780
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,040
know which one you're talking about um
 

4781
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:41,990
know which one you're talking about um
it's

4782
01:20:41,990 --> 01:20:42,000
it's
 

4783
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,830
it's
i wouldn't say

4784
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
i wouldn't say
 

4785
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,590
i wouldn't say
a lot of these games on these lists i

4786
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
a lot of these games on these lists i
 

4787
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,149
a lot of these games on these lists i
think are really great combinations that

4788
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:48,159
think are really great combinations that
 

4789
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:48,950
think are really great combinations that
that

4790
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:48,960
that
 

4791
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,790
that
when tactics come into play which is

4792
01:20:50,790 --> 01:20:50,800
when tactics come into play which is
 

4793
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,550
when tactics come into play which is
what we're talking about but they're

4794
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
what we're talking about but they're
 

4795
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,910
what we're talking about but they're
very good at exemplifying lessons

4796
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
very good at exemplifying lessons
 

4797
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,470
very good at exemplifying lessons
this is why you study famous games so

4798
01:20:58,470 --> 01:20:58,480
this is why you study famous games so
 

4799
01:20:58,480 --> 01:20:59,990
this is why you study famous games so
you can apply these lessons to your own

4800
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:00,000
you can apply these lessons to your own
 

4801
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,149
you can apply these lessons to your own
games and i think the main takeaway for

4802
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:02,159
games and i think the main takeaway for
 

4803
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,149
games and i think the main takeaway for
this one was they were punishing their

4804
01:21:04,149 --> 01:21:04,159
this one was they were punishing their
 

4805
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:06,470
this one was they were punishing their
opponent from steering away from opening

4806
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:06,480
opponent from steering away from opening
 

4807
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:09,030
opponent from steering away from opening
principles which is something that we

4808
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:09,040
principles which is something that we
 

4809
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,030
principles which is something that we
learned a little earlier

4810
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:11,040
learned a little earlier
 

4811
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,189
learned a little earlier
where he delayed the development of his

4812
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
where he delayed the development of his
 

4813
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,750
where he delayed the development of his
king and put his queen out a little bit

4814
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:15,760
king and put his queen out a little bit
 

4815
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,950
king and put his queen out a little bit
too exposed so bobby fischer immediately

4816
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:18,960
too exposed so bobby fischer immediately
 

4817
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,790
too exposed so bobby fischer immediately
punished that and then there was just

4818
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
punished that and then there was just
 

4819
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,390
punished that and then there was just
like a beautiful combination where it

4820
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:22,400
like a beautiful combination where it
 

4821
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,430
like a beautiful combination where it
was like a

4822
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
was like a
 

4823
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:26,070
was like a
12 in a row perfect moves which was a

4824
01:21:26,070 --> 01:21:26,080
12 in a row perfect moves which was a
 

4825
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,990
12 in a row perfect moves which was a
tactic just winning the game but it only

4826
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
tactic just winning the game but it only
 

4827
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,390
tactic just winning the game but it only
came from punishing those mistakes the

4828
01:21:30,390 --> 01:21:30,400
came from punishing those mistakes the
 

4829
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:32,229
came from punishing those mistakes the
mistake being bringing the queen out

4830
01:21:32,229 --> 01:21:32,239
mistake being bringing the queen out
 

4831
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:33,830
mistake being bringing the queen out
bringing the queen out and yeah not

4832
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:33,840
bringing the queen out and yeah not
 

4833
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:35,830
bringing the queen out and yeah not
castling your king right away

4834
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
castling your king right away
 

4835
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:37,189
castling your king right away
and these were just like opening

4836
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
and these were just like opening
 

4837
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,790
and these were just like opening
principles that now they're written in

4838
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:38,800
principles that now they're written in
 

4839
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,590
principles that now they're written in
books but but for books you would study

4840
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:41,600
books but but for books you would study
 

4841
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,350
books but but for books you would study
these principles by studying games

4842
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,360

 

4843
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,790

the slowly going crazier is there some

4872
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
the slowly going crazier is there some
 

4873
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,790
the slowly going crazier is there some
aspect of chess that

4874
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:20,800
aspect of chess that
 

4875
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,110
aspect of chess that

i went to college where i just wanted to
 

4921
01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:18,470
i went to college where i just wanted to
take a gap year and focus on chess

4922
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:18,480
take a gap year and focus on chess
 

4923
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:19,430
take a gap year and focus on chess
because

4924
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:19,440
because
 

4925
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:21,350
because
i still i went to high school we moved a

4926
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:21,360
i still i went to high school we moved a
 

4927
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,790
i still i went to high school we moved a
lot there was always other things going

4928
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:22,800
lot there was always other things going
 

4929
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:25,110
lot there was always other things going
on so i felt like i could never really

4930
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,120
on so i felt like i could never really
 

4931
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:26,629
on so i felt like i could never really
focus on chess

4932
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
focus on chess
 

4933
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:28,950
focus on chess
and the one time i could by taking a gap

4934
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
and the one time i could by taking a gap
 

4935
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,870
and the one time i could by taking a gap
year i ended up not doing because my

4936
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:30,880
year i ended up not doing because my
 

4937
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,229
year i ended up not doing because my
parents really wanted me to go to

4938
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
parents really wanted me to go to
 

4939
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:34,629
parents really wanted me to go to
university right away but i think maybe

4940
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
university right away but i think maybe
 

4941
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,070
university right away but i think maybe
if i had taken that gap year i don't

4942
01:23:36,070 --> 01:23:36,080
if i had taken that gap year i don't
 

4943
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,430
if i had taken that gap year i don't
know if i would have gone back to school

4944
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
know if i would have gone back to school
 

4945
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,430
know if i would have gone back to school
so maybe it wasn't a bad thing i also

4946
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
so maybe it wasn't a bad thing i also
 

4947

so maybe it wasn't a bad thing i also

a dangerous addiction
 

5259
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:53,830
a dangerous addiction
it's such a beautiful addiction but it's

5260
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:53,840
it's such a beautiful addiction but it's
 

5261
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,510
it's such a beautiful addiction but it's
a dangerous one depending on what your

5262
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
a dangerous one depending on what your
 

5263
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,590
a dangerous one depending on what your
mind is like it reminds me of something

5264
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
mind is like it reminds me of something
 

5265
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,790
mind is like it reminds me of something
i thought of

5266
01:28:58,790 --> 01:28:58,800
i thought of
 

5267
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:01,350
i thought of
before i stopped competing as much and

5268
01:29:01,350 --> 01:29:01,360
before i stopped competing as much and
 

5269
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:03,350
before i stopped competing as much and
i'd look at people and think

5270
01:29:03,350 --> 01:29:03,360
i'd look at people and think
 

5271
01:29:03,360 --> 01:29:05,350
i'd look at people and think
imagine being

5272
01:29:05,350 --> 01:29:05,360
imagine being
 

5273
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:06,950
imagine being
so intelligent that you could become a

5274
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
so intelligent that you could become a
 

5275
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,350
so intelligent that you could become a
grand master and yet only spending the

5276
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:09,360
grand master and yet only spending the
 

5277
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,350
grand master and yet only spending the
rest of your life being a grandmaster

5278
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:11,360
rest of your life being a grandmaster
 

5279
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:12,870
rest of your life being a grandmaster
because it's one of those things where

5280
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:12,880
because it's one of those things where
 

5281
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,270
because it's one of those things where
it does require a lot of mental power

5282
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:15,280
it does require a lot of mental power
 

5283
01:29:15,280 --> 01:29:17,270
it does require a lot of mental power
but by doing chess you're not going to

5284
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:17,280
but by doing chess you're not going to
 

5285
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:20,550
but by doing chess you're not going to
be able to explore other subjects deeply

5286
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:20,560
be able to explore other subjects deeply
 

5287
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,270
be able to explore other subjects deeply
yeah and not in a way that is is bad

5288
01:29:23,270 --> 01:29:23,280
yeah and not in a way that is is bad
 

5289
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,750
yeah and not in a way that is is bad
necessarily more in admiration and

5290
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:25,760
necessarily more in admiration and
 

5291
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,270
necessarily more in admiration and
wondering what else could have been

5292
01:29:27,270 --> 01:29:27,280
wondering what else could have been
 

5293
01:29:27,280 --> 01:29:29,030
wondering what else could have been
because i've just seen people get to

5294
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
because i've just seen people get to
 

5295
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,870
because i've just seen people get to
these levels of obsession where it's all

5296
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:30,880
these levels of obsession where it's all
 

5297
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:32,790
these levels of obsession where it's all
they want to do and they're grandmasters

5298
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:32,800
they want to do and they're grandmasters
 

5299
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,070
they want to do and they're grandmasters
but they're not even top players so

5300
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:34,080
but they're not even top players so
 

5301
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,350
but they're not even top players so
they're never going to make a living out

5302
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:35,360
they're never going to make a living out
 

5303
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:37,669
they're never going to make a living out
of it they'll make like maybe 30 40k

5304
01:29:37,669 --> 01:29:37,679
of it they'll make like maybe 30 40k
 

5305
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:39,750
of it they'll make like maybe 30 40k
your max they can't even focus on their

5306
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:39,760
your max they can't even focus on their
 

5307
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,990
your max they can't even focus on their
competitive chess because they have to

5308
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
competitive chess because they have to
 

5309
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,229
competitive chess because they have to
supplement it by you know teaching and

5310
01:29:44,229 --> 01:29:44,239
supplement it by you know teaching and
 

5311
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:45,590
supplement it by you know teaching and
doing things they don't like and it's

5312
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:45,600
doing things they don't like and it's
 

5313
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,510
doing things they don't like and it's
just because of how strong of an

5314
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:47,520
just because of how strong of an
 

5315
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,830
just because of how strong of an
obsession it can be because it truly is

5316
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:49,840
obsession it can be because it truly is
 

5317
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:52,550
obsession it can be because it truly is
very intellectually rewarding

5318
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:52,560
very intellectually rewarding
 

5319
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:53,669
very intellectually rewarding
and i think that's what people are

5320
01:29:53,669 --> 01:29:53,679
and i think that's what people are
 

5321
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:55,270
and i think that's what people are
addicted to and the self-improvement but

5322
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
addicted to and the self-improvement but
 

5323
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,709
addicted to and the self-improvement but
you can get that from a lot of other

5324
01:29:56,709 --> 01:29:56,719
you can get that from a lot of other
 

5325
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:57,910
you can get that from a lot of other
things as well

5326
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
things as well
 

5327
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,070

by that stuck with me is that
a human being could be

5332
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:04,880

you just have to keep going forward
 

6003
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,430
you just have to keep going forward
because there's not a great path ahead

staying sharp and then also applying
 

6011
01:41:40,400 --> 01:41:42,229
staying sharp and then also applying
that to other things whereas if instead

something like that you'd probably end
 

6017
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,030
something like that you'd probably end
up being less sharp

6018

01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:16,470
and the
like is there some sense where it's

6106
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,480
like is there some sense where it's
 

6107
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,830
like is there some sense where it's
isolating

6108

and so on
or is it actually the opposite like is

6116
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:25,760
or is it actually the opposite like is
 

6117

to live stream all of it and that's just
 

6955
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,669
to live stream all of it and that's just
at some point it's like just enjoy your

at some point it's like just enjoy your
 

6957
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:27,510
at some point it's like just enjoy your
time off for those hobbies and

6958
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:27,520
time off for those hobbies and

prioritize what you're good at because
that's just going to be better for the

6962
01:57:31,270 --> 01:57:31,280
that's just going to be better for the
 

6963
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,350
that's just going to be better for the
channel overall so that was a learning

6964
01:57:33,350 --> 01:57:33,360
channel overall so that was a learning
 

6965
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,270
channel overall so that was a learning
lesson for sure it's nice because there

6966
01:57:35,270 --> 01:57:35,280
lesson for sure it's nice because there
 

6967
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:37,109
lesson for sure it's nice because there
are some intersections when i have tried

6968
01:57:37,109 --> 01:57:37,119
are some intersections when i have tried
 

6969
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:38,950
are some intersections when i have tried
new things that i really enjoy and it

6970
01:57:38,950 --> 01:57:38,960
new things that i really enjoy and it
 

6971
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,589
new things that i really enjoy and it
pays off but that's more uh less often

6972
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
pays off but that's more uh less often
 

6973
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,350
pays off but that's more uh less often
so it's more like you can be yourself

6974
01:57:43,350 --> 01:57:43,360
so it's more like you can be yourself
 

6975
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:45,430
so it's more like you can be yourself
but only specific parts of yourself

6976
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440

7319
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:32,709
and even though i don't like andrew tate
i think the fact that he got banned from

all the platforms is kind of scary
 

7323
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:37,109
all the platforms is kind of scary
because it sets a precedent and you

7324
02:03:37,109 --> 02:03:37,119
because it sets a precedent and you
 

7325
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:38,310
because it sets a precedent and you
always have to ask yourself would this

7326
02:03:38,310 --> 02:03:38,320
always have to ask yourself would this

be ethical if i was on the other side
 

7329
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:42,149
be ethical if i was on the other side
and even things with a president like

7330
02:03:42,149 --> 02:03:42,159
and even things with a president like
 

7331
02:03:42,159 --> 02:03:44,070
and even things with a president like
trump even if let's say you're somebody

7332
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:44,080
trump even if let's say you're somebody
 

7333
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:46,229
trump even if let's say you're somebody
who was on the left if that would have

7334
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:46,239

7335
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:47,589
who was on the left if that would have
happened to a leftist president how

would you feel would you think that's
morally ethical so

7340

that is something that i think is
 

7343
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:55,350
that is something that i think is

instead of just amplifying the worst
 

7351
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,550
instead of just amplifying the worst
about every human being

7352
02:04:04,550 --> 02:04:04,560
about every human being

02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:39,430
lasker he was world champion for 27
years he was the best in his field by

7728
02:10:39,430 --> 02:10:39,440
years he was the best in his field by
 

7729
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,270
years he was the best in his field by
far but would he be able to stand up to

7730
02:10:41,270 --> 02:10:41,280
far but would he be able to stand up to
 

7731
02:10:41,280 --> 02:10:42,870
far but would he be able to stand up to
someone like magnus carlson who has had

7732
02:10:42,870 --> 02:10:42,880
someone like magnus carlson who has had
 

7733
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,069
someone like magnus carlson who has had
these tools

7734
02:10:44,069 --> 02:10:44,079
these tools
 

7735
02:10:44,079 --> 02:10:45,510
these tools
i don't think so

7736
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:45,520
i don't think so
 

7737
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:46,629
i don't think so
so

7738
02:10:46,629 --> 02:10:46,639
so
 

7739
02:10:46,639 --> 02:10:48,149
so
most chess players have said gary

7740
02:10:48,149 --> 02:10:48,159
most chess players have said gary
 

7741
02:10:48,159 --> 02:10:50,950
most chess players have said gary
kasparov um and i think even magnus has

7742
02:10:50,950 --> 02:10:50,960
kasparov um and i think even magnus has
 

7743
02:10:50,960 --> 02:10:53,430
kasparov um and i think even magnus has
said that in the past but i like to

7744
02:10:53,430 --> 02:10:53,440
said that in the past but i like to
 

7745
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,270
said that in the past but i like to
think of it as magnus in his peak and

7746
02:10:55,270 --> 02:10:55,280
think of it as magnus in his peak and
 

7747
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:57,270
think of it as magnus in his peak and
gary at his peak and because magnus was

7748
02:10:57,270 --> 02:10:57,280
gary at his peak and because magnus was
 

7749
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,430
gary at his peak and because magnus was
able to live more in a computer era i

7750
02:10:59,430 --> 02:10:59,440
able to live more in a computer era i
 

7751
02:10:59,440 --> 02:11:01,430
able to live more in a computer era i
feel like so far he's the greatest of

7752
02:11:01,430 --> 02:11:01,440
feel like so far he's the greatest of
 

7753
02:11:01,440 --> 02:11:03,669
feel like so far he's the greatest of
all time and some studies say things

7754
02:11:03,669 --> 02:11:03,679
all time and some studies say things
 

7755
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:05,830
all time and some studies say things
like how there's raiding inflation but i

7756
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
like how there's raiding inflation but i
 

7757
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,990
like how there's raiding inflation but i
looked into some of them and they

7758
02:11:07,990 --> 02:11:08,000
looked into some of them and they
 

7759
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:11,350
looked into some of them and they
basically calculated people's um play in

7760
02:11:11,350 --> 02:11:11,360
basically calculated people's um play in
 

7761
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:13,350
basically calculated people's um play in
over the years and it seems that there

7762
02:11:13,350 --> 02:11:13,360
over the years and it seems that there
 

7763
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:14,709
over the years and it seems that there
hasn't been inflation people are just

7764
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
hasn't been inflation people are just
 

7765
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:15,830
hasn't been inflation people are just
getting better and i think it's because

7766
02:11:15,830 --> 02:11:15,840
getting better and i think it's because
 

7767
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:18,149
getting better and i think it's because
you have better tools at chess

7768
02:11:18,149 --> 02:11:18,159
you have better tools at chess
 

7769
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:20,229
you have better tools at chess
and also the one one of the cases what's

7770
02:11:20,229 --> 02:11:20,239
and also the one one of the cases what's
 

7771
02:11:20,239 --> 02:11:21,030
and also the one one of the cases what's
your

7772
02:11:21,030 --> 02:11:21,040
your
 

7773
02:11:21,040 --> 02:11:23,270
your
i was gonna say i actually i disagree

7774
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
i was gonna say i actually i disagree
 

7775
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:24,390
i was gonna say i actually i disagree
with that

7776
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:24,400
with that
 

7777
02:11:24,400 --> 02:11:27,669
with that
good make it interesting i think i would

7778
02:11:27,669 --> 02:11:27,679
good make it interesting i think i would
 

7779
02:11:27,679 --> 02:11:30,229
good make it interesting i think i would
judge the greatest like greatest player

7780
02:11:30,229 --> 02:11:30,239
judge the greatest like greatest player
 

7781
02:11:30,239 --> 02:11:31,510
judge the greatest like greatest player
of all time

7782
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:31,520
of all time
 

7783
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:33,430
of all time
in relative to the time that they lived

7784
02:11:33,430 --> 02:11:33,440
in relative to the time that they lived
 

7785
02:11:33,440 --> 02:11:35,430
in relative to the time that they lived
in and magnus although

7786
02:11:35,430 --> 02:11:35,440
in and magnus although
 

7787
02:11:35,440 --> 02:11:37,430
in and magnus although
he is technically the strongest chess

7788
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
he is technically the strongest chess
 

7789
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:40,069
he is technically the strongest chess
player in history that is because he had

7790
02:11:40,069 --> 02:11:40,079
player in history that is because he had
 

7791
02:11:40,079 --> 02:11:42,149
player in history that is because he had
computers to study chess with and of

7792
02:11:42,149 --> 02:11:42,159
computers to study chess with and of
 

7793
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:43,109
computers to study chess with and of
course

7794
02:11:43,109 --> 02:11:43,119
course
 

7795
02:11:43,119 --> 02:11:45,669
course
if you compare him to like gary kasparov

7796
02:11:45,669 --> 02:11:45,679
if you compare him to like gary kasparov
 

7797
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:48,149
if you compare him to like gary kasparov
he plays most like stockfish but gary

7798
02:11:48,149 --> 02:11:48,159
he plays most like stockfish but gary
 

7799
02:11:48,159 --> 02:11:50,950
he plays most like stockfish but gary
kasparov at his time he beat more

7800
02:11:50,950 --> 02:11:50,960
kasparov at his time he beat more
 

7801
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:53,270
kasparov at his time he beat more
players of his skill level than magnus

7802
02:11:53,270 --> 02:11:53,280
players of his skill level than magnus
 

7803
02:11:53,280 --> 02:11:55,669
players of his skill level than magnus
did magnus loses more often he also of

7804
02:11:55,669 --> 02:11:55,679
did magnus loses more often he also of
 

7805
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:57,510
did magnus loses more often he also of
course held the belt for 20 years more

7806
02:11:57,510 --> 02:11:57,520
course held the belt for 20 years more
 

7807
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:00,550
course held the belt for 20 years more
so i'd say actually because gary lacked

7808
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:00,560
so i'd say actually because gary lacked
 

7809
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,750
so i'd say actually because gary lacked
the help of computers to study chess and

7810
02:12:03,750 --> 02:12:03,760
the help of computers to study chess and
 

7811
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:06,390
the help of computers to study chess and
overall performed better against players

7812
02:12:06,390 --> 02:12:06,400
overall performed better against players
 

7813
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,910
overall performed better against players
of his skill level i think he would be

7814
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:07,920
of his skill level i think he would be
 

7815
02:12:07,920 --> 02:12:09,270
of his skill level i think he would be
number one

7816
02:12:09,270 --> 02:12:09,280
number one
 

7817
02:12:09,280 --> 02:12:10,149
number one
nice

7818
02:12:10,149 --> 02:12:10,159
nice
 

7819
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:11,510
nice
yeah but i mean the case that people

7820
02:12:11,510 --> 02:12:11,520
yeah but i mean the case that people
 

7821
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:13,430
yeah but i mean the case that people
make for magnus

7822
02:12:13,430 --> 02:12:13,440
make for magnus
 

7823
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,790
make for magnus
on many

7824
02:12:14,790 --> 02:12:14,800
on many
 

7825
02:12:14,800 --> 02:12:17,030
on many
i mean what alex said but but also

7826
02:12:17,030 --> 02:12:17,040
i mean what alex said but but also
 

7827
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:18,790
i mean what alex said but but also
magnus plays a lot

7828
02:12:18,790 --> 02:12:18,800
magnus plays a lot
 

7829
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,950
magnus plays a lot
and he doesn't

7830
02:12:20,950 --> 02:12:20,960
and he doesn't
 

7831
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:23,830
and he doesn't
he plays a lot blitz bullet and

7832
02:12:23,830 --> 02:12:23,840
he plays a lot blitz bullet and
 

7833
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:25,830
he plays a lot blitz bullet and
like he puts

7834
02:12:25,830 --> 02:12:25,840
like he puts
 

7835
02:12:25,840 --> 02:12:27,830
like he puts
he gets drunk and like he's really

7836
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:27,840
he gets drunk and like he's really
 

7837
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:29,510
he gets drunk and like he's really
putting himself out there

7838
02:12:29,510 --> 02:12:29,520
putting himself out there
 

7839
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:31,589
putting himself out there
and in all kinds of conditions and he's

7840
02:12:31,589 --> 02:12:31,599
and in all kinds of conditions and he's
 

7841
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:33,750
and in all kinds of conditions and he's
able to dominate in a lot of them we get

7842
02:12:33,750 --> 02:12:33,760
able to dominate in a lot of them we get
 

7843
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:35,669
able to dominate in a lot of them we get
to see many of the like losses of

7844
02:12:35,669 --> 02:12:35,679
to see many of the like losses of
 

7845
02:12:35,679 --> 02:12:36,950
to see many of the like losses of
blunders and all that kind of stuff

7846
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:36,960
blunders and all that kind of stuff
 

7847
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,870
blunders and all that kind of stuff
because he just puts himself out there

7848
02:12:38,870 --> 02:12:38,880
because he just puts himself out there
 

7849
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:42,229
because he just puts himself out there
and i think uh caspar was much more like

7850
02:12:42,229 --> 02:12:42,239
and i think uh caspar was much more like
 

7851
02:12:42,239 --> 02:12:44,870
and i think uh caspar was much more like
i never saw him play drunk right

7852
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:44,880
i never saw him play drunk right
 

7853
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,310
i never saw him play drunk right
and it's very focused on the world

7854
02:12:46,310 --> 02:12:46,320
and it's very focused on the world
 

7855
02:12:46,320 --> 02:12:49,109
and it's very focused on the world
championship is very like

7856
02:12:49,109 --> 02:12:49,119
championship is very like
 

7857
02:12:49,119 --> 02:12:51,510
championship is very like
um very limited number of games and very

7858
02:12:51,510 --> 02:12:51,520
um very limited number of games and very
 

7859
02:12:51,520 --> 02:12:53,350
um very limited number of games and very
focused on winning and so

7860
02:12:53,350 --> 02:12:53,360
focused on winning and so
 

7861
02:12:53,360 --> 02:12:55,990
focused on winning and so
there's some aspect to the versatility

7862
02:12:55,990 --> 02:12:56,000
there's some aspect to the versatility
 

7863
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,390
there's some aspect to the versatility
the aggressive play the fun the all of

7864
02:12:58,390 --> 02:12:58,400
the aggressive play the fun the all of
 

7865
02:12:58,400 --> 02:12:59,189
the aggressive play the fun the all of
that

7866
02:12:59,189 --> 02:12:59,199
that
 

7867
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:01,669
that
that i think you have to give credit to

7868
02:13:01,669 --> 02:13:01,679
that i think you have to give credit to
 

7869
02:13:01,679 --> 02:13:02,629
that i think you have to give credit to

the scope
 

7877
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:09,270
the scope
the scale of the variety of genius

7878
02:13:09,270 --> 02:13:09,280
the scale of the variety of genius
 

7879
02:13:09,280 --> 02:13:11,350
the scale of the variety of genius
exhibited by magnus and he might not

7880
02:13:11,350 --> 02:13:11,360
exhibited by magnus and he might not
 

7881
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:13,189
exhibited by magnus and he might not
even be done yet i don't know if you'll

7882
02:13:13,189 --> 02:13:13,199
even be done yet i don't know if you'll
 

7883
02:13:13,199 --> 02:13:16,470
even be done yet i don't know if you'll
ever hit 2 900 but we can't judge yet

7884
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:16,480
ever hit 2 900 but we can't judge yet
 

7885
02:13:16,480 --> 02:13:17,750
ever hit 2 900 but we can't judge yet
because he's not at the peak of his

7886
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:17,760
because he's not at the peak of his
 

7887
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,270
because he's not at the peak of his
career potentially what do you think

7888
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:19,280
career potentially what do you think
 

7889
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,790
career potentially what do you think
about him not playing world championship

7890
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800
about him not playing world championship
 

7891
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:23,109
about him not playing world championship
isn't that like isn't that wild the

7892
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:23,119
isn't that like isn't that wild the
 

7893

isn't that like isn't that wild the
entirety of the history of chess in the

7894
02:13:25,430 --> 02:13:25,440
entirety of the history of chess in the
 

7895
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:29,350
entirety of the history of chess in the
20th century going like meh

7896
02:13:29,350 --> 02:13:29,360
20th century going like meh
 

7897
02:13:29,360 --> 02:13:31,189
20th century going like meh
let's walking away from this one

7898
02:13:31,189 --> 02:13:31,199
let's walking away from this one
 

7899
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:32,550
let's walking away from this one
tournament that

7900
02:13:32,550 --> 02:13:32,560
tournament that
 

7901
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:34,790
tournament that
seems to be at the center of chess

7902
02:13:34,790 --> 02:13:34,800
seems to be at the center of chess
 

7903
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:37,189
seems to be at the center of chess
um what do you think about that decision

7904
02:13:37,189 --> 02:13:37,199
um what do you think about that decision
 

7905
02:13:37,199 --> 02:13:39,589
um what do you think about that decision
i mean you can't help but be

7906
02:13:39,589 --> 02:13:39,599
i mean you can't help but be
 

7907
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:41,910
i mean you can't help but be
disappointed as a chess fan who wants to

7908
02:13:41,910 --> 02:13:41,920
disappointed as a chess fan who wants to
 

7909
02:13:41,920 --> 02:13:43,750
disappointed as a chess fan who wants to
see the best player in the world defend

7910
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:43,760
see the best player in the world defend
 

7911
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:44,870
see the best player in the world defend
his title

7912
02:13:44,870 --> 02:13:44,880
his title
 

7913
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:47,990
his title
but i also understand it on a personal

7914
02:13:47,990 --> 02:13:48,000
but i also understand it on a personal
 

7915
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:51,430
but i also understand it on a personal
level and not feeling as satisfied when

7916
02:13:51,430 --> 02:13:51,440
level and not feeling as satisfied when
 

7917
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:52,470
level and not feeling as satisfied when
you're

7918
02:13:52,470 --> 02:13:52,480
you're
 

7919
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:53,990
you're
going to the world championship and have

7920
02:13:53,990 --> 02:13:54,000
going to the world championship and have
 

7921
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:55,750
going to the world championship and have
to having to defend against people who

7922
02:13:55,750 --> 02:13:55,760
to having to defend against people who
 

7923
02:13:55,760 --> 02:13:56,470
to having to defend against people who
are

7924
02:13:56,470 --> 02:13:56,480
are
 

7925
02:13:56,480 --> 02:13:57,990
are
less strong than you and also imagine

7926
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:58,000
less strong than you and also imagine
 

7927
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:00,069
less strong than you and also imagine
winning world championships and not

7928
02:14:00,069 --> 02:14:00,079
winning world championships and not
 

7929
02:14:00,079 --> 02:14:01,910
winning world championships and not
feeling a joy out of that

7930
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
feeling a joy out of that
 

7931
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,629
feeling a joy out of that
yeah so maybe by not doing that and

7932
02:14:04,629 --> 02:14:04,639
yeah so maybe by not doing that and
 

7933
02:14:04,639 --> 02:14:07,030
yeah so maybe by not doing that and
focusing instead on a goal like 2 900

7934
02:14:07,030 --> 02:14:07,040
focusing instead on a goal like 2 900
 

7935
02:14:07,040 --> 02:14:09,030
focusing instead on a goal like 2 900
he'll be more likely to accomplish it

7936
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:09,040
he'll be more likely to accomplish it
 

7937
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,109
he'll be more likely to accomplish it
because he's focusing on

7938
02:14:11,109 --> 02:14:11,119
because he's focusing on
 

7939
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:12,709
because he's focusing on
what actually motivates him to play

7940
02:14:12,709 --> 02:14:12,719
what actually motivates him to play
 

7941
02:14:12,719 --> 02:14:17,270
what actually motivates him to play
chess but i do think that it will

7942
02:14:17,270 --> 02:14:17,280
chess but i do think that it will
 

7943
02:14:17,280 --> 02:14:18,870
chess but i do think that it will
hurt how we judge

7944
02:14:18,870 --> 02:14:18,880
hurt how we judge
 

7945
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,189
hurt how we judge
the next world champion

7946
02:14:21,189 --> 02:14:21,199
the next world champion
 

7947
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:23,189
the next world champion
i think it won't change him being the

7948
02:14:23,189 --> 02:14:23,199
i think it won't change him being the
 

7949
02:14:23,199 --> 02:14:24,870
i think it won't change him being the
best player in the world

7950
02:14:24,870 --> 02:14:24,880
best player in the world
 

7951
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:27,510
best player in the world
and for someone to replace him even

7952
02:14:27,510 --> 02:14:27,520
and for someone to replace him even
 

7953
02:14:27,520 --> 02:14:30,310
and for someone to replace him even
let's say like nepo versus sting even if

7954
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
let's say like nepo versus sting even if
 

7955
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,790
let's say like nepo versus sting even if
one of them win and right on some stance

7956
02:14:32,790 --> 02:14:32,800
one of them win and right on some stance
 

7957
02:14:32,800 --> 02:14:35,510
one of them win and right on some stance
it does lower the merit because now who

7958
02:14:35,510 --> 02:14:35,520
it does lower the merit because now who
 

7959
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,589
it does lower the merit because now who
has the world chess championship title

7960
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
has the world chess championship title
 

7961
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:38,790
has the world chess championship title
isn't actually the best player in the

7962
02:14:38,790 --> 02:14:38,800
isn't actually the best player in the
 

7963
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:40,950
isn't actually the best player in the
world and that has happened before in

7964
02:14:40,950 --> 02:14:40,960
world and that has happened before in
 

7965
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:43,589
world and that has happened before in
the past but still going to take him

7966
02:14:43,589 --> 02:14:43,599
the past but still going to take him
 

7967
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:45,990
the past but still going to take him
the same effort to prove when they would

7968
02:14:45,990 --> 02:14:46,000
the same effort to prove when they would
 

7969
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,390
the same effort to prove when they would
pass him like 10 20 years to become

7970
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,400
pass him like 10 20 years to become
 

7971
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:49,990
pass him like 10 20 years to become
stronger than magnus so i don't think it

7972
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:50,000
stronger than magnus so i don't think it
 

7973
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:52,069
stronger than magnus so i don't think it
changes the skill level that it takes to

7974
02:14:52,069 --> 02:14:52,079
changes the skill level that it takes to
 

7975
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:53,270
changes the skill level that it takes to
become the best chess player in the

7976
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
become the best chess player in the
 

7977
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:55,510
become the best chess player in the
world i think for chess fans it's very

7978
02:14:55,510 --> 02:14:55,520
world i think for chess fans it's very
 

7979
02:14:55,520 --> 02:14:57,669
world i think for chess fans it's very
disappointing but i think in the overall

7980
02:14:57,669 --> 02:14:57,679
disappointing but i think in the overall
 

7981
02:14:57,679 --> 02:14:59,430
disappointing but i think in the overall
like grand scheme of like the public

7982
02:14:59,430 --> 02:14:59,440
like grand scheme of like the public
 

7983
02:14:59,440 --> 02:15:01,589
like grand scheme of like the public
view to people who don't really

7984
02:15:01,589 --> 02:15:01,599
view to people who don't really
 

7985
02:15:01,599 --> 02:15:03,589
view to people who don't really
so like you know what breaks the popular

7986
02:15:03,589 --> 02:15:03,599
so like you know what breaks the popular
 

7987
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:04,790
so like you know what breaks the popular
culture

7988
02:15:04,790 --> 02:15:04,800
culture
 

7989
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:08,149
culture
and you think of what names people know

7990
02:15:08,149 --> 02:15:08,159
and you think of what names people know
 

7991
02:15:08,159 --> 02:15:09,910
and you think of what names people know
who don't play chess like bobby fischer

7992
02:15:09,910 --> 02:15:09,920
who don't play chess like bobby fischer
 

7993
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:11,750
who don't play chess like bobby fischer
did it most people know casper over

7994
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:11,760
did it most people know casper over
 

7995
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,910
did it most people know casper over
magnus it takes the same ability and

7996
02:15:13,910 --> 02:15:13,920
magnus it takes the same ability and
 

7997
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,750
magnus it takes the same ability and
talent and that doesn't change i think

7998
02:15:15,750 --> 02:15:15,760
talent and that doesn't change i think
 

7999
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,589
talent and that doesn't change i think
it does change though if you're playing

8000
02:15:17,589 --> 02:15:17,599
it does change though if you're playing
 

8001
02:15:17,599 --> 02:15:20,229
it does change though if you're playing
a player who's not as strong

8002
02:15:20,229 --> 02:15:20,239
a player who's not as strong
 

8003
02:15:20,239 --> 02:15:22,310
a player who's not as strong
but i i see your point as well and i

8004

asked magnus but what is your take on it

8008
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:30,000

 

8009
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,270

well

8010

well
 

8011
02:15:31,280 --> 02:15:34,149
well
listen his answer is kind of brilliant

8012
02:15:34,149 --> 02:15:34,159
listen his answer is kind of brilliant
 

8013
02:15:34,159 --> 02:15:34,950
listen his answer is kind of brilliant
which

8014
02:15:34,950 --> 02:15:34,960
which
 

8015
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,430
which
he's not saying he's he's bored of the

bored of a process that doesn't
 

8021
02:15:41,920 --> 02:15:44,229
bored of a process that doesn't
determine the best player

determine the best player
 

8023
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,310
determine the best player
like and it's too anxiety-inducing to

8024
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
like and it's too anxiety-inducing to
 

8025
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:50,550
like and it's too anxiety-inducing to
him to have a small number of games he's

he doesn't mind losing which is really
 

8031
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,709
he doesn't mind losing which is really
fascinating to a better player right

8032
02:15:56,709 --> 02:15:56,719
fascinating to a better player right
 

8033
02:15:56,719 --> 02:15:59,189
fascinating to a better player right
or somebody who's his level he's more

a weaker player the weaker player

a weaker player the weaker player
 

8041
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,750

because of the small sample size now if
 

8043
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,830
because of the small sample size now if
like poker players had that anxiety they

8044
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:09,840
like poker players had that anxiety they
 

8045

like poker players had that anxiety they
would never play at all right that's the

8046
02:16:12,069 --> 02:16:12,079
would never play at all right that's the
 

8047
02:16:12,079 --> 02:16:14,069
would never play at all right that's the
world series of poker you

8048
02:16:14,069 --> 02:16:14,079
world series of poker you
 

8049
02:16:14,079 --> 02:16:16,950
world series of poker you
you get to lose against weaker players

8050
02:16:16,950 --> 02:16:16,960
you get to lose against weaker players
 

8051
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,870
you get to lose against weaker players
all the time that's the throw of the

8052
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
all the time that's the throw of the
 

8053
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:20,149
all the time that's the throw of the
dice but

8054
02:16:20,149 --> 02:16:20,159
dice but
 

8055
02:16:20,159 --> 02:16:21,830
dice but
um that's an interesting perspective

8056
02:16:21,830 --> 02:16:21,840
um that's an interesting perspective
 

8057
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:24,069
um that's an interesting perspective
that he would love to play 20 30 40

8058
02:16:24,069 --> 02:16:24,079
that he would love to play 20 30 40
 

8059
02:16:24,079 --> 02:16:24,950
that he would love to play 20 30 40

would enjoy it much more
 

8065
02:16:28,079 --> 02:16:31,350
would enjoy it much more
and also play shorter games because they

8066
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:31,360
and also play shorter games because they
 

8067
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,429
and also play shorter games because they
emphasize the um

8068
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:33,439

when you're younger it's okay to take
 

8375
02:21:59,520 --> 02:22:01,270
when you're younger it's okay to take
more risks because you have a lot more

8376
02:22:01,270 --> 02:22:01,280
more risks because you have a lot more
 

8377
02:22:01,280 --> 02:22:02,150
more risks because you have a lot more
time

8378

time
 

8379

but there has to be a reason why you're
doing that particular risk is it

8382
02:22:06,230 --> 02:22:06,240
doing that particular risk is it
 

8383
02:22:06,240 --> 02:22:07,590
doing that particular risk is it
something that you've spent a lot of

8384
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:07,600
something that you've spent a lot of
 

8385
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:09,190
something that you've spent a lot of
time already really passionate and

8386
02:22:09,190 --> 02:22:09,200
time already really passionate and
 

8387
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:10,469
time already really passionate and

that's trendy and you want to do it
 

8391
02:22:11,840 --> 02:22:13,670
that's trendy and you want to do it
because you don't have a better option

8392
02:22:13,670 --> 02:22:13,680
because you don't have a better option
 

8393
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,429
because you don't have a better option
and that's actually similar to what

and that's actually similar to what
 

8395

a lot more experience than i do um and
then i can go back to school after

8430
02:22:52,389 --> 02:22:52,399
then i can go back to school after
 

8431
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:54,070
then i can go back to school after
and if i go to school right now i do

8432
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:54,080
and if i go to school right now i do
 

8433
02:22:54,080 --> 02:22:55,670
and if i go to school right now i do
online classes for a year and that's

8434
02:22:55,670 --> 02:22:55,680
online classes for a year and that's
 

8435
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:57,429
online classes for a year and that's
something that i could do at any time so

8436
02:22:57,429 --> 02:22:57,439
something that i could do at any time so
 

8437
02:22:57,439 --> 02:22:58,950
something that i could do at any time so
that's why it made a lot of sense for me

8438
02:22:58,950 --> 02:22:58,960
that's why it made a lot of sense for me
 

8439
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:00,710
that's why it made a lot of sense for me
to go into this

8440
02:23:00,710 --> 02:23:00,720
to go into this
 

8441
02:23:00,720 --> 02:23:03,349
to go into this
but of course this is also a very unique

8442
02:23:03,349 --> 02:23:03,359
but of course this is also a very unique
 

8443
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:04,870
but of course this is also a very unique
opportunity so i don't know how

8444
02:23:04,870 --> 02:23:04,880
opportunity so i don't know how
 

8445
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:06,790
opportunity so i don't know how
applicable but i do think overall the

8446
02:23:06,790 --> 02:23:06,800
applicable but i do think overall the
 

8447
02:23:06,800 --> 02:23:08,550
applicable but i do think overall the
calculated risk is a really good it's a

8448
02:23:08,550 --> 02:23:08,560
calculated risk is a really good it's a
 

8449
02:23:08,560 --> 02:23:09,270
calculated risk is a really good it's a
life

8450
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:09,280

02:32:35,750 --> 02:32:35,760
within my own life even if i know it's

maybe it was more so
 

9007
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:49,110
maybe it was more so
when i was younger because it was easier

9008
02:32:49,110 --> 02:32:49,120
when i was younger because it was easier
 

9009
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:51,110
when i was younger because it was easier
to just feel like i want to improve as a

02:32:53,110 --> 02:32:53,120
person and
 

9013
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:55,190
person and
to use chess to kind of measure some

9014
02:32:55,190 --> 02:32:55,200

more different than that and i think i

9020
02:33:00,950 --> 02:33:00,960
more different than that and i think i

more different than that and i think i
need to once again find what that

02:33:56,389 --> 02:33:56,399
love is a reason you want to share
 

9073

experiences with other people

02:33:58,950 --> 02:33:58,960
experiences with other people
 

9075
02:33:58,960 --> 02:34:00,469
experiences with other people
that's how i see it like the people you

9076
02:34:00,469 --> 02:34:00,479
that's how i see it like the people you
 

9077

um the good and the bad yeah exactly
 

9083
02:34:07,920 --> 02:34:12,230
um the good and the bad yeah exactly
that's my simple take on love

9084
02:34:12,230 --> 02:34:12,240

 

9085
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:15,190

my take on it is that

9086
02:34:15,190 --> 02:34:15,200
my take on it is that
 

9087
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:17,349
my take on it is that
part of what it is to be human is to be

9088
02:34:17,349 --> 02:34:17,359
part of what it is to be human is to be
 

9089
02:34:17,359 --> 02:34:18,710
part of what it is to be human is to be
somebody who

9090
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:18,720
somebody who
 

9091
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:21,830
somebody who
feels things emotionally and love

9092
02:34:21,830 --> 02:34:21,840
feels things emotionally and love
 

9093
02:34:21,840 --> 02:34:24,389
feels things emotionally and love
is one of the most intense feelings you

9094
02:34:24,389 --> 02:34:24,399
is one of the most intense feelings you
 

9095
02:34:24,399 --> 02:34:25,910
is one of the most intense feelings you
can have

9096
02:34:25,910 --> 02:34:25,920
can have
 

9097
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:28,070
can have
um obviously there's the opposite of

9098
02:34:28,070 --> 02:34:28,080
um obviously there's the opposite of
 

9099
02:34:28,080 --> 02:34:30,150
um obviously there's the opposite of
that and there's things like hate but i

9100
02:34:30,150 --> 02:34:30,160
that and there's things like hate but i
 

9101
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,469
that and there's things like hate but i
think the love you feel for people like

think the love you feel for people like
your parents and your friends and

9104
02:34:33,990 --> 02:34:34,000
your parents and your friends and
 

9105
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:36,070

02:34:45,750 --> 02:34:45,760
unique to humans and that's
