more risk-averse style you know if

210
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:52,260
more risk-averse style you know if
 

211
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,350
more risk-averse style you know if
somebody makes a huge bet you're gonna

212
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:54,360
somebody makes a huge bet you're gonna
 

213
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,850
somebody makes a huge bet you're gonna
if you're playing no limit hold them and

214
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:55,860
if you're playing no limit hold them and
 

215
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,410
if you're playing no limit hold them and
somebody makes a huge bet

216
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,420
somebody makes a huge bet
 

217
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,850
somebody makes a huge bet
there might come a point where you're

218
00:03:58,850 --> 00:03:58,860
there might come a point where you're
 

219
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,649
there might come a point where you're
like this is too much money for me to

220
00:04:00,649 --> 00:04:00,659
like this is too much money for me to
 

221
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,530
like this is too much money for me to
handle like I can't risk this amount uh

222
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:03,540
handle like I can't risk this amount uh
 

223
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,610
handle like I can't risk this amount uh
and that's what throws a lot of people

224
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,620
and that's what throws a lot of people
 

225
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,449
and that's what throws a lot of people
off

226
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:05,459
off
 

227
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,910
off
so that's the big difference I think

228
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:07,920
so that's the big difference I think
 

229
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,850
so that's the big difference I think
between No Limit and limit what about on

230
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:10,860
between No Limit and limit what about on
 

231
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,050
between No Limit and limit what about on
the action side when you're actually

232
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,060
the action side when you're actually
 

233
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,809
the action side when you're actually
making that big bet that's what I mean

234
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:14,819
making that big bet that's what I mean
 

235
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:16,909
making that big bet that's what I mean
by crazy I was I was trying to refer to

person in terms of
 

245
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,530
person in terms of
um their ability to reason optimally I

246
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:30,540
um their ability to reason optimally I
 

247
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,030
um their ability to reason optimally I
think that's right I think

248
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,040
think that's right I think
 

249
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:35,450
think that's right I think
one of the key strategies in poker is to

250
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:35,460
one of the key strategies in poker is to
 

251
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,770
one of the key strategies in poker is to
put the other person into an

252

put the other person into an
 

253
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,510
put the other person into an
uncomfortable position and if you're

254
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:38,520
uncomfortable position and if you're
 

255
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,129
uncomfortable position and if you're
doing that then you're you're playing

256
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:40,139
doing that then you're you're playing
 

257
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:41,570
doing that then you're you're playing
poker well and there's a lot of

258
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:41,580
poker well and there's a lot of
 

259
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,770
poker well and there's a lot of
opportunities to do that in no limit

260
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:42,780
opportunities to do that in no limit
 

261
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,890
opportunities to do that in no limit
Hold'em you know you can have like 50 in

262
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:45,900
Hold'em you know you can have like 50 in
 

263
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,270
Hold'em you know you can have like 50 in
there you throw in a thousand dollar bet

264
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,280
there you throw in a thousand dollar bet
 

265
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,210
there you throw in a thousand dollar bet
and um you know that's sometimes if you

266
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,220
and um you know that's sometimes if you
 

267
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,249
and um you know that's sometimes if you
do it right it puts the other person in

268
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:52,259
do it right it puts the other person in
 

269
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:53,990
do it right it puts the other person in
a really tough spot now it's also

270
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:54,000
a really tough spot now it's also
 

271
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,670
a really tough spot now it's also
possible that you make huge mistakes

272
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:55,680
possible that you make huge mistakes
 

273
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,530
possible that you make huge mistakes
that way and so it's really easy to lose

274
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:57,540
that way and so it's really easy to lose
 

275
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,790
that way and so it's really easy to lose
a lot of money and no limit hold them if

276
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
a lot of money and no limit hold them if
 

277
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,469
a lot of money and no limit hold them if
you don't know what you're doing

278
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
you don't know what you're doing
 

279
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,270
you don't know what you're doing
um but there's a lot of upside potential

280
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,280
um but there's a lot of upside potential
 

281
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,850
um but there's a lot of upside potential
too so when you build systems AI systems

282
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:04,860
too so when you build systems AI systems

when I I started playing poker when I

298
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:24,780
when I I started playing poker when I
 

299
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,770
when I I started playing poker when I
was in high school and the idea to me

300
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:27,780
was in high school and the idea to me
 

301
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,650
was in high school and the idea to me
that there is a correct and objectively

302
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:30,660
that there is a correct and objectively
 

303
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,170
that there is a correct and objectively
correct way of playing poker and if you

304
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,180
correct way of playing poker and if you
 

305
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,550
correct way of playing poker and if you
could figure out what that is then

306
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:34,560
could figure out what that is then
 

307
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,950
could figure out what that is then
you're you know you're making unlimited

308
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
you're you know you're making unlimited
 

309
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,029
you're you know you're making unlimited
money basically

310
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:38,039
money basically
 

311
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:39,890
money basically
that's like a really fascinating concept

312
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:39,900
that's like a really fascinating concept
 

313
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,790
that's like a really fascinating concept
to me

314
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
to me
 

315
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,710
to me
um and so I was fascinated by the

316
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:42,720
um and so I was fascinated by the
 

317
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,290
um and so I was fascinated by the
strategy of Poker even when I was like

318
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:45,300
strategy of Poker even when I was like
 

319
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,390
strategy of Poker even when I was like
16 years old it wasn't until like much

320
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:47,400
16 years old it wasn't until like much
 

321
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,650
16 years old it wasn't until like much
later that I actually worked on poker

322
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:48,660
later that I actually worked on poker
 

323
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,570
later that I actually worked on poker
AIS so there was a sense that you can

324
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:50,580
AIS so there was a sense that you can
 

325
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,270
AIS so there was a sense that you can
solve poker like uh in the way you can

326
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
solve poker like uh in the way you can
 

327
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,029
solve poker like uh in the way you can
solve chess for example or Checkers I

328
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:56,039
solve chess for example or Checkers I
 

329
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:57,590
solve chess for example or Checkers I
believe Checkers got solved right yeah

330
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,600
believe Checkers got solved right yeah
 

331
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,270
believe Checkers got solved right yeah
Checkers Checkers are completely solved

332
00:05:59,270 --> 00:05:59,280
Checkers Checkers are completely solved
 

333
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,950
Checkers Checkers are completely solved
up optimal optimal strategy it's

334
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:00,960
up optimal optimal strategy it's
 

335
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,689
up optimal optimal strategy it's
impossible to beat the AI yeah and so in

336
00:06:02,689 --> 00:06:02,699
impossible to beat the AI yeah and so in
 

337
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,129
impossible to beat the AI yeah and so in
that same way you could technically

338
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:04,139
that same way you could technically
 

339
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,629
that same way you could technically
solve chess

340
00:06:05,629 --> 00:06:05,639
solve chess
 

341
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:07,189
solve chess
you could solve chess you could solve

342
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
you could solve chess you could solve
 

343
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,469
you could solve chess you could solve
poker you could solve poker so this is

344
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:09,479
poker you could solve poker so this is
 

345
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,450
poker you could solve poker so this is
this gets into the concept of an ash

346
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:11,460
this gets into the concept of an ash
 

347
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,370
this gets into the concept of an ash
equilibrium yeah so it is a Nash

348
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:13,380
equilibrium yeah so it is a Nash
 

349
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,249
equilibrium yeah so it is a Nash
equilibrium Okay so

350
00:06:16,249 --> 00:06:16,259
equilibrium Okay so
 

351
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,830
equilibrium Okay so
and any finite two-player zero-sum game

352
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:18,840
and any finite two-player zero-sum game
 

353
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,590
and any finite two-player zero-sum game
there is an optimal strategy that if you

354
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:21,600
there is an optimal strategy that if you
 

355
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,450
there is an optimal strategy that if you
play it you are guaranteed to not lose

356
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,460
play it you are guaranteed to not lose
 

357
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,070
play it you are guaranteed to not lose
an expectation no matter what your

358
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,080
an expectation no matter what your
 

359
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,450
an expectation no matter what your
opponent does

360
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:26,460
opponent does
 

361
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,610
opponent does
and this is kind of a radical concept to

362
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:28,620
and this is kind of a radical concept to
 

363
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,930
and this is kind of a radical concept to
a lot of people

364
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:29,940
a lot of people
 

365
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,490
a lot of people
um but it's true in chess it's true in

366
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:31,500
um but it's true in chess it's true in
 

367
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,650
um but it's true in chess it's true in
poker it's true in any finite two-player

368
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:33,660
poker it's true in any finite two-player
 

369
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,790
poker it's true in any finite two-player
zero-sum game

370
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
zero-sum game
 

371
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,010
zero-sum game
and to give some intuition for this you

372
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,020
and to give some intuition for this you
 

373
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,809
and to give some intuition for this you
can think of rock paper scissors

374
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:38,819
can think of rock paper scissors
 

375
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,270
can think of rock paper scissors
and rock paper scissors if you randomly

376
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
and rock paper scissors if you randomly
 

377
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,010
and rock paper scissors if you randomly
choose between throwing rock paper and

378
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,020
choose between throwing rock paper and
 

379
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,990
choose between throwing rock paper and
scissors with equal probability then no

380
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,000
scissors with equal probability then no
 

381
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,090
scissors with equal probability then no
matter what your opponent does you are

382
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,100
matter what your opponent does you are
 

383
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,590
matter what your opponent does you are
not going to lose an expectation you're

384
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:48,600
not going to lose an expectation you're
 

385
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,969
not going to lose an expectation you're
not going to lose an expectation in the

386
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:49,979
not going to lose an expectation in the
 

387
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:50,930
not going to lose an expectation in the
long run

388
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:50,940
long run
 

389
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,450
long run
now the same is true for poker there

390
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:53,460
now the same is true for poker there
 

391
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,070
now the same is true for poker there
exists some strategy some really

392
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,080
exists some strategy some really
 

393
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,290
exists some strategy some really
complicated strategy that if you play

394
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:57,300
complicated strategy that if you play
 

395
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,150
complicated strategy that if you play
that you are guaranteed to not lose

396
00:06:59,150 --> 00:06:59,160
that you are guaranteed to not lose
 

397
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,950
that you are guaranteed to not lose
money in the long run and I should say

398
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
money in the long run and I should say
 

399
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,390
money in the long run and I should say
this is for two player poker six player

400
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,400
this is for two player poker six player
 

401
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,890
this is for two player poker six player
poker is a different story yeah it's a

402
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:03,900
poker is a different story yeah it's a
 

403
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,830
poker is a different story yeah it's a
beautiful giant mess when you say in

404
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:06,840
beautiful giant mess when you say in
 

405
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,469
beautiful giant mess when you say in
expectation you're guaranteed not to

406
00:07:09,469 --> 00:07:09,479
expectation you're guaranteed not to
 

407
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,510
expectation you're guaranteed not to
lose in expectation what does in

408
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:11,520
lose in expectation what does in
 

409
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,550
lose in expectation what does in
expectation mean Poker is a very high

410
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
expectation mean Poker is a very high
 

411
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,230
expectation mean Poker is a very high
variance game so you're gonna have hands

412
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:15,240
variance game so you're gonna have hands
 

413
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,189
variance game so you're gonna have hands
where you win you're gonna have hands

414
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:16,199
where you win you're gonna have hands
 

415
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,150
where you win you're gonna have hands
with your lose even if you're playing

416
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
with your lose even if you're playing
 

417
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,950
with your lose even if you're playing
the perfect strategy you can't guarantee

418
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:18,960
the perfect strategy you can't guarantee
 

419
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,150
the perfect strategy you can't guarantee
they're going to win every single hand

420
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,160
they're going to win every single hand
 

421
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,150
they're going to win every single hand
but if you play for long enough then you

422
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:23,160
but if you play for long enough then you
 

423
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,010
but if you play for long enough then you
are guaranteed to at least break even

424
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,020
are guaranteed to at least break even
 

425
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,469
are guaranteed to at least break even
and and practice probably one

426
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:27,479
and and practice probably one
 

427
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,990
and and practice probably one
so that's an expectation the size of

428
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,000
so that's an expectation the size of
 

429
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,809
so that's an expectation the size of
your stack generally speaking now that

430
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:32,819
your stack generally speaking now that
 

431
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,210
your stack generally speaking now that
doesn't include anything about the fact

432
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:35,220
doesn't include anything about the fact
 

433
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,830
doesn't include anything about the fact
that you can go broke it doesn't include

434
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:36,840
that you can go broke it doesn't include
 

435
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,930
that you can go broke it doesn't include
any of those kinds of normal real world

436
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:38,940
any of those kinds of normal real world
 

437
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,969
any of those kinds of normal real world
limitations you're talking you know in

438
00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:40,979
limitations you're talking you know in
 

439
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:42,290
limitations you're talking you know in
the theoretical world

440
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:42,300
the theoretical world
 

441
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,689
the theoretical world
uh what about this the zero-sum aspect

442
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:44,699
uh what about this the zero-sum aspect
 

443
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,430
uh what about this the zero-sum aspect
how big of a constraint is that how big

444
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
how big of a constraint is that how big
 

445
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,350
how big of a constraint is that how big
of a constraint is finite

446
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:48,360
of a constraint is finite
 

447
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,370
of a constraint is finite
so

448
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:49,380
so
 

449
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,249
so
finite's not a huge constraint so I mean

450
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:52,259
finite's not a huge constraint so I mean
 

451
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,689
finite's not a huge constraint so I mean
most games that you play are finite in

452
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:53,699
most games that you play are finite in
 

453
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:54,529
most games that you play are finite in
size

454
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:54,539
size
 

455
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:56,270
size
um it's also true actually that there

456
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:56,280
um it's also true actually that there
 

457
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,010
um it's also true actually that there
exists this like perfect strategy in

458
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
exists this like perfect strategy in
 

459
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,809
exists this like perfect strategy in
many infinite games as well technically

460
00:07:59,809 --> 00:07:59,819
many infinite games as well technically
 

461
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,029
many infinite games as well technically
the game has to be compact

462
00:08:02,029 --> 00:08:02,039
the game has to be compact
 

463
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:04,129
the game has to be compact
um there are like some edge cases where

464
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:04,139
um there are like some edge cases where
 

465
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:05,510
um there are like some edge cases where
you don't have an ash equilibrium and a

466
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,520
you don't have an ash equilibrium and a
 

467
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,129
you don't have an ash equilibrium and a
two player zero-sum game so you can

468
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:07,139
two player zero-sum game so you can
 

469
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:08,809
two player zero-sum game so you can
think of a game where you like you know

470
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:08,819
think of a game where you like you know
 

471
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:09,830
think of a game where you like you know
if we're playing a game where whoever

472
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
if we're playing a game where whoever
 

473
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,570
if we're playing a game where whoever
names the bigger number is the winner

474
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:11,580
names the bigger number is the winner
 

475
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,490
names the bigger number is the winner
there's no Nash equilibrium to that game

476
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:13,500
there's no Nash equilibrium to that game
 

477
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,850
there's no Nash equilibrium to that game
17 yeah 18. but you beat you win again

478
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:16,860
17 yeah 18. but you beat you win again
 

479
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,430
17 yeah 18. but you beat you win again
you're good at this I played a lot of

480
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,440
you're good at this I played a lot of
 

481
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,290
you're good at this I played a lot of
games

482
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,300
games
 

483
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,629
games
okay uh so that's and then the Zero Sum

484
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:23,639
okay uh so that's and then the Zero Sum
 

485
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,510
okay uh so that's and then the Zero Sum
aspect the zero zero sum aspects so

486
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:26,520
aspect the zero zero sum aspects so
 

487
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,029
aspect the zero zero sum aspects so
there exists a Nash equilibrium in non

488
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:29,039
there exists a Nash equilibrium in non
 

489
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,650
there exists a Nash equilibrium in non
two player zero-sum games as well and by

490
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:30,660
two player zero-sum games as well and by
 

491
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,969
two player zero-sum games as well and by
the way just to clarify what I mean by

492
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:31,979
the way just to clarify what I mean by
 

493
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:34,070
the way just to clarify what I mean by
two player Zero Sum I mean there's two

494
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
two player Zero Sum I mean there's two
 

495
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,930
two player Zero Sum I mean there's two
players and whatever one player wins the

496
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:35,940
players and whatever one player wins the
 

497
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,670
players and whatever one player wins the
other player loses so if we're applying

498
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
other player loses so if we're applying
 

499
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,290
other player loses so if we're applying
poker and I win 50 that means that

500
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:39,300
poker and I win 50 that means that
 

501
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,969
poker and I win 50 that means that
you're losing fifty dollars

502
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:40,979
you're losing fifty dollars
 

503
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,110
you're losing fifty dollars
now outside of two player zero-sum games

504
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:44,120
now outside of two player zero-sum games
 

505
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,090
now outside of two player zero-sum games
there still exists Nash equilibria but

506
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:47,100
there still exists Nash equilibria but
 

507
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,130
there still exists Nash equilibria but
they're not as meaningful because you

508
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:49,140
they're not as meaningful because you
 

509
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,170
they're not as meaningful because you
know you can think of a game like Risk

510
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:51,180
know you can think of a game like Risk
 

511
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:53,630
know you can think of a game like Risk
if everybody else at the and on the

512
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:53,640
if everybody else at the and on the
 

513
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,009
if everybody else at the and on the
board decides a team up against you and

514
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:55,019
board decides a team up against you and
 

515
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:57,050
board decides a team up against you and
take you out there's no perfect strategy

516
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:57,060
take you out there's no perfect strategy
 

517
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,730
take you out there's no perfect strategy
you can play that's gonna guarantee that

518
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:58,740
you can play that's gonna guarantee that
 

519
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,930
you can play that's gonna guarantee that
you win there there's just nothing you

520
00:08:59,930 --> 00:08:59,940
you win there there's just nothing you
 

521
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,509
you win there there's just nothing you
can do so outside of two players zero

522
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:02,519
can do so outside of two players zero
 

523
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,190
can do so outside of two players zero
some games there's no guarantee that

524
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:04,200
some games there's no guarantee that
 

525
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,509
some games there's no guarantee that
you're going to win by playing a

526
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:05,519
you're going to win by playing a
 

527
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,009
you're going to win by playing a
national equilibrium

528
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:07,019
national equilibrium
 

529
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,410
national equilibrium
have you ever tried to model in the

530
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:09,420
have you ever tried to model in the
 

531
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,269
have you ever tried to model in the
other aspects of the game

532
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
other aspects of the game
 

533
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,389
other aspects of the game
which is like the pleasure you draw from

534
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:14,399
which is like the pleasure you draw from
 

535
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,850
which is like the pleasure you draw from
playing the game and then if you're a

536
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:16,860
playing the game and then if you're a
 

537
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,070
playing the game and then if you're a
professional poker player if you're

538
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,080
professional poker player if you're
 

539
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,889
professional poker player if you're
exciting even if you lose

540
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:21,899
exciting even if you lose
 

541
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:24,590
exciting even if you lose
uh the you know the money you would get

542
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:24,600
uh the you know the money you would get
 

543
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,910
uh the you know the money you would get
from the attention you get to the

544
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
from the attention you get to the
 

545
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,650
from the attention you get to the
sponsor and all that kind of stuff is

546
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:27,660
sponsor and all that kind of stuff is
 

547
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,810
sponsor and all that kind of stuff is
that that would be a fun thing to model

548
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:29,820
that that would be a fun thing to model
 

549
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,509
that that would be a fun thing to model
to model in as I'd be make it sort of

550
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:32,519
to model in as I'd be make it sort of
 

551
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,310
to model in as I'd be make it sort of
super complex to include the human

552
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,320
super complex to include the human
 

553
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,190
super complex to include the human
factor in this in this full complexity I

554
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:37,200
factor in this in this full complexity I
 

555
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,389
factor in this in this full complexity I
think you bring up a couple good points

556
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:38,399
think you bring up a couple good points
 

557
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,370
think you bring up a couple good points
there so I think a lot of professional

558
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:40,380
there so I think a lot of professional
 

559
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,530
there so I think a lot of professional
poker players I mean they got a huge

560
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:42,540
poker players I mean they got a huge
 

561
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,970
poker players I mean they got a huge
amount of money not from actually

562
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:43,980
amount of money not from actually
 

563
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,949
amount of money not from actually
playing poker but from the sponsorships

564
00:09:45,949 --> 00:09:45,959
playing poker but from the sponsorships
 

565
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,110
playing poker but from the sponsorships
and having a personality that people

566
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:48,120
and having a personality that people
 

567
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,509
and having a personality that people
want to tune in and watch that that's a

568
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:50,519
want to tune in and watch that that's a
 

569
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,009
want to tune in and watch that that's a
big that's a big way to to make a name

570
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:52,019
big that's a big way to to make a name
 

571
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,230
big that's a big way to to make a name
for yourself in poker I just wanted from

572
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:54,240
for yourself in poker I just wanted from
 

573
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,269
for yourself in poker I just wanted from
an AI perspective if you create and

574
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:56,279
an AI perspective if you create and
 

575
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,509
an AI perspective if you create and
we'll talk about this more maybe a AI

576
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
we'll talk about this more maybe a AI
 

577
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,090
we'll talk about this more maybe a AI
system that also talks trash and all

578
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,100
system that also talks trash and all
 

579
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,130
system that also talks trash and all
that kind of stuff that that becomes

580
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:04,140
that kind of stuff that that becomes
 

581
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,750
that kind of stuff that that becomes
part of the function to maximize so it's

582
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:05,760
part of the function to maximize so it's
 

583
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,870
part of the function to maximize so it's
not just optimal poker play maybe

584
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:08,880
not just optimal poker play maybe
 

585
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,490
not just optimal poker play maybe
sometimes you want to be chaotic maybe

586
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:10,500
sometimes you want to be chaotic maybe
 

587
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,170
sometimes you want to be chaotic maybe
sometimes you want to be suboptimal and

588
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:12,180
sometimes you want to be suboptimal and
 

589
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,090
sometimes you want to be suboptimal and
you lose

590
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:14,100
you lose
 

591
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,550
you lose
um the the chaos and maybe sometimes you

592
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:16,560
um the the chaos and maybe sometimes you
 

593
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,590
um the the chaos and maybe sometimes you
want to be overly aggressive because

594
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,600
want to be overly aggressive because
 

595
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,650
want to be overly aggressive because
people the audience loves that

596
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:21,660
people the audience loves that
 

597
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,750
people the audience loves that
that's fascinating I think I think what

598
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:23,760
that's fascinating I think I think what
 

599
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,070
that's fascinating I think I think what
you're getting at here is that there's a

600
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:25,080
you're getting at here is that there's a
 

601
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,210
you're getting at here is that there's a
difference between making an AI that

602
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,220
difference between making an AI that
 

603
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,769
difference between making an AI that
wins a game and an AI That's fun to play

604
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:27,779
wins a game and an AI That's fun to play
 

605
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:30,170
wins a game and an AI That's fun to play
with right yeah yeah and more fun to

606
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
with right yeah yeah and more fun to
 

607
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,430
with right yeah yeah and more fun to
watch so those are all different things

608
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:31,440
watch so those are all different things
 

609
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,530
watch so those are all different things
fun to play with and fun to watch yeah

610
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:33,540
fun to play with and fun to watch yeah
 

611
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,170
fun to play with and fun to watch yeah
and I think you know I've I've heard uh

612
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:36,180
and I think you know I've I've heard uh
 

613
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,030
and I think you know I've I've heard uh
talks from like game designers and and

614
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,040
talks from like game designers and and
 

615
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,470
talks from like game designers and and
they say like you know people that work

616
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:39,480
they say like you know people that work
 

617
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,870
they say like you know people that work
on AI for actual recreational games that

618
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:41,880
on AI for actual recreational games that
 

619
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,030
on AI for actual recreational games that
people play and they say yeah there's a

620
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:44,040
people play and they say yeah there's a
 

621
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,470
people play and they say yeah there's a
big difference between trying to make an

622
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:45,480
big difference between trying to make an
 

623
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,910
big difference between trying to make an
area that actually wins and you know you

624
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:46,920
area that actually wins and you know you
 

625
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,069
area that actually wins and you know you
look at a game like Civilization

626
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:49,079
look at a game like Civilization
 

627
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,610
look at a game like Civilization
um the way that the AIS play is not

628
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:51,620
um the way that the AIS play is not
 

629
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,870
um the way that the AIS play is not
optimal for trying to win they're

630
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:53,880
optimal for trying to win they're
 

631
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,069
optimal for trying to win they're
they're playing a different game they're

632
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:55,079
they're playing a different game they're
 

633
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,269
they're playing a different game they're
trying to have personalities they're

634
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:56,279

NPCs there the AI that governs that
 

655
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:18,769
NPCs there the AI that governs that
whole game is very interesting but the

656
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:18,779
whole game is very interesting but the
 

657
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,590
whole game is very interesting but the
NPCs also are super interesting and

658

NPCs also are super interesting and
 

659
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,990
NPCs also are super interesting and
considering what language models might

660
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:24,000
considering what language models might
 

661
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,009
considering what language models might
do to NPCs in an open world RPG

662
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:28,019
do to NPCs in an open world RPG
 

663
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,630
do to NPCs in an open world RPG
role-playing game

664
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:29,640
role-playing game
 

665
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,750
role-playing game
it's super exciting yeah honestly I'm I

666
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:32,760
it's super exciting yeah honestly I'm I
 

667
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,829
it's super exciting yeah honestly I'm I
think this is like one of the first

668
00:11:33,829 --> 00:11:33,839
think this is like one of the first
 

669
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,910
think this is like one of the first
applications where we're going to see

670
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:34,920
applications where we're going to see
 

671
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,610
applications where we're going to see
like real consumer interaction with

672
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:37,620
like real consumer interaction with
 

673
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,410
like real consumer interaction with
large language models

674
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:39,420
large language models
 

675
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:42,050
large language models
um I guess what sky um Elder Scrolls 6

676
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:42,060
um I guess what sky um Elder Scrolls 6
 

677
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,130
um I guess what sky um Elder Scrolls 6
is in development now they're probably

678
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:43,140
is in development now they're probably
 

679
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,290
is in development now they're probably
like pretty close to finishing it but I

680
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,300
like pretty close to finishing it but I
 

681
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,210
like pretty close to finishing it but I
would not be surprised at all if Elder

682
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,220
would not be surprised at all if Elder
 

683
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,009
would not be surprised at all if Elder

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
not saying anything this is me
 

691
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,930
not saying anything this is me
speculating not you no but but there's

692
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:56,940
speculating not you no but but there's
 

693
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,970
speculating not you no but but there's
they're just releasing the star feel

694
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:58,980
they're just releasing the star feel
 

695
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,130
they're just releasing the star feel
good they do one game at a time yeah and

696
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:01,140
good they do one game at a time yeah and
 

697
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,069
good they do one game at a time yeah and
so uh whatever it is whenever the date

698
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
so uh whatever it is whenever the date
 

699
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,990
so uh whatever it is whenever the date
is I don't know what the data is calm

700
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:06,000
is I don't know what the data is calm
 

701
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,210
is I don't know what the data is calm
down uh but it would be I don't know

702
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:08,220
down uh but it would be I don't know
 

703
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,110
down uh but it would be I don't know
like uh 20 24 25 26 so it's actually

704
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:12,120
like uh 20 24 25 26 so it's actually
 

705
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,370
like uh 20 24 25 26 so it's actually
very possible they would include

706
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,380
very possible they would include
 

707
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,130
very possible they would include
language models I was listening to this

708
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:16,140
language models I was listening to this
 

709
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:19,250
language models I was listening to this
um this talk by a gaming executive uh

710
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:19,260
um this talk by a gaming executive uh
 

711
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,630
um this talk by a gaming executive uh
when I was in grad school

712
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:20,640
when I was in grad school
 

713
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,449
when I was in grad school
and one of the questions that a person

714
00:12:23,449 --> 00:12:23,459
and one of the questions that a person
 

715
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,250
and one of the questions that a person
in the audience asked is why are all

716
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,260
in the audience asked is why are all
 

717
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,810
in the audience asked is why are all
these games so focused on fighting and

718
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:26,820
these games so focused on fighting and
 

719
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,810
these games so focused on fighting and
killing and the person responded that

720
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:29,820
killing and the person responded that
 

721
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,610
killing and the person responded that
it's just so much harder to make an AI

722
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:31,620
it's just so much harder to make an AI
 

723
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,710
it's just so much harder to make an AI
that can talk with you and cooperate

724
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:33,720
that can talk with you and cooperate
 

725
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,150
that can talk with you and cooperate
with you than it is to make an AI that

726
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,160
with you than it is to make an AI that
 

727
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,470
with you than it is to make an AI that
can fight you

728
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:36,480
can fight you
 

729
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,870
can fight you
and I think once this technology

730
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
and I think once this technology
 

731
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,490
and I think once this technology
develops further and you can have a you

732
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:40,500
develops further and you can have a you
 

733
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,990
develops further and you can have a you
can reach a point where like not every

734
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
can reach a point where like not every
 

735
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,190
can reach a point where like not every
single line of dialogue has to be

736
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
single line of dialogue has to be
 

737
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,410
single line of dialogue has to be
scripted it unlocks a lot of potential

738
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:45,420
scripted it unlocks a lot of potential
 

739
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,030
scripted it unlocks a lot of potential
for new kinds of games like much more

740
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
for new kinds of games like much more
 

741
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,610
for new kinds of games like much more
like positive interactions that are not

742
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:49,620
like positive interactions that are not
 

743
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,690
like positive interactions that are not
so focused on fighting and I'm really

744
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:50,700
so focused on fighting and I'm really
 

745
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,370
so focused on fighting and I'm really
looking forward to that well it might

746
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:52,380
looking forward to that well it might
 

747
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,430
looking forward to that well it might
not be positive it might be just drama

748
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:54,440
not be positive it might be just drama
 

749
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,629
not be positive it might be just drama
you'll be in like a Call of Duty game

750
00:12:56,629 --> 00:12:56,639
you'll be in like a Call of Duty game
 

751
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,009
you'll be in like a Call of Duty game
instead of doing the shooting you'll

752
00:12:58,009 --> 00:12:58,019
instead of doing the shooting you'll
 

753
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,050
instead of doing the shooting you'll
just be hanging out and like arguing

754
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,060
just be hanging out and like arguing
 

755
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,569
just be hanging out and like arguing
with an AI about like

756
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:02,579
with an AI about like
 

757
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:04,190
with an AI about like
um like passive aggressive and then you

758
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:04,200
um like passive aggressive and then you
 

759
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,449
um like passive aggressive and then you
won't be able to sleep that night you

760
00:13:05,449 --> 00:13:05,459
won't be able to sleep that night you
 

761
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,210
won't be able to sleep that night you
have to return or continue the argument

762
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:07,220
have to return or continue the argument
 

763
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,410
have to return or continue the argument
that you were uh emotionally hurt uh

764
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:12,420
that you were uh emotionally hurt uh
 

765
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,269
that you were uh emotionally hurt uh
I mean yeah I think that's actually an

766
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:14,279
I mean yeah I think that's actually an
 

767
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,370
I mean yeah I think that's actually an
exciting World whatever whatever is the

768
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:16,380
exciting World whatever whatever is the
 

769
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,050
exciting World whatever whatever is the
drama the chaos that we love the push

770
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,060
drama the chaos that we love the push
 

771
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,850
drama the chaos that we love the push
and pull of human connection I think

772
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:19,860
and pull of human connection I think
 

773
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,050
and pull of human connection I think
it's possible to do that in the video

774
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:21,060
it's possible to do that in the video
 

775
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,509
it's possible to do that in the video
game world and I think you could be

776
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
game world and I think you could be
 

777
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,670
game world and I think you could be
Messier and make more mistakes in the

778
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:25,680
Messier and make more mistakes in the
 

779
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,170
Messier and make more mistakes in the
Video Game World which is why it would

780
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:27,180
Video Game World which is why it would
 

781
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,170
Video Game World which is why it would
be a nice place and and also it doesn't

782
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:30,180
be a nice place and and also it doesn't
 

783
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,350
be a nice place and and also it doesn't
have a deep of a as deep of a real

784
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:33,360
have a deep of a as deep of a real
 

785
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,910
have a deep of a as deep of a real
psychological impact because inside

786
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:34,920
psychological impact because inside
 

787
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,370
psychological impact because inside
video games it's kind of understood that

788
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:37,380
video games it's kind of understood that
 

789
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,889
video games it's kind of understood that
you're in a not a real world so whatever

790
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:39,899
you're in a not a real world so whatever
 

791
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,650
you're in a not a real world so whatever
crazy stuff AI does we have some

792
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:42,660
crazy stuff AI does we have some
 

793
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,569
crazy stuff AI does we have some
flexibility to play just like with the

794
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:44,579
flexibility to play just like with the
 

795
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,790
flexibility to play just like with the
game of diplomacy it's a game this is

796
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
game of diplomacy it's a game this is
 

797
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,310
game of diplomacy it's a game this is
not real geopolitics not real war it's a

798
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:49,320
not real geopolitics not real war it's a
 

799
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,290
not real geopolitics not real war it's a
it's a game so you could you can have a

800
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:51,300
it's a game so you could you can have a
 

801
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,810
it's a game so you could you can have a
little bit of fun a little bit of chaos

802
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:53,820
little bit of fun a little bit of chaos
 

803
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,050
little bit of fun a little bit of chaos
okay back to Natural uh how do we find

804
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,060
okay back to Natural uh how do we find
 

805
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,970
okay back to Natural uh how do we find
the Nash equilibrium

806
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:58,980
the Nash equilibrium
 

807
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,769
the Nash equilibrium
all right so there's different ways to

808
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:00,779
all right so there's different ways to
 

809
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,530
all right so there's different ways to
find an ash equilibrium so um

810
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:03,540
find an ash equilibrium so um
 

811
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,210
find an ash equilibrium so um
the way that we do it is with this

812
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:05,220
the way that we do it is with this
 

813
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,129
the way that we do it is with this
process called self-play

814
00:14:07,129 --> 00:14:07,139
process called self-play
 

815
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,650
process called self-play
um basically we have this algorithm that

816
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:09,660
um basically we have this algorithm that
 

817
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,110
um basically we have this algorithm that
starts by playing totally randomly and

818
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:12,120
starts by playing totally randomly and
 

819
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,030
starts by playing totally randomly and
it learns how to play the game by

820
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,040
it learns how to play the game by
 

821
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,590
it learns how to play the game by
playing against itself

822
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
playing against itself
 

823
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,210
playing against itself
so

824
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:17,220
so
 

825
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,889
so
um it will start playing the game

826
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:18,899
um it will start playing the game
 

827
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,449
um it will start playing the game
totally randomly and then it you know if

828
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:20,459
totally randomly and then it you know if
 

829
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,310
totally randomly and then it you know if
it's playing poker it'll eventually like

830
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:22,320
it's playing poker it'll eventually like
 

831
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,350
it's playing poker it'll eventually like
get to the end of the end of the game

832
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:24,360
get to the end of the end of the game
 

833
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,090
get to the end of the end of the game
and make fifty dollars

834
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:26,100
and make fifty dollars
 

835
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,009
and make fifty dollars
and then it will like review all the

836
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:28,019
and then it will like review all the
 

837
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,050
and then it will like review all the
decisions that it made along the way and

838
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,060
decisions that it made along the way and
 

839
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,970
decisions that it made along the way and
say what would have happened if I had

840
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:31,980
say what would have happened if I had
 

841
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,190
say what would have happened if I had
chosen this other action instead you

842
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,200
chosen this other action instead you
 

843
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,569
chosen this other action instead you
know if I had raised here instead of

844
00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:35,579
know if I had raised here instead of
 

845
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:36,769
know if I had raised here instead of
called

846
00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:36,779
called
 

847
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,030
called
um what would the other player have done

848
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,040
um what would the other player have done
 

849
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,829
um what would the other player have done
and because it's playing against a copy

850
00:14:39,829 --> 00:14:39,839
and because it's playing against a copy
 

851
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,210
and because it's playing against a copy
of itself it's able to do that

852
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:41,220
of itself it's able to do that
 

853
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,310
of itself it's able to do that
counterfactual reasoning so they can say

854
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:43,320
counterfactual reasoning so they can say
 

855
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,650
counterfactual reasoning so they can say
okay well if I took this action and the

856
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:45,660
okay well if I took this action and the
 

857
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,850
okay well if I took this action and the
other person takes this action and then

858
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:46,860
other person takes this action and then
 

859
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,009
other person takes this action and then
I take this action and eventually I make

860
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:49,019
I take this action and eventually I make
 

861
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:51,350
I take this action and eventually I make
150 instead of 50.

862
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
150 instead of 50.
 

863
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,069
150 instead of 50.
and so it updates the regret value for

864
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:55,079
and so it updates the regret value for
 

865
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:56,030
and so it updates the regret value for
that action

866
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
that action
 

867
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,710
that action
regret is basically like how much does

868
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:57,720
regret is basically like how much does
 

869
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,150
regret is basically like how much does
it regret having not played that action

870
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,160
it regret having not played that action
 

871
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,410
it regret having not played that action
in the past

872
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:00,420
in the past
 

873
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,569
in the past
and when it encounters that same

874
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:02,579
and when it encounters that same
 

875
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,490
and when it encounters that same
situation again it's going to pick

876
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:04,500
situation again it's going to pick
 

877
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,990
situation again it's going to pick
actions that have higher regret with

878
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
actions that have higher regret with
 

879
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,550
actions that have higher regret with
higher probability

880
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,560
higher probability
 

881
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,930
higher probability
now

882
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:08,940
now
 

883
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,670
now
it'll just keep simulating the games

884
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:10,680
it'll just keep simulating the games
 

885
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,110
it'll just keep simulating the games
this way it'll keep um you know

886
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
this way it'll keep um you know
 

887
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,189
this way it'll keep um you know
accumulating regrets for different

00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
accumulating regrets for different
 

889
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,990
accumulating regrets for different

situations
 

891
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,509
situations
um and in the long run if you pick

892
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:17,519
um and in the long run if you pick
 

893
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,829
um and in the long run if you pick
actions that have higher regret with

894
00:15:18,829 --> 00:15:18,839
actions that have higher regret with
 

895
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,210
actions that have higher regret with
higher probability in the correct way

for chess it's true for poker it's
 

909
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,189
for chess it's true for poker it's
particularly useful for poker so this is

910
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:34,199
particularly useful for poker so this is
 

911
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:35,870
particularly useful for poker so this is

to arrive in an optimal set of actions
 

925
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,730
to arrive in an optimal set of actions
so this counterfactual regret

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,990
of in my brain the word self-play has
mapped in you all networks but we're

954
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
mapped in you all networks but we're
 

955
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,430
mapped in you all networks but we're
speaking something bigger than just

956
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:19,440
speaking something bigger than just
 

957
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,910
speaking something bigger than just
neural networks it could be anything

958
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
neural networks it could be anything
 

959
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,769
neural networks it could be anything
the self-play mechanism is just the

960
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:24,779
the self-play mechanism is just the
 

961
00:16:24,779 --> 00:16:26,150
the self-play mechanism is just the
mechanism of a system playing itself

962
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:26,160
mechanism of a system playing itself
 

963
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,949
mechanism of a system playing itself
exactly yeah self-play is not tied

964
00:16:27,949 --> 00:16:27,959
exactly yeah self-play is not tied
 

965
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,750
exactly yeah self-play is not tied
specifically to neural Nets it's it's a

966
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:29,760
specifically to neural Nets it's it's a
 

967
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,430
specifically to neural Nets it's it's a
kind of reinforcement learning basically

968
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
kind of reinforcement learning basically
 

969
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,250
kind of reinforcement learning basically
okay and I would also say this process

970
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:34,260
okay and I would also say this process
 

971
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,350
okay and I would also say this process
of like trying to reason oh what would

972
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:36,360
of like trying to reason oh what would
 

973
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,970
of like trying to reason oh what would
the value have been if I had taken this

974
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:37,980
the value have been if I had taken this
 

975
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,949
the value have been if I had taken this
other action instead this is very

976
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:39,959
other action instead this is very
 

977
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,329
other action instead this is very
similar to how humans learn to play a

978
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:41,339
similar to how humans learn to play a
 

979
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,370
similar to how humans learn to play a
game like poker right like you probably

980
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:43,380
game like poker right like you probably
 

981
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,110
game like poker right like you probably
played poker before and with your

982
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
played poker before and with your
 

983
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,910
played poker before and with your
friends you probably asked like oh what

984
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:46,920
friends you probably asked like oh what
 

985
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,949
friends you probably asked like oh what
do you have called me if I raised there

986
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:48,959
do you have called me if I raised there
 

987
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,870
do you have called me if I raised there
you know and that's that's a person

988
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:50,880
you know and that's that's a person
 

989
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,189
you know and that's that's a person
trying to do the same kind of like

990
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:52,199
trying to do the same kind of like
 

991
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:53,689
trying to do the same kind of like
learning from a counter factual that the

992
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:53,699
learning from a counter factual that the
 

993
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:56,150
learning from a counter factual that the
AI is doing okay and if you do that at

994
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160
AI is doing okay and if you do that at
 

995
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,009
AI is doing okay and if you do that at
scale you're going to be able to learn

996
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:58,019
scale you're going to be able to learn
 

997
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:00,769
scale you're going to be able to learn
an optimal policy yeah now where the

998
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:00,779
an optimal policy yeah now where the
 

999
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,930
an optimal policy yeah now where the
neural nets come in I said like okay if

1000
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:02,940
neural nets come in I said like okay if
 

1001
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,390
neural nets come in I said like okay if
it's in that situation again then it

1002
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:05,400
it's in that situation again then it
 

1003
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,949
it's in that situation again then it
will choose the action that has high

1004
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
will choose the action that has high
 

1005
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,990
will choose the action that has high
regret now the problem is that poker is

1006
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:09,000
regret now the problem is that poker is
 

1007
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,569
regret now the problem is that poker is
such a huge game you know I think no

1008
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:11,579
such a huge game you know I think no
 

1009
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:13,010
such a huge game you know I think no
limit Texas Hold'em the version that we

1010
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,020
limit Texas Hold'em the version that we
 

1011
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,929
limit Texas Hold'em the version that we
were playing has 10 to the 161 different

1012
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:14,939
were playing has 10 to the 161 different
 

1013
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:16,610
were playing has 10 to the 161 different
decision points which is more than the

1014
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:16,620
decision points which is more than the
 

1015
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,169
decision points which is more than the
number of atoms in the universe squared

1016
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:18,179
number of atoms in the universe squared
 

1017
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,510
number of atoms in the universe squared
that's heads up that's heads up yeah 10

1018
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:20,520
that's heads up that's heads up yeah 10
 

1019
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,250
that's heads up that's heads up yeah 10
to the 161 you said yeah I mean it

1020
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:22,260
to the 161 you said yeah I mean it
 

1021
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,329
to the 161 you said yeah I mean it
depends on the number of chips that you

1022
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:23,339
depends on the number of chips that you
 

1023
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,590
depends on the number of chips that you
have the stacks and everything but like

1024
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:24,600
have the stacks and everything but like
 

1025
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,970
have the stacks and everything but like
the version that we were playing was

1026
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:25,980
the version that we were playing was
 

1027
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,010
the version that we were playing was
tense to the 161. which I assume would

1028
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,020
tense to the 161. which I assume would
 

1029
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,289
tense to the 161. which I assume would
be a somewhat simplified version anyway

1030
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:30,299
be a somewhat simplified version anyway
 

1031
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,950
be a somewhat simplified version anyway
because the about there's some like step

1032
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:33,960
because the about there's some like step
 

1033
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,529
because the about there's some like step
function you had for like bets oh no no

1034
00:17:36,529 --> 00:17:36,539
function you had for like bets oh no no
 

1035
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,210
function you had for like bets oh no no
that's that's I'm saying like we played

1036
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:38,220
that's that's I'm saying like we played
 

1037
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,289
that's that's I'm saying like we played
the the full game you can bet whatever

1038
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:39,299
the the full game you can bet whatever
 

1039
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,730
the the full game you can bet whatever
amount you want another thought maybe

1040
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:40,740
amount you want another thought maybe
 

1041
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,169
amount you want another thought maybe
was constrained in like what it

1042
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:42,179
was constrained in like what it
 

1043
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,970
was constrained in like what it
considered for bed sizes but the the

1044
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:43,980
considered for bed sizes but the the
 

1045
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,990
considered for bed sizes but the the
person on the other side could bet

1046
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,000
person on the other side could bet
 

1047
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,750
person on the other side could bet
whatever they wanted yeah I mean 161

1048
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:47,760
whatever they wanted yeah I mean 161
 

1049
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,289
whatever they wanted yeah I mean 161
plus or minus 10 doesn't matter yeah

1050
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:51,299
plus or minus 10 doesn't matter yeah
 

1051
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,690
plus or minus 10 doesn't matter yeah
um and so the way neural Nets help out

1052
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:53,700
um and so the way neural Nets help out
 

1053
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,970
um and so the way neural Nets help out
here is you know you don't have to run

1054
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:55,980
here is you know you don't have to run
 

1055
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,289
here is you know you don't have to run
into the same exact situation because

1056
00:17:57,289 --> 00:17:57,299
into the same exact situation because
 

1057
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,430
into the same exact situation because
that's never going to happen again the

1058
00:17:58,430 --> 00:17:58,440
that's never going to happen again the
 

1059
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,810
that's never going to happen again the
odds of you running into the same exact

1060
00:17:59,810 --> 00:17:59,820
odds of you running into the same exact
 

1061
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,970
odds of you running into the same exact
situation are pretty slim but if you run

1062
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:01,980
situation are pretty slim but if you run
 

1063
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,650
situation are pretty slim but if you run
into a similar situation then you can

1064
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:03,660
into a similar situation then you can
 

1065
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,450
into a similar situation then you can
generalize from other states that you've

1066
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,460
generalize from other states that you've
 

1067
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,770
generalize from other states that you've
been in that kind of look like that one

1068
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:06,780
been in that kind of look like that one
 

1069
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,630
been in that kind of look like that one
and you can say like well these other

1070
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
and you can say like well these other
 

1071
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,130
and you can say like well these other
situations I had high regret for this

1072
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:10,140
situations I had high regret for this
 

1073
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,450
situations I had high regret for this
action and so maybe I should play that

1074
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
action and so maybe I should play that
 

1075
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,669
action and so maybe I should play that
action here as well which is the more

1076
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:13,679
action here as well which is the more
 

1077
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,169
action here as well which is the more
complex game chess or poker or go or

1078
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:18,179
complex game chess or poker or go or
 

1079
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:20,029
complex game chess or poker or go or
poker do you know that is a

1080
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:20,039
poker do you know that is a
 

1081
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,250
poker do you know that is a
controversial question okay um I'm gonna

1082
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:22,260
controversial question okay um I'm gonna
 

1083
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,750
controversial question okay um I'm gonna
it's like somebody screaming on Reddit

1084
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
it's like somebody screaming on Reddit
 

1085
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,430
it's like somebody screaming on Reddit
right now it depends on which subreddit

1086
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
right now it depends on which subreddit
 

1087
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,470
right now it depends on which subreddit
you're on is it chess or is it poker I'm

1088
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:27,480
you're on is it chess or is it poker I'm
 

1089
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,730
you're on is it chess or is it poker I'm
sure like David Silver's gonna get

1090
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:28,740
sure like David Silver's gonna get
 

1091
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,830
sure like David Silver's gonna get
really angry at me yeah I'll say I'm

1092
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:30,840
really angry at me yeah I'll say I'm
 

1093
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,330
really angry at me yeah I'll say I'm
gonna say poker actually and I think for

1094
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:32,340
gonna say poker actually and I think for
 

1095
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,890
gonna say poker actually and I think for
a couple reasons

1096
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:33,900
a couple reasons
 

1097
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,110
a couple reasons
um they're not here to defend themselves

1098
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,120
um they're not here to defend themselves
 

1099
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,630
um they're not here to defend themselves
so first of all you have the imperfect

1100
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:38,640
so first of all you have the imperfect
 

1101
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,010
so first of all you have the imperfect
information aspect and so it's um it we

1102
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,020
information aspect and so it's um it we
 

1103
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,450
information aspect and so it's um it we
can go into that but like once you

1104
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:44,460
can go into that but like once you
 

1105
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,789
can go into that but like once you
introduce imperfect information uh

1106
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
introduce imperfect information uh
 

1107
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,549
introduce imperfect information uh
things get much more complicated so we

1108
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:49,559
things get much more complicated so we
 

1109
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:50,810
things get much more complicated so we
should say

1110
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:50,820
should say
 

1111
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,870
should say
maybe you can describe what is seen to

1112
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:53,880
maybe you can describe what is seen to
 

1113
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,930
maybe you can describe what is seen to
the players what is not seen uh in the

1114
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:56,940
the players what is not seen uh in the
 

1115
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,610
the players what is not seen uh in the
game of Texas Hold'em yeah so Texas

1116
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:58,620
game of Texas Hold'em yeah so Texas
 

1117
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,549
game of Texas Hold'em yeah so Texas
Hold'em you get two cards face down that

1118
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:01,559
Hold'em you get two cards face down that
 

1119
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:03,049
Hold'em you get two cards face down that
only you see

1120
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:03,059
only you see
 

1121
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,250
only you see
um and so that's the hidden information

1122
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:04,260
um and so that's the hidden information
 

1123
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,690
um and so that's the hidden information
of the game the other players also all

1124
00:19:05,690 --> 00:19:05,700
of the game the other players also all
 

1125
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,250
of the game the other players also all
get two cards face down that only they

1126
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:07,260
get two cards face down that only they
 

1127
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,390
get two cards face down that only they
see

1128
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:08,400
see
 

1129
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,830
see
um and so you have to kind of as you're

1130
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:09,840
um and so you have to kind of as you're
 

1131
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,630
um and so you have to kind of as you're
playing reason about like okay what do

1132
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:11,640
playing reason about like okay what do
 

1133
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,029
playing reason about like okay what do
they think I have what do they have what

1134
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:14,039
they think I have what do they have what
 

1135
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:15,830
they think I have what do they have what
do they think I think they have that

1136
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:15,840
do they think I think they have that
 

1137
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,570
do they think I think they have that
kind of stuff and

1138
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:17,580
kind of stuff and
 

1139
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,250
kind of stuff and
um that's that's kind of where bluffing

1140
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:19,260
um that's that's kind of where bluffing
 

1141
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,169
um that's that's kind of where bluffing
comes into play right because the fact

1142
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:21,179
comes into play right because the fact
 

1143
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,450
comes into play right because the fact
that you can Bluff the fact that you can

1144
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:23,460
that you can Bluff the fact that you can
 

1145
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,029
that you can Bluff the fact that you can
bet with a bad hand and still win is

1146
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:26,039
bet with a bad hand and still win is
 

1147
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,230
bet with a bad hand and still win is
because they don't know what your cards

1148
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:27,240
because they don't know what your cards
 

1149
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,450
because they don't know what your cards
are right and that's the that's the key

1150
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:29,460
are right and that's the that's the key
 

1151
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,650
are right and that's the that's the key
difference between a perfect information

1152
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:30,660
difference between a perfect information
 

1153
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,870
difference between a perfect information
game like poker uh sorry like chess and

1154
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:32,880
game like poker uh sorry like chess and
 

1155
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,130
game like poker uh sorry like chess and
go

1156
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:34,140
go
 

1157
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,510
go
um and imprint information games like

1158
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
um and imprint information games like
 

1159
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,770
um and imprint information games like
poker this is what trash talk looks like

1160
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:39,780
poker this is what trash talk looks like
 

1161
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,830
poker this is what trash talk looks like
the implied statement is the game I

1162
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:42,840
the implied statement is the game I
 

1163
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,310
the implied statement is the game I
solved is much tougher uh but yeah so uh

1164
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:46,320
solved is much tougher uh but yeah so uh
 

1165
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,630
solved is much tougher uh but yeah so uh
when you're playing I'm just gonna do

1166
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:47,640
when you're playing I'm just gonna do
 

1167
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,549
when you're playing I'm just gonna do
random questions here so what when

1168
00:19:49,549 --> 00:19:49,559
random questions here so what when
 

1169
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,049
random questions here so what when
you're playing your opponent

1170
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:51,059
you're playing your opponent
 

1171
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,350
you're playing your opponent
under imperfect information

1172
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,360
under imperfect information
 

1173
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,789
under imperfect information
is there some degree to which you're

1174
00:19:55,789 --> 00:19:55,799
is there some degree to which you're
 

1175
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,950
is there some degree to which you're
trying to estimate the range of hands

1176
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:57,960
trying to estimate the range of hands
 

1177
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,990
trying to estimate the range of hands
that they have

1178
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,000
that they have
 

1179
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,669
that they have
or is that not part of the algorithm so

1180
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
or is that not part of the algorithm so
 

1181
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,950
or is that not part of the algorithm so
how what are the different approaches to

1182
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:03,960
how what are the different approaches to
 

1183
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:07,730
how what are the different approaches to
the imperfect information game so the

1184
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:07,740
the imperfect information game so the
 

1185
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,110
the imperfect information game so the
key thing to understand about why in

1186
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
key thing to understand about why in
 

1187
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,250
key thing to understand about why in
perfect information makes things

1188
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,260
perfect information makes things
 

1189
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:12,830
perfect information makes things
difficult is that you have to worry not

1190
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:12,840
difficult is that you have to worry not
 

1191
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,169
difficult is that you have to worry not
just about which actions to play but the

1192
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:15,179
just about which actions to play but the
 

1193
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,130
just about which actions to play but the
probability that you're going to play

1194
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,140
probability that you're going to play
 

1195
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,270
probability that you're going to play
those actions

1196
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
those actions
 

1197
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,970
those actions
so you think about

1198
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:19,980
so you think about
 

1199
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,529
so you think about
um rock paper scissors for example rock

1200
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:21,539
um rock paper scissors for example rock
 

1201
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:22,669
um rock paper scissors for example rock
paper scissors is an imperfect

1202
00:20:22,669 --> 00:20:22,679
paper scissors is an imperfect
 

1203
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,289
paper scissors is an imperfect
information game

1204
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:24,299
information game
 

1205
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,090
information game
um right because you don't know what I'm

1206
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,100
um right because you don't know what I'm
 

1207
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,130
um right because you don't know what I'm
about to throw I do but yeah usually not

1208
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:28,140
about to throw I do but yeah usually not
 

1209
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,350
about to throw I do but yeah usually not
yeah yeah and so you can't just say like

1210
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:30,360
yeah yeah and so you can't just say like
 

1211
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,610
yeah yeah and so you can't just say like
I'm just gonna throw a rock every single

1212
00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:31,620
I'm just gonna throw a rock every single
 

1213
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,350
I'm just gonna throw a rock every single
time because the other person is going

1214
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:33,360
time because the other person is going
 

1215
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,270
time because the other person is going
to figure that out and notice a pattern

1216
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:35,280
to figure that out and notice a pattern
 

1217
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,350
to figure that out and notice a pattern
and then suddenly you're going to start

1218
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,360
and then suddenly you're going to start
 

1219
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,330
and then suddenly you're going to start
losing and so you don't just have to

1220
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:38,340
losing and so you don't just have to
 

1221
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,830
losing and so you don't just have to
figure out like which action to play you

1222
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:39,840
figure out like which action to play you
 

1223
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,970
figure out like which action to play you
have to figure out the probability that

1224
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:40,980
have to figure out the probability that
 

1225
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,390
have to figure out the probability that
you play it and really importantly the

1226
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
you play it and really importantly the
 

1227
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,130
you play it and really importantly the
value of an action depends on the

1228
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:46,140
value of an action depends on the
 

1229
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,150
value of an action depends on the
probability that you're going to play it

1230
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:47,160
probability that you're going to play it
 

1231
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,029
probability that you're going to play it
so if you're playing Rock every single

1232
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:50,039
so if you're playing Rock every single
 

1233
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:52,610
so if you're playing Rock every single
time that value is really low but if

1234
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:52,620
time that value is really low but if
 

1235
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,190
time that value is really low but if
you're never playing rock you play Rock

1236
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:55,200
you're never playing rock you play Rock
 

1237
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,150
you're never playing rock you play Rock
like one percent of the time then

1238
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,160
like one percent of the time then
 

1239
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,950
like one percent of the time then
suddenly the the other person's probably

1240
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:57,960
suddenly the the other person's probably
 

1241
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,409
suddenly the the other person's probably
gonna be throwing scissors and when you

1242
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:00,419
gonna be throwing scissors and when you
 

1243
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,730
gonna be throwing scissors and when you
throw rock the value of that action is

1244
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:01,740
throw rock the value of that action is
 

1245
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,110
throw rock the value of that action is
going to be really high

1246
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
going to be really high
 

1247
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,029
going to be really high
now you take that to Poker what that

1248
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
now you take that to Poker what that
 

1249
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,409
now you take that to Poker what that
means is

1250
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:06,419
means is
 

1251
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,409
means is
the value of bluffing for example if

1252
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:09,419
the value of bluffing for example if
 

1253
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,310
the value of bluffing for example if
you're the kind of person that never

1254
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:10,320
you're the kind of person that never
 

1255
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,690
you're the kind of person that never
Bluffs and you have this reputation as

1256
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:11,700
Bluffs and you have this reputation as
 

1257
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,789
Bluffs and you have this reputation as
somebody that never Bluffs and suddenly

1258
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:13,799
somebody that never Bluffs and suddenly
 

1259
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,409
somebody that never Bluffs and suddenly
you Bluff there's a really good chance

1260
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:15,419
you Bluff there's a really good chance
 

1261
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,730
you Bluff there's a really good chance
that that bluff is going to work and

1262
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:16,740
that that bluff is going to work and
 

1263
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,409
that that bluff is going to work and
you're gonna make a lot of money on the

1264
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:18,419
you're gonna make a lot of money on the
 

1265
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:19,789
you're gonna make a lot of money on the
other hand if you've got a reputation

1266
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:19,799
other hand if you've got a reputation
 

1267
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,169
other hand if you've got a reputation
like if they seen you play for a long

1268
00:21:21,169 --> 00:21:21,179
like if they seen you play for a long
 

1269
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:22,490
like if they seen you play for a long
time and they see oh you're the kind of

1270
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:22,500
time and they see oh you're the kind of
 

1271
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,529
time and they see oh you're the kind of
person that's bluffing all the time

1272
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:24,539
person that's bluffing all the time
 

1273
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:25,970
person that's bluffing all the time
when you Bluff they're not going to buy

1274
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:25,980
when you Bluff they're not going to buy
 

1275
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,990
when you Bluff they're not going to buy
it and they're going to call you down

1276
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,000
it and they're going to call you down
 

1277
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,789
it and they're going to call you down
you're going to lose a lot of money

1278
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
you're going to lose a lot of money
 

1279
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,850
you're going to lose a lot of money
and that finding that balance of how

1280
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:31,860
and that finding that balance of how
 

1281
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,210
and that finding that balance of how
often you should be bluffing is uh the

1282
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:35,220
often you should be bluffing is uh the
 

1283
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,070
often you should be bluffing is uh the
key challenge of a game of poker

1284
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:37,080
key challenge of a game of poker
 

1285
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,529
key challenge of a game of poker
and um you contrast that with a game

1286
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:39,539
and um you contrast that with a game
 

1287
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:40,909
and um you contrast that with a game
like chess

1288
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:40,919
like chess
 

1289
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:42,770
like chess
it doesn't matter if you're opening with

1290
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:42,780
it doesn't matter if you're opening with
 

1291
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,110
it doesn't matter if you're opening with
the Queen's Gambit 10 of the time or 100

1292
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
the Queen's Gambit 10 of the time or 100
 

1293
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,510
the Queen's Gambit 10 of the time or 100
of the time the value the expected value

1294
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:47,520
of the time the value the expected value
 

1295
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,370
of the time the value the expected value
is the same

1296
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:49,380
is the same
 

1297
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,190
is the same
so um so that's that's why we need these

1298
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:52,200
so um so that's that's why we need these
 

1299
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,610
so um so that's that's why we need these
algorithms that understand not just we

1300
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:55,620
algorithms that understand not just we
 

1301
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,750
algorithms that understand not just we
have to figure out what actions are good

1302
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:56,760
have to figure out what actions are good
 

1303
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,250
have to figure out what actions are good
but the probabilities we need to get the

1304
00:21:58,250 --> 00:21:58,260
but the probabilities we need to get the
 

1305
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,930
but the probabilities we need to get the
exact probabilities correct and that's

1306
00:21:59,930 --> 00:21:59,940
exact probabilities correct and that's
 

1307
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,130
exact probabilities correct and that's
actually when we created the bot

1308
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,140
actually when we created the bot
 

1309
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,890
actually when we created the bot
labradus libratus means balanced because

bluff
 

1323
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,990
bluff
is that a is that a good crude

poker it's a good simplification I think

1328
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:22,500
poker it's a good simplification I think
 

1329
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,770
poker it's a good simplification I think
that's like the main tension but it's

1330
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:24,780
that's like the main tension but it's
 

1331
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,350
that's like the main tension but it's
it's not just how often the bluff or not

1332
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
it's not just how often the bluff or not
 

1333
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,970
it's not just how often the bluff or not
to Bluff it's like how often should you

1334
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:28,980
to Bluff it's like how often should you
 

1335
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,250
to Bluff it's like how often should you
bet in general how often should you what

1336
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:31,260
bet in general how often should you what
 

1337
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,230
bet in general how often should you what
what kind of bet should you make

1338
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:33,240
what kind of bet should you make
 

1339
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,549
what kind of bet should you make
um should you bet big or should you bet

1340
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:34,559
um should you bet big or should you bet
 

1341
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,970
um should you bet big or should you bet
small and with which with which hands uh

1342
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:37,980
small and with which with which hands uh
 

1343
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,710
small and with which with which hands uh
and so this is where the idea of a range

1344
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:39,720
and so this is where the idea of a range
 

1345
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,350
and so this is where the idea of a range
comes from because when you are bluffing

1346
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:42,360
comes from because when you are bluffing
 

1347
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,730
comes from because when you are bluffing
with a particular hand in a particular

1348
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:43,740
with a particular hand in a particular
 

1349
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,690
with a particular hand in a particular
spot

1350
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:44,700
spot
 

1351
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,490
spot
you don't want there to be a pattern for

1352
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,500
you don't want there to be a pattern for
 

1353
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,870
you don't want there to be a pattern for
the other person to pick up on you don't

1354
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:47,880
the other person to pick up on you don't
 

1355
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,549
the other person to pick up on you don't
want them to figure out oh whenever this

1356
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:49,559
want them to figure out oh whenever this
 

1357
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:51,169
want them to figure out oh whenever this
person is in this spot they're always

1358
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:51,179
person is in this spot they're always
 

1359
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,210
person is in this spot they're always
bluffing and so you have to reason about

1360
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,220
bluffing and so you have to reason about
 

1361
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:56,810
bluffing and so you have to reason about
okay would I also bet with a good hand

1362
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:56,820
okay would I also bet with a good hand
 

1363
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,010
okay would I also bet with a good hand
in this spot

1364
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,020
in this spot
 

1365
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,169
in this spot
you want to be unpredictable so you have

1366
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:00,179
you want to be unpredictable so you have
 

1367
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,630
you want to be unpredictable so you have
to think about what would I do if I had

1368
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:02,640
to think about what would I do if I had
 

1369
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,990
to think about what would I do if I had
this different set of cards is there

1370
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:05,000
this different set of cards is there
 

1371
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,149
this different set of cards is there
explicit estimation of like a theory of

1372
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:08,159
explicit estimation of like a theory of
 

1373
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,830
explicit estimation of like a theory of
mind that the other person has about you

1374
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:09,840
mind that the other person has about you
 

1375
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,590
mind that the other person has about you
or is that just a emergent thing that

1376
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:12,600
or is that just a emergent thing that
 

1377
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,270
or is that just a emergent thing that
happens

1378
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,280
happens
 

1379
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:17,690

the way that the Bots handle it that are

1380
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:17,700
the way that the Bots handle it that are
 

1381
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,190
the way that the Bots handle it that are
really successful they have an explicit

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:19,200
really successful they have an explicit
 

1383
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,570
really successful they have an explicit
theory of mine so they're explicitly

1384
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,580
theory of mine so they're explicitly
 

1385
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,409
theory of mine so they're explicitly
reasoning about what are what's the

1386
00:23:24,409 --> 00:23:24,419
reasoning about what are what's the
 

1387
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,450
reasoning about what are what's the

1388
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:26,460
common knowledge belief what does what
 

1389
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,190
common knowledge belief what does what
do you think I have what do I think you

1390
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:28,200
do you think I have what do I think you
 

1391
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,130
do you think I have what do I think you
have what do you think I think you have

00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,140
have what do you think I think you have
 

1393
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,690
have what do you think I think you have
um it's explicitly reasoning about that

1394
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:32,700
um it's explicitly reasoning about that
 

1395
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,450
um it's explicitly reasoning about that
is there multiple U's there so

1396
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:35,460
is there multiple U's there so
 

1397
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,130
is there multiple U's there so
maybe that's jumping ahead to six

1398
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:37,140
maybe that's jumping ahead to six
 

1399
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,710
maybe that's jumping ahead to six
players but is there a stickiness to the

1400
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:39,720
players but is there a stickiness to the
 

1401
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,990
players but is there a stickiness to the
person to so it's an iterative game

1402
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,000
person to so it's an iterative game
 

1403
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,990
person to so it's an iterative game
you're playing the same person

00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,000
you're playing the same person
 

1405
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,270
you're playing the same person
there is there's a stickiness to that

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,130
what kind of player I'm facing here
that's a good question so

1418
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:01,140
that's a good question so
 

1419
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,169
that's a good question so
you could approach the game that way the

1420
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,179
you could approach the game that way the
 

1421
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,149
you could approach the game that way the
way that the Bots do it they don't and

1422
00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:05,159
way that the Bots do it they don't and
 

1423
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,770
way that the Bots do it they don't and
the way that humans approach it also

1424
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:06,780
the way that humans approach it also
 

1425
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,450
the way that humans approach it also
expert human players the way they

1426
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:08,460
expert human players the way they
 

1427
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,029
expert human players the way they
approach it is to basically assume that

1428
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
approach it is to basically assume that
 

1429
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,570
approach it is to basically assume that
you know my strategy so

1430
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:14,580
you know my strategy so
 

1431
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,490
you know my strategy so
I'm going to try to pick a strategy

1432
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:16,500
I'm going to try to pick a strategy
 

1433
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,110
I'm going to try to pick a strategy
where even if I were to play it for 10

1434
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,120
where even if I were to play it for 10
 

1435
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,130
where even if I were to play it for 10
000 hands and you could figure out

1436
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:19,140
000 hands and you could figure out
 

1437
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,750
000 hands and you could figure out
exactly what it was you still wouldn't

1438
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:20,760
exactly what it was you still wouldn't
 

1439
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,190
exactly what it was you still wouldn't
be able to beat it basically what that

1440
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,200
be able to beat it basically what that
 

1441
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,450
be able to beat it basically what that
means is I'm trying to approximate the

1442
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:23,460
means is I'm trying to approximate the
 

1443
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,950
means is I'm trying to approximate the
Nash equilibrium I'm trying to be

1444
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:24,960
Nash equilibrium I'm trying to be
 

1445
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,570
Nash equilibrium I'm trying to be
perfectly balanced because if if I'm

1446
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:26,580
perfectly balanced because if if I'm
 

1447
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,370
perfectly balanced because if if I'm
playing the national equilibrium even if

1448
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:28,380
playing the national equilibrium even if
 

1449
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,190
playing the national equilibrium even if
you know what my strategy is like I said

1450
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:31,200
you know what my strategy is like I said
 

1451
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,470
you know what my strategy is like I said
I'm still unbeatable in expectation so

1452
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,480
I'm still unbeatable in expectation so
 

1453
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,149
I'm still unbeatable in expectation so
so that's what that's what the bot aims

1454
00:24:35,149 --> 00:24:35,159
so that's what that's what the bot aims
 

1455
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,010
so that's what that's what the bot aims
for and that's actually what a lot of

1456
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,020
for and that's actually what a lot of
 

1457
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,990
for and that's actually what a lot of
expert poker players aim for as well to

1458
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:39,000
expert poker players aim for as well to
 

1459
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,850
expert poker players aim for as well to
start by playing the Nash equilibrium

1460
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:40,860
start by playing the Nash equilibrium
 

1461
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,529
start by playing the Nash equilibrium
and then maybe if they spot weaknesses

1462
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:42,539
and then maybe if they spot weaknesses
 

1463
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,090
and then maybe if they spot weaknesses
in the way you're playing then they can

1464
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,100
in the way you're playing then they can
 

1465
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,590
in the way you're playing then they can
deviate a little bit to take advantage

1466
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
deviate a little bit to take advantage
 

1467
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,690
deviate a little bit to take advantage
of that

1468
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:46,700
of that
 

1469
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,490
of that
they aim to be unbeatable in expectation

1470
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:49,500
they aim to be unbeatable in expectation
 

1471
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,510
they aim to be unbeatable in expectation
okay

1472
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:50,520
okay
 

1473
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,549
okay
so who's the greatest poker player of

1474
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:52,559
so who's the greatest poker player of
 

1475
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,529
so who's the greatest poker player of
all time and why is it Phil Hellmuth so

1476
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:54,539
all time and why is it Phil Hellmuth so
 

1477
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,070
all time and why is it Phil Hellmuth so
this is for Phil uh so he's known

1478
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:58,080
this is for Phil uh so he's known
 

1479
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,090
this is for Phil uh so he's known
um

1480
00:24:59,090 --> 00:24:59,100
um
 

1481
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,549
um
at least in part for maybe playing

1482
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:01,559
at least in part for maybe playing
 

1483
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,430
at least in part for maybe playing
sub-optimally and he still wins a lot

1484
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:04,440
sub-optimally and he still wins a lot
 

1485
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,549
sub-optimally and he still wins a lot
it's a bit chaotic so maybe

1486
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:07,559
it's a bit chaotic so maybe
 

1487
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,890
it's a bit chaotic so maybe
can you speak from an AI perspective

1488
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:09,900
can you speak from an AI perspective
 

1489
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,710
can you speak from an AI perspective
about the genius of his Madness or The

1490
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:12,720
about the genius of his Madness or The
 

1491
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,330
about the genius of his Madness or The
Madness of his genius

1492
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:14,340
Madness of his genius
 

1493
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,950
Madness of his genius
so playing sub optimally playing

1494
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:15,960
so playing sub optimally playing
 

1495
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,250
so playing sub optimally playing
chaotically

1496
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:19,260

 

1497
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,890

um as a way to make it hard to pin down

1498
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:21,900
um as a way to make it hard to pin down
 

1499
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,310
um as a way to make it hard to pin down
about what your strategy is so okay the

1500
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
about what your strategy is so okay the
 

1501
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,450
about what your strategy is so okay the
thing that I should explain first of all

1502
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:26,460
thing that I should explain first of all
 

1503
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,909
thing that I should explain first of all
was like Nash equilibrium it doesn't

1504
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:28,919
was like Nash equilibrium it doesn't
 

1505
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,409
was like Nash equilibrium it doesn't
mean that it's predictable the whole

1506
00:25:30,409 --> 00:25:30,419
mean that it's predictable the whole
 

1507
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:31,610
mean that it's predictable the whole
point of it is that you're trying to be

1508
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:31,620
point of it is that you're trying to be
 

1509
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,669
point of it is that you're trying to be
unpredictable now I think when somebody

1510
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:34,679
unpredictable now I think when somebody
 

1511
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,990
unpredictable now I think when somebody
like Phil Hellmuth might be really

1512
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
like Phil Hellmuth might be really
 

1513
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,450
like Phil Hellmuth might be really
successful is not in being unpredictable

1514
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:38,460
successful is not in being unpredictable
 

1515
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,730
successful is not in being unpredictable
but in being able to

1516
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:40,740
but in being able to
 

1517
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,070
but in being able to
um take advantage of the other player

1518
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,080
um take advantage of the other player
 

1519
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,450
um take advantage of the other player
and figure out where they're being

1520
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:44,460
and figure out where they're being
 

1521
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,529
and figure out where they're being
predictable

1522
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:45,539
predictable
 

1523
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:48,289
predictable
or guiding the other player into

1524
00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:48,299
or guiding the other player into
 

1525
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:50,390
or guiding the other player into
thinking that you have certain

1526
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:50,400
thinking that you have certain
 

1527
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,310
thinking that you have certain
weaknesses and then and then

1528
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:52,320
weaknesses and then and then
 

1529
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,269
weaknesses and then and then
understanding how they're going to

1530
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
understanding how they're going to
 

1531
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,590
understanding how they're going to
change their behavior they're going to

1532
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:54,600
change their behavior they're going to
 

1533
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,230
change their behavior they're going to
deviate from a Nash equilibrium style of

1534
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:57,240
deviate from a Nash equilibrium style of
 

1535
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,789
deviate from a Nash equilibrium style of
play to try to take advantage of those

1536
00:25:58,789 --> 00:25:58,799
play to try to take advantage of those
 

1537
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,049
play to try to take advantage of those
perceived weaknesses and then counter

1538
00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:00,059
perceived weaknesses and then counter
 

1539
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,730
perceived weaknesses and then counter
exploit them so you kind of get into the

1540
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:01,740
exploit them so you kind of get into the
 

1541
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,529
exploit them so you kind of get into the
Mind Games there so you think about

1542
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:03,539
Mind Games there so you think about
 

1543
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:06,169
Mind Games there so you think about
these heads up poker as a dance between

1544
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:06,179
these heads up poker as a dance between
 

1545
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,630
these heads up poker as a dance between
two agents I guess are you playing the

1546
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:08,640
two agents I guess are you playing the
 

1547
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,789
two agents I guess are you playing the
cards are you playing the the player so

1548
00:26:10,789 --> 00:26:10,799
cards are you playing the the player so
 

1549
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,490
cards are you playing the the player so
this this gets down to a big argument in

1550
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:13,500
this this gets down to a big argument in
 

1551
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,230
this this gets down to a big argument in
the poker community and the academic

1552
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,240
the poker community and the academic
 

1553
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,669
the poker community and the academic
Community for a long time there was this

1554
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:16,679
Community for a long time there was this
 

1555
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:19,370
Community for a long time there was this
debate of like what's called GTO Game

1556
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:19,380
debate of like what's called GTO Game
 

1557
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,649
debate of like what's called GTO Game
Theory optimal poker or exploitative

1558
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:21,659
Theory optimal poker or exploitative
 

1559
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:22,669
Theory optimal poker or exploitative
play

1560
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:22,679
play
 

1561
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:26,210
play
and um up until about like 2017 when we

1562
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:26,220
and um up until about like 2017 when we
 

1563
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,830
and um up until about like 2017 when we
did the broadest match I think actually

1564
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
did the broadest match I think actually
 

1565
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,930
did the broadest match I think actually
exploitative play had the advantage a

1566
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:29,940
exploitative play had the advantage a
 

1567
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,610
exploitative play had the advantage a
lot of people were saying like oh this

1568
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:31,620
lot of people were saying like oh this
 

1569
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,169
lot of people were saying like oh this
whole idea of Game Theory it's just

1570
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:33,179
whole idea of Game Theory it's just
 

1571
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:34,909
whole idea of Game Theory it's just
nonsense and if you really want to make

1572
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:34,919
nonsense and if you really want to make
 

1573
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:36,110
nonsense and if you really want to make
money you got to like look into the

1574
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,120
money you got to like look into the
 

1575
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,970
money you got to like look into the
other person's eyes and read their soul

1576
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:37,980
other person's eyes and read their soul
 

1577
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,730
other person's eyes and read their soul
and figure out what cards they have but

1578
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:40,740
and figure out what cards they have but
 

1579
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,590
and figure out what cards they have but
what happened was people started

1580
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:42,600
what happened was people started
 

1581
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,909
what happened was people started
adopting the game theory optimal

1582
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
adopting the game theory optimal
 

1583
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:45,289
adopting the game theory optimal
strategy

1584
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:45,299
strategy
 

1585
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,330
strategy
um and they were making good money and

1586
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:47,340
um and they were making good money and
 

1587
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,789
um and they were making good money and
they weren't trying to adapt so much to

1588
00:26:49,789 --> 00:26:49,799
they weren't trying to adapt so much to
 

1589
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:50,750
they weren't trying to adapt so much to
the other player they were just trying

1590
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:50,760
the other player they were just trying
 

1591
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,029
the other player they were just trying
to play the national equilibrium and

1592
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
to play the national equilibrium and
 

1593
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,409
to play the national equilibrium and
then what really solidified it I think

1594
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:54,419
then what really solidified it I think
 

1595
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,750
then what really solidified it I think
was the broadest the broadest match

1596
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:56,760
was the broadest the broadest match
 

1597
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,090
was the broadest the broadest match
where we played our bot against four top

1598
00:26:59,090 --> 00:26:59,100
where we played our bot against four top
 

1599
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,130
where we played our bot against four top
heads up no limit Hold'em poker players

1600
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,140
heads up no limit Hold'em poker players
 

1601
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,010
heads up no limit Hold'em poker players
and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to

1602
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,020
and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to
 

1603
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,570
and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to
them it wasn't trying to exploit them it

1604
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:05,580
them it wasn't trying to exploit them it
 

1605
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,610
them it wasn't trying to exploit them it
wasn't trying to do these Mind Games it

1606
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:07,620
wasn't trying to do these Mind Games it
 

1607
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,870
wasn't trying to do these Mind Games it
was just trying to approximate the Nash

1608
00:27:08,870 --> 00:27:08,880
was just trying to approximate the Nash
 

1609
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,390
was just trying to approximate the Nash
equilibrium and it crushed them

1610
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:11,400
equilibrium and it crushed them
 

1611
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,669
equilibrium and it crushed them
I think you know

1612
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:13,679
I think you know
 

1613
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,029
I think you know
it we've we're playing for 50 100 blinds

1614
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:17,039
it we've we're playing for 50 100 blinds
 

1615
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,430
it we've we're playing for 50 100 blinds
and over the course of about 120 000

1616
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:19,440
and over the course of about 120 000
 

1617
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,350
and over the course of about 120 000
hands it made close to two million

1618
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:21,360
hands it made close to two million
 

1619
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,990
hands it made close to two million
dollars 120 000 hands 120 000 hands

against humans yeah and this was this

1622
00:27:25,789 --> 00:27:25,799
against humans yeah and this was this
 

1623
00:27:25,799 --> 00:27:27,110
against humans yeah and this was this
was fake money to be clear so there was

1624
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,120
was fake money to be clear so there was
 

1625
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,549
was fake money to be clear so there was
real money at stake there was 200 000

1626
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
real money at stake there was 200 000
 

1627
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,430
real money at stake there was 200 000
first of all all money is fake but um

1628
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
first of all all money is fake but um
 

1629
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,110
first of all all money is fake but um
that's that's that's a different

that's that's that's a different

1632
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:34,679
conversation
 

1633
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,610
conversation
um we give it meaning uh it's an it's a

1634
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:37,620
um we give it meaning uh it's an it's a
 

1635
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,590
um we give it meaning uh it's an it's a
it's a phenomena that gets meaning from

1636
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:39,600
it's a phenomena that gets meaning from
 

1637
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,750
it's a phenomena that gets meaning from
our uh complex psychology as a human

1638
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:41,760
our uh complex psychology as a human
 

1639
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,370
our uh complex psychology as a human

1640
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:43,380
civilization
 

1641
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,810
civilization
um it's emerging from the collective

1642
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:44,820
um it's emerging from the collective
 

1643
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,610
um it's emerging from the collective
intelligence of the human species but

1644
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:46,620
intelligence of the human species but
 

1645
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,930
intelligence of the human species but
that's not what you mean you mean like

1646
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:47,940
that's not what you mean you mean like
 

1647
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,549
that's not what you mean you mean like
there's literally you can't you can't

1648
00:27:49,549 --> 00:27:49,559
there's literally you can't you can't
 

1649
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,590
there's literally you can't you can't
buy stuff with it okay can you actually

1650
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:51,600
buy stuff with it okay can you actually
 

1651
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,470
buy stuff with it okay can you actually
uh step back and take me through that

1652
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:54,480
uh step back and take me through that
 

1653
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,890
uh step back and take me through that
um competition yeah okay so

1654
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:57,900
um competition yeah okay so
 

1655
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,750
um competition yeah okay so
when I was in grad school

1656
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
when I was in grad school
 

1657
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,710
when I was in grad school
um there was this thing called the

1658
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:00,720
um there was this thing called the
 

1659
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,570
um there was this thing called the
annual computer poker competition where

1660
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:02,580
annual computer poker competition where
 

1661
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,430
annual computer poker competition where
every year all the different research

1662
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:04,440
every year all the different research
 

1663
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,169
every year all the different research
Labs that were working on AI for poker

1664
00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:06,179
Labs that were working on AI for poker
 

1665
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:07,789
Labs that were working on AI for poker
would get together they would make a bot

1666
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:07,799
would get together they would make a bot
 

1667
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,590
would get together they would make a bot
they would play them against each other

1668
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
they would play them against each other
 

1669
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,870
they would play them against each other
uh and we made a bot that actually won

1670
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:11,880
uh and we made a bot that actually won
 

1671
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,870
uh and we made a bot that actually won
the um 2014 competition the 2016

1672
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:14,880
the um 2014 competition the 2016
 

1673
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,570
the um 2014 competition the 2016
competition uh and so we decided we're

1674
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:17,580
competition uh and so we decided we're
 

1675
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,570
competition uh and so we decided we're
gonna take this bot build on it and play

1676
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:20,580
gonna take this bot build on it and play
 

1677
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,850
gonna take this bot build on it and play
against Real top professional heads up

1678
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:22,860
against Real top professional heads up
 

1679
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,950
against Real top professional heads up
no limit Texas hold 'em poker players

1680
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
no limit Texas hold 'em poker players
 

1681
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,269
no limit Texas hold 'em poker players
so we invited four of the world's best

1682
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:28,279
so we invited four of the world's best
 

1683
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:31,370
so we invited four of the world's best
players in this specialty and we

1684
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,380
players in this specialty and we
 

1685
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,350
players in this specialty and we
challenge them to 120 000 hands of poker

1686
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:33,360
challenge them to 120 000 hands of poker
 

1687
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:36,169
challenge them to 120 000 hands of poker
over the course of 20 days

1688
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:36,179
over the course of 20 days
 

1689
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,350
over the course of 20 days
um and we had 200 000 200 000 in prize

1690
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:39,360
um and we had 200 000 200 000 in prize
 

1691
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,029
um and we had 200 000 200 000 in prize
money at stake where it would basically

1692
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:41,039
money at stake where it would basically
 

1693
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,710
money at stake where it would basically
be divided among them depending on how

1694
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
be divided among them depending on how
 

1695
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,510
be divided among them depending on how
well they did relative to each other

1696
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:44,520
well they did relative to each other
 

1697
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,190
well they did relative to each other
so we wanted to have some incentive for

1698
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:46,200
so we wanted to have some incentive for
 

1699
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,690
so we wanted to have some incentive for
them to play their best

1700
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,700
them to play their best
 

1701
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,870
them to play their best
did you have a confidence

1702
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:49,880
did you have a confidence
 

1703
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,850
did you have a confidence
2014-16 that this is even possible how

1704
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:52,860
2014-16 that this is even possible how
 

1705
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,250
2014-16 that this is even possible how
much doubt was there so and we did a

1706
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:55,260
much doubt was there so and we did a
 

1707
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,049
much doubt was there so and we did a
competition actually in 2015 where we

1708
00:28:57,049 --> 00:28:57,059
competition actually in 2015 where we
 

1709
00:28:57,059 --> 00:28:58,669
competition actually in 2015 where we
also played against professional poker

1710
00:28:58,669 --> 00:28:58,679
also played against professional poker
 

1711
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,710
also played against professional poker
players and the bot lost by by a pretty

1712
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:00,720
players and the bot lost by by a pretty
 

1713
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,289
players and the bot lost by by a pretty
sizable margin actually now there were

1714
00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:03,299
sizable margin actually now there were
 

1715
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,630
sizable margin actually now there were
some big improvements from 2015 to 2017.

1716
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:05,640
some big improvements from 2015 to 2017.
 

1717
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,730
some big improvements from 2015 to 2017.
and so can you speak to the improvements

1718
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:07,740
and so can you speak to the improvements
 

1719
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,649
and so can you speak to the improvements
is it computational nature is it the

1720
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:09,659
is it computational nature is it the
 

1721
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,750
is it computational nature is it the
algorithm the the methods it was it was

1722
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:11,760
algorithm the the methods it was it was
 

1723
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,669
algorithm the the methods it was it was
really an algorithmic approach that was

1724
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:13,679
really an algorithmic approach that was
 

1725
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,610
really an algorithmic approach that was
the difference so 2015 it was much more

1726
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:16,620
the difference so 2015 it was much more
 

1727
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,029
the difference so 2015 it was much more
focused on trying to come up with a

1728
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:20,039
focused on trying to come up with a
 

1729
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,889
focused on trying to come up with a
strategy up front like trying to solve

1730
00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:21,899
strategy up front like trying to solve
 

1731
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,930
strategy up front like trying to solve
the entire game of poker like and then

1732
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:23,940
the entire game of poker like and then
 

1733
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,789
the entire game of poker like and then
just have a lookup table where you're

1734
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:25,799
just have a lookup table where you're
 

1735
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,110
just have a lookup table where you're
saying like oh I'm in this situation

1736
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,120
saying like oh I'm in this situation
 

1737
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,450
saying like oh I'm in this situation
what's the strategy

1738
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:29,460
what's the strategy
 

1739
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,310
what's the strategy
um the approach that we took in 2017 was

1740
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:31,320
um the approach that we took in 2017 was
 

1741
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,769
um the approach that we took in 2017 was
much more search based it was trying to

1742
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:33,779
much more search based it was trying to
 

1743
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:36,830
much more search based it was trying to
say okay well let me in real time try to

1744
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:36,840
say okay well let me in real time try to
 

1745
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,350
say okay well let me in real time try to
compute a much better strategy than what

1746
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
compute a much better strategy than what
 

1747
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,630
compute a much better strategy than what
I had pre-computed by playing against

1748
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:41,640
I had pre-computed by playing against
 

1749
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,490
I had pre-computed by playing against
myself during self-play what is the

1750
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:43,500
myself during self-play what is the
 

1751
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,769
myself during self-play what is the
search space for

1752
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:45,779
search space for
 

1753
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:49,669
search space for
poker what are you searching over

1754
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
poker what are you searching over
 

1755
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,289
poker what are you searching over
what's that look like there's different

1756
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:51,299
what's that look like there's different
 

1757
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:54,409
what's that look like there's different
actions like raising calling yeah what

1758
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:54,419
actions like raising calling yeah what
 

1759
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,930
actions like raising calling yeah what
are the actions

1760
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:56,940
are the actions
 

1761
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,110
are the actions
um is it just a search over actions so

1762
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:00,120
um is it just a search over actions so
 

1763
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,570
um is it just a search over actions so
in a game like chess the the search is

1764
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:02,580
in a game like chess the the search is
 

1765
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,210
in a game like chess the the search is
like okay I'm in this chess position and

1766
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:05,220
like okay I'm in this chess position and
 

1767
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,590
like okay I'm in this chess position and
I can like you know move these different

1768
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:06,600
I can like you know move these different
 

1769
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,630
I can like you know move these different
pieces and see where things end up in

1770
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:08,640
pieces and see where things end up in
 

1771
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,090
pieces and see where things end up in
poker what you're searching over is the

1772
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,100
poker what you're searching over is the
 

1773
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,250
poker what you're searching over is the
actions you can take for your hand the

1774
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:13,260
actions you can take for your hand the
 

1775
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,330
actions you can take for your hand the
probabilities that you take those

1776
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:14,340
probabilities that you take those
 

1777
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,130
probabilities that you take those
actions and then also the probabilities

1778
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:16,140
actions and then also the probabilities
 

1779
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,630
actions and then also the probabilities
that you take other actions with other

1780
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:17,640
that you take other actions with other
 

1781
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,210
that you take other actions with other
hands that you might have

1782
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:20,220
hands that you might have
 

1783
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,490
hands that you might have
um and and that's kind of like a hard to

1784
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:22,500
um and and that's kind of like a hard to
 

1785
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,750
um and and that's kind of like a hard to
wrap your head around like why are you

1786
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
wrap your head around like why are you
 

1787
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,330
wrap your head around like why are you
searching over these like other hands

1788
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:26,340
searching over these like other hands
 

1789
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,310
searching over these like other hands
that you might have and like trying to

1790
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:28,320
that you might have and like trying to
 

1791
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,210
that you might have and like trying to
figure out what you would do with those

1792
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:29,220
figure out what you would do with those
 

1793
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,470
figure out what you would do with those
hands

1794
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:30,480
hands
 

1795
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,510
hands
um and the idea is is again you you

1796
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:32,520
um and the idea is is again you you
 

1797
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,409
um and the idea is is again you you
wanna

1798
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:33,419
wanna
 

1799
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,690
wanna
you wanna always be balanced and

1800
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:35,700
you wanna always be balanced and
 

1801
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,909
you wanna always be balanced and
unpredictable and so if you're a search

1802
00:30:37,909 --> 00:30:37,919
unpredictable and so if you're a search
 

1803
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,950
unpredictable and so if you're a search
algorithm that's saying like oh I want

1804
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:39,960
algorithm that's saying like oh I want
 

1805
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,590
algorithm that's saying like oh I want
to raise with this hand well in order to

1806
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:42,600
to raise with this hand well in order to
 

1807
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,850
to raise with this hand well in order to
know whether that's a good action like

1808
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:43,860
know whether that's a good action like
 

1809
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,930
know whether that's a good action like
let's say it's a bluff you know let's

1810
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:44,940
let's say it's a bluff you know let's
 

1811
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,889
let's say it's a bluff you know let's
say you have a bad hand and you're

1812
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:45,899
say you have a bad hand and you're
 

1813
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:47,690
say you have a bad hand and you're
saying like oh I I think I should be

1814
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:47,700
saying like oh I I think I should be
 

1815
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,250
saying like oh I I think I should be
betting here with this really bad hand

1816
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,260
betting here with this really bad hand
 

1817
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,590
betting here with this really bad hand
and bluffing well that all that's only a

1818
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:51,600
and bluffing well that all that's only a
 

1819
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,510
and bluffing well that all that's only a
good action if you're also

1820
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:53,520
good action if you're also
 

1821
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,850
good action if you're also
betting with a strong hand otherwise

1822
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:55,860
betting with a strong hand otherwise
 

1823
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,190
betting with a strong hand otherwise
it's an obvious Bluff so if your action

1824
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:58,200
it's an obvious Bluff so if your action
 

1825
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,669
it's an obvious Bluff so if your action
in some sense maximizes your

1826
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:00,679
in some sense maximizes your
 

1827
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:03,230
in some sense maximizes your
unpredictability so that action could be

1828
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,240
unpredictability so that action could be
 

1829
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,850
unpredictability so that action could be
mapped by your opponent to a lot of

1830
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:04,860
mapped by your opponent to a lot of
 

1831
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,289
mapped by your opponent to a lot of
different hands then that's a good

1832
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:06,299
different hands then that's a good
 

1833
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,750
different hands then that's a good
action basically what you want to do is

1834
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:08,760
action basically what you want to do is
 

1835
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,510
action basically what you want to do is
put your opponent into a tough spot so

1836
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:11,520
put your opponent into a tough spot so
 

1837
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,610
put your opponent into a tough spot so
you want them to always have some doubt

1838
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:13,620
you want them to always have some doubt
 

1839
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,289
you want them to always have some doubt
like should I call here should I fold

1840
00:31:15,289 --> 00:31:15,299
like should I call here should I fold
 

1841
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:18,289
like should I call here should I fold
here and if you are raising in the

1842
00:31:18,289 --> 00:31:18,299
here and if you are raising in the
 

1843
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:19,850
here and if you are raising in the
appropriate balance between Bluffs and

1844
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:19,860
appropriate balance between Bluffs and
 

1845
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,289
appropriate balance between Bluffs and
good hands then you're putting them into

1846
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:21,299
good hands then you're putting them into
 

1847
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:22,490
good hands then you're putting them into
that tough spot and so that's what we're

1848
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:22,500
that tough spot and so that's what we're
 

1849
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,510
that tough spot and so that's what we're
trying to do we're always trying to

1850
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:23,520
trying to do we're always trying to
 

1851
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,370
trying to do we're always trying to
search for a strategy that would put the

1852
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:25,380
search for a strategy that would put the
 

1853
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,289
search for a strategy that would put the
opponent into a difficult position can

1854
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:27,299
opponent into a difficult position can
 

1855
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:29,570
opponent into a difficult position can
you give a metric that you're trying to

1856
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:29,580
you give a metric that you're trying to
 

1857
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,370
you give a metric that you're trying to
maximize or minimize does this have to

1858
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:31,380
maximize or minimize does this have to
 

1859
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,510
maximize or minimize does this have to
do with the regret thing what we're

1860
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:32,520
do with the regret thing what we're
 

1861
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,090
do with the regret thing what we're
talking about in terms of putting your

1862
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:35,100
talking about in terms of putting your
 

1863
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,669
talking about in terms of putting your
opponent in a maximally tough spot yeah

1864
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
opponent in a maximally tough spot yeah
 

1865
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:38,690
opponent in a maximally tough spot yeah
ultimately what you're trying to

1866
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:38,700
ultimately what you're trying to
 

1867
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,850
ultimately what you're trying to
maximize is your expected winnings like

1868
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:40,860
maximize is your expected winnings like
 

1869
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,409
maximize is your expected winnings like
your expected value the amount of money

1870
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:42,419
your expected value the amount of money
 

1871
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:43,370
your expected value the amount of money
that you're going to walk away from

1872
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:43,380
that you're going to walk away from
 

1873
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,830
that you're going to walk away from
assuming that your opponent was playing

1874
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
assuming that your opponent was playing
 

1875
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,289
assuming that your opponent was playing
optimally in response so you're going to

1876
00:31:48,289 --> 00:31:48,299
optimally in response so you're going to
 

1877
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,049
optimally in response so you're going to
assume that your opponent is is also

1878
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:51,059
assume that your opponent is is also
 

1879
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,450
assume that your opponent is is also
playing um like as as well as possible

1880
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:53,460
playing um like as as well as possible
 

1881
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,789
playing um like as as well as possible
Nash equilibrium approach because if

1882
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:55,799
Nash equilibrium approach because if
 

1883
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,590
Nash equilibrium approach because if
they're not then you're just going to

1884
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
they're not then you're just going to
 

1885
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,870
they're not then you're just going to
make more money right like anything that

1886
00:31:59,870 --> 00:31:59,880
make more money right like anything that
 

1887
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,669
make more money right like anything that
deviates like by definition the national

1888
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:01,679
deviates like by definition the national
 

1889
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,610
deviates like by definition the national
equilibrium is the strategy that does

1890
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:04,620
equilibrium is the strategy that does
 

1891
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,010
equilibrium is the strategy that does
the best in expectation and so if you're

1892
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,020
the best in expectation and so if you're
 

1893
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,389
the best in expectation and so if you're
deviating from that then you're just

1894
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:08,399
deviating from that then you're just
 

1895
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:09,889
deviating from that then you're just
they're going to lose money and since

1896
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:09,899
they're going to lose money and since
 

1897
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,389
they're going to lose money and since
it's a two player zero-sum game that

1898
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:11,399
it's a two player zero-sum game that
 

1899
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:12,889
it's a two player zero-sum game that
means you're gonna make money so there's

1900
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:12,899
means you're gonna make money so there's
 

1901
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:15,230
means you're gonna make money so there's
not an explicit like objective function

1902
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:15,240
not an explicit like objective function
 

1903
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,169
not an explicit like objective function
that maximizes the toughness of the spot

1904
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:18,179
that maximizes the toughness of the spot
 

1905
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,210
that maximizes the toughness of the spot
they're put in you're always

1906
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:20,220
they're put in you're always
 

1907
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,130
they're put in you're always
this is not from like a self-play

1908
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:22,140
this is not from like a self-play
 

1909
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,630
this is not from like a self-play
reinforcement learning perspective

1910
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:23,640
reinforcement learning perspective
 

1911
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,789
reinforcement learning perspective
you're just trying to maximize winnings

1912
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:25,799
you're just trying to maximize winnings
 

1913
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,190
you're just trying to maximize winnings
and the rest is implicit that's right

1914
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:28,200
and the rest is implicit that's right
 

1915
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,750
and the rest is implicit that's right
yeah so we're what we're actually trying

1916
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:29,760
yeah so we're what we're actually trying
 

1917
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,149
yeah so we're what we're actually trying
to maximize is the expected value given

1918
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:32,159
to maximize is the expected value given
 

1919
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,409
to maximize is the expected value given
that the opponent is playing optimally

1920
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:33,419
that the opponent is playing optimally
 

1921
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,510
that the opponent is playing optimally
in response to us now in practice what

1922
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:35,520
in response to us now in practice what
 

1923
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,490
in response to us now in practice what
that ends up looking like is it's

1924
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:37,500
that ends up looking like is it's
 

1925
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:38,930
that ends up looking like is it's
putting the opponent into difficult

1926
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:38,940
putting the opponent into difficult
 

1927
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,909
putting the opponent into difficult
situations where there's no obvious

1928
00:32:40,909 --> 00:32:40,919
situations where there's no obvious
 

1929
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,769
situations where there's no obvious
decision to be made so the the system

1930
00:32:42,769 --> 00:32:42,779
decision to be made so the the system
 

1931
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,750
decision to be made so the the system
doesn't know anything about the

1932
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:44,760
doesn't know anything about the
 

1933
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,850
doesn't know anything about the
difficulty of the situation not at all

1934
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:46,860
difficulty of the situation not at all
 

1935
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,230
difficulty of the situation not at all
it doesn't care okay yeah all right my

1936
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,240
it doesn't care okay yeah all right my
 

1937
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,269
it doesn't care okay yeah all right my
head was getting excited whenever I was

1938
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:50,279
head was getting excited whenever I was
 

1939
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:51,830
head was getting excited whenever I was
making the other the opponent's sweat

1940
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:51,840
making the other the opponent's sweat
 

1941
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,169
making the other the opponent's sweat
okay so you're in 2015 you didn't do as

1942
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:54,179
okay so you're in 2015 you didn't do as
 

1943
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,649
okay so you're in 2015 you didn't do as
well so what's the journey from that to

1944
00:32:57,649 --> 00:32:57,659
well so what's the journey from that to
 

1945
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,630
well so what's the journey from that to
a system that in your mind could have a

1946
00:32:59,630 --> 00:32:59,640
a system that in your mind could have a
 

1947
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:03,470
a system that in your mind could have a
chance so 2015 we we got we got beat

1948
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:03,480
chance so 2015 we we got we got beat
 

1949
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,810
chance so 2015 we we got we got beat
pretty badly and we actually learned a

1950
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:05,820
pretty badly and we actually learned a
 

1951
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,130
pretty badly and we actually learned a
lot from that competition and in

1952
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:07,140
lot from that competition and in
 

1953
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:09,289
lot from that competition and in
particular you know what became clear to

1954
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:09,299
particular you know what became clear to
 

1955
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:10,909
particular you know what became clear to
me is that the way the humans were

1956
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:10,919
me is that the way the humans were
 

1957
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:12,350
me is that the way the humans were
approaching the game was very different

1958
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:12,360
approaching the game was very different
 

1959
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,330
approaching the game was very different
from how the bot was approaching the

1960
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:14,340
from how the bot was approaching the
 

1961
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,570
from how the bot was approaching the
game the bot would not be doing search

1962
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:17,580
game the bot would not be doing search
 

1963
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,370
game the bot would not be doing search
it would just be trying to compute you

1964
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:19,380
it would just be trying to compute you
 

1965
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,630
it would just be trying to compute you
know it would do like months of

1966
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
know it would do like months of
 

1967
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,889
know it would do like months of
self-play it would just be playing

1968
00:33:21,889 --> 00:33:21,899
self-play it would just be playing
 

1969
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,630
self-play it would just be playing
against itself for months but then when

1970
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:23,640
against itself for months but then when
 

1971
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,830
against itself for months but then when
it's actually playing the game it would

1972
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:24,840
it's actually playing the game it would
 

1973
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,509
it's actually playing the game it would
just act instantly

1974
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:26,519
just act instantly
 

1975
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,070
just act instantly
um and the humans when they're in a

1976
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
um and the humans when they're in a
 

1977
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,870
um and the humans when they're in a
tough spot they would sit there and

1978
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:29,880
tough spot they would sit there and
 

1979
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,450
tough spot they would sit there and
think for sometimes even like five

1980
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:32,460
think for sometimes even like five
 

1981
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,130
think for sometimes even like five
minutes about whether they're going to

1982
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:34,140
minutes about whether they're going to
 

1983
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,990
minutes about whether they're going to
call or fold a hand

1984
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:36,000
call or fold a hand
 

1985
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,169
call or fold a hand
um and it became clear to me that that's

1986
00:33:39,169 --> 00:33:39,179
um and it became clear to me that that's
 

1987
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,789
um and it became clear to me that that's
there's a good chance that that's what

1988
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:40,799
there's a good chance that that's what
 

1989
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,409
there's a good chance that that's what
that's what's missing from our bot so I

1990
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:42,419
that's what's missing from our bot so I
 

1991
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,090
that's what's missing from our bot so I
actually did some

1992
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:44,100
actually did some
 

1993
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,529
actually did some
um initial experiments to try to figure

1994
00:33:45,529 --> 00:33:45,539
um initial experiments to try to figure
 

1995
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:46,730
um initial experiments to try to figure
out how much of a difference this is

1996
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:46,740
out how much of a difference this is
 

1997
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,470
out how much of a difference this is
actually make and the difference was

1998
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:48,480
actually make and the difference was
 

1999
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,230
actually make and the difference was
huge as a signal to the human player how

2000
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:51,240
huge as a signal to the human player how
 

2001
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,970
huge as a signal to the human player how
long you took to think no no I'm not

2002
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:52,980
long you took to think no no I'm not
 

2003
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,289
long you took to think no no I'm not
saying that there were any timing tells

2004
00:33:54,289 --> 00:33:54,299
saying that there were any timing tells
 

2005
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,389
saying that there were any timing tells
I was saying when the human like the bot

2006
00:33:56,389 --> 00:33:56,399
I was saying when the human like the bot
 

2007
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:57,950
I was saying when the human like the bot
would always act instantly it wouldn't

2008
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:57,960
would always act instantly it wouldn't
 

2009
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,110
would always act instantly it wouldn't
try to come up with a better strategy in

2010
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,120
try to come up with a better strategy in
 

2011
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,549
try to come up with a better strategy in
real time

2012
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:01,559
real time
 

2013
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:03,590
real time
um over what it had precomputed during

2014
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
um over what it had precomputed during
 

2015
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,750
um over what it had precomputed during
training whereas the human like they

2016
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:05,760
training whereas the human like they
 

2017
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,130
training whereas the human like they
have all this intuition about how to

2018
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,140
have all this intuition about how to
 

2019
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,369
have all this intuition about how to
play but they're also in real time

2020
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:09,379
play but they're also in real time
 

2021
00:34:09,379 --> 00:34:12,710
play but they're also in real time
leveraging their ability to think just

2022
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:12,720
leveraging their ability to think just
 

2023
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,389

2024
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
to search to plan
 

2025
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,530
to search to plan
um and coming up with an even better

00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:15,540
um and coming up with an even better
 

2027
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,210

say so you're saying that there's you're

2030
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
say so you're saying that there's you're
 

2031
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,750
say so you're saying that there's you're
doing that's what you mean by you're

2032
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:20,760
doing that's what you mean by you're
 

2033
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,750
doing that's what you mean by you're
doing search also you have an you have a

2034
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
doing search also you have an you have a
 

2035
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,810
doing search also you have an you have a
intuition and searched on top of that

2036
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:26,820
intuition and searched on top of that
 

2037
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,909
intuition and searched on top of that
looking for a better solution yeah

2038
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:28,919
looking for a better solution yeah
 

2039
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,430
looking for a better solution yeah
that's that's what I mean by search that

2040
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
that's that's what I mean by search that
 

2041
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,290
that's that's what I mean by search that
um instead of acting instantly you know

2042
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:33,300
um instead of acting instantly you know
 

2043
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,810
um instead of acting instantly you know
a neural net usually gives you a

2044
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:35,820
a neural net usually gives you a
 

2045
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,250
a neural net usually gives you a
response in like 100 milliseconds or

2046
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:37,260
response in like 100 milliseconds or
 

2047
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,389
response in like 100 milliseconds or
something it depends on the size of the

2048
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:38,399
something it depends on the size of the
 

2049
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,849
something it depends on the size of the
of the net but if you can leverage extra

2050
00:34:40,849 --> 00:34:40,859
of the net but if you can leverage extra
 

2051
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:42,710
of the net but if you can leverage extra
computational resources

2052
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
computational resources
 

2053
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:44,930
computational resources
you can't possibly get a much better

2054
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:44,940
you can't possibly get a much better
 

2055
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,250
you can't possibly get a much better
outcome and we did some experiments in

2056
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,260
outcome and we did some experiments in
 

2057
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,010
outcome and we did some experiments in
small scale versions of Poker and what

2058
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,020
small scale versions of Poker and what
 

2059
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,369
small scale versions of Poker and what
we what we found was that if you

2060
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:55,379
we what we found was that if you
 

2061
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:57,349
we what we found was that if you
do a little bit of search even just a

2062
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:57,359
do a little bit of search even just a
 

2063
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,630
do a little bit of search even just a
little bit it was the equivalent of

2064
00:34:59,630 --> 00:34:59,640
little bit it was the equivalent of
 

2065
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,170
little bit it was the equivalent of
making your you know your pre-computed

2066
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,180
making your you know your pre-computed
 

2067
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,430
making your you know your pre-computed
strategy like you could kind of think it

2068
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:04,440
strategy like you could kind of think it
 

2069
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,870
strategy like you could kind of think it
as your neural net a thousand times

2070
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:05,880
as your neural net a thousand times
 

2071
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,829
as your neural net a thousand times
bigger

2072
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:06,839
bigger
 

2073
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,810
bigger
with just a little bit of search and it

2074
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:08,820
with just a little bit of search and it
 

2075
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,970
with just a little bit of search and it
just like blew away all of the research

2076
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:10,980
just like blew away all of the research
 

2077
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,109
just like blew away all of the research
that we had been working on and trying

2078
00:35:12,109 --> 00:35:12,119
that we had been working on and trying
 

2079
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,930
that we had been working on and trying
to like scale up this like pre-computed

2080
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:14,940
to like scale up this like pre-computed
 

2081
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,290
to like scale up this like pre-computed
solution it was dwarfed by the benefit

2082
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:18,300
solution it was dwarfed by the benefit
 

2083
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,730
solution it was dwarfed by the benefit
that we got from search

2084
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:19,740
that we got from search
 

2085
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,710
that we got from search
can you just Linger on what you mean by

2086
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:21,720
can you just Linger on what you mean by
 

2087
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,750
can you just Linger on what you mean by
search here you're searching over a

2088
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760
search here you're searching over a
 

2089
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,970
search here you're searching over a
space of actions

2090
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:25,980
space of actions
 

2091
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,329
space of actions
for your hand and for other hands how

2092
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:29,339
for your hand and for other hands how
 

2093
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:30,890
for your hand and for other hands how
are you selecting the other hands to

2094
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:30,900
are you selecting the other hands to
 

2095
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,910
are you selecting the other hands to
search over

2096
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
search over
 

2097
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,790
search over
and so yeah randomly no it's all the

2098
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:34,800
and so yeah randomly no it's all the
 

2099
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,050
and so yeah randomly no it's all the
other hands that you could have so when

2100
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,060
other hands that you could have so when
 

2101
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,370
other hands that you could have so when
you're playing No Limit taxes hold on

2102
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:37,380
you're playing No Limit taxes hold on
 

2103
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,589
you're playing No Limit taxes hold on
you've got two face down cards and so

2104
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
you've got two face down cards and so
 

2105
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:42,109
you've got two face down cards and so
that's 52 choose two one thousand three

2106
00:35:42,109 --> 00:35:42,119
that's 52 choose two one thousand three
 

2107
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:42,950
that's 52 choose two one thousand three
hundred twenty six different

2108
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:42,960
hundred twenty six different
 

2109
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,690
hundred twenty six different
combinations now that's actually a

2110
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:44,700
combinations now that's actually a
 

2111
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,530
combinations now that's actually a
little bit lower because there's

2112
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:45,540
little bit lower because there's
 

2113
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,970
little bit lower because there's
Facebook cards in the middle and so you

2114
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:46,980
Facebook cards in the middle and so you
 

2115
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,829
Facebook cards in the middle and so you
can eliminate those as well but you're

2116
00:35:48,829 --> 00:35:48,839
can eliminate those as well but you're
 

2117
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:50,089
can eliminate those as well but you're
looking at like around a thousand

2118
00:35:50,089 --> 00:35:50,099
looking at like around a thousand
 

2119
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:51,470
looking at like around a thousand
different possible hands that you can

2120
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:51,480
different possible hands that you can
 

2121
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,210
different possible hands that you can
have and so when we're doing when the

2122
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:53,220
have and so when we're doing when the
 

2123
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,190
have and so when we're doing when the
bot's doing search It's thinking

2124
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
bot's doing search It's thinking
 

2125
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,290
bot's doing search It's thinking
explicitly there are these thousand

2126
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:57,300
explicitly there are these thousand
 

2127
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,430
explicitly there are these thousand
different hands that I could have there

2128
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:58,440
different hands that I could have there
 

2129
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,510
different hands that I could have there
are these thousand different hands that

2130
00:35:59,510 --> 00:35:59,520
are these thousand different hands that
 

2131
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,470
are these thousand different hands that
you could have

2132
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:00,480
you could have
 

2133
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,450
you could have
let me try to figure out what would it

2134
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:02,460
let me try to figure out what would it
 

2135
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,950
let me try to figure out what would it
be a better strategy than what I've

2136
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:03,960
be a better strategy than what I've
 

2137
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,589
be a better strategy than what I've
pre-computed for these hands and your

2138
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:06,599
pre-computed for these hands and your
 

2139
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:07,609
pre-computed for these hands and your
hands

2140
00:36:07,609 --> 00:36:07,619
hands
 

2141
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:09,589
hands
Okay so

2142
00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:09,599
Okay so
 

2143
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,270
Okay so
that search how do you fuse that with

2144
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:14,280
that search how do you fuse that with
 

2145
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,890
that search how do you fuse that with
what the neural net is telling you or

2146
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:15,900
what the neural net is telling you or
 

2147
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,470
what the neural net is telling you or
what the the the train system is telling

2148
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
what the the the train system is telling
 

2149
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,270
what the the the train system is telling
you yeah so

2150
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:20,280
you yeah so
 

2151
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,910
you yeah so
you kind of like where the train system

2152
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:22,920
you kind of like where the train system
 

2153
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,490
you kind of like where the train system
comes in is is the value

2154
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:25,500
comes in is is the value
 

2155
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,530
comes in is is the value
um at the end so there's

2156
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:27,540
um at the end so there's
 

2157
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,230
um at the end so there's
um you only look so far ahead you look

2158
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
um you only look so far ahead you look
 

2159
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,970
um you only look so far ahead you look
like maybe you know one round ahead so

2160
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:31,980
like maybe you know one round ahead so
 

2161
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,050
like maybe you know one round ahead so
if you're on the Flop you're looking to

2162
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,060
if you're on the Flop you're looking to
 

2163
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,790
if you're on the Flop you're looking to
the start of the turn

2164
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
the start of the turn
 

2165
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,450
the start of the turn
um

2166
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:35,460
um
 

2167
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,089
um
and at that point you can use the

2168
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:38,099
and at that point you can use the
 

2169
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:40,310
and at that point you can use the
pre-computed solution to figure out what

2170
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
pre-computed solution to figure out what
 

2171
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,230
pre-computed solution to figure out what
are what's the value here of like of

2172
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
are what's the value here of like of
 

2173
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,730
are what's the value here of like of
this strategy

2174
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:43,740
this strategy
 

2175
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,069
this strategy
is it of a single action essentially in

2176
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
is it of a single action essentially in
 

2177
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,950
is it of a single action essentially in
that spot you're getting a value or is

2178
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:48,960
that spot you're getting a value or is
 

2179
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,170
that spot you're getting a value or is
it the value of the entire series of

2180
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:51,180
it the value of the entire series of
 

2181
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,510
it the value of the entire series of
actions well it's kind of both

2182
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520
actions well it's kind of both
 

2183
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,310
actions well it's kind of both
um because you're trying to maximize the

2184
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:55,320
um because you're trying to maximize the
 

2185
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,690
um because you're trying to maximize the
value for

2186
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:56,700
value for
 

2187
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,430
value for
the hand that you have but in the

2188
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:58,440
the hand that you have but in the
 

2189
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,870
the hand that you have but in the
process in order to maximize the value

2190
00:36:59,870 --> 00:36:59,880
process in order to maximize the value
 

2191
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,609
process in order to maximize the value
of the hand that you have you have to

2192
00:37:01,609 --> 00:37:01,619
of the hand that you have you have to
 

2193
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,290
of the hand that you have you have to
figure out what would I be doing with

2194
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:03,300
figure out what would I be doing with
 

2195
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,150
figure out what would I be doing with
all these other hands as well okay but

2196
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,160
all these other hands as well okay but
 

2197
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,250
all these other hands as well okay but
you are you in the search always going

2198
00:37:07,250 --> 00:37:07,260
you are you in the search always going
 

2199
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,430
you are you in the search always going
to the end of the game in liberatis we

2200
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:10,440
to the end of the game in liberatis we
 

2201
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,370
to the end of the game in liberatis we
did uh so we only use search starting on

2202
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:13,380
did uh so we only use search starting on
 

2203
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,010
did uh so we only use search starting on
the turn and then we searched all the

2204
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:16,020
the turn and then we searched all the
 

2205
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,690
the turn and then we searched all the
way to the end of the game the turn the

2206
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:17,700
way to the end of the game the turn the
 

2207
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,890
way to the end of the game the turn the
river

2208
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:18,900
river
 

2209
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,770
river
uh can we take it through the

2210
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:21,780
uh can we take it through the
 

2211
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,450
uh can we take it through the
terminology yeah there's four rounds of

2212
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,460
terminology yeah there's four rounds of
 

2213
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,490
terminology yeah there's four rounds of
Poker so there's the pre-flop the Flop

2214
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:25,500
Poker so there's the pre-flop the Flop
 

2215
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,710
Poker so there's the pre-flop the Flop
the turn and the river uh and so we

2216
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:27,720
the turn and the river uh and so we
 

2217
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:30,290
the turn and the river uh and so we
would start doing search halfway through

2218
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:30,300
would start doing search halfway through
 

2219
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,030
would start doing search halfway through
the game now the first half of the game

2220
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:32,040
the game now the first half of the game
 

2221
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,410
the game now the first half of the game
that was all pre-computed it would just

2222
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:33,420
that was all pre-computed it would just
 

2223
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,109
that was all pre-computed it would just
act instantly and then when it got to at

2224
00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:36,119
act instantly and then when it got to at
 

2225
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,790
act instantly and then when it got to at
the halfway point then it would always

2226
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:37,800
the halfway point then it would always
 

2227
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,410
the halfway point then it would always
search to the end of the game now we

2228
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:39,420
search to the end of the game now we
 

2229
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,849
search to the end of the game now we
later improved this so wouldn't have to

2230
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:40,859
later improved this so wouldn't have to
 

2231
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,870
later improved this so wouldn't have to
search all the way to the end of the

2232
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:41,880
search all the way to the end of the
 

2233
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,730
search all the way to the end of the
game it would actually search

2234
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:43,740
game it would actually search
 

2235
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,010
game it would actually search
um just a few moves ahead

2236
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:46,020
um just a few moves ahead
 

2237
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,630
um just a few moves ahead
um but that that came later and that

2238
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:47,640
um but that that came later and that
 

2239
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,550
um but that that came later and that
drastically reduced the num the amount

2240
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
drastically reduced the num the amount
 

2241
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,750
drastically reduced the num the amount
of computational resources that we

2242
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:50,760
of computational resources that we
 

2243
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,730
of computational resources that we
needed but the moves because you can

2244
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:52,740
needed but the moves because you can
 

2245
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,410
needed but the moves because you can
keep betting on top of each other that's

2246
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:54,420
keep betting on top of each other that's
 

2247
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,849
keep betting on top of each other that's
what you mean by moves so like that's

2248
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:55,859
what you mean by moves so like that's
 

2249
00:37:55,859 --> 00:37:58,670
what you mean by moves so like that's
where you don't just get one bet

2250
00:37:58,670 --> 00:37:58,680
where you don't just get one bet
 

2251
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,069
where you don't just get one bet
per Turner poker you can have multiple

2252
00:38:01,069 --> 00:38:01,079
per Turner poker you can have multiple
 

2253
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,230
per Turner poker you can have multiple
arbitrary number of bets right right I'm

2254
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:03,240
arbitrary number of bets right right I'm
 

2255
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,569
arbitrary number of bets right right I'm
trying to think like I'm gonna bet and

2256
00:38:05,569 --> 00:38:05,579
trying to think like I'm gonna bet and
 

2257
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:06,770
trying to think like I'm gonna bet and
then what are you gonna do in response

2258
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:06,780
then what are you gonna do in response
 

2259
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,910
then what are you gonna do in response
are you gonna raise me are you going to

2260
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:07,920
are you gonna raise me are you going to
 

2261
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,710
are you gonna raise me are you going to
call and then if you raise what should I

2262
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:09,720
call and then if you raise what should I
 

2263
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,109
call and then if you raise what should I
do so it's reasoning about that whole

2264
00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:12,119
do so it's reasoning about that whole
 

2265
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,510
do so it's reasoning about that whole
process up until the end of the game in

2266
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:14,520
process up until the end of the game in
 

2267
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,550
process up until the end of the game in
the case of liberatis so for liberatis

2268
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:16,560
the case of liberatis so for liberatis
 

2269
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,829
the case of liberatis so for liberatis
what's the the most number of re-racists

2270
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:18,839
what's the the most number of re-racists
 

2271
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:20,450
what's the the most number of re-racists
have you ever seen

2272
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:20,460
have you ever seen
 

2273
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,450
have you ever seen
uh you probably cap out at like five or

2274
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,460
uh you probably cap out at like five or
 

2275
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,370
uh you probably cap out at like five or
something because at that point you're

2276
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,380
something because at that point you're
 

2277
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,530
something because at that point you're
basically all in you know I mean is

2278
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:27,540
basically all in you know I mean is
 

2279
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,050
basically all in you know I mean is
there like uh interesting patterns like

2280
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:30,060
there like uh interesting patterns like
 

2281
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,970
there like uh interesting patterns like
that that you've seen that the game does

2282
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:31,980
that that you've seen that the game does
 

2283
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,530
that that you've seen that the game does
like you you'll have like Alpha zero

2284
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:33,540
like you you'll have like Alpha zero
 

2285
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,930
like you you'll have like Alpha zero
doing way more sacrifices than humans

2286
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:35,940
doing way more sacrifices than humans
 

2287
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:39,109
doing way more sacrifices than humans
usually do is there something like the

2288
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
usually do is there something like the
 

2289
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,270
usually do is there something like the
bratis was constantly re-raising or

2290
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:41,280
bratis was constantly re-raising or
 

2291
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,310
bratis was constantly re-raising or
something like that even noticed there

2292
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:43,320
something like that even noticed there
 

2293
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,210
something like that even noticed there
was there was something really

2294
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,220
was there was something really
 

2295
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,349
was there was something really
interesting that we observed with the

2296
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
interesting that we observed with the
 

2297
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,430
interesting that we observed with the
broadest

2298
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:46,440
broadest
 

2299
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,510
broadest
um so

2300
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
um so
 

2301
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,670
um so
humans when they're playing poker they

2302
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
humans when they're playing poker they
 

2303
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,770
humans when they're playing poker they
usually size their bets relative to the

2304
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:51,780
usually size their bets relative to the
 

2305
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,630
usually size their bets relative to the
size of the pot so you know if the pot

2306
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
size of the pot so you know if the pot
 

2307
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,670
size of the pot so you know if the pot
has a hundred dollars in there maybe you

2308
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:55,680
has a hundred dollars in there maybe you
 

2309
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,710
has a hundred dollars in there maybe you
bet like 75 or somewhere around there

2310
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:57,720
bet like 75 or somewhere around there
 

2311
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:00,109
bet like 75 or somewhere around there
somewhere between like 50 and 100

2312
00:39:00,109 --> 00:39:00,119
somewhere between like 50 and 100
 

2313
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:03,050
somewhere between like 50 and 100
um and with libratus we gave it the

2314
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,060
um and with libratus we gave it the
 

2315
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,730
um and with libratus we gave it the
option to basically bet whatever it

2316
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:04,740
option to basically bet whatever it
 

2317
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,190
option to basically bet whatever it
wanted it was actually really easy for

2318
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
wanted it was actually really easy for
 

2319
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,329
wanted it was actually really easy for
us to say like oh if you want you can

2320
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:08,339
us to say like oh if you want you can
 

2321
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,190
us to say like oh if you want you can
bet like 10 times the pot and we didn't

2322
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,200
bet like 10 times the pot and we didn't
 

2323
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,450
bet like 10 times the pot and we didn't
think it would actually do that it was

2324
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:11,460
think it would actually do that it was
 

2325
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,089
think it would actually do that it was
just like why not give it the option and

2326
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:14,099
just like why not give it the option and
 

2327
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:15,470
just like why not give it the option and
then during the competition it actually

2328
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:15,480
then during the competition it actually
 

2329
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,270
then during the competition it actually
started doing this and by the way this

2330
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
started doing this and by the way this
 

2331
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,770
started doing this and by the way this
is like a very last minute decision on

2332
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:18,780
is like a very last minute decision on
 

2333
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,569
is like a very last minute decision on
our part to add this option and so we

2334
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:20,579
our part to add this option and so we
 

2335
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,970
our part to add this option and so we
did not we did not think the bot would

2336
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:22,980
did not we did not think the bot would
 

2337
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,430
did not we did not think the bot would
would do this and uh I was actually kind

2338
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:25,440
would do this and uh I was actually kind
 

2339
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,630
would do this and uh I was actually kind
of worried when it did start to do this

2340
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
of worried when it did start to do this
 

2341
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,250
of worried when it did start to do this
like oh is this is a problem like humans

2342
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:28,260
like oh is this is a problem like humans
 

2343
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,710
like oh is this is a problem like humans
don't do this like is it screwing up

2344
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:30,720
don't do this like is it screwing up
 

2345
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,390
don't do this like is it screwing up
um but it would put the humans into

2346
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:32,400
um but it would put the humans into
 

2347
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,890
um but it would put the humans into
really difficult spots when it would do

2348
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:33,900
really difficult spots when it would do
 

2349
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:34,550
really difficult spots when it would do
that

2350
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:34,560
that
 

2351
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,950
that
because you know you can imagine like

2352
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:36,960
because you know you can imagine like
 

2353
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,510
because you know you can imagine like
you have the second best hand that's

2354
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:38,520
you have the second best hand that's
 

2355
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,609
you have the second best hand that's
possible given the board and you're

2356
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:40,619
possible given the board and you're
 

2357
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:41,630
possible given the board and you're
thinking like oh you're in a really

2358
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:41,640
thinking like oh you're in a really
 

2359
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,190
thinking like oh you're in a really
great spot here and suddenly the bot

2360
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
great spot here and suddenly the bot
 

2361
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,290
great spot here and suddenly the bot
bets twenty thousand dollars into a you

2362
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:45,300
bets twenty thousand dollars into a you
 

2363
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,569
bets twenty thousand dollars into a you
know a thousand dollar pot and and it's

2364
00:39:47,569 --> 00:39:47,579
know a thousand dollar pot and and it's
 

2365
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:49,370
know a thousand dollar pot and and it's
basically saying like I have the best

2366
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:49,380
basically saying like I have the best
 

2367
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,270
basically saying like I have the best
hand or I'm bluffing and you having the

2368
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
hand or I'm bluffing and you having the
 

2369
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,950
hand or I'm bluffing and you having the
second best hand like now you get a

2370
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
second best hand like now you get a
 

2371
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,410
second best hand like now you get a
really tough choice to make and so the

2372
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:57,420
really tough choice to make and so the
 

2373
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,089
really tough choice to make and so the
humans would sometimes think like five

2374
00:39:59,089 --> 00:39:59,099
humans would sometimes think like five
 

2375
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,069
humans would sometimes think like five
or ten minutes about like what do you do

2376
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:01,079
or ten minutes about like what do you do
 

2377
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:04,670
or ten minutes about like what do you do
should I call should I fold and um and

2378
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:04,680
should I call should I fold and um and
 

2379
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,690
should I call should I fold and um and
when I saw the humans like really

2380
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:05,700
when I saw the humans like really
 

2381
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,710
when I saw the humans like really
struggling with that decision like

2382
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
struggling with that decision like
 

2383
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,730
struggling with that decision like
that's when I realized like oh actually

2384
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:07,740
that's when I realized like oh actually
 

2385
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,109
that's when I realized like oh actually
this is maybe a good thing to do after

2386
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
this is maybe a good thing to do after
 

2387
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,329
this is maybe a good thing to do after
all and of course the system doesn't

2388
00:40:11,329 --> 00:40:11,339
all and of course the system doesn't
 

2389
00:40:11,339 --> 00:40:14,450
all and of course the system doesn't
know that it's making again like we said

2390
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:14,460
know that it's making again like we said
 

2391
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,670
know that it's making again like we said
that it's putting them in a tough spot

2392
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:16,680
that it's putting them in a tough spot
 

2393
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,430
that it's putting them in a tough spot
it's it's it's just that's part of the

2394
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,440
it's it's it's just that's part of the
 

2395
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,530
it's it's it's just that's part of the
optimal the game theory optimal right

2396
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:21,540
optimal the game theory optimal right
 

2397
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,210
optimal the game theory optimal right
from the Bots perspective it's just it's

2398
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,220
from the Bots perspective it's just it's
 

2399
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,530
from the Bots perspective it's just it's
just doing the thing that's going to

2400
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:24,540
just doing the thing that's going to
 

2401
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,450
just doing the thing that's going to
make it the most money

2402
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:26,460
make it the most money
 

2403
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,950
make it the most money
um and the fact that it's putting the

2404
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:27,960
um and the fact that it's putting the
 

2405
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,510
um and the fact that it's putting the
humans in a difficult spot like that's

2406
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:29,520
humans in a difficult spot like that's
 

2407
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,550
humans in a difficult spot like that's
just um you know a side effect of that

2408
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:31,560
just um you know a side effect of that
 

2409
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,150
just um you know a side effect of that
and this was I think the the one thing I

2410
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,160
and this was I think the the one thing I
 

2411
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,050
and this was I think the the one thing I
mean there were a few things that the

2412
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:36,060
mean there were a few things that the
 

2413
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,210
mean there were a few things that the
humans walked away from but this was the

2414
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:38,220
humans walked away from but this was the
 

2415
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,829
humans walked away from but this was the
the number one thing that the humans

2416
00:40:39,829 --> 00:40:39,839
the number one thing that the humans
 

2417
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,270
the number one thing that the humans
walked away from the competition saying

2418
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
walked away from the competition saying
 

2419
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,849
walked away from the competition saying
like we need to start doing this

2420
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:43,859
like we need to start doing this
 

2421
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,290
like we need to start doing this
um and now these over bats what are

2422
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:45,300
um and now these over bats what are
 

2423
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,030

was like you know excited about like
learning from these AIS

2452
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:14,280
learning from these AIS
 

2453
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,370
learning from these AIS
um so he wasn't scared he was excited he

was excited and uh and he all he
honestly he wanted to play against the

2458
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:19,920
honestly he wanted to play against the
 

2459
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,349
honestly he wanted to play against the
bot he thought he thought he had a

2460
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:21,359
bot he thought he thought he had a
 

2461
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:23,329
bot he thought he thought he had a
decent chance of beating it

2462
00:41:23,329 --> 00:41:23,339
decent chance of beating it
 

2463
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:25,130
decent chance of beating it
um I I think he's you know

2464
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:25,140
um I I think he's you know
 

2465
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,290
um I I think he's you know
this was like several years ago and I

2466
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:27,300
this was like several years ago and I
 

2467
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,109
this was like several years ago and I
think it was like not as clear to

2468
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:30,119
think it was like not as clear to
 

2469
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:31,910
think it was like not as clear to
everybody that you know the AIS were

2470
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:31,920
everybody that you know the AIS were
 

2471
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,069
everybody that you know the AIS were
taking over I think now people recognize

2472
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:34,079
taking over I think now people recognize
 

2473
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,170
taking over I think now people recognize
that like if you're playing against uh a

2474
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:36,180
that like if you're playing against uh a
 

2475
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,849
that like if you're playing against uh a
bot there's like no chance that you have

2476
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:37,859
bot there's like no chance that you have
 

2477
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,650
bot there's like no chance that you have
in a game like Pokemon so consistently

2478
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:39,660
in a game like Pokemon so consistently
 

2479
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,150
in a game like Pokemon so consistently
the Bots will win the Bots have heads up

2480
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,160
the Bots will win the Bots have heads up
 

2481
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,370
the Bots will win the Bots have heads up
and in in other variants too so multi

2482
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:46,380
and in in other variants too so multi
 

2483
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:49,670
and in in other variants too so multi
multi six player Texas Hold'em No Limit

2484
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:49,680
multi six player Texas Hold'em No Limit
 

2485
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,130
multi six player Texas Hold'em No Limit
taxes hold them as the Bots win yeah

2486
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:52,140
taxes hold them as the Bots win yeah
 

2487
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,750
taxes hold them as the Bots win yeah
that's the case so I think there's some

2488
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:53,760
that's the case so I think there's some
 

2489
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,310
that's the case so I think there's some
debate about like is it true for every

2490
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:55,320
debate about like is it true for every
 

2491
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,710
debate about like is it true for every
single variant of Poker I think I think

2492
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:57,720
single variant of Poker I think I think
 

2493
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,630
single variant of Poker I think I think
for every single variant of Poker if

2494
00:41:59,630 --> 00:41:59,640
for every single variant of Poker if
 

2495
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,190
for every single variant of Poker if
somebody really put in the effort they

2496
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:01,200
somebody really put in the effort they
 

2497
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,270
somebody really put in the effort they
can make an AI that would beat all

2498
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:02,280
can make an AI that would beat all
 

2499
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,950
can make an AI that would beat all
humans at it

2500
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:03,960
humans at it
 

2501
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,170
humans at it
um we've focused on the most popular

2502
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,180
um we've focused on the most popular
 

2503
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,150
um we've focused on the most popular
variants so heads up no limit Texas

2504
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:08,160
variants so heads up no limit Texas
 

2505
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,550
variants so heads up no limit Texas
Hold'em and then we followed it up with

2506
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:10,560
Hold'em and then we followed it up with
 

2507
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,589
Hold'em and then we followed it up with
um with uh six player poker as well

2508
00:42:12,589 --> 00:42:12,599
um with uh six player poker as well
 

2509
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:14,810
um with uh six player poker as well
where we managed to uh make a bot that

2510
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:14,820
where we managed to uh make a bot that
 

2511
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:17,089
where we managed to uh make a bot that
beat expert human players and I think

2512
00:42:17,089 --> 00:42:17,099
beat expert human players and I think
 

2513
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:19,849
beat expert human players and I think
even there now uh it's pretty clear that

2514
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:19,859
even there now uh it's pretty clear that
 

2515
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:21,349
even there now uh it's pretty clear that
humans don't stand a chance see I would

2516
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
humans don't stand a chance see I would
 

2517
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,349
humans don't stand a chance see I would
love to hook up an AI system that looks

2518
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:24,359
love to hook up an AI system that looks
 

2519
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:25,670
love to hook up an AI system that looks
at EEG

2520
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:25,680
at EEG
 

2521
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,730
at EEG
like how like actually tries to optimize

2522
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:28,740
like how like actually tries to optimize
 

2523
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:30,470
like how like actually tries to optimize
the toughness of the spot it puts a

2524
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:30,480
the toughness of the spot it puts a
 

2525
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,870
the toughness of the spot it puts a
human in and I I would I would love to

2526
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:32,880
human in and I I would I would love to
 

2527
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,550
human in and I I would I would love to
see how different is that from the game

2528
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
see how different is that from the game
 

2529
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,010
see how different is that from the game
theory optimal so you try to maximize

2530
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:37,020
theory optimal so you try to maximize
 

2531
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,430
theory optimal so you try to maximize
the heart rate of the human player like

2532
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,440
the heart rate of the human player like
 

2533
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,650
the heart rate of the human player like
the freaking out over a long period of

2534
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:42,660
the freaking out over a long period of
 

2535
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,230
the freaking out over a long period of
time I wonder if there's going to be

2536
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:45,240
time I wonder if there's going to be
 

2537
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:48,349
time I wonder if there's going to be
different strategies that emerge uh that

2538
00:42:48,349 --> 00:42:48,359
different strategies that emerge uh that
 

2539
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:49,730
different strategies that emerge uh that
are close in terms of Effectiveness

2540
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:49,740
are close in terms of Effectiveness
 

2541
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,370
are close in terms of Effectiveness
because something tells me you could

2542
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,380
because something tells me you could
 

2543
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,589
because something tells me you could
still be

2544
00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:54,599
still be
 

2545
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,390
still be
um achieved superhuman level performance

2546
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:56,400
um achieved superhuman level performance
 

2547
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,370
um achieved superhuman level performance
by just making people sweat

2548
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,380
by just making people sweat
 

2549
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,650
by just making people sweat
I feel like that there's a good chance

2550
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:00,660
I feel like that there's a good chance
 

2551
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,390
I feel like that there's a good chance
that that is the case yeah if you're

2552
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:02,400
that that is the case yeah if you're
 

2553
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,670
that that is the case yeah if you're
able to see like that it's like it's

2554
00:43:04,670 --> 00:43:04,680
able to see like that it's like it's
 

2555
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,349
able to see like that it's like it's
like a decent proxy for score right

2556
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:06,359
like a decent proxy for score right
 

2557
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:08,450
like a decent proxy for score right
right um and this is actually like the

2558
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:08,460
right um and this is actually like the
 

2559
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,130
right um and this is actually like the
the common poker wisdom when they're

2560
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:10,140
the common poker wisdom when they're
 

2561
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:11,630
the common poker wisdom when they're
telling where they're teaching players

2562
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:11,640
telling where they're teaching players
 

2563
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,790
telling where they're teaching players
before the robots and they were trying

2564
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:13,800
before the robots and they were trying
 

2565
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,050
before the robots and they were trying
to teach people how to play poker they

2566
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:15,060
to teach people how to play poker they
 

2567
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,910
to teach people how to play poker they
would say like the key to the game is to

2568
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:16,920
would say like the key to the game is to
 

2569
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,290
would say like the key to the game is to
put your opponent into difficult spots

2570
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:18,300
put your opponent into difficult spots
 

2571
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,690
put your opponent into difficult spots
it's a good um a good estimate for if

2572
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:20,700
it's a good um a good estimate for if
 

2573
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,490
it's a good um a good estimate for if
you're making the right decision so what

2574
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:22,500
you're making the right decision so what
 

2575
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,230
you're making the right decision so what
else can you say about the fundamental

2576
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:24,240
else can you say about the fundamental
 

2577
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:28,309
else can you say about the fundamental
role of search in poker and maybe if you

2578
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
role of search in poker and maybe if you
 

2579
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,650
role of search in poker and maybe if you
can also relate it to chess and go in

2580
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:30,660
can also relate it to chess and go in
 

2581
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,329
can also relate it to chess and go in
these games

2582
00:43:32,329 --> 00:43:32,339
these games
 

2583
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:32,930
these games
um

2584
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:32,940
um
 

2585
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,150
um
what's the role of search to solve in

2586
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:35,160
what's the role of search to solve in
 

2587
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,890
what's the role of search to solve in
these games

2588
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:36,900
these games
 

2589
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,530
these games
yeah I think a lot of people under this

2590
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:39,540
yeah I think a lot of people under this
 

2591
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,150
yeah I think a lot of people under this
is true for the general public and I

2592
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,160
is true for the general public and I
 

2593
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,890
is true for the general public and I
think it's true for the AI Community a

2594
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:42,900
think it's true for the AI Community a
 

2595
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,150
think it's true for the AI Community a
lot of people underestimate the

2596
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,160
lot of people underestimate the
 

2597
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,010
lot of people underestimate the
importance of search for these kinds of

2598
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:46,020
importance of search for these kinds of
 

2599
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:48,050
importance of search for these kinds of
game AI results

game AI results
 

2601
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,589
game AI results
um an example of this is uh TD Gammon

2602
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:51,599
um an example of this is uh TD Gammon
 

2603
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:53,870
um an example of this is uh TD Gammon
that came out in 1992 this was the the

2604
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
that came out in 1992 this was the the
 

2605
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,670
that came out in 1992 this was the the
first real instance of a neural net

2606
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
first real instance of a neural net
 

2607
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,890
first real instance of a neural net
being used in a game AI it's a landmark

2608
00:43:57,890 --> 00:43:57,900
being used in a game AI it's a landmark
 

2609
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:58,970
being used in a game AI it's a landmark
achievement it was actually the

2610
00:43:58,970 --> 00:43:58,980
achievement it was actually the
 

2611
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,490
achievement it was actually the
inspiration for Alpha zero and it used

2612
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:01,500
inspiration for Alpha zero and it used
 

2613
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,410
inspiration for Alpha zero and it used
search it used two-ply search to figure

2614
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:03,420
search it used two-ply search to figure
 

2615
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:04,790
search it used two-ply search to figure
out its next move

2616
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:04,800
out its next move
 

2617
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,089
out its next move
you got deep blue there he was very

2618
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:08,099
you got deep blue there he was very
 

2619
00:44:08,099 --> 00:44:09,829
you got deep blue there he was very
heavily focused on search

2620
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:09,839
heavily focused on search
 

2621
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,290
heavily focused on search
um looking many many moves ahead farther

2622
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:12,300
um looking many many moves ahead farther
 

2623
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,210
um looking many many moves ahead farther
than any human could and that was key

2624
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:14,220
than any human could and that was key
 

2625
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:16,370
than any human could and that was key
for why it won and then even with

2626
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:16,380
for why it won and then even with
 

2627
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,849
for why it won and then even with
something like alphago I mean alphago is

2628
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:19,859
something like alphago I mean alphago is
 

2629
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:22,790
something like alphago I mean alphago is
commonly hailed as a landmark

2630
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:22,800
commonly hailed as a landmark
 

2631
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,349
commonly hailed as a landmark
achievement for neural Nets and it is

2632
00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:24,359
achievement for neural Nets and it is
 

2633
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,510
achievement for neural Nets and it is
but there's also this huge component of

2634
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:26,520
but there's also this huge component of
 

2635
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,190
but there's also this huge component of
search Monte Carlo tree search to

2636
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:28,200
search Monte Carlo tree search to
 

2637
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,589
search Monte Carlo tree search to
alphago that was key absolutely

2638
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:30,599
alphago that was key absolutely
 

2639
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,510
alphago that was key absolutely
essential for the AI to be able to beat

2640
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:32,520
essential for the AI to be able to beat
 

2641
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,550
essential for the AI to be able to beat
top humans

2642
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:34,560
top humans
 

2643
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,190
top humans
um I think a good example of this is you

2644
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:37,200
um I think a good example of this is you
 

2645
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,530
um I think a good example of this is you
look at the latest versions of alpha of

2646
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:39,540
look at the latest versions of alpha of
 

2647
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:42,829
look at the latest versions of alpha of
alphago like it was called Alpha zero

2648
00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:42,839
alphago like it was called Alpha zero
 

2649
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:44,750
alphago like it was called Alpha zero
um and there's this metric called ELO

2650
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:44,760
um and there's this metric called ELO
 

2651
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:46,849
um and there's this metric called ELO
rating where you can compare different

2652
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:46,859
rating where you can compare different
 

2653
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,349
rating where you can compare different
humans and you can compare Bots to

2654
00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:48,359
humans and you can compare Bots to
 

2655
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:51,829
humans and you can compare Bots to
humans now a top human player is around

2656
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
humans now a top human player is around
 

2657
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,950
humans now a top human player is around
3600 ELO maybe a little bit higher now

2658
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
3600 ELO maybe a little bit higher now
 

2659
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,589
3600 ELO maybe a little bit higher now
um Alpha zero the strongest version is

2660
00:44:57,589 --> 00:44:57,599
um Alpha zero the strongest version is
 

2661
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,750
um Alpha zero the strongest version is
around 5200 ELO

2662
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
around 5200 ELO
 

2663
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,849
around 5200 ELO
but if you take out the search that's

2664
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:01,859
but if you take out the search that's
 

2665
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:04,370
but if you take out the search that's
being done at test time and by the way

2666
00:45:04,370 --> 00:45:04,380
being done at test time and by the way
 

2667
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,650
being done at test time and by the way
what I mean by search is the planning

2668
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:06,660
what I mean by search is the planning
 

2669
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,569
what I mean by search is the planning
ahead the thinking of like oh if I move

2670
00:45:08,569 --> 00:45:08,579
ahead the thinking of like oh if I move
 

2671
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,730
ahead the thinking of like oh if I move
my if I place the stone here and then he

2672
00:45:10,730 --> 00:45:10,740
my if I place the stone here and then he
 

2673
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,470
my if I place the stone here and then he
does this and then you look like five

2674
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
does this and then you look like five
 

2675
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,730
does this and then you look like five
moves ahead and you see like what the

2676
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:13,740
moves ahead and you see like what the
 

2677
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:15,589
moves ahead and you see like what the
board state looks like

2678
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:15,599
board state looks like
 

2679
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,630
board state looks like
um that's what I mean by search if you

2680
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:17,640
um that's what I mean by search if you
 

2681
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,069
um that's what I mean by search if you
take out the search that's done during

2682
00:45:19,069 --> 00:45:19,079
take out the search that's done during
 

2683
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:21,170
take out the search that's done during
the game the ELO rating drops to around

2684
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:21,180
the game the ELO rating drops to around
 

2685
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,609
the game the ELO rating drops to around
three thousand

2686
00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:22,619
three thousand
 

2687
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:24,170
three thousand
so even today

2688
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:24,180
so even today
 

2689
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,809
so even today
what seven years after alphago

2690
00:45:26,809 --> 00:45:26,819
what seven years after alphago
 

2691
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:29,089
what seven years after alphago
if you take out the Monte Carlo research

2692
00:45:29,089 --> 00:45:29,099
if you take out the Monte Carlo research
 

2693
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:31,490
if you take out the Monte Carlo research
that's being done at one playing against

2694
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:31,500
that's being done at one playing against
 

2695
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,450
that's being done at one playing against
the human

2696
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:32,460
the human
 

2697
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,510
the human
the Bots are not superhuman nobody has

2698
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:35,520
the Bots are not superhuman nobody has
 

2699
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,849
the Bots are not superhuman nobody has
made a raw neural net that is superhuman

2700
00:45:37,849 --> 00:45:37,859
made a raw neural net that is superhuman
 

2701
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:39,109
made a raw neural net that is superhuman
and go

2702
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:39,119
and go
 

2703
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,210
and go
that's worth lingering on that's that's

2704
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:41,220
that's worth lingering on that's that's
 

2705
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,069
that's worth lingering on that's that's
quite profound

2706
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:43,079
quite profound
 

2707
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:45,530
quite profound
so without search that just means

2708
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:45,540
so without search that just means
 

2709
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,450
so without search that just means
looking at the next move

2710
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:47,460
looking at the next move
 

2711
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,089
looking at the next move
and saying this is the best move so

2712
00:45:50,089 --> 00:45:50,099
and saying this is the best move so
 

2713
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:51,589
and saying this is the best move so
having a function that estimates

2714
00:45:51,589 --> 00:45:51,599
having a function that estimates
 

2715
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,530
having a function that estimates
accurately what the best move is that's

2716
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:54,540
accurately what the best move is that's
 

2717
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,809
accurately what the best move is that's
right without search yeah and all these

2718
00:45:56,809 --> 00:45:56,819
right without search yeah and all these
 

2719
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,970
right without search yeah and all these
Bots they have the what's called a

2720
00:45:58,970 --> 00:45:58,980
Bots they have the what's called a
 

2721
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,589
Bots they have the what's called a
policy Network where it will tell you

2722
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:00,599
policy Network where it will tell you
 

2723
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,089
policy Network where it will tell you
this is what the neural net thinks is

2724
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:02,099
this is what the neural net thinks is
 

2725
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:04,069
this is what the neural net thinks is
the next best move

2726
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
the next best move
 

2727
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:04,670
the next best move
um

2728
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:04,680
um
 

2729
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:07,849
um
and it's kind of like a the intuition

2730
00:46:07,849 --> 00:46:07,859
and it's kind of like a the intuition
 

2731
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:09,349
and it's kind of like a the intuition
that a human has you know the human

2732
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:09,359
that a human has you know the human
 

2733
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,829
that a human has you know the human
looks at the board and and any uh go or

2734
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:12,839
looks at the board and and any uh go or
 

2735
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:14,390
looks at the board and and any uh go or
chess master will be able to tell you

2736
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:14,400
chess master will be able to tell you
 

2737
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,010
chess master will be able to tell you
like oh instantly here's what I think

2738
00:46:16,010 --> 00:46:16,020
like oh instantly here's what I think
 

2739
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,750
like oh instantly here's what I think
the right move is

2740
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:17,760
the right move is
 

2741
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,010
the right move is
um and the bot is able to do the same

2742
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:19,020
um and the bot is able to do the same
 

2743
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,490
um and the bot is able to do the same
thing but just like how a human

2744
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:21,500
thing but just like how a human
 

2745
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,510
thing but just like how a human
Grandmaster can make a better decision

2746
00:46:23,510 --> 00:46:23,520
Grandmaster can make a better decision
 

2747
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,550
Grandmaster can make a better decision
if they have more time to think when you

2748
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:25,560
if they have more time to think when you
 

2749
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,010
if they have more time to think when you
add on this Monte Carlo tree search the

2750
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:28,020
add on this Monte Carlo tree search the
 

2751
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,809
add on this Monte Carlo tree search the
bot is able to make a better decision

2752
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:29,819
bot is able to make a better decision
 

2753
00:46:29,819 --> 00:46:32,510
bot is able to make a better decision
yeah I mean of course a human is doing

2754
00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:32,520
yeah I mean of course a human is doing
 

2755
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,370
yeah I mean of course a human is doing
something like searching their brain but

2756
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:34,380
something like searching their brain but
 

2757
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,230
something like searching their brain but
it's not

2758
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
it's not
 

2759
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,290
it's not
I hesitate to draw a hard line but it's

2760
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:39,300
I hesitate to draw a hard line but it's
 

2761
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,170
I hesitate to draw a hard line but it's
not like uh Monte Carlo tree search it's

2762
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:42,180
not like uh Monte Carlo tree search it's
 

2763
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,490
not like uh Monte Carlo tree search it's
more like

2764
00:46:43,490 --> 00:46:43,500
more like
 

2765
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,089
more like
sequential language model generation so

2766
00:46:47,089 --> 00:46:47,099
sequential language model generation so
 

2767
00:46:47,099 --> 00:46:49,130
sequential language model generation so
it's like a different it's a the neural

2768
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:49,140
it's like a different it's a the neural
 

2769
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,170
it's like a different it's a the neural
network is doing the searching and I

2770
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:51,180
network is doing the searching and I
 

2771
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,910
network is doing the searching and I
wonder what the human brain is doing in

2772
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:52,920
wonder what the human brain is doing in
 

2773
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,290
wonder what the human brain is doing in
terms of searching because you're doing

2774
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:54,300
terms of searching because you're doing
 

2775
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,569
terms of searching because you're doing
that like computation the human is

2776
00:46:56,569 --> 00:46:56,579
that like computation the human is
 

2777
00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:58,490
that like computation the human is
Computing they have intuition they've

2778
00:46:58,490 --> 00:46:58,500
Computing they have intuition they've
 

2779
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,870
Computing they have intuition they've
got

2780
00:46:59,870 --> 00:46:59,880
got
 

2781
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,849
got
they have a really strong ability to

2782
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:01,859
they have a really strong ability to
 

2783
00:47:01,859 --> 00:47:03,650
they have a really strong ability to
estimate you know amongst the top

2784
00:47:03,650 --> 00:47:03,660
estimate you know amongst the top
 

2785
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,210
estimate you know amongst the top
players of what is a good and not

2786
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,220
players of what is a good and not
 

2787
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,190
players of what is a good and not
position without calculating all the

2788
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,200
position without calculating all the
 

2789
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,150
position without calculating all the
details

2790
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:08,160
details
 

2791
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,890
details
but they're still doing search in their

2792
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:09,900
but they're still doing search in their
 

2793
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,510
but they're still doing search in their
head but it's a different kind of search

2794
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:11,520
head but it's a different kind of search
 

2795
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,430
head but it's a different kind of search
have you ever thought about like what is

2796
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:13,440
have you ever thought about like what is
 

2797
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,349
have you ever thought about like what is
the difference between the human

2798
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:15,359
the difference between the human
 

2799
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,990
the difference between the human
the search that the human is performing

2800
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,000
the search that the human is performing
 

2801
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,550
the search that the human is performing
versus what

2802
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:19,560
versus what
 

2803
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,010
versus what
computers are doing I have thought a lot

2804
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:22,020
computers are doing I have thought a lot
 

2805
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,970
computers are doing I have thought a lot
about that and I think it's a really

2806
00:47:22,970 --> 00:47:22,980
about that and I think it's a really
 

2807
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,390
about that and I think it's a really
important question so the AI in Alpha

2808
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
important question so the AI in Alpha
 

2809
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,609
important question so the AI in Alpha
and Alphas in alphago or any of these go

2810
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:28,619
and Alphas in alphago or any of these go
 

2811
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:30,230
and Alphas in alphago or any of these go
AIS they're all doing Monte College

00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
AIS they're all doing Monte College
 

2813
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,329

00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:32,339
research which is a particular kind of
 

2815
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:35,329
research which is a particular kind of
search and it it's actually a symbolic

2816
00:47:35,329 --> 00:47:35,339
search and it it's actually a symbolic
 

2817
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,270
search and it it's actually a symbolic
tabular search it uses the neural net to

2818
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:38,280
tabular search it uses the neural net to
 

2819
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,890
tabular search it uses the neural net to
guide its search but it isn't actually

2820
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:39,900
guide its search but it isn't actually
 

2821
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,589
guide its search but it isn't actually
like full full-on neural net

2822
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:42,599
like full full-on neural net
 

2823
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:45,589
like full full-on neural net
now that kind of search is very

2824
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:45,599
now that kind of search is very
 

2825
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:47,450
now that kind of search is very
successful in these kinds of like

2826
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:47,460
successful in these kinds of like
 

2827
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:48,829
successful in these kinds of like
perfect information board games like

2828
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:48,839
perfect information board games like
 

2829
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,050
perfect information board games like
chess and go but if you take it to a

2830
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:51,060
chess and go but if you take it to a
 

2831
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,430
chess and go but if you take it to a
game like poker for example it doesn't

2832
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:52,440
game like poker for example it doesn't
 

2833
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,190
game like poker for example it doesn't
work it can't it can't understand the

2834
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:55,200
work it can't it can't understand the
 

2835
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,990
work it can't it can't understand the
concept of hidden information it doesn't

2836
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:57,000
concept of hidden information it doesn't
 

2837
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,550
concept of hidden information it doesn't
understand the balance that you have to

2838
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:58,560
understand the balance that you have to
 

2839
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,170
understand the balance that you have to
strike between like the amount that

2840
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:00,180
strike between like the amount that
 

2841
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,370
strike between like the amount that
you're raising versus the amount that

2842
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:01,380
you're raising versus the amount that
 

2843
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,710
you're raising versus the amount that
you're calling and in every one of these

2844
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:03,720
you're calling and in every one of these
 

2845
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,530
you're calling and in every one of these
games you see a different kind of search

2846
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:06,540
games you see a different kind of search
 

2847
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:08,990
games you see a different kind of search
and the human brain is able to plan for

2848
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:09,000
and the human brain is able to plan for
 

2849
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,430
and the human brain is able to plan for
all these different games in a very

2850
00:48:10,430 --> 00:48:10,440
all these different games in a very
 

2851
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,950
all these different games in a very
general way now I think that's one thing

2852
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:12,960
general way now I think that's one thing
 

2853
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,690
general way now I think that's one thing
that we're missing from AI today and I

2854
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:14,700
that we're missing from AI today and I
 

2855
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,710
that we're missing from AI today and I
think it's a really important missing

2856
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:15,720
think it's a really important missing
 

2857
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,710
think it's a really important missing
piece the ability to plan and reason

2858
00:48:18,710 --> 00:48:18,720
piece the ability to plan and reason
 

2859
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,130
piece the ability to plan and reason
more generally across a wide variety of

2860
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:22,140
more generally across a wide variety of
 

2861
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,630
more generally across a wide variety of
different settings

2862
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:23,640
different settings
 

2863
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,150
different settings
in a way where the general reasoning

2864
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:26,160
in a way where the general reasoning
 

2865
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,309
in a way where the general reasoning
makes you better at each one of the

2866
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
makes you better at each one of the
 

2867
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,710
makes you better at each one of the
games not worse yeah so you can kind of

2868
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
games not worse yeah so you can kind of
 

2869
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,690
games not worse yeah so you can kind of
think of it as like neural Nets today

2870
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:32,700
think of it as like neural Nets today
 

2871
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:34,550
think of it as like neural Nets today
they'll give you like Transformers for

2872
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:34,560
they'll give you like Transformers for
 

2873
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,770
they'll give you like Transformers for
example or super General but you know

2874
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:36,780
example or super General but you know
 

2875
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,630
example or super General but you know
they'll give you it'll output an answer

2876
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
they'll give you it'll output an answer
 

2877
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,150
they'll give you it'll output an answer
in like 100 milliseconds and if you tell

2878
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:41,160
in like 100 milliseconds and if you tell
 

2879
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,410
in like 100 milliseconds and if you tell
it like oh you've got five minutes to

2880
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:42,420
it like oh you've got five minutes to
 

2881
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:43,790
it like oh you've got five minutes to
give you a decision you know feel free

2882
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:43,800
give you a decision you know feel free
 

2883
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:44,870
give you a decision you know feel free
to take more time to make a better

2884
00:48:44,870 --> 00:48:44,880
to take more time to make a better
 

2885
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,490
to take more time to make a better
decision it's not gonna know what to do

2886
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:46,500
decision it's not gonna know what to do
 

2887
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,809
decision it's not gonna know what to do
with that

2888
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:47,819
with that
 

2889
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,210
with that
um but a human if you're playing a game

2890
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:50,220
um but a human if you're playing a game
 

2891
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,349
um but a human if you're playing a game
like chess they're going to give you a

2892
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:51,359
like chess they're going to give you a
 

2893
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:52,609
like chess they're going to give you a
very different answer depending on if

2894
00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:52,619
very different answer depending on if
 

2895
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:54,470
very different answer depending on if
you say oh you've got 100 milliseconds

2896
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:54,480
you say oh you've got 100 milliseconds
 

2897
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,950
you say oh you've got 100 milliseconds
or you've got five minutes

2898
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:56,960
or you've got five minutes
 

2899
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,270
or you've got five minutes
yeah there I mean that people have

2900
00:48:59,270 --> 00:48:59,280
yeah there I mean that people have
 

2901
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,890
yeah there I mean that people have
started using right Transformers the

2902
00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:00,900
started using right Transformers the
 

2903
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,690
started using right Transformers the
language models like the in an iterative

2904
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:02,700
language models like the in an iterative
 

2905
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,150
language models like the in an iterative
way that does improve the answer or like

2906
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:05,160
way that does improve the answer or like
 

2907
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,430
way that does improve the answer or like
showing the work the kind of kind of

2908
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
showing the work the kind of kind of
 

2909
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,050
showing the work the kind of kind of
idea yeah they got this thing called

2910
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,060
idea yeah they got this thing called
 

2911
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,910
idea yeah they got this thing called
Chain of Thought reasoning and that's I

2912
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:10,920
Chain of Thought reasoning and that's I
 

2913
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,950
Chain of Thought reasoning and that's I
think um super promising right yeah I

2914
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:12,960
think um super promising right yeah I
 

2915
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,329
think um super promising right yeah I
think and I think it's a good step in

2916
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:14,339
think and I think it's a good step in
 

2917
00:49:14,339 --> 00:49:15,530
think and I think it's a good step in
the right direction

2918
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:15,540
the right direction
 

2919
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,450
the right direction
um I I would kind of like say it's

2920
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:17,460
um I I would kind of like say it's
 

2921
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,790
um I I would kind of like say it's
similar to Monte Carlo rollouts in in a

2922
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:19,800
similar to Monte Carlo rollouts in in a
 

2923
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,170
similar to Monte Carlo rollouts in in a
game like chess there's a kind of search

2924
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:21,180
game like chess there's a kind of search
 

2925
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:22,910
game like chess there's a kind of search
that you can do where you're saying like

2926
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:22,920
that you can do where you're saying like
 

2927
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:24,829
that you can do where you're saying like
I'm Gonna Roll Out My intuition and see

2928
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:24,839
I'm Gonna Roll Out My intuition and see
 

2929
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:27,470
I'm Gonna Roll Out My intuition and see
like without really thinking you know

2930
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:27,480
like without really thinking you know
 

2931
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,730
like without really thinking you know
what are the better decisions I can make

2932
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:28,740
what are the better decisions I can make
 

2933
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,770
what are the better decisions I can make
farther down the path

2934
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:30,780
farther down the path
 

2935
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,030
farther down the path
um what would I do if I just acted

2936
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:32,040
um what would I do if I just acted
 

2937
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,410
um what would I do if I just acted
according to intuition for the next 10

2938
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:33,420
according to intuition for the next 10
 

2939
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:34,790
according to intuition for the next 10
moves

2940
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
moves
 

2941
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,190
moves
um and that gets you an improvement but

2942
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
um and that gets you an improvement but
 

2943
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,650
um and that gets you an improvement but
I think that there's much uh much richer

2944
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:39,660
I think that there's much uh much richer
 

2945
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,109
I think that there's much uh much richer
kinds of of planning that we could do

2946
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:42,119
kinds of of planning that we could do
 

2947
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,030
kinds of of planning that we could do
so when the broadest actually beat the

2948
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:44,040
so when the broadest actually beat the
 

2949
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:46,309
so when the broadest actually beat the
poker plays what did I feel like what

2950
00:49:46,309 --> 00:49:46,319
poker plays what did I feel like what
 

2951
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,890
poker plays what did I feel like what
was that I mean actually on that day

2952
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:48,900
was that I mean actually on that day
 

2953
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:50,690
was that I mean actually on that day
what were you feeling like were you were

2954
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:50,700
what were you feeling like were you were
 

2955
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:53,030
what were you feeling like were you were
you nervous

2956
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:53,040
you nervous
 

2957
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,069
you nervous
I mean Poco was one of the games that he

2958
00:49:55,069 --> 00:49:55,079
I mean Poco was one of the games that he
 

2959
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:56,569
I mean Poco was one of the games that he
thought like is not going to be solvable

2960
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:56,579
thought like is not going to be solvable
 

2961
00:49:56,579 --> 00:49:59,390
thought like is not going to be solvable
because it's the human factor so at

2962
00:49:59,390 --> 00:49:59,400
because it's the human factor so at
 

2963
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,710
because it's the human factor so at
least in the narratives we tell

2964
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:00,720

fundamental to the game of poker

2968
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,160
fundamental to the game of poker
 

2969
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,890
fundamental to the game of poker
yeah the liberatis competition was super

2970
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:06,900
yeah the liberatis competition was super
 

2971
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,210
yeah the liberatis competition was super
stressful for me

2972
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:08,220
stressful for me
 

2973
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:11,450
stressful for me
um also I mean I was working on this

2974
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:11,460
um also I mean I was working on this
 

2975
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:13,130
um also I mean I was working on this
like basically continuously for a year

2976
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:13,140
like basically continuously for a year
 

2977
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,349
like basically continuously for a year
leading up to the competition I mean for

2978
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:15,359
leading up to the competition I mean for
 

2979
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:17,089
leading up to the competition I mean for
me it became like very clear like okay

2980
00:50:17,089 --> 00:50:17,099
me it became like very clear like okay
 

2981
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,829
me it became like very clear like okay
this is the search technique this is the

2982
00:50:18,829 --> 00:50:18,839
this is the search technique this is the
 

2983
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,630
this is the search technique this is the
approach that we need and then I spent a

2984
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
approach that we need and then I spent a
 

2985
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:21,950
approach that we need and then I spent a
year working on this pretty much like

2986
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:21,960
year working on this pretty much like
 

2987
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,990
year working on this pretty much like
non-stop oh can we actually get into

2988
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:24,000
non-stop oh can we actually get into
 

2989
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,730
non-stop oh can we actually get into
details like what programming language

2990
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:25,740
details like what programming language
 

2991
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:27,950
details like what programming language
is it written in what's some interesting

2992
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:27,960
is it written in what's some interesting
 

2993
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,370
is it written in what's some interesting
uh implementation details that are like

2994
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:31,380
uh implementation details that are like
 

2995
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:34,130
uh implementation details that are like
fun slash painful yeah so one of the

2996
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:34,140
fun slash painful yeah so one of the
 

2997
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,170
fun slash painful yeah so one of the
interesting things about liberatis is

2998
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:36,180
interesting things about liberatis is
 

2999
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,910
interesting things about liberatis is
that we had no idea what the bar was to

3000
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:37,920
that we had no idea what the bar was to
 

3001
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,309
that we had no idea what the bar was to
actually beat top humans yeah we could

3002
00:50:40,309 --> 00:50:40,319
actually beat top humans yeah we could
 

3003
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:41,750
actually beat top humans yeah we could
play against like our prior Bots and

3004
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:41,760
play against like our prior Bots and
 

3005
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:42,950
play against like our prior Bots and
that kind of gives us some sense of like

3006
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
that kind of gives us some sense of like
 

3007
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,569
that kind of gives us some sense of like
are we making progress are we going in

3008
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:44,579
are we making progress are we going in
 

3009
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,430
are we making progress are we going in
the right direction uh but we had no

3010
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:46,440
the right direction uh but we had no
 

3011
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,349
the right direction uh but we had no
idea like what the bar actually was and

3012
00:50:48,349 --> 00:50:48,359
idea like what the bar actually was and
 

3013
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,510
idea like what the bar actually was and
so we threw a huge amount of resources

3014
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:50,520
so we threw a huge amount of resources
 

3015
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,250
so we threw a huge amount of resources
at trying to make the strongest bot

3016
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:52,260
at trying to make the strongest bot
 

3017
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:54,829
at trying to make the strongest bot
possible so we use C plus plus it was

3018
00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:54,839
possible so we use C plus plus it was
 

3019
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:56,630
possible so we use C plus plus it was
parallelized we were using I think like

3020
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:56,640
parallelized we were using I think like
 

3021
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,270
parallelized we were using I think like
a thousand CPUs uh maybe maybe more

3022
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
a thousand CPUs uh maybe maybe more
 

3023
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,230
a thousand CPUs uh maybe maybe more
actually

3024
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
actually
 

3025
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,970
actually
um and you know today that sounds like

3026
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:01,980
um and you know today that sounds like
 

3027
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:04,069
um and you know today that sounds like
nothing but for a grad student back in

3028
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
nothing but for a grad student back in
 

3029
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,410
nothing but for a grad student back in
2016 that was a huge amount of resources

3030
00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:06,420
2016 that was a huge amount of resources
 

3031
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:08,690
2016 that was a huge amount of resources
but still a lot for even any gratitude

3032
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:08,700
but still a lot for even any gratitude
 

3033
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,569
but still a lot for even any gratitude
today it's still tough to to get

3034
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:11,579
today it's still tough to to get
 

3035
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,690
today it's still tough to to get
or even to allow yourself to think in

3036
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:14,700
or even to allow yourself to think in
 

3037
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,750
or even to allow yourself to think in
that in terms of scale at CMU at MIT

3038
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:17,760
that in terms of scale at CMU at MIT
 

3039
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,150
that in terms of scale at CMU at MIT
anything like that yeah and you know

3040
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,160
anything like that yeah and you know
 

3041
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,010
anything like that yeah and you know
talking about terabytes of memory

3042
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:22,020
talking about terabytes of memory
 

3043
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,049
talking about terabytes of memory
um so it's a very paralyzed

3044
00:51:24,049 --> 00:51:24,059
um so it's a very paralyzed
 

3045
00:51:24,059 --> 00:51:25,549
um so it's a very paralyzed
um and it had to be very fast too

3046
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:25,559
um and it had to be very fast too
 

3047
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,530
um and it had to be very fast too
because the more games that you could

3048
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:27,540
because the more games that you could
 

3049
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:29,750
because the more games that you could
simulate uh the stronger the bot would

3050
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,760
simulate uh the stronger the bot would
 

3051
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,329
simulate uh the stronger the bot would
be so is there some like John Carmack

3052
00:51:32,329 --> 00:51:32,339
be so is there some like John Carmack
 

3053
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,290
be so is there some like John Carmack

Style
 

3055
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,870
Style
like efficiencies you have to come up

3056
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:35,880
like efficiencies you have to come up
 

3057
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:38,089
like efficiencies you have to come up
with like an efficient way to represent

3058
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:38,099
with like an efficient way to represent
 

3059
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,670
with like an efficient way to represent
a hand all that kind of stuff there were

3060
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:40,680
a hand all that kind of stuff there were
 

3061
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,290
a hand all that kind of stuff there were
all sorts of optimizations that I had to

3062
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:42,300
all sorts of optimizations that I had to
 

3063
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,790
all sorts of optimizations that I had to
make to try to get this thing to run as

3064
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:43,800
make to try to get this thing to run as
 

3065
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,589
make to try to get this thing to run as
fast as possible they were like how do

3066
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
fast as possible they were like how do
 

3067
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,450
fast as possible they were like how do
you minimize the latency how do you like

3068
00:51:47,450 --> 00:51:47,460
you minimize the latency how do you like
 

3069
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,309
you minimize the latency how do you like
you know package things together so that

3070
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:49,319
you know package things together so that
 

3071
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:50,569
you know package things together so that
like you minimize the amount of

3072
00:51:50,569 --> 00:51:50,579
like you minimize the amount of
 

3073
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:51,530
like you minimize the amount of
communication between the different

3074
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:51,540
communication between the different
 

3075
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,030
communication between the different
nodes

3076
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
nodes
 

3077
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,770
nodes
um how do you like optimize the

3078
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:54,780
um how do you like optimize the
 

3079
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:57,109
um how do you like optimize the
algorithm so that you can you know try

3080
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
algorithm so that you can you know try
 

3081
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,490
algorithm so that you can you know try
to squeeze out more and more from the

3082
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:58,500
to squeeze out more and more from the
 

3083
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,109
to squeeze out more and more from the
game that you're actually playing all

3084
00:52:00,109 --> 00:52:00,119
game that you're actually playing all
 

3085
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:01,609
game that you're actually playing all
these kinds of different decisions that

3086
00:52:01,609 --> 00:52:01,619
these kinds of different decisions that
 

3087
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,490
these kinds of different decisions that
that I you know had to make uh just a

3088
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:04,500
that I you know had to make uh just a
 

3089
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,089
that I you know had to make uh just a
fun question what what id did you use

3090
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:07,099
fun question what what id did you use
 

3091
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:09,890
fun question what what id did you use
what uh for for C plus plus

3092
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:09,900
what uh for for C plus plus
 

3093
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,530
what uh for for C plus plus
I think I used a visual studio actually

3094
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:12,540
I think I used a visual studio actually
 

3095
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,809
I think I used a visual studio actually
yeah okay yeah is that still carried

3096
00:52:14,809 --> 00:52:14,819
yeah okay yeah is that still carried
 

3097
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:16,849
yeah okay yeah is that still carried
through to today vs code is is what I

3098
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:16,859
through to today vs code is is what I
 

3099
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:18,170
through to today vs code is is what I
use today it seems like it's pretty the

3100
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:18,180
use today it seems like it's pretty the
 

3101
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:20,329
use today it seems like it's pretty the
community basically converged on Okay

3102
00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:20,339
community basically converged on Okay
 

3103
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,370
community basically converged on Okay
cool so you got you got this

3104
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:22,380
cool so you got you got this
 

3105
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:25,190
cool so you got you got this
super optimized C plus plus system

3106
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
super optimized C plus plus system
 

3107
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,870
super optimized C plus plus system
and then you show up to the day of

3108
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:26,880
and then you show up to the day of
 

3109
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,069
and then you show up to the day of
competition

3110
00:52:28,069 --> 00:52:28,079
competition
 

3111
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:28,809
competition
yeah

3112
00:52:28,809 --> 00:52:28,819
yeah
 

3113
00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:32,089
yeah
humans versus machine

3114
00:52:32,089 --> 00:52:32,099
humans versus machine
 

3115
00:52:32,099 --> 00:52:34,309
humans versus machine
um how did it feel throughout the day

3116
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
um how did it feel throughout the day
 

3117
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,990
um how did it feel throughout the day
super stressful

3118
00:52:35,990 --> 00:52:36,000
super stressful
 

3119
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,690
super stressful
um I mean I thought going into it that

3120
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:38,700
um I mean I thought going into it that
 

3121
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,250
um I mean I thought going into it that
we had like a 50 50 chance because

3122
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:40,260
we had like a 50 50 chance because
 

3123
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,190
we had like a 50 50 chance because
basically I thought if if they play in a

3124
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
basically I thought if if they play in a
 

3125
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,630
basically I thought if if they play in a
totally normal style I think we'll

3126
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
totally normal style I think we'll
 

3127
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,270
totally normal style I think we'll
squeak out a win but there's always a

3128
00:52:47,270 --> 00:52:47,280
squeak out a win but there's always a
 

3129
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,950
squeak out a win but there's always a
chance that they can find some weakness

3130
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:48,960
chance that they can find some weakness
 

3131
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,349
chance that they can find some weakness
in the bot and if they do and we're

3132
00:52:51,349 --> 00:52:51,359
in the bot and if they do and we're
 

3133
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,510
in the bot and if they do and we're
playing like for 20 days 120 000 hands

3134
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
playing like for 20 days 120 000 hands
 

3135
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:54,890
playing like for 20 days 120 000 hands
of poker they have a lot of time to find

3136
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:54,900
of poker they have a lot of time to find
 

3137
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,230
of poker they have a lot of time to find
weaknesses in the system and if they do

3138
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:57,240
weaknesses in the system and if they do
 

3139
00:52:57,240 --> 00:52:59,210
weaknesses in the system and if they do
we're gonna get crushed and that's

3140
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,220
we're gonna get crushed and that's
 

3141
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,410
we're gonna get crushed and that's
actually what happened in the previous

3142
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:00,420
actually what happened in the previous
 

3143
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,970
actually what happened in the previous
competition

3144
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:01,980
competition
 

3145
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,349
competition
um the humans you know they started out

3146
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:03,359
um the humans you know they started out
 

3147
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,849
um the humans you know they started out
it wasn't like a they were winning from

3148
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:04,859
it wasn't like a they were winning from
 

3149
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:06,470
it wasn't like a they were winning from
the start but then they found these

3150
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:06,480
the start but then they found these
 

3151
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,370
the start but then they found these
weaknesses that they could take

3152
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:07,380
weaknesses that they could take
 

3153
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,349
weaknesses that they could take
advantage of and for the next they know

3154
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:09,359
advantage of and for the next they know
 

3155
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,790
advantage of and for the next they know
like 10 days they were just just

3156
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:10,800
like 10 days they were just just
 

3157
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,650
like 10 days they were just just
crushing the bot stealing money from it

3158
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:12,660
crushing the bot stealing money from it
 

3159
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,809
crushing the bot stealing money from it
what were the weaknesses they found like

3160
00:53:14,809 --> 00:53:14,819
what were the weaknesses they found like
 

3161
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:17,150
what were the weaknesses they found like
maybe over betting was effective that

3162
00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:17,160
maybe over betting was effective that
 

3163
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,349
maybe over betting was effective that
kind of stuff so certain betting

3164
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:18,359
kind of stuff so certain betting
 

3165
00:53:18,359 --> 00:53:21,170
kind of stuff so certain betting
strategies worked what they found is

3166
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:21,180
strategies worked what they found is
 

3167
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:22,790
strategies worked what they found is
yeah over betting like betting certain

3168
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:22,800
yeah over betting like betting certain
 

3169
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,049
yeah over betting like betting certain
amounts the bot would have a lot of

3170
00:53:24,049 --> 00:53:24,059
amounts the bot would have a lot of
 

3171
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:25,910
amounts the bot would have a lot of
trouble dealing with those sizes and

3172
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:25,920
trouble dealing with those sizes and
 

3173
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,650
trouble dealing with those sizes and
then also

3174
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:27,660
then also
 

3175
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,170
then also
um when it the bot got into really

3176
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:30,180
um when it the bot got into really
 

3177
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,750
um when it the bot got into really
difficult all-in situations it wasn't

3178
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:32,760
difficult all-in situations it wasn't
 

3179
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:35,030
difficult all-in situations it wasn't
able to because it wasn't doing search

3180
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
able to because it wasn't doing search
 

3181
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,910
able to because it wasn't doing search
it had to Clump different hands together

3182
00:53:37,910 --> 00:53:37,920
it had to Clump different hands together
 

3183
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,230
it had to Clump different hands together
and it wouldn't it would treat them

3184
00:53:39,230 --> 00:53:39,240
and it wouldn't it would treat them
 

3185
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,450
and it wouldn't it would treat them
identically yeah um and so it wouldn't

3186
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:41,460
identically yeah um and so it wouldn't
 

3187
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,549
identically yeah um and so it wouldn't
be able to distinguish you know like

3188
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:43,559
be able to distinguish you know like
 

3189
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:45,650
be able to distinguish you know like
having a king High flush versus an ace

3190
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:45,660
having a king High flush versus an ace
 

3191
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,510
having a king High flush versus an ace
high flush and in some situations that

3192
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
high flush and in some situations that
 

3193
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:48,829
high flush and in some situations that
really matters a lot and so they could

3194
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:48,839
really matters a lot and so they could
 

3195
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:50,990
really matters a lot and so they could
put the bot into those situations and

3196
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:51,000
put the bot into those situations and
 

3197
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,370
put the bot into those situations and
then the bot would would just bleed

3198
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:52,380
then the bot would would just bleed
 

3199
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,130
then the bot would would just bleed
money clever humans yeah okay so I

3200
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:55,140
money clever humans yeah okay so I
 

3201
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:59,270
money clever humans yeah okay so I
didn't realize it was over 20 days so

3202
00:53:59,270 --> 00:53:59,280
didn't realize it was over 20 days so
 

3203
00:53:59,280 --> 00:53:59,870
didn't realize it was over 20 days so
um

3204
00:53:59,870 --> 00:53:59,880
um
 

3205
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:02,270
um
what were the humans like over those 20

3206
00:54:02,270 --> 00:54:02,280
what were the humans like over those 20
 

3207
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,450
what were the humans like over those 20
days and what was the bot like so we had

3208
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:05,460
days and what was the bot like so we had
 

3209
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,130
days and what was the bot like so we had
set up the competition you know like I

3210
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,140
set up the competition you know like I
 

3211
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,089
set up the competition you know like I
said there was two hundred thousand

3212
00:54:08,089 --> 00:54:08,099
said there was two hundred thousand
 

3213
00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:10,490
said there was two hundred thousand
dollars in prize money and they would

3214
00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:10,500
dollars in prize money and they would
 

3215
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,530
dollars in prize money and they would
get paid a fraction of that depending on

3216
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:12,540
get paid a fraction of that depending on
 

3217
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:13,970
get paid a fraction of that depending on
how well they did relative to each other

3218
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:13,980
how well they did relative to each other
 

3219
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:15,650
how well they did relative to each other
yeah so I was kind of hoping that they

3220
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:15,660
yeah so I was kind of hoping that they
 

3221
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,089
yeah so I was kind of hoping that they
wouldn't work together to try to find

3222
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:17,099
wouldn't work together to try to find
 

3223
00:54:17,099 --> 00:54:19,609
wouldn't work together to try to find
weaknesses in the bot but they entered

3224
00:54:19,609 --> 00:54:19,619
weaknesses in the bot but they entered
 

3225
00:54:19,619 --> 00:54:20,990
weaknesses in the bot but they entered
the competition with their like number

3226
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:21,000
the competition with their like number
 

3227
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,030
the competition with their like number
one objective being to beat the bot and

3228
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,040
one objective being to beat the bot and
 

3229
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,589
one objective being to beat the bot and
they didn't care about like individual

3230
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:24,599
they didn't care about like individual
 

3231
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:25,790
they didn't care about like individual
Glory they were like we're all going to

3232
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:25,800
Glory they were like we're all going to
 

3233
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,470
Glory they were like we're all going to
work as a team to try to take down the

3234
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:27,480
work as a team to try to take down the
 

3235
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,230
work as a team to try to take down the
spot yeah and so they immediately

3236
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
spot yeah and so they immediately
 

3237
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,549
spot yeah and so they immediately
started comparing notes what they would

3238
00:54:31,549 --> 00:54:31,559
started comparing notes what they would
 

3239
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,390
started comparing notes what they would
do is they would coordinate looking at

3240
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:35,400
do is they would coordinate looking at
 

3241
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,829
do is they would coordinate looking at
different parts of the strategy to try

3242
00:54:36,829 --> 00:54:36,839
different parts of the strategy to try
 

3243
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,950
different parts of the strategy to try
to try to you know find out weaknesses

3244
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:39,960
to try to you know find out weaknesses
 

3245
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,230
to try to you know find out weaknesses
um and then at the end of the day we

3246
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:42,240
um and then at the end of the day we
 

3247
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,670
um and then at the end of the day we
actually sent them a log of all the

3248
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:43,680
actually sent them a log of all the
 

3249
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,470
actually sent them a log of all the
hands that were played and what cards

3250
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:45,480
hands that were played and what cards
 

3251
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,210
hands that were played and what cards
the bot had on each of those hands oh

3252
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:47,220
the bot had on each of those hands oh
 

3253
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:50,030
the bot had on each of those hands oh
wow yeah that's that's gutsy yeah it was

3254
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:50,040
wow yeah that's that's gutsy yeah it was
 

3255
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,349
wow yeah that's that's gutsy yeah it was
honestly and I'm not sure why we did

3256
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
honestly and I'm not sure why we did
 

3257
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,329
honestly and I'm not sure why we did
that in retrospect but um I mean I'm

3258
00:54:53,329 --> 00:54:53,339
that in retrospect but um I mean I'm
 

3259
00:54:53,339 --> 00:54:54,230
that in retrospect but um I mean I'm
glad we did it because we ended up

3260
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
glad we did it because we ended up
 

3261
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,390
glad we did it because we ended up
winning anyway but that if if you've

3262
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:56,400
winning anyway but that if if you've
 

3263
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:57,829
winning anyway but that if if you've
ever played poker before like that is

3264
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
ever played poker before like that is
 

3265
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,990
ever played poker before like that is
golden information I mean to know

3266
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
golden information I mean to know
 

3267
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,670
golden information I mean to know
usually when you play poker you see

3268
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:01,680
usually when you play poker you see
 

3269
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,829
usually when you play poker you see
about a third of the hands to Showdown

3270
00:55:03,829 --> 00:55:03,839
about a third of the hands to Showdown
 

3271
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:06,470
about a third of the hands to Showdown
um and to just hand them all the cards

3272
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:06,480
um and to just hand them all the cards
 

3273
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,990
um and to just hand them all the cards
that the bot had on every single hand

3274
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:08,000
that the bot had on every single hand
 

3275
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,829
that the bot had on every single hand
that was

3276
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
that was
 

3277
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,809
that was
um just just a gold mine for them yeah

3278
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:11,819
um just just a gold mine for them yeah
 

3279
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:13,430
um just just a gold mine for them yeah
and so then they would review the hands

3280
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:13,440
and so then they would review the hands
 

3281
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,230
and so then they would review the hands
and try to see like okay could they find

3282
00:55:15,230 --> 00:55:15,240
and try to see like okay could they find
 

3283
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:17,089
and try to see like okay could they find
patterns in the bot the weaknesses and

3284
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:17,099
patterns in the bot the weaknesses and
 

3285
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:19,069
patterns in the bot the weaknesses and
could they then then they would

3286
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:19,079
could they then then they would
 

3287
00:55:19,079 --> 00:55:20,630
could they then then they would
coordinate and study together and try to

3288
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
coordinate and study together and try to
 

3289
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,670
coordinate and study together and try to
figure out okay now this person's gonna

3290
00:55:22,670 --> 00:55:22,680
figure out okay now this person's gonna
 

3291
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,230
figure out okay now this person's gonna
explore this part of the strategy for

3292
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:24,240
explore this part of the strategy for
 

3293
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,430
explore this part of the strategy for
weaknesses this person's gonna explore

3294
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:25,440
weaknesses this person's gonna explore
 

3295
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,589
weaknesses this person's gonna explore
this part of the strategy for weaknesses

3296
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
this part of the strategy for weaknesses
 

3297
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,930
this part of the strategy for weaknesses
it's a kind of psychological warfare

3298
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:29,940
it's a kind of psychological warfare
 

3299
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,450
it's a kind of psychological warfare
showing in the hands yeah

3300
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:32,460
showing in the hands yeah
 

3301
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,530
showing in the hands yeah
um I mean I'm sure you didn't think of

3302
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:33,540
um I mean I'm sure you didn't think of
 

3303
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:35,809
um I mean I'm sure you didn't think of
it that way but like doing that means

3304
00:55:35,809 --> 00:55:35,819
it that way but like doing that means
 

3305
00:55:35,819 --> 00:55:38,329
it that way but like doing that means
you're confident in the possibility to

3306
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:38,339
you're confident in the possibility to
 

3307
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:39,770
you're confident in the possibility to
win well that's that's one way of

3308
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:39,780
win well that's that's one way of
 

3309
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,390
win well that's that's one way of
putting it I wasn't uh super confident

3310
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:41,400
putting it I wasn't uh super confident
 

3311
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:42,950
putting it I wasn't uh super confident
yeah so

3312
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
yeah so
 

3313
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,630
yeah so
you know going in like I said I think I

3314
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
you know going in like I said I think I
 

3315
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,270
you know going in like I said I think I
had like 50 50 odds on us winning the

3316
00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:47,280
had like 50 50 odds on us winning the
 

3317
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,650
had like 50 50 odds on us winning the
when we actually when we announced the

3318
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:48,660
when we actually when we announced the
 

3319
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,049
when we actually when we announced the
competition the poker Community decided

3320
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,059
competition the poker Community decided
 

3321
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:53,210
competition the poker Community decided
to gamble on who would win and their

3322
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:53,220
to gamble on who would win and their
 

3323
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,710
to gamble on who would win and their
initial odds against us were like four

3324
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:54,720
initial odds against us were like four
 

3325
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,390
initial odds against us were like four
to one they were really convinced that

3326
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:56,400
to one they were really convinced that
 

3327
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,589
to one they were really convinced that
the humans were gonna

3328
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
the humans were gonna
 

3329
00:55:57,599 --> 00:55:59,390
the humans were gonna
pull out a win

3330
00:55:59,390 --> 00:55:59,400
pull out a win
 

3331
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,549
pull out a win
um the bot ended up winning for three

3332
00:56:01,549 --> 00:56:01,559
um the bot ended up winning for three
 

3333
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:04,370
um the bot ended up winning for three
days straight and even then after three

3334
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:04,380
days straight and even then after three
 

3335
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,870
days straight and even then after three
days the betting odds were still just 50

3336
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:05,880
days the betting odds were still just 50
 

3337
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:07,190
days the betting odds were still just 50
50.

3338
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
50.
 

3339
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,970
50.
um

3340
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:07,980
um
 

3341
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:11,030
um
and then at that point it started to

3342
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:11,040
and then at that point it started to
 

3343
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,790
and then at that point it started to
look like the humans were coming back

3344
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:13,800
look like the humans were coming back
 

3345
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,049
look like the humans were coming back
um they started to like you know but but

3346
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:15,059
um they started to like you know but but
 

3347
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:17,390
um they started to like you know but but
poker is a very high variance game

3348
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:17,400
poker is a very high variance game
 

3349
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,549
poker is a very high variance game
um and I think what happened is like

3350
00:56:19,549 --> 00:56:19,559
um and I think what happened is like
 

3351
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:20,569
um and I think what happened is like
they thought that they spotted some

3352
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:20,579
they thought that they spotted some
 

3353
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,190
they thought that they spotted some
weaknesses that weren't actually there

3354
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:22,200
weaknesses that weren't actually there
 

3355
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,710
weaknesses that weren't actually there
and then around day eight it was just

3356
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:24,720
and then around day eight it was just
 

3357
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,790
and then around day eight it was just
very clear that they were getting

3358
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:25,800
very clear that they were getting
 

3359
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,770
very clear that they were getting
absolutely crushed

3360
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:27,780
absolutely crushed
 

3361
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,809
absolutely crushed
um and and from that point I mean for

3362
00:56:29,809 --> 00:56:29,819
um and and from that point I mean for
 

3363
00:56:29,819 --> 00:56:31,430
um and and from that point I mean for
for a while there I was super stressed

3364
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:31,440
for a while there I was super stressed
 

3365
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,170
for a while there I was super stressed
out thinking like oh my God the humans

3366
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:33,180
out thinking like oh my God the humans
 

3367
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,670
out thinking like oh my God the humans
are coming back and we're just they've

3368
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:34,680
are coming back and we're just they've
 

3369
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,530
are coming back and we're just they've
found weaknesses and now we're just

3370
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:36,540
found weaknesses and now we're just
 

3371
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,270
found weaknesses and now we're just
gonna lose the whole thing but no it

3372
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:38,280
gonna lose the whole thing but no it
 

3373
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,410
gonna lose the whole thing but no it
ended up going in the other direction

3374
00:56:39,410 --> 00:56:39,420
ended up going in the other direction
 

3375
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,270
ended up going in the other direction
and the bot ended up like crushing them

3376
00:56:41,270 --> 00:56:41,280
and the bot ended up like crushing them
 

3377
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,589
and the bot ended up like crushing them
in the long run

3378
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:42,599
in the long run
 

3379
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,130
in the long run
how did it uh feel at the end like as a

3380
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:46,140
how did it uh feel at the end like as a
 

3381
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,470
how did it uh feel at the end like as a
human being what it as a person who

3382
00:56:48,470 --> 00:56:48,480
human being what it as a person who
 

3383

of Poker and the person who appreciates
 

3387
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,589
of Poker and the person who appreciates
the beauty of AI is there did you feel a

3388
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
the beauty of AI is there did you feel a
 

3389
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,150
the beauty of AI is there did you feel a
certain kind of way about it

3390
00:56:59,150 --> 00:56:59,160
certain kind of way about it
 

3391

3394
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:03,900
um I mean at that point in my life I had
 

3395
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,329
um I mean at that point in my life I had
spent five years working on this project

3396
00:57:05,329 --> 00:57:05,339
spent five years working on this project
 

3397
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,049
spent five years working on this project
and um it was a huge sense of

3398
00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:09,059
and um it was a huge sense of
 

3399
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,490
and um it was a huge sense of
accomplishment I mean to spend five

accomplishment I mean to spend five
 

3401
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,870
accomplishment I mean to spend five
years working on something and finally

3402
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:11,880
years working on something and finally
 

3403
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,609
years working on something and finally
see it succeed

3404
00:57:13,609 --> 00:57:13,619
see it succeed
 

3405
00:57:13,619 --> 00:57:14,809
see it succeed
um yeah I wouldn't trade that for

3406
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:14,819
um yeah I wouldn't trade that for
 

3407
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:16,790
um yeah I wouldn't trade that for
anything in the world yeah because it's

3408
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:16,800
anything in the world yeah because it's
 

3409
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,710
anything in the world yeah because it's
uh that's a real Benchmark it's not like

3410
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:18,720
uh that's a real Benchmark it's not like
 

3411
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:22,670
uh that's a real Benchmark it's not like
uh getting us some percent accuracy and

3412
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:22,680
uh getting us some percent accuracy and
 

3413
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,370
uh getting us some percent accuracy and
a data set this is like real this is

3414
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:25,380
a data set this is like real this is
 

3415
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:28,010
a data set this is like real this is
real world it's it's just a game but

3416
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:28,020
real world it's it's just a game but
 

3417
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,930
real world it's it's just a game but
it's also a game it means a lot to a lot

3418
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:29,940
it's also a game it means a lot to a lot
 

3419
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,329
it's also a game it means a lot to a lot
of people and this is humans doing their

3420
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:32,339
of people and this is humans doing their
 

3421
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:34,190
of people and this is humans doing their
best to beat the machine so this is a

3422
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:34,200
best to beat the machine so this is a
 

3423
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,710
best to beat the machine so this is a
real Benchmark unlike anything else yeah

3424
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:36,720
real Benchmark unlike anything else yeah
 

3425
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,809
real Benchmark unlike anything else yeah
and I mean this is this is what I have

3426
00:57:38,809 --> 00:57:38,819
and I mean this is this is what I have
 

3427
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:40,370
and I mean this is this is what I have
been dreaming about since I was like 16

3428
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:40,380
been dreaming about since I was like 16
 

3429
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:42,049
been dreaming about since I was like 16
playing poker you know with my friends

3430
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:42,059
playing poker you know with my friends
 

3431
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,089
playing poker you know with my friends
in high school the idea that you could

3432
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:44,099
in high school the idea that you could
 

3433
00:57:44,099 --> 00:57:46,370
in high school the idea that you could
find a strategy

3434
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:46,380
find a strategy
 

3435
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,750
find a strategy
um you know approximate the national

3436
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:47,760
um you know approximate the national
 

3437
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,549
um you know approximate the national
equilibrium be able to beat all the

3438
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:49,559
equilibrium be able to beat all the
 

3439
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:51,349
equilibrium be able to beat all the
poker players in the world with it you

3440
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
poker players in the world with it you
 

3441
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,270
poker players in the world with it you
know so to actually see that come to

3442
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:53,280
know so to actually see that come to
 

3443
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:56,750
know so to actually see that come to
fruition and be realized uh that was

3444
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:56,760
fruition and be realized uh that was
 

3445
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,309
fruition and be realized uh that was
is kind of magical

3446
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
is kind of magical
 

3447
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,410
is kind of magical
yeah especially money is on the line too

3448
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:00,420
yeah especially money is on the line too
 

3449
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,670
yeah especially money is on the line too
it's a different it's different than

3450
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:01,680
it's a different it's different than
 

3451
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,809
it's a different it's different than
chess

3452
00:58:02,809 --> 00:58:02,819
chess
 

3453
00:58:02,819 --> 00:58:05,990
chess
and that aspect like people get that's

3454
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,000
and that aspect like people get that's
 

3455
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,329
and that aspect like people get that's
why you want to look at Betty Marcus if

3456
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:08,339
why you want to look at Betty Marcus if
 

3457
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:10,069
why you want to look at Betty Marcus if
you want to actually understand what

3458
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:10,079
you want to actually understand what
 

3459
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,470
you want to actually understand what
people really think in the same sense

3460
00:58:12,470 --> 00:58:12,480
people really think in the same sense
 

3461
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,450
people really think in the same sense
poker it's really high stakes because

3462
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:14,460
poker it's really high stakes because
 

3463
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,210
poker it's really high stakes because
it's money and to solve that game that's

3464
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:17,220
it's money and to solve that game that's
 

3465
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:19,790
it's money and to solve that game that's
that's an amazing accomplishment so the

3466
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:19,800
that's an amazing accomplishment so the
 

3467
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,609
that's an amazing accomplishment so the
leap from that to

3468
00:58:21,609 --> 00:58:21,619
leap from that to
 

3469
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:25,609
leap from that to
multi-way six player poker what's how

3470
00:58:25,609 --> 00:58:25,619
multi-way six player poker what's how
 

3471
00:58:25,619 --> 00:58:27,290
multi-way six player poker what's how
difficult does that jump

3472
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:27,300
difficult does that jump
 

3473
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,670
difficult does that jump
and what are some interesting

3474
00:58:28,670 --> 00:58:28,680
and what are some interesting
 

3475
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,410
and what are some interesting
differences between heads up poker and

3476
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:30,420
differences between heads up poker and
 

3477
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,589
differences between heads up poker and
and multi-way poker yeah so I mentioned

3478
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:33,599
and multi-way poker yeah so I mentioned
 

3479
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:35,450
and multi-way poker yeah so I mentioned
you know Nash equilibrium and two player

3480
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:35,460
you know Nash equilibrium and two player
 

3481
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:36,950
you know Nash equilibrium and two player
zero-sum games

3482
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:36,960
zero-sum games
 

3483
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,690
zero-sum games
if you play that strategy you are

3484
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:38,700
if you play that strategy you are
 

3485
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,370
if you play that strategy you are
guaranteed to not lose an expectation no

3486
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:40,380
guaranteed to not lose an expectation no
 

3487
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:42,349
guaranteed to not lose an expectation no
matter what your opponent does now once

3488
00:58:42,349 --> 00:58:42,359
matter what your opponent does now once
 

3489
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:43,730
matter what your opponent does now once
you go to six player poker you're no

3490
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:43,740
you go to six player poker you're no
 

3491
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:44,990
you go to six player poker you're no
longer playing a two player zero-sum

3492
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:45,000
longer playing a two player zero-sum
 

3493
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,609
longer playing a two player zero-sum
game and so there was a lot of debate

3494
00:58:46,609 --> 00:58:46,619
game and so there was a lot of debate
 

3495
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,170
game and so there was a lot of debate
among the academic community and among

3496
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:48,180
among the academic community and among
 

3497
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,270
among the academic community and among
the poker Community about how well these

3498
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:50,280
the poker Community about how well these
 

3499
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,490
the poker Community about how well these
techniques would extend beyond just

3500
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:52,500
techniques would extend beyond just
 

3501
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,789
techniques would extend beyond just
two-player heads-up poker now

3502
00:58:55,789 --> 00:58:55,799
two-player heads-up poker now
 

3503
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:58,849
two-player heads-up poker now
what I have come to realize is that

3504
00:58:58,849 --> 00:58:58,859
what I have come to realize is that
 

3505
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:00,950
what I have come to realize is that
um the techniques actually I thought

3506
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:00,960
um the techniques actually I thought
 

3507
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,530
um the techniques actually I thought
really would extend to six player poker

3508
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:03,540
really would extend to six player poker
 

3509
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,870
really would extend to six player poker
because even though in theory they don't

3510
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:05,880
because even though in theory they don't
 

3511
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,609
because even though in theory they don't
give you these guarantees outside of two

3512
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:07,619
give you these guarantees outside of two
 

3513
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:09,650
give you these guarantees outside of two
player zero some games in practice it

3514
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:09,660
player zero some games in practice it
 

3515
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,690
player zero some games in practice it
still gives you a really strong strategy

3516
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:11,700
still gives you a really strong strategy
 

3517
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:13,849
still gives you a really strong strategy
now there were a lot of complications

3518
00:59:13,849 --> 00:59:13,859
now there were a lot of complications
 

3519
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:16,010
now there were a lot of complications
that would come up with six player poker

3520
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:16,020
that would come up with six player poker
 

3521
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,049
that would come up with six player poker
besides like the game theoretic aspect I

3522
00:59:18,049 --> 00:59:18,059
besides like the game theoretic aspect I
 

3523
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:19,849
besides like the game theoretic aspect I
mean for one the game is Just

3524
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:19,859
mean for one the game is Just
 

3525
00:59:19,859 --> 00:59:22,190
mean for one the game is Just
exponentially larger

3526
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:22,200
exponentially larger
 

3527
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,829
exponentially larger
um so the main thing that allowed us to

3528
00:59:24,829 --> 00:59:24,839
um so the main thing that allowed us to
 

3529
00:59:24,839 --> 00:59:27,230
um so the main thing that allowed us to
go from two player to six player was the

3530
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,240
go from two player to six player was the
 

3531
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:29,210
go from two player to six player was the
idea of depth limited search

3532
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:29,220
idea of depth limited search
 

3533
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:31,430
idea of depth limited search
so I said before like you know we would

3534
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:31,440
so I said before like you know we would
 

3535
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,589
so I said before like you know we would
do search we would plan out the bot

3536
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
do search we would plan out the bot
 

3537
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,089
do search we would plan out the bot
would plan out like what what it's going

3538
00:59:35,089 --> 00:59:35,099
would plan out like what what it's going
 

3539
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:36,470
would plan out like what what it's going
to do next and for the next several

3540
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:36,480
to do next and for the next several
 

3541
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,870
to do next and for the next several
moves and in liberatis that search was

3542
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:38,880
moves and in liberatis that search was
 

3543
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,730
moves and in liberatis that search was
done extending all the way to the end of

3544
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:40,740
done extending all the way to the end of
 

3545
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,370
done extending all the way to the end of
the game so it would have to start

3546
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:43,380
the game so it would have to start
 

3547
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,390
the game so it would have to start
um it from from the turn onwards like

3548
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:47,400
um it from from the turn onwards like
 

3549
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,609
um it from from the turn onwards like
looking maybe 10 moves ahead

3550
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:49,619
looking maybe 10 moves ahead
 

3551
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,770
looking maybe 10 moves ahead
um it would have to figure out what it

3552
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:51,780
um it would have to figure out what it
 

3553
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,510
um it would have to figure out what it
was doing for all those moves

3554
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
was doing for all those moves
 

3555
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,430
was doing for all those moves
now when you get to six player poker it

3556
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
now when you get to six player poker it
 

3557
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,170
now when you get to six player poker it
can't do that exhaustive search anymore

3558
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:57,180
can't do that exhaustive search anymore
 

3559
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,049
can't do that exhaustive search anymore
because the game is just way too large

3560
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:00,059
because the game is just way too large
 

3561
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:02,569
because the game is just way too large
um but by only having to look a few

3562
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:02,579
um but by only having to look a few
 

3563
01:00:02,579 --> 01:00:04,670
um but by only having to look a few
moves ahead and then stopping there and

3564
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:04,680
moves ahead and then stopping there and
 

3565
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,589
moves ahead and then stopping there and
substituting a Value Estimate of like

3566
01:00:06,589 --> 01:00:06,599
substituting a Value Estimate of like
 

3567
01:00:06,599 --> 01:00:08,270
substituting a Value Estimate of like
how good is that strategy at that point

3568
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:08,280
how good is that strategy at that point
 

3569
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,910
how good is that strategy at that point
then we're able to do a much more

3570
01:00:10,910 --> 01:00:10,920
then we're able to do a much more
 

3571
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:14,089
then we're able to do a much more
scalable form of search

3572
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:14,099

 

3573
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:16,010

is there something cool looking at the

3574
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:16,020
is there something cool looking at the
 

3575
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,930
is there something cool looking at the
paper right now is there something cool

3576
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:17,940
paper right now is there something cool
 

3577
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,690
paper right now is there something cool
in the paper in terms of Graphics a game

3578
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:20,700
in the paper in terms of Graphics a game
 

3579
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,789
in the paper in terms of Graphics a game
tree Traverse of via Monte Carlo I think

3580
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:22,799
tree Traverse of via Monte Carlo I think
 

3581
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,510
tree Traverse of via Monte Carlo I think
if you go down a bit uh

3582
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
if you go down a bit uh
 

3583
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:28,250
if you go down a bit uh
uh figure one an example of equilibrium

3584
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:28,260
uh figure one an example of equilibrium
 

3585
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:31,430
uh figure one an example of equilibrium
selection problem ooh so yeah uh what do

3586
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:31,440
selection problem ooh so yeah uh what do
 

3587
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,530
selection problem ooh so yeah uh what do
we know about equilibria one is there's

3588
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:33,540
we know about equilibria one is there's
 

3589
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,530
we know about equilibria one is there's
multiple players so when you go outside

3590
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:36,540
multiple players so when you go outside
 

3591
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,750
multiple players so when you go outside
of two players you're a sum so a Nash

3592
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:38,760
of two players you're a sum so a Nash
 

3593
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,190
of two players you're a sum so a Nash
equilibrium is a set of strategies like

3594
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:40,200
equilibrium is a set of strategies like
 

3595
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,289
equilibrium is a set of strategies like
one strategy for each player where no

3596
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:42,299
one strategy for each player where no
 

3597
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,690
one strategy for each player where no
player has an incentive to switch to a

3598
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:44,700
player has an incentive to switch to a
 

3599
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,670
player has an incentive to switch to a
different strategy

3600
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:46,680
different strategy
 

3601
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,289
different strategy
um and so you can kind of think of it as

3602
01:00:48,289 --> 01:00:48,299
um and so you can kind of think of it as
 

3603
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:50,270
um and so you can kind of think of it as
like imagine you have a game where

3604
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:50,280
like imagine you have a game where
 

3605
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,370
like imagine you have a game where
there's a ring that's actually the

3606
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:52,380
there's a ring that's actually the
 

3607
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:54,829
there's a ring that's actually the
visual here you got a ring and the

3608
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:54,839
visual here you got a ring and the
 

3609
01:00:54,839 --> 01:00:56,329
visual here you got a ring and the
object of the game is to be as far away

3610
01:00:56,329 --> 01:00:56,339
object of the game is to be as far away
 

3611
01:00:56,339 --> 01:00:58,670
object of the game is to be as far away
from the other players as possible

3612
01:00:58,670 --> 01:00:58,680
from the other players as possible
 

3613
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,309
from the other players as possible
there's an ash equilibrium is for all

3614
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:01,319
there's an ash equilibrium is for all
 

3615
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:03,049
there's an ash equilibrium is for all
the players to be spaced equally apart

3616
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:03,059
the players to be spaced equally apart
 

3617
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,430
the players to be spaced equally apart
around this ring

3618
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:04,440
around this ring
 

3619
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:05,809
around this ring
but there's infinitely many different

3620
01:01:05,809 --> 01:01:05,819
but there's infinitely many different
 

3621
01:01:05,819 --> 01:01:07,250
but there's infinitely many different
Nash equilibria right there's infinitely

3622
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,260
Nash equilibria right there's infinitely
 

3623
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:09,950
Nash equilibria right there's infinitely
many ways to space four dots along a

3624
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:09,960
many ways to space four dots along a
 

3625
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,910
many ways to space four dots along a
ring

3626
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
ring
 

3627
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:14,089
ring
And if every single player independently

3628
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:14,099
And if every single player independently
 

3629
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,069
And if every single player independently
computes a Nash equilibrium

3630
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
computes a Nash equilibrium
 

3631
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,589
computes a Nash equilibrium
then there's no guarantee that the joint

3632
01:01:18,589 --> 01:01:18,599
then there's no guarantee that the joint
 

3633
01:01:18,599 --> 01:01:20,690
then there's no guarantee that the joint
strategy that they're all playing is

3634
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:20,700
strategy that they're all playing is
 

3635
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,130
strategy that they're all playing is
going to result is going to be in Ash

3636
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:22,140
going to result is going to be in Ash
 

3637
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,870
going to result is going to be in Ash
equilibrium there they're just going to

3638
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:23,880
equilibrium there they're just going to
 

3639
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,309
equilibrium there they're just going to
be like random dots scattered along this

3640
01:01:25,309 --> 01:01:25,319
be like random dots scattered along this
 

3641
01:01:25,319 --> 01:01:27,650
be like random dots scattered along this
ring rather than four coordinated dots

3642
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:27,660
ring rather than four coordinated dots
 

3643
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:29,270
ring rather than four coordinated dots
being equally spaced apart is it

3644
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:29,280
being equally spaced apart is it
 

3645
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,829
being equally spaced apart is it
possible to sort of optimally do this

3646
01:01:30,829 --> 01:01:30,839
possible to sort of optimally do this
 

3647
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:32,630
possible to sort of optimally do this
kind of selection

3648
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:32,640
kind of selection
 

3649
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,809
kind of selection
to do the selection about

3650
01:01:35,809 --> 01:01:35,819
to do the selection about
 

3651
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:37,849
to do the selection about
um of the equilibrium you're chasing so

3652
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:37,859
um of the equilibrium you're chasing so
 

3653
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:39,410
um of the equilibrium you're chasing so
is there like a meta problem to be

3654
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:39,420
is there like a meta problem to be
 

3655
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,690
is there like a meta problem to be
solved here so the meta problem is in

3656
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:41,700
solved here so the meta problem is in
 

3657
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:42,589
solved here so the meta problem is in
some sense

3658
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:42,599
some sense
 

3659
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:44,750
some sense
um how do you how do you understand the

3660
01:01:44,750 --> 01:01:44,760
um how do you how do you understand the
 

3661
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,829
um how do you how do you understand the
national equilibria that the other

3662
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
national equilibria that the other
 

3663
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,930
national equilibria that the other
players are going to play

3664
01:01:47,930 --> 01:01:47,940
players are going to play
 

3665
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:51,170
players are going to play
um and and even if you do that again

3666
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:51,180
um and and even if you do that again
 

3667
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:52,609
um and and even if you do that again
there's no guarantee that you're going

3668
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:52,619
there's no guarantee that you're going
 

3669
01:01:52,619 --> 01:01:54,230
there's no guarantee that you're going
to win so

3670
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:54,240
to win so
 

3671
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,089
to win so
you know if you're playing

3672
01:01:56,089 --> 01:01:56,099
you know if you're playing
 

3673
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:58,309
you know if you're playing
uh if you're playing risk like I said

3674
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
uh if you're playing risk like I said
 

3675
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,930
uh if you're playing risk like I said
and and all the other players decide to

3676
01:01:59,930 --> 01:01:59,940
and and all the other players decide to
 

3677
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:01,549
and and all the other players decide to
team up against you You're Gonna Lose

3678
01:02:01,549 --> 01:02:01,559
team up against you You're Gonna Lose
 

3679
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,770
team up against you You're Gonna Lose
Nash equilibrium doesn't help you there

3680
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:03,780
Nash equilibrium doesn't help you there
 

3681
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:06,470
Nash equilibrium doesn't help you there
and so there was this big debate about

3682
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:06,480
and so there was this big debate about
 

3683
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:08,329
and so there was this big debate about
whether Nash equilibrium and all these

3684
01:02:08,329 --> 01:02:08,339
whether Nash equilibrium and all these
 

3685
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:10,069
whether Nash equilibrium and all these
techniques that compute it are even

3686
01:02:10,069 --> 01:02:10,079
techniques that compute it are even
 

3687
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:11,809
techniques that compute it are even
useful once you go outside of two player

3688
01:02:11,809 --> 01:02:11,819
useful once you go outside of two player
 

3689
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:14,630
useful once you go outside of two player
zero some games now I think for many

3690
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
zero some games now I think for many
 

3691
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,670
zero some games now I think for many
games there is a valid criticism here

3692
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:16,680
games there is a valid criticism here
 

3693
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,289
games there is a valid criticism here
and I think when we talk about when we

3694
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:18,299
and I think when we talk about when we
 

3695
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,150
and I think when we talk about when we
go to something like diplomacy we run

3696
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:20,160
go to something like diplomacy we run
 

3697
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,690
go to something like diplomacy we run
into this issue that the approach of

3698
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:23,700
into this issue that the approach of
 

3699
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:25,430
into this issue that the approach of
trying to approximate a Nash equilibrium

3700
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:25,440
trying to approximate a Nash equilibrium
 

3701
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,430
trying to approximate a Nash equilibrium
doesn't really work anymore but it turns

3702
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:28,440
doesn't really work anymore but it turns
 

3703
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,589
doesn't really work anymore but it turns
out that in six player poker

3704
01:02:30,589 --> 01:02:30,599
out that in six player poker
 

3705
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,210
out that in six player poker
um because six player poker is such an

3706
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:32,220
um because six player poker is such an
 

3707
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:34,190
um because six player poker is such an
adversarial game

3708
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:34,200
adversarial game
 

3709
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,470
adversarial game
um where none of the players really try

3710
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:36,480
um where none of the players really try
 

3711
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,970
um where none of the players really try
to work with each other

3712
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:37,980
to work with each other
 

3713
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:39,589
to work with each other
the techniques that were used in

3714
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,599
the techniques that were used in
 

3715
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:41,150
the techniques that were used in
two-player poker to try to approximate

3716
01:02:41,150 --> 01:02:41,160
two-player poker to try to approximate
 

3717
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,890
two-player poker to try to approximate
an equilibrium those still end up

3718
01:02:42,890 --> 01:02:42,900
an equilibrium those still end up
 

3719
01:02:42,900 --> 01:02:44,809
an equilibrium those still end up
working in practice in in six player

3720
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:44,819
working in practice in in six player
 

3721
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:47,030
working in practice in in six player
poker there's some

3722
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:47,040
poker there's some
 

3723
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,490
poker there's some
deep way in which six player poker is

3724
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:49,500
deep way in which six player poker is
 

3725
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,950
deep way in which six player poker is
just a bunch of heads up poker like

3726
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:51,960
just a bunch of heads up poker like
 

3727
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,890
just a bunch of heads up poker like
games in one it's like uh it's like

3728
01:02:54,890 --> 01:02:54,900
games in one it's like uh it's like
 

3729
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,010
games in one it's like uh it's like
embedded in it so the competitiveness

3730
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:58,020
embedded in it so the competitiveness
 

3731
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:00,589
embedded in it so the competitiveness
um is more fundamental to Poker than the

3732
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:00,599
um is more fundamental to Poker than the
 

3733
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,930
um is more fundamental to Poker than the
cooperation right yeah poker is just

3734
01:03:02,930 --> 01:03:02,940
cooperation right yeah poker is just
 

3735
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:04,549
cooperation right yeah poker is just
such an adversarial game there's no real

3736
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:04,559
such an adversarial game there's no real
 

3737
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:06,049
such an adversarial game there's no real
cooperation in fact you're not even

3738
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:06,059
cooperation in fact you're not even
 

3739
01:03:06,059 --> 01:03:07,609
cooperation in fact you're not even
allowed to cooperate in poker it's

3740
01:03:07,609 --> 01:03:07,619
allowed to cooperate in poker it's
 

3741
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:08,870
allowed to cooperate in poker it's
considered collusion it's against the

3742
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
considered collusion it's against the
 

3743
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,309
considered collusion it's against the
rules

3744
01:03:10,309 --> 01:03:10,319
rules
 

3745
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:11,089
rules
um

3746
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:11,099
um
 

3747
01:03:11,099 --> 01:03:12,829
um
and so for that reason the techniques

3748
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:12,839
and so for that reason the techniques
 

3749
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:14,150
and so for that reason the techniques
end up working really well and I think

3750
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:14,160
end up working really well and I think
 

3751
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:16,490
end up working really well and I think
that's true more more broadly in

01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:16,500
that's true more more broadly in
 

3753

3755
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:19,849

so what are some interesting things

3802
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:06,900
so what are some interesting things
 

3803
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,589
so what are some interesting things
about uh pluribus that was able to

about uh pluribus that was able to
 

3805
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:11,450
about uh pluribus that was able to
achieve human level performance on this

six player version of Poker I personally
 

3811
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:18,170
six player version of Poker I personally
I think the most interesting interesting

3812
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:18,180
I think the most interesting interesting
 

3813
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,630
I think the most interesting interesting
thing about pluribus is that it was so

3814
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
thing about pluribus is that it was so
 

3815
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:23,030
thing about pluribus is that it was so
much cheaper than libratus I mean

3816
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:23,040
much cheaper than libratus I mean
 

3817
01:04:23,040 --> 01:04:25,549
much cheaper than libratus I mean
libratus if you had to put a price tag

3818
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:25,559
libratus if you had to put a price tag
 

3819
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,230
libratus if you had to put a price tag
on on the computational resources that

3820
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:27,240
on on the computational resources that
 

3821
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,549
on on the computational resources that
went into it I would say the final

3822
01:04:28,549 --> 01:04:28,559
went into it I would say the final
 

3823
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,750
went into it I would say the final
training run took about a hundred

3824
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:29,760
training run took about a hundred
 

3825
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,010
training run took about a hundred
thousand dollars

3826
01:04:31,010 --> 01:04:31,020
thousand dollars
 

3827
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,829
thousand dollars
you go to pluribus the final training

3828
01:04:33,829 --> 01:04:33,839
you go to pluribus the final training
 

3829
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:37,370
you go to pluribus the final training
run would cost like less than 150 on AWS

3830
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:37,380
run would cost like less than 150 on AWS
 

3831
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:40,430
run would cost like less than 150 on AWS
is this normalized to computational

3832
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:40,440
is this normalized to computational
 

3833
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:43,549
is this normalized to computational
inflation so meaning uh this is is this

3834
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:43,559
inflation so meaning uh this is is this
 

3835
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:46,069
inflation so meaning uh this is is this
just does this just have to do with the

3836
01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:46,079
just does this just have to do with the
 

3837
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,870
just does this just have to do with the
fact that pluribus was trained like a

3838
01:04:47,870 --> 01:04:47,880
fact that pluribus was trained like a
 

3839
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,950
fact that pluribus was trained like a
year later

3840
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
year later
 

3841
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,170
year later
no no it's not it's I mean first of all

3842
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:51,180
no no it's not it's I mean first of all
 

3843
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,329
no no it's not it's I mean first of all
like yeah Computing resources are are

3844
01:04:53,329 --> 01:04:53,339
like yeah Computing resources are are
 

3845
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:55,430
like yeah Computing resources are are
getting cheaper every day and like but

3846
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:55,440
getting cheaper every day and like but
 

3847
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,349
getting cheaper every day and like but
you're not going to see a thousand-fold

3848
01:04:57,349 --> 01:04:57,359
you're not going to see a thousand-fold
 

3849
01:04:57,359 --> 01:04:59,089
you're not going to see a thousand-fold
decrease in the computational resources

3850
01:04:59,089 --> 01:04:59,099
decrease in the computational resources
 

3851
01:04:59,099 --> 01:05:00,589
decrease in the computational resources
over two years

3852
01:05:00,589 --> 01:05:00,599
over two years
 

3853
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,329
over two years
um or even anywhere close to that the

3854
01:05:02,329 --> 01:05:02,339
um or even anywhere close to that the
 

3855
01:05:02,339 --> 01:05:04,069
um or even anywhere close to that the
the real Improvement was algorithmic

3856
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:04,079
the real Improvement was algorithmic
 

3857
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,349
the real Improvement was algorithmic
improvements and in particular the

3858
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:06,359
improvements and in particular the
 

3859
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:08,270
improvements and in particular the
ability to do depth limited search

3860
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:08,280
ability to do depth limited search
 

3861
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,490
ability to do depth limited search
so it does depth limited search also

3862
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:10,500
so it does depth limited search also
 

3863
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,390
so it does depth limited search also
work for libratus yeah yes so where this

3864
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:14,400
work for libratus yeah yes so where this
 

3865
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,010
work for libratus yeah yes so where this
deploymented search came from is you

3866
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:16,020
deploymented search came from is you
 

3867
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,710
deploymented search came from is you
know I I developed this technique and

3868
01:05:18,710 --> 01:05:18,720
know I I developed this technique and
 

3869
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:21,470
know I I developed this technique and
um ran it on two-player poker first and

3870
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:21,480
um ran it on two-player poker first and
 

3871
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:23,870
um ran it on two-player poker first and
that reduced the computational resources

3872
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:23,880
that reduced the computational resources
 

3873
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,910
that reduced the computational resources
needed to make an AI that was superhuman

3874
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:25,920
needed to make an AI that was superhuman
 

3875
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:27,829
needed to make an AI that was superhuman
from you know a hundred thousand dollars

3876
01:05:27,829 --> 01:05:27,839
from you know a hundred thousand dollars
 

3877
01:05:27,839 --> 01:05:30,230
from you know a hundred thousand dollars
for the broadest to something you could

3878
01:05:30,230 --> 01:05:30,240
for the broadest to something you could
 

3879
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:32,270
for the broadest to something you could
train on your laptop what do you learn

3880
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:32,280
train on your laptop what do you learn
 

3881
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:34,789
train on your laptop what do you learn
from that

3882
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799

 

3883
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,829

um from that discovery

3884
01:05:36,829 --> 01:05:36,839
um from that discovery
 

3885
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:38,510
um from that discovery
what I would take away from that is that

3886
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:38,520
what I would take away from that is that
 

3887
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,770
what I would take away from that is that
algorithmic improvements really do

3888
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:39,780
algorithmic improvements really do
 

3889
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:41,990
algorithmic improvements really do
matter how would you describe the more

3890
01:05:41,990 --> 01:05:42,000
matter how would you describe the more
 

3891
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,109
matter how would you describe the more
General case of limited Dev search

3892
01:05:45,109 --> 01:05:45,119
General case of limited Dev search
 

3893
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,270
General case of limited Dev search
so it's basically constraining the scale

3894
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
so it's basically constraining the scale
 

3895
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,390
so it's basically constraining the scale
a temporal or in some other way of the

3896
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
a temporal or in some other way of the
 

3897
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,190
a temporal or in some other way of the
computation you're doing in some clever

3898
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:52,200
computation you're doing in some clever
 

3899
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,210
computation you're doing in some clever
way

3900
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:53,220
way
 

3901
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,089
way
so like with like how else can you

3902
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:56,099
so like with like how else can you
 

3903
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:58,069
so like with like how else can you
significantly constrain computation

3904
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
significantly constrain computation
 

3905
01:05:58,079 --> 01:05:59,510
significantly constrain computation
right

3906
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
right
 

3907
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,089
right
well I think the idea is that we want to

3908
01:06:02,089 --> 01:06:02,099
well I think the idea is that we want to
 

3909
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:03,589
well I think the idea is that we want to
be able to leverage search as much as

3910
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:03,599
be able to leverage search as much as
 

3911
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,270
be able to leverage search as much as
possible and the way that we were doing

3912
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:05,280
possible and the way that we were doing
 

3913
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,069
possible and the way that we were doing
it in liberatis required us to search

3914
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:07,079
it in liberatis required us to search
 

3915
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:08,870
it in liberatis required us to search
all the way to the end of the game now

3916
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
all the way to the end of the game now
 

3917
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,190
all the way to the end of the game now
if you're playing a game like chess the

3918
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:10,200
if you're playing a game like chess the
 

3919
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,329
if you're playing a game like chess the
idea that you're going to search always

3920
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:11,339
idea that you're going to search always
 

3921
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,430
idea that you're going to search always
to the end of the game is kind of

3922
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
to the end of the game is kind of
 

3923
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:14,750
to the end of the game is kind of
unimaginable right like there's just so

3924
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:14,760
unimaginable right like there's just so
 

3925
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,069
unimaginable right like there's just so
many situations where you just won't be

3926
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:16,079
many situations where you just won't be
 

3927
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,049
many situations where you just won't be
able to use search in that case or the

3928
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:18,059
able to use search in that case or the
 

3929
01:06:18,059 --> 01:06:19,490
able to use search in that case or the
cost would be

3930
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:19,500
cost would be
 

3931
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:20,809
cost would be
um you know prohibitive

3932
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:20,819
um you know prohibitive
 

3933
01:06:20,819 --> 01:06:24,650
um you know prohibitive
and this technique allowed us to

3934
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:24,660
and this technique allowed us to
 

3935
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,289
and this technique allowed us to
leverage search and without having to

3936
01:06:27,289 --> 01:06:27,299
leverage search and without having to
 

3937
01:06:27,299 --> 01:06:29,089
leverage search and without having to
pay such a huge computational cost for

3938
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:29,099
pay such a huge computational cost for
 

3939
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:31,309
pay such a huge computational cost for
it and be able to apply it more broadly

3940
01:06:31,309 --> 01:06:31,319
it and be able to apply it more broadly
 

3941
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:33,589
it and be able to apply it more broadly
so to what degree did you use neural

3942
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
so to what degree did you use neural
 

3943
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:36,950
so to what degree did you use neural
nets for uh libratus and pluribus and

3944
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:36,960
nets for uh libratus and pluribus and
 

3945
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:39,109
nets for uh libratus and pluribus and
more generally what role do neural Nets

3946
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
more generally what role do neural Nets
 

3947
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,190
more generally what role do neural Nets
have to play

3948
01:06:40,190 --> 01:06:40,200
have to play
 

3949
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:43,549
have to play
in um in super human level performance

3950
01:06:43,549 --> 01:06:43,559
in um in super human level performance
 

3951
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:45,950
in um in super human level performance
in poker so we actually did not use

3952
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:45,960
in poker so we actually did not use
 

3953
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,990
in poker so we actually did not use
neural Nets at all for libratus or

3954
01:06:47,990 --> 01:06:48,000
neural Nets at all for libratus or
 

3955
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,170
neural Nets at all for libratus or
pluribus and a lot of people found this

3956
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:51,180
pluribus and a lot of people found this
 

3957
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,390
pluribus and a lot of people found this
surprising back in 2017 I think they

3958
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:53,400
surprising back in 2017 I think they
 

3959
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:55,309
surprising back in 2017 I think they
found it surprising today

3960
01:06:55,309 --> 01:06:55,319
found it surprising today
 

3961
01:06:55,319 --> 01:06:57,349
found it surprising today
um that we were able to do this without

3962
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
um that we were able to do this without
 

3963
01:06:57,359 --> 01:06:59,569
um that we were able to do this without
using any neural Nets um

3964
01:06:59,569 --> 01:06:59,579
using any neural Nets um
 

3965
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:01,789
using any neural Nets um
and I think the reason for that I mean I

3966
01:07:01,789 --> 01:07:01,799
and I think the reason for that I mean I
 

3967
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:03,710
and I think the reason for that I mean I
think neural Nets are

3968
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:03,720
think neural Nets are
 

3969
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:05,990
think neural Nets are
um incredibly powerful and the

3970
01:07:05,990 --> 01:07:06,000
um incredibly powerful and the
 

3971
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,250
um incredibly powerful and the
techniques that are used today even for

3972
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:07,260
techniques that are used today even for
 

3973
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,250
techniques that are used today even for
poker AIS do rely uh quite heavily on

3974
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:10,260
poker AIS do rely uh quite heavily on
 

3975
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,690
poker AIS do rely uh quite heavily on
neural Nets

3976
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:11,700
neural Nets
 

3977
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,849
neural Nets
um but it wasn't the main challenge for

3978
01:07:13,849 --> 01:07:13,859
um but it wasn't the main challenge for
 

3979
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:16,190
um but it wasn't the main challenge for
poker like I think what neural Nets are

3980
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:16,200
poker like I think what neural Nets are
 

3981
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,349
poker like I think what neural Nets are
really good for if you're in a situation

3982
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:18,359
really good for if you're in a situation
 

3983
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:20,990
really good for if you're in a situation
where finding features for a value

3984
01:07:20,990 --> 01:07:21,000
where finding features for a value
 

3985
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,569
where finding features for a value
function is really difficult then neural

3986
01:07:23,569 --> 01:07:23,579
function is really difficult then neural
 

3987
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:25,130
function is really difficult then neural
Nets are really powerful and this was

3988
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:25,140
Nets are really powerful and this was
 

3989
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:26,870
Nets are really powerful and this was
the problem in go right like the problem

3990
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:26,880
the problem in go right like the problem
 

3991
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,829
the problem in go right like the problem
and go

3992
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:27,839
and go
 

3993
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:30,349
and go
was that or the final problem in go at

3994
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:30,359
was that or the final problem in go at
 

3995
01:07:30,359 --> 01:07:32,510
was that or the final problem in go at
least was that nobody had a good way of

3996
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:32,520
least was that nobody had a good way of
 

3997
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,150
least was that nobody had a good way of
looking at a board and figuring out who

3998
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:35,160
looking at a board and figuring out who
 

3999
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:37,370
looking at a board and figuring out who
was winning or describing

4000
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:37,380
was winning or describing
 

4001
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,870
was winning or describing
um through a simple algorithm who was

4002
01:07:38,870 --> 01:07:38,880
um through a simple algorithm who was
 

4003
01:07:38,880 --> 01:07:40,130
um through a simple algorithm who was
winning or losing

4004
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:40,140
winning or losing
 

4005
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,589
winning or losing
and so there neural Nets were super

4006
01:07:42,589 --> 01:07:42,599
and so there neural Nets were super
 

4007
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,690
and so there neural Nets were super
helpful because you could just feed in a

4008
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:44,700
helpful because you could just feed in a
 

4009
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:46,069
helpful because you could just feed in a
ton of different board positions into

4010
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
ton of different board positions into
 

4011
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:47,870
ton of different board positions into
this neural net and it would be able to

4012
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:47,880
this neural net and it would be able to
 

4013
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,430
this neural net and it would be able to
predict then who was winning or losing

4014
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
predict then who was winning or losing
 

4015
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,849
predict then who was winning or losing
but in poker the features weren't the

4016
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:52,859
but in poker the features weren't the
 

4017
01:07:52,859 --> 01:07:55,250
but in poker the features weren't the
challenge the the challenge was how do

4018
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:55,260
challenge the the challenge was how do
 

4019
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:58,190
challenge the the challenge was how do
you design a scalable algorithm that

4020
01:07:58,190 --> 01:07:58,200
you design a scalable algorithm that
 

4021
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,410
you design a scalable algorithm that
would allow you to find this balance

4022
01:08:00,410 --> 01:08:00,420
would allow you to find this balance
 

4023
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,930
would allow you to find this balance
strategy that would understand that you

4024
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:02,940
strategy that would understand that you
 

4025
01:08:02,940 --> 01:08:05,510
strategy that would understand that you
have to Bluff with the right probability

4026
01:08:05,510 --> 01:08:05,520
have to Bluff with the right probability
 

4027
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,569
have to Bluff with the right probability
so can that be somehow incorporated into

4028
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:08,579
so can that be somehow incorporated into
 

4029
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:11,630
so can that be somehow incorporated into
the value function this

4030
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:11,640
the value function this
 

4031
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,029
the value function this
the complexity of polka that you've

4032
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,039
the complexity of polka that you've
 

4033
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:16,249
the complexity of polka that you've
described yeah so the way the value

4034
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,259
described yeah so the way the value
 

4035
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:18,229
described yeah so the way the value
functions work in like the latest and

4036
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
functions work in like the latest and
 

4037
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,329
functions work in like the latest and
greatest poker AIS they do use neural

4038
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:20,339
greatest poker AIS they do use neural
 

4039
01:08:20,339 --> 01:08:22,729
greatest poker AIS they do use neural
nets for the value function the way it's

4040
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:22,739
nets for the value function the way it's
 

4041
01:08:22,739 --> 01:08:24,890
nets for the value function the way it's
done is is very different from how it's

4042
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:24,900
done is is very different from how it's
 

4043
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:26,890
done is is very different from how it's
done in a game like chess or go because

4044
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:26,900
done in a game like chess or go because
 

4045
01:08:26,900 --> 01:08:29,930
done in a game like chess or go because
in poker you have to reason about

4046
01:08:29,930 --> 01:08:29,940
in poker you have to reason about
 

4047
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:34,030
in poker you have to reason about
beliefs and so the value of a state

4048
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:34,040
beliefs and so the value of a state
 

4049
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,650
beliefs and so the value of a state
depends on the beliefs that players have

4050
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:36,660
depends on the beliefs that players have
 

4051
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:39,530
depends on the beliefs that players have
about what the different cards are like

4052
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:39,540
about what the different cards are like
 

4053
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,130
about what the different cards are like
if you have pocket aces then whether

4054
01:08:43,130 --> 01:08:43,140
if you have pocket aces then whether
 

4055
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,930
if you have pocket aces then whether
that's a really really good hand or just

4056
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:44,940
that's a really really good hand or just
 

4057
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:47,030
that's a really really good hand or just
an okay hand depends on whether you know

4058
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
an okay hand depends on whether you know
 

4059
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,070
an okay hand depends on whether you know
I have pocket aces where like if you

4060
01:08:49,070 --> 01:08:49,080
I have pocket aces where like if you
 

4061
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,890
I have pocket aces where like if you
know that I have pocket aces then if I

4062
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:51,900
know that I have pocket aces then if I
 

4063
01:08:51,900 --> 01:08:53,689
know that I have pocket aces then if I
bet you're going to fold immediately but

4064
01:08:53,689 --> 01:08:53,699
bet you're going to fold immediately but
 

4065
01:08:53,699 --> 01:08:55,010
bet you're going to fold immediately but
if you think that I have a really bad

4066
01:08:55,010 --> 01:08:55,020
if you think that I have a really bad
 

4067
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,229
if you think that I have a really bad
hand then I could bet with pocket aces

4068
01:08:57,229 --> 01:08:57,239
hand then I could bet with pocket aces
 

4069
01:08:57,239 --> 01:08:59,689
hand then I could bet with pocket aces
and make a ton of money so

4070
01:08:59,689 --> 01:08:59,699
and make a ton of money so
 

4071
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:02,570
and make a ton of money so
the value function in poker these days

4072
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:02,580
the value function in poker these days
 

4073
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:05,510
the value function in poker these days
takes the beliefs as an input which is

4074
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:05,520
takes the beliefs as an input which is
 

4075
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,249
takes the beliefs as an input which is
very different from like how how chess

4076
01:09:07,249 --> 01:09:07,259
very different from like how how chess
 

4077
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:08,930
very different from like how how chess
and go AIS work

4078
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:08,940
and go AIS work
 

4079
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:11,809
and go AIS work
so as a person who appreciates the game

4080
01:09:11,809 --> 01:09:11,819
so as a person who appreciates the game
 

4081
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:13,370
so as a person who appreciates the game
uh

4082
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:13,380
uh
 

4083
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:15,289
uh
who do you think is the greatest poker

4084
01:09:15,289 --> 01:09:15,299
who do you think is the greatest poker
 

4085
01:09:15,299 --> 01:09:16,910
who do you think is the greatest poker
player of all time

4086
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:16,920
player of all time
 

4087
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,130
player of all time
that's a that's a tough question

4088
01:09:19,130 --> 01:09:19,140
that's a that's a tough question
 

4089
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:20,749
that's a that's a tough question
um Can an AI help answer that question

4090
01:09:20,749 --> 01:09:20,759
um Can an AI help answer that question
 

4091
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:23,329
um Can an AI help answer that question
can you can actually add analyze the

4092
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:23,339
can you can actually add analyze the
 

4093
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:26,150
can you can actually add analyze the
quality of play right so the AHS engines

4094
01:09:26,150 --> 01:09:26,160
quality of play right so the AHS engines
 

4095
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,110
quality of play right so the AHS engines
can

4096
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
can
 

4097
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,689
can
can give estimates of the quality of

4098
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:29,699
can give estimates of the quality of
 

4099
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,030
can give estimates of the quality of
play right

4100
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:32,040
play right
 

4101
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,050
play right
um

4102
01:09:33,050 --> 01:09:33,060
um
 

4103
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:34,910
um
I wonder if there's a is there an ELO

4104
01:09:34,910 --> 01:09:34,920
I wonder if there's a is there an ELO
 

4105
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:37,550
I wonder if there's a is there an ELO
rating type of system for poker

4106
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:37,560
rating type of system for poker
 

4107
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,590
rating type of system for poker
I suppose you could but there's just not

4108
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
I suppose you could but there's just not
 

4109
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,090
I suppose you could but there's just not
enough

4110
01:09:41,090 --> 01:09:41,100
enough
 

4111
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,769
enough
you would have to play a lot of games

4112
01:09:42,769 --> 01:09:42,779
you would have to play a lot of games
 

4113
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:45,470
you would have to play a lot of games
right a very large number of games like

4114
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:45,480
right a very large number of games like
 

4115
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:46,669
right a very large number of games like
more than you would in chess the

4116
01:09:46,669 --> 01:09:46,679
more than you would in chess the
 

4117
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:48,289
more than you would in chess the
deterministic game makes it easier to

4118
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:48,299
deterministic game makes it easier to
 

4119
01:09:48,299 --> 01:09:49,550
deterministic game makes it easier to
estimate yellow

4120
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:49,560
estimate yellow
 

4121
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,890
estimate yellow
I think I think it is much harder to

4122
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:51,900
I think I think it is much harder to
 

4123
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,990
I think I think it is much harder to
estimate something like ELO rating in

4124
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:54,000
estimate something like ELO rating in
 

4125
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,850
estimate something like ELO rating in
poker I think it's doable the problem is

4126
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:55,860
poker I think it's doable the problem is
 

4127
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:58,010
poker I think it's doable the problem is
that the game is very high variants so

4128
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:58,020
that the game is very high variants so
 

4129
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:00,110
that the game is very high variants so
you could play you could be profitable

4130
01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:00,120
you could play you could be profitable
 

4131
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:02,689
you could play you could be profitable
in poker for a year and you could

4132
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:02,699
in poker for a year and you could
 

4133
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:03,890
in poker for a year and you could
actually be a bad player just because

4134
01:10:03,890 --> 01:10:03,900
actually be a bad player just because
 

4135
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,750
actually be a bad player just because
the variance is so high I mean you've

4136
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:05,760
the variance is so high I mean you've
 

4137
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:07,550
the variance is so high I mean you've
got top professional poker players that

4138
01:10:07,550 --> 01:10:07,560
got top professional poker players that
 

4139
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,410
got top professional poker players that
would lose for a year just because

4140
01:10:09,410 --> 01:10:09,420
would lose for a year just because
 

4141
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,030
would lose for a year just because
they're on a really bad

4142
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:11,040
they're on a really bad
 

4143
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,729
they're on a really bad
um bad streak so yeah so for ELO you

4144
01:10:13,729 --> 01:10:13,739
um bad streak so yeah so for ELO you
 

4145
01:10:13,739 --> 01:10:16,010
um bad streak so yeah so for ELO you
have to have a nice clean way of saying

4146
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:16,020
have to have a nice clean way of saying
 

4147
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,130
have to have a nice clean way of saying
if player a played player B

4148
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:19,140
if player a played player B
 

4149
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,070
if player a played player B
and a B's B that says something that's a

4150
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:22,080
and a B's B that says something that's a
 

4151
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:24,709
and a B's B that says something that's a
signal in poker it's a very noisy signal

4152
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
signal in poker it's a very noisy signal
 

4153
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:26,209
signal in poker it's a very noisy signal
it's a very noisy signal now there is a

4154
01:10:26,209 --> 01:10:26,219
it's a very noisy signal now there is a
 

4155
01:10:26,219 --> 01:10:27,950
it's a very noisy signal now there is a
signal there and so you could do this

4156
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:27,960
signal there and so you could do this
 

4157
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:30,229
signal there and so you could do this
this calculation it would just be much

4158
01:10:30,229 --> 01:10:30,239
this calculation it would just be much
 

4159
01:10:30,239 --> 01:10:31,490
this calculation it would just be much
harder

4160
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:31,500
harder
 

4161
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:33,950
harder
um but the same way that AIS have now

4162
01:10:33,950 --> 01:10:33,960
um but the same way that AIS have now
 

4163
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:36,950
um but the same way that AIS have now
taken over chess and you know all the

4164
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:36,960
taken over chess and you know all the
 

4165
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,750
taken over chess and you know all the
top professional chess players train

4166
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:38,760
top professional chess players train
 

4167
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:41,630
top professional chess players train
with with AIS the same is true for poker

4168
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:41,640
with with AIS the same is true for poker
 

4169
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:46,010
with with AIS the same is true for poker
the game has become a very computational

4170
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:46,020
the game has become a very computational
 

4171
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,990
the game has become a very computational
um people trained with AIS to try to

4172
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:48,000
um people trained with AIS to try to
 

4173
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:49,250
um people trained with AIS to try to
find out where they're making mistakes

4174
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:49,260
find out where they're making mistakes
 

4175
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,470
find out where they're making mistakes
try to learn from the AIS to improve

4176
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:51,480
try to learn from the AIS to improve
 

4177
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:54,189
try to learn from the AIS to improve
their strategy so

4178
01:10:54,189 --> 01:10:54,199
their strategy so
 

4179
01:10:54,199 --> 01:10:56,810
their strategy so
now yeah so the game has been

4180
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:56,820
now yeah so the game has been
 

4181
01:10:56,820 --> 01:10:59,090
now yeah so the game has been
revolutionized in the past five years by

4182
01:10:59,090 --> 01:10:59,100
revolutionized in the past five years by
 

4183
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:00,770
revolutionized in the past five years by
by the development of AI in this sport

4184
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:00,780
by the development of AI in this sport
 

4185
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,810
by the development of AI in this sport
the skill with which you avoided the

4186
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:02,820
the skill with which you avoided the
 

4187
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:04,669
the skill with which you avoided the
question of the greatest of all time was

4188
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:04,679
question of the greatest of all time was
 

4189
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:06,590
question of the greatest of all time was
impressive so my feeling is that it's a

4190
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:06,600
impressive so my feeling is that it's a
 

4191
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,790
impressive so my feeling is that it's a
difficult it's a difficult question

4192
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:07,800
difficult it's a difficult question
 

4193
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,390
difficult it's a difficult question
because just like in chess where you

4194
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:11,400
because just like in chess where you
 

4195
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,010
because just like in chess where you
can't really compare Magnus Carlson

4196
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:13,020
can't really compare Magnus Carlson
 

4197
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:15,169
can't really compare Magnus Carlson
today to Gary Kasparov

4198
01:11:15,169 --> 01:11:15,179
today to Gary Kasparov
 

4199
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:18,110
today to Gary Kasparov
um because the game has evolved so much

4200
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:18,120
um because the game has evolved so much
 

4201
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,470
um because the game has evolved so much
um the poker players today are so far

4202
01:11:21,470 --> 01:11:21,480
um the poker players today are so far
 

4203
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,350
um the poker players today are so far
beyond the the skills of like people

4204
01:11:24,350 --> 01:11:24,360
beyond the the skills of like people
 

4205
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,450
beyond the the skills of like people
that were playing even 10 or 20 years

4206
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:26,460
that were playing even 10 or 20 years
 

4207
01:11:26,460 --> 01:11:27,470
that were playing even 10 or 20 years
ago

4208
01:11:27,470 --> 01:11:27,480
ago
 

4209
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,209
ago
um so you look at the kinds of like

4210
01:11:29,209 --> 01:11:29,219
um so you look at the kinds of like
 

4211
01:11:29,219 --> 01:11:31,550
um so you look at the kinds of like
All-Stars that were on ESPN at like the

4212
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:31,560
All-Stars that were on ESPN at like the
 

4213
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:33,110
All-Stars that were on ESPN at like the
height of the poker boom

4214
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:33,120
height of the poker boom
 

4215
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:34,790
height of the poker boom
pretty much all those players are

4216
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
pretty much all those players are
 

4217
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,590
pretty much all those players are
actually not that good at the game today

4218
01:11:36,590 --> 01:11:36,600
actually not that good at the game today
 

4219
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,110
actually not that good at the game today
at least at least the the strategy

4220
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:39,120
at least at least the the strategy
 

4221
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,370
at least at least the the strategy
aspect I mean there might be still be

4222
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:40,380
aspect I mean there might be still be
 

4223
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,590
aspect I mean there might be still be
good at like reading the player at the

4224
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:42,600
good at like reading the player at the
 

4225
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:43,910
good at like reading the player at the
other side of the table and trying to

4226
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
other side of the table and trying to
 

4227
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,290
other side of the table and trying to
figure out like are they bluffing or not

4228
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:45,300
figure out like are they bluffing or not
 

4229
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:47,149
figure out like are they bluffing or not
but in terms of the actual like

4230
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:47,159
but in terms of the actual like
 

4231
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:49,490
but in terms of the actual like
computational strategy of the game

4232
01:11:49,490 --> 01:11:49,500
computational strategy of the game
 

4233
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,810
computational strategy of the game
um a lot of them have really struggled

4234

um a lot of them have really struggled
 

4235
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,750
um a lot of them have really struggled
to keep up with that development now

zero some games and what's interesting
 

4295
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,729
zero some games and what's interesting
about diplomacy is that it's very

4296
01:12:55,729 --> 01:12:55,739
about diplomacy is that it's very
 

4297
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:59,270

player game it was actually created in
 

4307
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,770
player game it was actually created in
the 50s

4308
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:09,780
the 50s
 

4309
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:12,110
the 50s
um and it takes place

4310
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:12,120
um and it takes place
 

4311
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,390
um and it takes place
uh before World War one it's like a map

4312
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,400
uh before World War one it's like a map
 

4313
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,910
uh before World War one it's like a map
of Europe with seven Great Powers

4314
01:13:16,910 --> 01:13:16,920
of Europe with seven Great Powers
 

4315
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:19,310
of Europe with seven Great Powers
um and they're all trying to form

4316
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:19,320
um and they're all trying to form
 

4317
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:21,050
um and they're all trying to form
alliances with each other there's a lot

4318
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:21,060
alliances with each other there's a lot
 

4319
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:23,390
alliances with each other there's a lot
of negotiation going on

4320
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:23,400
of negotiation going on
 

4321
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:25,910
of negotiation going on
um and so the whole focus of the game is

4322
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:25,920
um and so the whole focus of the game is
 

4323

Italy and France that's right yeah
 

4333
01:13:36,780 --> 01:13:39,890
Italy and France that's right yeah
so the way the game works is

4334
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:39,900
so the way the game works is
 

4335
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,470
so the way the game works is
on each turn you spend about you know

4336
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:42,480
on each turn you spend about you know
 

4337
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:44,510
on each turn you spend about you know
five to fifteen minutes talking to the

4338
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:44,520
five to fifteen minutes talking to the
 

4339
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,870
five to fifteen minutes talking to the
other players in privates and you make

4340
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:47,880
other players in privates and you make
 

4341
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,189
other players in privates and you make
all sorts of deals with them you say

4342
01:13:49,189 --> 01:13:49,199
all sorts of deals with them you say
 

4343
01:13:49,199 --> 01:13:51,169
all sorts of deals with them you say
like hey let's work together

4344
01:13:51,169 --> 01:13:51,179
like hey let's work together
 

4345
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:52,610
like hey let's work together
um you know let's team up against this

4346
01:13:52,610 --> 01:13:52,620
um you know let's team up against this
 

4347
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:53,810
um you know let's team up against this
other player because the only way that

4348
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:53,820
other player because the only way that
 

4349
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,850
other player because the only way that
you can make progress is by working with

4350
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:55,860
you can make progress is by working with
 

4351
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:58,490
you can make progress is by working with
somebody else against the others

4352
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:58,500
somebody else against the others
 

4353
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:00,050
somebody else against the others
um and then after that negotiation

4354
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:00,060
um and then after that negotiation
 

4355
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:02,050
um and then after that negotiation
period is done all the players

4356
01:14:02,050 --> 01:14:02,060
period is done all the players
 

4357
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:05,750
period is done all the players
simultaneously submit their moves and

4358
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:05,760
simultaneously submit their moves and
 

4359
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,130
simultaneously submit their moves and
they're all executed at the same time

4360
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:07,140
they're all executed at the same time
 

4361
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,709
they're all executed at the same time
and so you can tell people like hey I'm

4362
01:14:09,709 --> 01:14:09,719
and so you can tell people like hey I'm
 

4363
01:14:09,719 --> 01:14:11,689
and so you can tell people like hey I'm
going to support you this turn

4364
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:11,699
going to support you this turn
 

4365
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:12,709
going to support you this turn
um but then you don't follow through

4366
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
um but then you don't follow through
 

4367
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,570
um but then you don't follow through
with it and they're only going to figure

4368
01:14:14,570 --> 01:14:14,580
with it and they're only going to figure
 

4369
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:16,430
with it and they're only going to figure
that out once they see the moves being

4370
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:16,440
that out once they see the moves being
 

4371

01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,970
about like what they're planning
um the way that I would describe the

4446
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:31,980
um the way that I would describe the
 

4447
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:33,530
um the way that I would describe the
game is that it's kind of like a mix

4448
01:15:33,530 --> 01:15:33,540
game is that it's kind of like a mix
 

4449
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,470
game is that it's kind of like a mix
between risk poker and the TV show

4450
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
between risk poker and the TV show
 

4451
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:38,750
between risk poker and the TV show
Survivor there's like this big element

4452
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:38,760
Survivor there's like this big element
 

4453
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,330
Survivor there's like this big element
of like trying to

4454
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:41,340
of like trying to
 

4455
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:43,970
of like trying to
um yeah there's a big social element and

4456
01:15:43,970 --> 01:15:43,980
um yeah there's a big social element and
 

4457
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:45,290
um yeah there's a big social element and
the best way that I would describe the

4458
01:15:45,290 --> 01:15:45,300
the best way that I would describe the
 

4459
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:46,790
the best way that I would describe the
game is that it's really a game about

4460
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
game is that it's really a game about
 

4461
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,790
game is that it's really a game about
people rather than the pieces

4462
01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:49,800
people rather than the pieces
 

4463
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:53,209
people rather than the pieces
so risk because it is a map it's kind of

4464
01:15:53,209 --> 01:15:53,219
so risk because it is a map it's kind of
 

4465
01:15:53,219 --> 01:15:55,870
so risk because it is a map it's kind of
war game like

4466
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:55,880
war game like
 

4467
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,250
war game like
uh poker because there's a game theory

4468
01:15:58,250 --> 01:15:58,260
uh poker because there's a game theory
 

4469
01:15:58,260 --> 01:16:00,350
uh poker because there's a game theory
component that's very kind of strategic

4470
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:00,360
component that's very kind of strategic
 

4471
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:02,390
component that's very kind of strategic
so you could convert it into an

4472
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:02,400
so you could convert it into an
 

4473
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:04,610
so you could convert it into an
artificial intelligence problem and then

4474
01:16:04,610 --> 01:16:04,620
artificial intelligence problem and then
 

4475
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:05,689
artificial intelligence problem and then
survive it because of the social

4476
01:16:05,689 --> 01:16:05,699
survive it because of the social
 

4477
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,070
survive it because of the social
component that's a strong social

4478
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:07,080
component that's a strong social
 

4479
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,810
component that's a strong social
component I saw that somebody said

4480
01:16:08,810 --> 01:16:08,820
component I saw that somebody said
 

4481
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:11,149
component I saw that somebody said
online that the internet version of the

4482
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:11,159
online that the internet version of the
 

4483
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:14,990
online that the internet version of the
game has this quality of that is easier

4484
01:16:14,990 --> 01:16:15,000
game has this quality of that is easier
 

4485
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,330
game has this quality of that is easier

01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:10,679
gain control of a majority of the map if
 

4537
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:11,930
gain control of a majority of the map if
you able if you're able to do that then

4538
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:11,940
you able if you're able to do that then
 

4539
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,090
you able if you're able to do that then
you've won the game but like I said the

4540
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,100
you've won the game but like I said the
 

4541
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,470
you've won the game but like I said the
only way that you're able to do that is

4542
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:15,480
only way that you're able to do that is
 

4543
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:17,270
only way that you're able to do that is
by working with other players so on

4544
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,280
by working with other players so on
 

4545
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,790
by working with other players so on
every turn you can issue a move order so

4546
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:19,800
every turn you can issue a move order so
 

4547
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:21,950
every turn you can issue a move order so
for each of your units you can move them

4548
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:21,960
for each of your units you can move them
 

4549
01:17:21,960 --> 01:17:23,810
for each of your units you can move them
to an adjacent territory

4550
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:23,820
to an adjacent territory
 

4551
01:17:23,820 --> 01:17:26,689
to an adjacent territory
or you can keep them where they are or

4552
01:17:26,689 --> 01:17:26,699
or you can keep them where they are or
 

4553
01:17:26,699 --> 01:17:30,050
or you can keep them where they are or
you can support a move or a hold of a

4554
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:30,060
you can support a move or a hold of a
 

4555
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,149
you can support a move or a hold of a
different units so what are the

4556
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:32,159
different units so what are the
 

4557
01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:34,189
different units so what are the
territories how how is the map divided

4558
01:17:34,189 --> 01:17:34,199
territories how how is the map divided
 

4559
01:17:34,199 --> 01:17:36,110
territories how how is the map divided
up it's kind of like Risk where the the

4560
01:17:36,110 --> 01:17:36,120
up it's kind of like Risk where the the
 

4561
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:38,090
up it's kind of like Risk where the the
map is divided up into like 50 different

4562
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:38,100
map is divided up into like 50 different
 

4563
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:39,830
map is divided up into like 50 different
territories

4564
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
territories
 

4565
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,830
territories
um now you can enter a territory if

4566
01:17:42,830 --> 01:17:42,840
um now you can enter a territory if
 

4567
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:44,510
um now you can enter a territory if
you're moving into that territory with

4568
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:44,520
you're moving into that territory with
 

4569
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,790
you're moving into that territory with
more supports than the person that's in

4570
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:46,800
more supports than the person that's in
 

4571
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:47,990
more supports than the person that's in
there or the person that's trying to

4572
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:48,000
there or the person that's trying to
 

4573
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,270
there or the person that's trying to
move in there so if you're moving in and

4574
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:50,280
move in there so if you're moving in and
 

4575
01:17:50,280 --> 01:17:51,830
move in there so if you're moving in and
there's somebody already there

4576
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:51,840
there's somebody already there
 

4577
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:53,390
there's somebody already there
um then if neither of you have support

4578
01:17:53,390 --> 01:17:53,400
um then if neither of you have support
 

4579
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,950
um then if neither of you have support
it's a one versus one and you'll bounce

4580
01:17:54,950 --> 01:17:54,960
it's a one versus one and you'll bounce
 

4581
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,290
it's a one versus one and you'll bounce
back another if you'll make progress if

4582
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:57,300
back another if you'll make progress if
 

4583
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,850
back another if you'll make progress if
you have a unit that's supporting that

4584
01:17:58,850 --> 01:17:58,860
you have a unit that's supporting that
 

4585
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:00,709
you have a unit that's supporting that
move into the territory then it's a two

4586
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:00,719
move into the territory then it's a two
 

4587
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,450
move into the territory then it's a two
versus one and you'll kick them out and

4588
01:18:02,450 --> 01:18:02,460
versus one and you'll kick them out and
 

4589
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:04,250
versus one and you'll kick them out and
they'll have to retreat somewhere what

4590
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:04,260
they'll have to retreat somewhere what
 

4591
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,810
they'll have to retreat somewhere what
does support mean support is like it's

4592
01:18:05,810 --> 01:18:05,820
does support mean support is like it's
 

4593
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:07,610
does support mean support is like it's
it's an action that you can issue in the

4594
01:18:07,610 --> 01:18:07,620
it's an action that you can issue in the
 

4595
01:18:07,620 --> 01:18:09,830
it's an action that you can issue in the
game so you can say this unit you write

4596
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:09,840
game so you can say this unit you write
 

4597
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:11,630
game so you can say this unit you write
down this unit is supporting this other

4598
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:11,640
down this unit is supporting this other
 

4599
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:14,510
down this unit is supporting this other
unit into this territory are these units

4600
01:18:14,510 --> 01:18:14,520
unit into this territory are these units
 

4601
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,850
unit into this territory are these units
from opposing forces they could be they

4602
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:16,860
from opposing forces they could be they
 

4603
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,050
from opposing forces they could be they
could be and this is this is where the

4604
01:18:18,050 --> 01:18:18,060
could be and this is this is where the
 

4605
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,370
could be and this is this is where the
interesting aspect of the game comes in

4606
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:19,380
interesting aspect of the game comes in
 

4607
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:21,410
interesting aspect of the game comes in
because you can support your own units

4608
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:21,420
because you can support your own units
 

4609
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:23,390
because you can support your own units
into territory but you can also support

4610
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:23,400
into territory but you can also support
 

4611
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:25,310
into territory but you can also support
other people's units into territories

4612
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:25,320
other people's units into territories
 

4613
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,709
other people's units into territories
and so that's what the negotiations

4614
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
and so that's what the negotiations
 

4615
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,450
and so that's what the negotiations
really revolve around but you don't have

4616
01:18:29,450 --> 01:18:29,460
really revolve around but you don't have
 

4617
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:31,490
really revolve around but you don't have
to do the thing you say you're going to

4618
01:18:31,490 --> 01:18:31,500
to do the thing you say you're going to
 

4619
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,310
to do the thing you say you're going to
do and this yeah and so you can say I'm

4620
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:34,320
do and this yeah and so you can say I'm
 

4621
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,410
do and this yeah and so you can say I'm
going to support you but then backstab

4622
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:36,420
going to support you but then backstab
 

4623
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,330
going to support you but then backstab
the person yeah that's absolutely right

4624
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:38,340
the person yeah that's absolutely right
 

4625
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:41,209
the person yeah that's absolutely right
and that tension is core to the game the

4626
01:18:41,209 --> 01:18:41,219
and that tension is core to the game the
 

4627
01:18:41,219 --> 01:18:42,590
and that tension is core to the game the
attention is absolutely core to the game

4628
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:42,600
attention is absolutely core to the game
 

4629
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:45,410
attention is absolutely core to the game
the the fact that you can make all sorts

4630
01:18:45,410 --> 01:18:45,420
the the fact that you can make all sorts
 

4631
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,169
the the fact that you can make all sorts
of promises but you have to reason about

4632
01:18:48,169 --> 01:18:48,179
of promises but you have to reason about
 

4633
01:18:48,179 --> 01:18:49,790
of promises but you have to reason about
the fact that like hey they might not

4634
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:49,800
the fact that like hey they might not
 

4635
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,290
the fact that like hey they might not
trust you if you say you're going to do

4636
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:51,300
trust you if you say you're going to do
 

4637
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,470
trust you if you say you're going to do
something or they might be lying to you

4638
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:53,480
something or they might be lying to you
 

4639
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,370
something or they might be lying to you
when they say they're going to support

4640
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:55,380
when they say they're going to support
 

4641
01:18:55,380 --> 01:18:56,270
when they say they're going to support
you

4642
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:56,280
you
 

4643
01:18:56,280 --> 01:18:59,390
you
so maybe just just to jump back what's

4644
01:18:59,390 --> 01:18:59,400
so maybe just just to jump back what's
 

4645
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:00,709
so maybe just just to jump back what's
what's the history of the game in

4646
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:00,719
what's the history of the game in
 

4647

by
um somebody that had looked at the

World War one as a failure of diplomacy

4688
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:42,900
World War one as a failure of diplomacy
 

4689
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:46,370
World War one as a failure of diplomacy
so sure you know they saw the fact that

4690
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:46,380
so sure you know they saw the fact that
 

4691
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:48,709
so sure you know they saw the fact that
this war broke out as like the the

4692
01:19:48,709 --> 01:19:48,719
this war broke out as like the the
 

4693
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,030
this war broke out as like the the
diplomats of all these countries like

4694
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:50,040
diplomats of all these countries like
 

4695
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,770
diplomats of all these countries like
really failed to prevent a war and he

4696
01:19:51,770 --> 01:19:51,780
really failed to prevent a war and he
 

4697
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,090
really failed to prevent a war and he
wanted to create a game that would

4698
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:53,100
wanted to create a game that would
 

4699
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,390
wanted to create a game that would
basically teach people about diplomacy

4700
01:19:56,390 --> 01:19:56,400
basically teach people about diplomacy
 

4701
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,570
basically teach people about diplomacy
um and it's really fascinating that like

4702
01:19:59,570 --> 01:19:59,580
um and it's really fascinating that like
 

4703
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,430
um and it's really fascinating that like
in his ideal version of the game of

4704
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:01,440
in his ideal version of the game of
 

4705
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,169
in his ideal version of the game of
diplomacy nobody actually wins the game

4706
01:20:03,169 --> 01:20:03,179
diplomacy nobody actually wins the game
 

4707
01:20:03,179 --> 01:20:05,090
diplomacy nobody actually wins the game
because the whole point is that if

4708
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:05,100
because the whole point is that if
 

4709
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:06,410
because the whole point is that if
somebody is about to win then the other

4710
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:06,420
somebody is about to win then the other
 

4711
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:07,790
somebody is about to win then the other
players should be able to work together

4712
01:20:07,790 --> 01:20:07,800
players should be able to work together
 

4713
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,669
players should be able to work together
to stop that person from winning and so

4714
01:20:10,669 --> 01:20:10,679
to stop that person from winning and so
 

4715
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,350
to stop that person from winning and so
the ideal version of the game is just

4716
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:12,360
the ideal version of the game is just
 

4717
01:20:12,360 --> 01:20:14,570
the ideal version of the game is just
one where nobody actually wins and you

4718
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:14,580
one where nobody actually wins and you
 

4719
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:15,830
one where nobody actually wins and you
know it kind of has a nice like

4720
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
know it kind of has a nice like
 

4721
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,390
know it kind of has a nice like
wholesome take-home message then that

4722
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:17,400
wholesome take-home message then that
 

4723
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,669
wholesome take-home message then that
you know war war is ultimately futile

4724
01:20:19,669 --> 01:20:19,679
you know war war is ultimately futile
 

4725
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:21,290
you know war war is ultimately futile
and uh

4726
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:21,300
and uh
 

4727
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:24,350
and uh
and that optimal

4728
01:20:24,350 --> 01:20:24,360
and that optimal
 

4729
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,689
and that optimal
that feudal optimal could be achieved

4730
01:20:26,689 --> 01:20:26,699
that feudal optimal could be achieved
 

4731
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:30,350
that feudal optimal could be achieved
through great diplomacy yeah so uh is

4732
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:30,360
through great diplomacy yeah so uh is
 

4733
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,510
through great diplomacy yeah so uh is
there some asymmetry in in terms of

4734
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:32,520
there some asymmetry in in terms of
 

4735
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:34,610
there some asymmetry in in terms of
which is more powerful Russia versus

4736
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:34,620
which is more powerful Russia versus
 

4737
01:20:34,620 --> 01:20:36,229
which is more powerful Russia versus
Germany versus

4738
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:36,239
Germany versus
 

4739
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:39,530
Germany versus
France and so on so I think the general

4740
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:39,540
France and so on so I think the general
 

4741
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:41,090
France and so on so I think the general
consensus is that France is the

4742
01:20:41,090 --> 01:20:41,100
consensus is that France is the
 

4743
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,070
consensus is that France is the
strongest power in the game but the

4744
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:43,080
strongest power in the game but the
 

4745
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:44,630
strongest power in the game but the
beautiful thing about diplomacy is that

4746
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:44,640
beautiful thing about diplomacy is that
 

4747
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,189
beautiful thing about diplomacy is that
it's it's self-balancing right so it's

4748
01:20:46,189 --> 01:20:46,199
it's it's self-balancing right so it's
 

4749
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:48,110
it's it's self-balancing right so it's
the fact that France has an inherent

4750
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:48,120
the fact that France has an inherent
 

4751
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,850
the fact that France has an inherent
Advantage from the beginning means that

4752
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:49,860
Advantage from the beginning means that
 

4753
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:52,250
Advantage from the beginning means that
the other players are less likely to

4754
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:52,260
the other players are less likely to
 

4755
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:54,350
the other players are less likely to
work with it I saw that Russia has four

4756
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:54,360
work with it I saw that Russia has four
 

4757
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:56,810
work with it I saw that Russia has four
units or four of something that the

4758
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:56,820
units or four of something that the
 

4759
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,189
units or four of something that the
others have three of something that's

4760
01:20:58,189 --> 01:20:58,199
others have three of something that's
 

4761
01:20:58,199 --> 01:20:59,570
others have three of something that's
true yeah so Russia starts off with four

4762
01:20:59,570 --> 01:20:59,580
true yeah so Russia starts off with four
 

4763
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,189
true yeah so Russia starts off with four
units while all the other players start

4764
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:01,199
units while all the other players start
 

4765
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,590
units while all the other players start
with three but Russia is also in a much

4766
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:03,600
with three but Russia is also in a much
 

4767
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,209
with three but Russia is also in a much
more vulnerable position because they

4768
01:21:05,209 --> 01:21:05,219
more vulnerable position because they
 

4769
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:06,350
more vulnerable position because they
have to like

4770
01:21:06,350 --> 01:21:06,360
have to like
 

4771
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:07,850
have to like
um they have a lot more neighbors as

4772
01:21:07,850 --> 01:21:07,860
um they have a lot more neighbors as
 

4773
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,310
um they have a lot more neighbors as
well got it larger territory more uh

4774
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
well got it larger territory more uh
 

4775
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,209
well got it larger territory more uh
yeah right more border to defend okay uh

4776
01:21:14,209 --> 01:21:14,219
yeah right more border to defend okay uh
 

4777
01:21:14,219 --> 01:21:16,669
yeah right more border to defend okay uh
what else is what else is important to

4778
01:21:16,669 --> 01:21:16,679
what else is what else is important to
 

4779
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:19,430
what else is what else is important to
know about the rules so there how many

4780
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,440
know about the rules so there how many
 

4781
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,229
know about the rules so there how many
rounds are there like is this iterative

4782
01:21:21,229 --> 01:21:21,239
rounds are there like is this iterative
 

4783
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:24,169
rounds are there like is this iterative
game is there is it is it finite you

4784
01:21:24,169 --> 01:21:24,179
game is there is it is it finite you
 

4785
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:26,090
game is there is it is it finite you
just keep going indefinitely usually the

4786
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:26,100
just keep going indefinitely usually the
 

4787
01:21:26,100 --> 01:21:28,490
just keep going indefinitely usually the
game lasts uh I would say about

4788
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:28,500
game lasts uh I would say about
 

4789
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:30,770
game lasts uh I would say about
15 or 20 turns

4790
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:30,780
15 or 20 turns
 

4791
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,570
15 or 20 turns
um there's in theory No Limit it could

4792
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:32,580
um there's in theory No Limit it could
 

4793
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:34,550
um there's in theory No Limit it could
last longer but at some point I mean if

4794
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:34,560
last longer but at some point I mean if
 

4795
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:35,750
last longer but at some point I mean if
you're playing a house game with friends

4796
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:35,760
you're playing a house game with friends
 

4797
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,310
you're playing a house game with friends
at some point you just get tired and you

4798
01:21:37,310 --> 01:21:37,320
at some point you just get tired and you
 

4799
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,689
at some point you just get tired and you
all agree like okay we're gonna end the

4800
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:38,699
all agree like okay we're gonna end the
 

4801
01:21:38,699 --> 01:21:40,850
all agree like okay we're gonna end the
game here and call it a draw

4802
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:40,860
game here and call it a draw
 

4803
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:42,290
game here and call it a draw
um if you're playing online there's

4804
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:42,300
um if you're playing online there's
 

4805
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,910
um if you're playing online there's
usually like set limits on when the game

4806
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
usually like set limits on when the game
 

4807
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,010
usually like set limits on when the game
will actually end and what's the end

4808
01:21:46,010 --> 01:21:46,020
will actually end and what's the end
 

4809
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:48,050
will actually end and what's the end
what's the termination condition like

4810
01:21:48,050 --> 01:21:48,060
what's the termination condition like
 

4811
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:51,649
what's the termination condition like
this this one country have to conquer

4812
01:21:51,649 --> 01:21:51,659
this this one country have to conquer
 

4813
01:21:51,659 --> 01:21:53,990
this this one country have to conquer
everything else so if somebody is able

4814
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
everything else so if somebody is able
 

4815
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,790
everything else so if somebody is able
to actually gain control of a majority

4816
01:21:55,790 --> 01:21:55,800
to actually gain control of a majority
 

4817
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:57,410
to actually gain control of a majority
of the map then then they've won the

4818
01:21:57,410 --> 01:21:57,420
of the map then then they've won the
 

4819
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,390
of the map then then they've won the
game and that is a solo Victory as it's

4820
01:21:59,390 --> 01:21:59,400
game and that is a solo Victory as it's
 

4821
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,310
game and that is a solo Victory as it's
called now that pretty rarely happens

4822
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:01,320
called now that pretty rarely happens
 

4823
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:02,810
called now that pretty rarely happens
especially with strong players because

4824
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:02,820
especially with strong players because
 

4825
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,970
especially with strong players because
like I said the game is designed to

4826
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:04,980
like I said the game is designed to
 

4827
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:06,649
like I said the game is designed to
incentivize the other players to put a

4828
01:22:06,649 --> 01:22:06,659
incentivize the other players to put a
 

4829
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:08,030
incentivize the other players to put a
stop to that and all work together to

4830
01:22:08,030 --> 01:22:08,040
stop to that and all work together to
 

4831
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,189
stop to that and all work together to
stop the superpower

4832
01:22:10,189 --> 01:22:10,199
stop the superpower
 

4833
01:22:10,199 --> 01:22:12,050
stop the superpower
um usually what ends up happening is

4834
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:12,060
um usually what ends up happening is
 

4835
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,030
um usually what ends up happening is
that you know all the players agree to a

4836
01:22:14,030 --> 01:22:14,040
that you know all the players agree to a
 

4837
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:17,330
that you know all the players agree to a
draw and then the the score the the win

4838
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:17,340
draw and then the the score the the win
 

4839
01:22:17,340 --> 01:22:20,330
draw and then the the score the the win
is divided among the remaining players

4840
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:20,340
is divided among the remaining players
 

4841
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:21,410
is divided among the remaining players
um there's a lot of different scoring

4842
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:21,420
um there's a lot of different scoring
 

4843
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:22,850
um there's a lot of different scoring
systems the one that we used in our

4844
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:22,860
systems the one that we used in our
 

4845
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:23,990
systems the one that we used in our
research

4846
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
research
 

4847
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,610
research
um basically

4848
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:25,620
um basically
 

4849
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,669
um basically
um gives a score relative to how much

4850
01:22:28,669 --> 01:22:28,679
um gives a score relative to how much
 

4851
01:22:28,679 --> 01:22:30,410
um gives a score relative to how much
control you have of the map so the more

4852
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:30,420
control you have of the map so the more
 

4853
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,510
control you have of the map so the more
that you control the higher you score

4854
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:32,520
that you control the higher you score
 

4855
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:35,930
that you control the higher you score
what's the history of using this game as

4856
01:22:35,930 --> 01:22:35,940
what's the history of using this game as
 

4857
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:38,810
what's the history of using this game as
a benchmark for AI research do people

4858
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:38,820
a benchmark for AI research do people
 

4859
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,750
a benchmark for AI research do people
use it yeah so people have been working

4860
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:41,760
use it yeah so people have been working
 

4861
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,110
use it yeah so people have been working
on AI for diplomacy since about the 80s

4862
01:22:45,110 --> 01:22:45,120
on AI for diplomacy since about the 80s
 

4863
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,970
on AI for diplomacy since about the 80s
um there was some really exciting

4864
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:46,980
um there was some really exciting
 

4865
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:49,250
um there was some really exciting
research back then but the approach that

4866
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:49,260
research back then but the approach that
 

4867
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:51,110
research back then but the approach that
was taken was very different from what

4868
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
was taken was very different from what
 

4869
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:52,550
was taken was very different from what
we see today I mean the research in the

4870
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:52,560
we see today I mean the research in the
 

4871
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:54,890
we see today I mean the research in the
80s was a very rule-based approach kind

4872
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:54,900
80s was a very rule-based approach kind
 

4873
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,510
80s was a very rule-based approach kind
of kind of a heuristic approach it was

4874
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:56,520
of kind of a heuristic approach it was
 

4875
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:57,890
of kind of a heuristic approach it was
very in line with the kind of research

4876
01:22:57,890 --> 01:22:57,900
very in line with the kind of research
 

4877
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:59,870
very in line with the kind of research
that was being done in the 80s you know

4878
01:22:59,870 --> 01:22:59,880
that was being done in the 80s you know
 

4879
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:01,189
that was being done in the 80s you know
basically trying to encode human

4880
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
basically trying to encode human
 

4881
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,410
basically trying to encode human
knowledge into the strategy of the AI

4882
01:23:03,410 --> 01:23:03,420
knowledge into the strategy of the AI
 

4883
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:04,610
knowledge into the strategy of the AI
sure

4884
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:04,620
sure
 

4885
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,470
sure
um and you know it's understandable I

4886
01:23:06,470 --> 01:23:06,480
um and you know it's understandable I
 

4887
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,510
um and you know it's understandable I
mean the game is so incredibly different

4888
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:08,520
mean the game is so incredibly different
 

4889
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:11,630
mean the game is so incredibly different
and so so much more complicated than the

4890
01:23:11,630 --> 01:23:11,640
and so so much more complicated than the
 

4891
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:13,490
and so so much more complicated than the
kinds of games that people were working

4892
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:13,500
kinds of games that people were working
 

4893
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,250
kinds of games that people were working
on like chess and go uh and poker that

4894
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:16,260
on like chess and go uh and poker that
 

4895
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,490
on like chess and go uh and poker that
it was honestly even hard to like start

4896
01:23:19,490 --> 01:23:19,500
it was honestly even hard to like start
 

4897
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,709
it was honestly even hard to like start
getting making any progress in in

4898
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:21,719
getting making any progress in in
 

4899
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:24,410
getting making any progress in in
diplomacy can you just formulate what is

4900
01:23:24,410 --> 01:23:24,420
diplomacy can you just formulate what is
 

4901
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,990
diplomacy can you just formulate what is
the problem from an AI perspective and

4902
01:23:26,990 --> 01:23:27,000
the problem from an AI perspective and
 

4903
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:28,610
the problem from an AI perspective and
why is it hard why is it a challenging

4904
01:23:28,610 --> 01:23:28,620
why is it hard why is it a challenging
 

4905
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,470
why is it hard why is it a challenging
game to solve so there's a lot of

4906
01:23:30,470 --> 01:23:30,480
game to solve so there's a lot of
 

4907
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:32,450
game to solve so there's a lot of
aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge

4908
01:23:32,450 --> 01:23:32,460
aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge
 

4909
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:35,689
aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge
challenge first of all you have the

4910
01:23:35,689 --> 01:23:35,699
challenge first of all you have the
 

4911
01:23:35,699 --> 01:23:37,250
challenge first of all you have the
natural language components and I think

4912
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:37,260
natural language components and I think
 

4913
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,649
natural language components and I think
this really is what makes it are really

4914
01:23:39,649 --> 01:23:39,659
this really is what makes it are really
 

4915
01:23:39,659 --> 01:23:41,410
this really is what makes it are really
the most difficult

4916
01:23:41,410 --> 01:23:41,420
the most difficult
 

4917
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:44,149
the most difficult
game among like the major benchmarks the

4918
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
game among like the major benchmarks the
 

4919
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:47,270
game among like the major benchmarks the
fact that you have to it's not about

4920
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
fact that you have to it's not about
 

4921
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:49,550
fact that you have to it's not about
moving pieces on the board

4922
01:23:49,550 --> 01:23:49,560
moving pieces on the board
 

4923
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:52,010
moving pieces on the board
your action space is basically all the

4924
01:23:52,010 --> 01:23:52,020
your action space is basically all the
 

4925
01:23:52,020 --> 01:23:53,990
your action space is basically all the
different sentences that you could

4926
01:23:53,990 --> 01:23:54,000
different sentences that you could
 

4927
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,550
different sentences that you could
communicate to somebody else in this

4928
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:55,560
communicate to somebody else in this
 

4929
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,729
communicate to somebody else in this
game and um is there can we just like

4930
01:23:58,729 --> 01:23:58,739
game and um is there can we just like
 

4931
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:00,410
game and um is there can we just like
Linger on that so

4932
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:00,420
Linger on that so
 

4933
01:24:00,420 --> 01:24:03,770
Linger on that so
is part of it like the ambiguity in the

4934
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:03,780
is part of it like the ambiguity in the
 

4935
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:04,729
is part of it like the ambiguity in the
language

4936
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:04,739
language
 

4937
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:07,790
language
if it was like very strict

4938
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:07,800
if it was like very strict
 

4939
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,649
if it was like very strict
if you narrowed the set of possible

4940
01:24:09,649 --> 01:24:09,659
if you narrowed the set of possible
 

4941
01:24:09,659 --> 01:24:10,970
if you narrowed the set of possible
sentences you could do it would that

4942
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:10,980
sentences you could do it would that
 

4943
01:24:10,980 --> 01:24:13,250
sentences you could do it would that
simplify the game significantly the the

4944
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:13,260
simplify the game significantly the the
 

4945
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,149
simplify the game significantly the the
real

you can talk about
 

4951
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,149
you can talk about
um you can have natural language and

4952
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
um you can have natural language and
 

4953
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,010
um you can have natural language and
other games and like Sellers of Catan

4954
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,020
other games and like Sellers of Catan
 

4955
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,090
other games and like Sellers of Catan
for example like you could have a

4956
01:24:23,090 --> 01:24:23,100
for example like you could have a
 

4957
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,070
for example like you could have a

but the things that you're going to talk
 

4961
01:24:26,699 --> 01:24:28,310
but the things that you're going to talk
about are basically like am I trading

4962
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:28,320
about are basically like am I trading
 

4963
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,930
about are basically like am I trading

for a wood
 

4967
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:34,130
for a wood
um whereas in a game like diplomacy the

4968
01:24:34,130 --> 01:24:34,140
um whereas in a game like diplomacy the
 

4969
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:35,330
um whereas in a game like diplomacy the

breadth of conversations that you're
 

4971
01:24:35,340 --> 01:24:37,430
breadth of conversations that you're
going to have are like you know am I

01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:37,440
going to have are like you know am I
 

4973
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,689
going to have are like you know am I
going to support you are you going to

4974
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:38,699
going to support you are you going to
 

4975
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,430
going to support you are you going to
support me in return which units are

4976

they're going to do this instead
um if you help me out this turn then in

4986
01:24:50,689 --> 01:24:50,699
um if you help me out this turn then in
 

4987
01:24:50,699 --> 01:24:52,790
um if you help me out this turn then in
the future I'll do these things that

4988
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
the future I'll do these things that
 

4989
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:54,410
the future I'll do these things that
will help you out

4990
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:54,420
will help you out
 

4991
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:57,530
will help you out
um the the depth and breadth of these

4992
01:24:57,530 --> 01:24:57,540
um the the depth and breadth of these
 

4993
01:24:57,540 --> 01:25:00,830
um the the depth and breadth of these
conversations is is really complicated

4994
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:00,840
conversations is is really complicated
 

4995
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:02,390
conversations is is really complicated
and it's all being done in natural

4996
01:25:02,390 --> 01:25:02,400
and it's all being done in natural
 

4997
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:03,830
and it's all being done in natural
language

4998
01:25:03,830 --> 01:25:03,840
language
 

4999
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:05,810
language
um now you could approach it and we

5000
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:05,820
um now you could approach it and we
 

5001
01:25:05,820 --> 01:25:07,070
um now you could approach it and we
actually consider doing this like you

5002
01:25:07,070 --> 01:25:07,080
actually consider doing this like you
 

5003
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:09,709
actually consider doing this like you
you know having a simplified language to

5004
01:25:09,709 --> 01:25:09,719
you know having a simplified language to
 

5005
01:25:09,719 --> 01:25:13,130
you know having a simplified language to
make this complexity uh smaller But

5006
01:25:13,130 --> 01:25:13,140
make this complexity uh smaller But
 

5007
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:15,830
make this complexity uh smaller But
ultimately we thought the most impactful

01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:18,070
ultimately we thought the most impactful
way of doing this research would be to

5010
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:18,080
way of doing this research would be to
 

5011
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,570
way of doing this research would be to
address the natural language component

5012
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:20,580
address the natural language component
 

5013
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:23,090
address the natural language component
head-on and just try to go for the full

01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:26,340
just looking at sample games and what
 

5019
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,430
just looking at sample games and what
the conversations look like greetings

5020

England this should prove to be a fun

5022
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:30,300

01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:33,000
game since all the private press is
 

5025
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,030
game since all the private press is
going to be made public at the end

5026
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
going to be made public at the end
 

5027
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,370
going to be made public at the end
at the least it will be interesting to

5028
01:25:37,370 --> 01:25:37,380
at the least it will be interesting to
 

5029
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,410
at the least it will be interesting to
see if the Press changes because of that

5030
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:39,420
see if the Press changes because of that
 

5031
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,050
see if the Press changes because of that
anyway good okay so there's like uh yeah

5032
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:42,060
anyway good okay so there's like uh yeah
 

5033
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:43,310
anyway good okay so there's like uh yeah
that's just kind of like the generic

5034
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:43,320
that's just kind of like the generic
 

5035
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:44,689
that's just kind of like the generic
readings at the beginning of the game I

5036
01:25:44,689 --> 01:25:44,699
readings at the beginning of the game I
 

5037
01:25:44,699 --> 01:25:46,010
readings at the beginning of the game I
think that the meat comes a little bit

5038
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:46,020
think that the meat comes a little bit

5042
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:49,980
like specific strategy and stuff
 

5043
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,490
like specific strategy and stuff
I agree there are a lot of advantages to

01:25:52,490 --> 01:25:52,500
I agree there are a lot of advantages to

the middle game so that kind of stuff uh

5050
01:26:00,649 --> 01:26:00,659
the middle game so that kind of stuff uh
 

5051
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,870
the middle game so that kind of stuff uh
making friends making enemies yeah or

5052
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
making friends making enemies yeah or
 

5053
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,310
making friends making enemies yeah or
like if you look at the next line so the

5054
01:26:04,310 --> 01:26:04,320
like if you look at the next line so the
 

5055
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:06,709
like if you look at the next line so the
person's saying like I've heard uh bits

5056
01:26:06,709 --> 01:26:06,719
person's saying like I've heard uh bits
 

5057
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:08,629
person's saying like I've heard uh bits
about a Lepanto and an octopus opening

5058
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:08,639
about a Lepanto and an octopus opening
 

5059
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:10,550
about a Lepanto and an octopus opening
and basically telling Austria like hey

5060
01:26:10,550 --> 01:26:10,560
and basically telling Austria like hey
 

5061
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,169
and basically telling Austria like hey
just a heads up you know I've heard

5062
01:26:12,169 --> 01:26:12,179
just a heads up you know I've heard
 

5063
01:26:12,179 --> 01:26:13,669
just a heads up you know I've heard
these whispers about like what might be

5064
01:26:13,669 --> 01:26:13,679
these whispers about like what might be
 

5065
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:16,550
these whispers about like what might be
going on behind your back yeah but so

5066
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
going on behind your back yeah but so
 

5067
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,310
going on behind your back yeah but so
there's all kinds of complexities in

5068
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:19,320
there's all kinds of complexities in
 

5069
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:20,209
there's all kinds of complexities in
that

5070
01:26:20,209 --> 01:26:20,219
that
 

5071
01:26:20,219 --> 01:26:22,790
that
in the in the language of that right

5072
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:22,800
in the in the language of that right
 

5073
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,530
in the in the language of that right
like to interpret what that what the

5074
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:24,540
like to interpret what that what the
 

5075
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:26,330
like to interpret what that what the
heck that means it's hard for us humans

5076
01:26:26,330 --> 01:26:26,340
heck that means it's hard for us humans
 

5077
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:28,010
heck that means it's hard for us humans
but for yeah it's even harder because

5078
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:28,020
but for yeah it's even harder because
 

5079
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:29,689
but for yeah it's even harder because
you have to understand like at every

5080
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:29,699
you have to understand like at every
 

5081
01:26:29,699 --> 01:26:32,270
you have to understand like at every
level the the semantics of that right I

5082
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:32,280
level the the semantics of that right I
 

5083
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,770
level the the semantics of that right I
mean there's there's a complexity and

5084
01:26:33,770 --> 01:26:33,780
mean there's there's a complexity and
 

5085
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,270
mean there's there's a complexity and
understanding when somebody is saying

5086
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:35,280
understanding when somebody is saying
 

5087
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:37,010
understanding when somebody is saying
this to me what does that mean and then

5088
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,020
this to me what does that mean and then
 

5089
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:38,510
this to me what does that mean and then
there's also the complexity of like

5090
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:38,520
there's also the complexity of like
 

5091
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,129
there's also the complexity of like
should I be telling this person this

5092
01:26:40,129 --> 01:26:40,139
should I be telling this person this
 

5093
01:26:40,139 --> 01:26:42,110
should I be telling this person this
like I've overheard these these Whispers

5094
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:42,120
like I've overheard these these Whispers
 

5095
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,490
like I've overheard these these Whispers
should I be telling this person that

5096
01:26:43,490 --> 01:26:43,500
should I be telling this person that
 

5097
01:26:43,500 --> 01:26:44,750
should I be telling this person that
like hey you might be getting attacked

5098
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:44,760
like hey you might be getting attacked
 

5099
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:49,689
like hey you might be getting attacked
by by this other power Okay so

5100
01:26:49,689 --> 01:26:49,699
by by this other power Okay so
 

5101
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:51,770
by by this other power Okay so
what how we're supposed to think about

5102
01:26:51,770 --> 01:26:51,780
what how we're supposed to think about
 

5103
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,229
what how we're supposed to think about
okay so that's the natural language how

5104
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
okay so that's the natural language how
 

5105
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:55,970
okay so that's the natural language how
do you even begin trying to solve this

5106
01:26:55,970 --> 01:26:55,980
do you even begin trying to solve this
 

5107
01:26:55,980 --> 01:26:58,729
do you even begin trying to solve this
game it seems like this seems like the

5108
01:26:58,729 --> 01:26:58,739
game it seems like this seems like the
 

5109
01:26:58,739 --> 01:27:00,890
game it seems like this seems like the
touring test on steroids yeah and I mean

5110
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:00,900
touring test on steroids yeah and I mean
 

5111
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:01,910
touring test on steroids yeah and I mean
there's there's the natural language

5112
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:01,920
there's there's the natural language
 

5113
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:03,590
there's there's the natural language
aspect and then even besides the natural

5114
01:27:03,590 --> 01:27:03,600
aspect and then even besides the natural
 

5115
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,169
aspect and then even besides the natural
language aspect you also have the The

5116
01:27:06,169 --> 01:27:06,179
language aspect you also have the The
 

5117
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:07,970
language aspect you also have the The
Cooperative elements of the game and I

5118
01:27:07,970 --> 01:27:07,980
Cooperative elements of the game and I
 

5119
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:09,590
Cooperative elements of the game and I
think this is actually

5120
01:27:09,590 --> 01:27:09,600
think this is actually
 

5121
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:10,669
think this is actually
um something that I find really

5122
01:27:10,669 --> 01:27:10,679
um something that I find really
 

5123
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:12,649
um something that I find really
interesting if you look at all the

5124
01:27:12,649 --> 01:27:12,659
interesting if you look at all the
 

5125
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:14,990
interesting if you look at all the
previous game AI uh breakthroughs

previous game AI uh breakthroughs
 

5127
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:16,370
previous game AI uh breakthroughs
they've all happened in these purely

01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:19,620
actually need to understand how humans
 

5133
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:22,550
actually need to understand how humans
play the game it's all just AI versus AI

01:27:52,860 --> 01:27:54,890
zero some game guarantees that they're
going to be able to not lose to any

5160
01:27:54,890 --> 01:27:54,900
going to be able to not lose to any
 

5161
01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:57,169
going to be able to not lose to any
opponent so you can't leverage self-play

5162
01:27:57,169 --> 01:27:57,179
opponent so you can't leverage self-play
 

5163
01:27:57,179 --> 01:27:59,330
opponent so you can't leverage self-play
to solve this game you you can leverage

5164
01:27:59,330 --> 01:27:59,340
to solve this game you you can leverage
 

5165
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,250
to solve this game you you can leverage
self-play but it's no longer sufficient

5166
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:01,260
self-play but it's no longer sufficient
 

5167
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:03,649
self-play but it's no longer sufficient
to beat humans so how do you integrate

5168
01:28:03,649 --> 01:28:03,659
to beat humans so how do you integrate
 

5169
01:28:03,659 --> 01:28:05,689
to beat humans so how do you integrate
the human into the loop of this so what

5170
01:28:05,689 --> 01:28:05,699
the human into the loop of this so what
 

5171
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:09,110
the human into the loop of this so what
you have to do is incorporate human data

5172
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
you have to do is incorporate human data
 

5173
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,030
you have to do is incorporate human data
and to kind of give you some intuition

5174
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:11,040
and to kind of give you some intuition
 

5175
01:28:11,040 --> 01:28:12,410
and to kind of give you some intuition
for why this is the case like imagine

5176
01:28:12,410 --> 01:28:12,420
for why this is the case like imagine
 

5177
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:13,970
for why this is the case like imagine
you're playing a negotiation game like

5178
01:28:13,970 --> 01:28:13,980
you're playing a negotiation game like
 

5179
01:28:13,980 --> 01:28:15,709
you're playing a negotiation game like
like diplomacy

5180
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:15,719
like diplomacy
 

5181
01:28:15,719 --> 01:28:17,450
like diplomacy
um but you're training completely from

5182
01:28:17,450 --> 01:28:17,460
um but you're training completely from
 

5183
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,470
um but you're training completely from
scratch

5184
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:18,480
scratch
 

5185
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,350
scratch
without any human data the AI is not

5186
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
without any human data the AI is not
 

5187
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:23,570
without any human data the AI is not
going to suddenly like figure out how to

5188
01:28:23,570 --> 01:28:23,580
going to suddenly like figure out how to
 

5189
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,070
going to suddenly like figure out how to
communicate in English it's going to

5190
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:25,080
communicate in English it's going to
 

5191
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,810
communicate in English it's going to
figure out some weird robot language

5192
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:26,820
figure out some weird robot language
 

5193
01:28:26,820 --> 01:28:29,209
figure out some weird robot language
that only it will understand yeah and

5194
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:29,219
that only it will understand yeah and
 

5195
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:30,709
that only it will understand yeah and
then when you stick that in a game with

5196
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
then when you stick that in a game with
 

5197
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,169
then when you stick that in a game with
six other humans they're gonna think

5198
01:28:33,169 --> 01:28:33,179
six other humans they're gonna think
 

5199
01:28:33,179 --> 01:28:34,490
six other humans they're gonna think
this person's talking gibberish and

5200
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:34,500
this person's talking gibberish and
 

5201
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:35,330
this person's talking gibberish and
they're just going to Ally with each

5202
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:35,340
they're just going to Ally with each
 

5203
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:37,070
they're just going to Ally with each
other and team up against the bot

5204
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:37,080
other and team up against the bot
 

5205
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,689
other and team up against the bot
or not even team up against the ball but

5206
01:28:38,689 --> 01:28:38,699
or not even team up against the ball but
 

5207
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:40,610
or not even team up against the ball but
just not work with the bot and so in

5208
01:28:40,610 --> 01:28:40,620
just not work with the bot and so in
 

5209
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,129
just not work with the bot and so in
order to be able to play this game with

5210
01:28:43,129 --> 01:28:43,139
order to be able to play this game with
 

5211
01:28:43,139 --> 01:28:45,050
order to be able to play this game with
humans it has to understand the human

5212
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,060
humans it has to understand the human
 

5213
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:47,209
humans it has to understand the human
way of playing the game not this machine

5214
01:28:47,209 --> 01:28:47,219
way of playing the game not this machine
 

5215
01:28:47,219 --> 01:28:50,090
way of playing the game not this machine
way of playing the game yeah yeah that's

5216
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:50,100
way of playing the game yeah yeah that's
 

5217
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:53,810
way of playing the game yeah yeah that's
fascinating so right the the there's a

5218
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:53,820
fascinating so right the the there's a
 

5219
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:56,689
fascinating so right the the there's a
nuanced thing to understand because the

5220
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:56,699
nuanced thing to understand because the
 

5221
01:28:56,699 --> 01:28:59,270
nuanced thing to understand because the
a chess playing program doesn't need to

5222
01:28:59,270 --> 01:28:59,280
a chess playing program doesn't need to
 

5223
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:00,830
a chess playing program doesn't need to
play like a human to beat a human

5224
01:29:00,830 --> 01:29:00,840
play like a human to beat a human
 

5225
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:03,410
play like a human to beat a human
exactly but here you have to play like a

5226
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:03,420
exactly but here you have to play like a
 

5227
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,149
exactly but here you have to play like a
human in order to beat them or at least

5228
01:29:05,149 --> 01:29:05,159
human in order to beat them or at least
 

5229
01:29:05,159 --> 01:29:06,770
human in order to beat them or at least
you have to understand how humans play

5230
01:29:06,770 --> 01:29:06,780
you have to understand how humans play
 

5231
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:08,149
you have to understand how humans play
the game so that you can understand how

5232
01:29:08,149 --> 01:29:08,159
the game so that you can understand how
 

5233
01:29:08,159 --> 01:29:09,770
the game so that you can understand how
to work with them if they have certain

5234
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:09,780
to work with them if they have certain
 

5235
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,110
to work with them if they have certain
expectations about what does it mean to

5236
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:12,120
expectations about what does it mean to
 

5237
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:14,689
expectations about what does it mean to
be a good Ally what does it mean to have

5238
01:29:14,689 --> 01:29:14,699
be a good Ally what does it mean to have
 

5239
01:29:14,699 --> 01:29:16,370
be a good Ally what does it mean to have
like a reciprocal relationship where

5240
01:29:16,370 --> 01:29:16,380
like a reciprocal relationship where
 

5241
01:29:16,380 --> 01:29:18,590
like a reciprocal relationship where
we're working together you have to abide

5242
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:18,600
we're working together you have to abide
 

5243
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,750
we're working together you have to abide
by those conventions and if you don't

5244
01:29:20,750 --> 01:29:20,760
by those conventions and if you don't
 

5245
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:21,770
by those conventions and if you don't
they're just going to work with somebody

5246
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:21,780
they're just going to work with somebody
 

5247
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:25,370
they're just going to work with somebody
else instead do you think of this as a

5248
01:29:25,370 --> 01:29:25,380
else instead do you think of this as a
 

5249
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:28,070
else instead do you think of this as a
clean in some deep sense of the spirit

5250
01:29:28,070 --> 01:29:28,080
clean in some deep sense of the spirit
 

5251
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,629
clean in some deep sense of the spirit
of the touring test is formulated by

5252
01:29:29,629 --> 01:29:29,639
of the touring test is formulated by
 

5253
01:29:29,639 --> 01:29:32,870
of the touring test is formulated by
Alan Turing is is it in some sense this

5254
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:32,880
Alan Turing is is it in some sense this
 

5255
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:34,729
Alan Turing is is it in some sense this
is what the Turing test actually looks

5256
01:29:34,729 --> 01:29:34,739
is what the Turing test actually looks
 

5257
01:29:34,739 --> 01:29:36,229
is what the Turing test actually looks
like

5258
01:29:36,229 --> 01:29:36,239
like
 

5259
01:29:36,239 --> 01:29:39,290
like
so because of open-ended natural

5260
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:39,300
so because of open-ended natural
 

5261
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,110
so because of open-ended natural
language conversation seems like

5262
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:42,120
language conversation seems like
 

5263
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,350
language conversation seems like
very difficult to evaluate like here at

5264
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
very difficult to evaluate like here at
 

5265
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,030
very difficult to evaluate like here at
a high stakes where humans are trying to

5266
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
a high stakes where humans are trying to
 

5267
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:49,010
a high stakes where humans are trying to
win a game that seems like how you

5268
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:49,020
win a game that seems like how you
 

5269
01:29:49,020 --> 01:29:50,149
win a game that seems like how you
actually

5270
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
actually
 

5271
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,610
actually
perform the Turing test I think it's

5272
01:29:52,610 --> 01:29:52,620
perform the Turing test I think it's
 

5273
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,229
perform the Turing test I think it's
different from the touring test like the

5274
01:29:54,229 --> 01:29:54,239
different from the touring test like the
 

5275
01:29:54,239 --> 01:29:55,850
different from the touring test like the
way that the touring test is formulated

5276
01:29:55,850 --> 01:29:55,860
way that the touring test is formulated
 

5277
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:58,010
way that the touring test is formulated
it's about trying to distinguish a human

5278
01:29:58,010 --> 01:29:58,020
it's about trying to distinguish a human
 

5279
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,530
it's about trying to distinguish a human
from a machine and seeing Oh could the

5280
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:00,540
from a machine and seeing Oh could the
 

5281
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,290
from a machine and seeing Oh could the
machine uh successfully pass as a human

5282
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:03,300
machine uh successfully pass as a human
 

5283
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,030
machine uh successfully pass as a human
in this adversarial setting where the

5284
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:05,040
in this adversarial setting where the
 

5285
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,950
in this adversarial setting where the
eight where the player is trying to

5286
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:06,960
eight where the player is trying to
 

5287
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:08,330
eight where the player is trying to
figure out whether it's a machine or a

5288
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:08,340
figure out whether it's a machine or a
 

5289
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:10,970
figure out whether it's a machine or a
human whereas in diplomacy it's not

5290
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:10,980
human whereas in diplomacy it's not
 

5291
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:12,709
human whereas in diplomacy it's not
about trying to figure out whether this

5292
01:30:12,709 --> 01:30:12,719
about trying to figure out whether this
 

5293
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:14,629
about trying to figure out whether this
player is a human or a machine it's

5294
01:30:14,629 --> 01:30:14,639
player is a human or a machine it's
 

5295
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:16,490
player is a human or a machine it's
ultimately about whether I can work with

5296
01:30:16,490 --> 01:30:16,500
ultimately about whether I can work with
 

5297
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,649
ultimately about whether I can work with
this player regardless of whether they

5298
01:30:18,649 --> 01:30:18,659
this player regardless of whether they
 

5299
01:30:18,659 --> 01:30:20,689
this player regardless of whether they
are a human or machine and can the

5300
01:30:20,689 --> 01:30:20,699
are a human or machine and can the
 

5301
01:30:20,699 --> 01:30:23,870
are a human or machine and can the
machine do that better than a human can

5302
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:23,880
machine do that better than a human can
 

5303
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:26,450
machine do that better than a human can
yeah I'm going to think about that but

5304
01:30:26,450 --> 01:30:26,460
yeah I'm going to think about that but
 

5305
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:28,250
yeah I'm going to think about that but
that just feels like

5306
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:28,260
that just feels like
 

5307
01:30:28,260 --> 01:30:32,090
that just feels like
the implied requirement for that is for

5308
01:30:32,090 --> 01:30:32,100
the implied requirement for that is for
 

5309
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:34,370
the implied requirement for that is for
the machine to be human-like

5310
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:34,380
the machine to be human-like
 

5311
01:30:34,380 --> 01:30:36,229
the machine to be human-like
I think that's I think that's true that

5312
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:36,239
I think that's I think that's true that
 

5313
01:30:36,239 --> 01:30:38,090
I think that's I think that's true that
if you're going to play in this human

5314
01:30:38,090 --> 01:30:38,100
if you're going to play in this human
 

5315
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:38,990
if you're going to play in this human
game

5316
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:39,000
game
 

5317
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:42,050
game
you have to somehow adapt to the to the

5318
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:42,060
you have to somehow adapt to the to the
 

5319
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:43,970
you have to somehow adapt to the to the
human surroundings and the human

5320
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:43,980
human surroundings and the human
 

5321
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:47,149
human surroundings and the human
playstyle and to win you have to adapt

5322
01:30:47,149 --> 01:30:47,159
playstyle and to win you have to adapt
 

5323
01:30:47,159 --> 01:30:49,910
playstyle and to win you have to adapt
so you can't if you're the outsider

5324
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:49,920
so you can't if you're the outsider
 

5325
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,310
so you can't if you're the outsider
if you're not human-like I feel like

5326
01:30:52,310 --> 01:30:52,320
if you're not human-like I feel like
 

5327
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,410
if you're not human-like I feel like
that's a losing strategy I think that's

5328
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:54,420
that's a losing strategy I think that's
 

5329
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,930
that's a losing strategy I think that's
I think that's correct yeah yeah so okay

5330
01:30:56,930 --> 01:30:56,940
I think that's correct yeah yeah so okay
 

5331
01:30:56,940 --> 01:30:59,149
I think that's correct yeah yeah so okay
uh

5332
01:30:59,149 --> 01:30:59,159
uh
 

5333
01:30:59,159 --> 01:31:01,129
uh
what what are the complexities here what

5334
01:31:01,129 --> 01:31:01,139
what what are the complexities here what
 

5335
01:31:01,139 --> 01:31:03,410
what what are the complexities here what
was your approach to it before I get to

5336
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:03,420
was your approach to it before I get to
 

5337
01:31:03,420 --> 01:31:05,090
was your approach to it before I get to
that one thing I should explain like why

5338
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:05,100
that one thing I should explain like why
 

5339
01:31:05,100 --> 01:31:07,910
that one thing I should explain like why
we decided to work on diplomacy so

5340
01:31:07,910 --> 01:31:07,920
we decided to work on diplomacy so
 

5341
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:11,450
we decided to work on diplomacy so
basically what happened is in 2019

5342
01:31:11,450 --> 01:31:11,460
basically what happened is in 2019
 

5343
01:31:11,460 --> 01:31:13,550
basically what happened is in 2019
um I was wrapping up the work on six

5344
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:13,560
um I was wrapping up the work on six
 

5345
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,129
um I was wrapping up the work on six
player poker on pluribus and was trying

5346
01:31:16,129 --> 01:31:16,139
player poker on pluribus and was trying
 

5347
01:31:16,139 --> 01:31:18,530
player poker on pluribus and was trying
to think about what to work on next and

5348
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:18,540
to think about what to work on next and
 

5349
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:20,450
to think about what to work on next and
I had been seeing like all these other

5350
01:31:20,450 --> 01:31:20,460
I had been seeing like all these other
 

5351
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:21,950
I had been seeing like all these other
breakthroughs happening in AI I mean

5352
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:21,960
breakthroughs happening in AI I mean
 

5353
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:24,950
breakthroughs happening in AI I mean
like 2019 you have Starcraft you have

5354
01:31:24,950 --> 01:31:24,960
like 2019 you have Starcraft you have
 

5355
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,870
like 2019 you have Starcraft you have
Alpha star beating humans and Starcraft

5356
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:26,880
Alpha star beating humans and Starcraft
 

5357
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:29,030
Alpha star beating humans and Starcraft
you've got the Dota 2 stuff happening at

5358
01:31:29,030 --> 01:31:29,040
you've got the Dota 2 stuff happening at
 

5359
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:32,750
you've got the Dota 2 stuff happening at
open AI you have GPT 2 or GPD 3 coming I

5360
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:32,760
open AI you have GPT 2 or GPD 3 coming I
 

5361
01:31:32,760 --> 01:31:35,330
open AI you have GPT 2 or GPD 3 coming I
think it was gpd2 at the time and it

5362
01:31:35,330 --> 01:31:35,340
think it was gpd2 at the time and it
 

5363
01:31:35,340 --> 01:31:37,370
think it was gpd2 at the time and it
became clear that AI was progressing

5364
01:31:37,370 --> 01:31:37,380
became clear that AI was progressing
 

5365
01:31:37,380 --> 01:31:39,290
became clear that AI was progressing
really really rapidly

5366
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:39,300
really really rapidly
 

5367
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,110
really really rapidly
and people were throwing out these like

5368
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:42,120
and people were throwing out these like
 

5369
01:31:42,120 --> 01:31:43,729
and people were throwing out these like
other games about you know what should

5370
01:31:43,729 --> 01:31:43,739
other games about you know what should
 

5371
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:45,290
other games about you know what should
be the next challenge for for

5372
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:45,300
be the next challenge for for
 

5373
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:48,950
be the next challenge for for
multi-agent AI and I just felt like we

5374
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:48,960
multi-agent AI and I just felt like we
 

5375
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:50,510
multi-agent AI and I just felt like we
had to aim bigger

5376
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:50,520
had to aim bigger
 

5377
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:51,350
had to aim bigger
um

5378
01:31:51,350 --> 01:31:51,360
um
 

5379
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:53,450
um
if you look at a game like chess or a

5380
01:31:53,450 --> 01:31:53,460
if you look at a game like chess or a
 

5381
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:55,790
if you look at a game like chess or a
game like go they took decades for

5382
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:55,800
game like go they took decades for
 

5383
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:58,490
game like go they took decades for
researchers to to ultimately reach

5384
01:31:58,490 --> 01:31:58,500
researchers to to ultimately reach
 

5385
01:31:58,500 --> 01:31:59,870
researchers to to ultimately reach
superhuman performance at I mean like

5386
01:31:59,870 --> 01:31:59,880
superhuman performance at I mean like
 

5387
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,750
superhuman performance at I mean like
chess took 40 Years of AI research go

5388
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:02,760
chess took 40 Years of AI research go
 

5389
01:32:02,760 --> 01:32:04,970
chess took 40 Years of AI research go
took another 20 years

5390
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:04,980
took another 20 years
 

5391
01:32:04,980 --> 01:32:06,530
took another 20 years
um and

5392
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:06,540
um and
 

5393
01:32:06,540 --> 01:32:09,290
um and
we we thought that diplomacy would be

5394
01:32:09,290 --> 01:32:09,300
we we thought that diplomacy would be
 

5395
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:11,209
we we thought that diplomacy would be
this incredibly difficult challenge that

5396
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:11,219
this incredibly difficult challenge that
 

5397
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:13,850
this incredibly difficult challenge that
could easily take a decade to make an AI

5398
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:13,860
could easily take a decade to make an AI
 

5399
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:15,770
could easily take a decade to make an AI
that could play competently

5400
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:15,780
that could play competently
 

5401
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:17,209
that could play competently
um but we felt like that was that was a

5402
01:32:17,209 --> 01:32:17,219
um but we felt like that was that was a
 

5403
01:32:17,219 --> 01:32:19,310
um but we felt like that was that was a
goal worth aiming for

5404
01:32:19,310 --> 01:32:19,320
goal worth aiming for
 

5405
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,090
goal worth aiming for
um

5406
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:20,100
um
 

5407
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,709
um
and so honestly I was kind of reluctant

5408
01:32:21,709 --> 01:32:21,719
and so honestly I was kind of reluctant
 

5409
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:23,390
and so honestly I was kind of reluctant
to work on it at first because I thought

5410
01:32:23,390 --> 01:32:23,400
to work on it at first because I thought
 

5411
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:25,669
to work on it at first because I thought
it was like too far out of the realm of

5412
01:32:25,669 --> 01:32:25,679
it was like too far out of the realm of
 

5413
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,350
it was like too far out of the realm of
possibility but you know I was talking

5414
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:27,360
possibility but you know I was talking
 

5415
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:29,090
possibility but you know I was talking
to a co-worker of mine Adam Lear and he

5416
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:29,100
to a co-worker of mine Adam Lear and he
 

5417
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,470
to a co-worker of mine Adam Lear and he
was basically saying like yeah why not

5418
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
was basically saying like yeah why not
 

5419
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,209
was basically saying like yeah why not
aim for it you know we'll learn some

5420
01:32:32,209 --> 01:32:32,219
aim for it you know we'll learn some
 

5421
01:32:32,219 --> 01:32:33,169
aim for it you know we'll learn some
interesting things along the way and

5422
01:32:33,169 --> 01:32:33,179
interesting things along the way and
 

5423
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:34,850
interesting things along the way and
maybe it'll be possible

5424
01:32:34,850 --> 01:32:34,860
maybe it'll be possible
 

5425
01:32:34,860 --> 01:32:36,709
maybe it'll be possible
um and so so we decided to go for it and

5426
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
um and so so we decided to go for it and
 

5427
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:38,750
um and so so we decided to go for it and
I think I think it was the right choice

5428
01:32:38,750 --> 01:32:38,760
I think I think it was the right choice
 

5429
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,810
I think I think it was the right choice
considering just how much progress there

5430
01:32:41,810 --> 01:32:41,820
considering just how much progress there
 

5431
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:43,970
considering just how much progress there
there was in Ai and that that progress

5432
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:43,980
there was in Ai and that that progress
 

5433
01:32:43,980 --> 01:32:45,890
there was in Ai and that that progress
has continued in the years since so

5434
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:45,900
has continued in the years since so
 

5435
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:48,709
has continued in the years since so
winning in diplomacy what does that

5436
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
winning in diplomacy what does that
 

5437
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:53,450
winning in diplomacy what does that
really look like it means talking to six

5438
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:53,460
really look like it means talking to six
 

5439
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:57,229
really look like it means talking to six
other players six other entities agents

5440
01:32:57,229 --> 01:32:57,239
other players six other entities agents
 

5441
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,510
other players six other entities agents
and convincing

5442
01:32:59,510 --> 01:32:59,520
and convincing
 

5443
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,610
and convincing
and convincing them of stuff that you

5444
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:01,620
and convincing them of stuff that you
 

5445
01:33:01,620 --> 01:33:04,129
and convincing them of stuff that you
want them to be convinced of like what

5446
01:33:04,129 --> 01:33:04,139
want them to be convinced of like what
 

5447
01:33:04,139 --> 01:33:06,470
want them to be convinced of like what
what exactly I'm trying to get like to

5448
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:06,480
what exactly I'm trying to get like to
 

5449
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,290
what exactly I'm trying to get like to
deeply understand what the problem is

5450
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:09,300
deeply understand what the problem is
 

5451
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,850
deeply understand what the problem is
ultimately

5452
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:10,860
ultimately
 

5453
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:13,189
ultimately
the problem is it's simple to to

5454
01:33:13,189 --> 01:33:13,199
the problem is it's simple to to
 

5455
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,930
the problem is it's simple to to
quantify right like you're going to play

5456
01:33:14,930 --> 01:33:14,940
quantify right like you're going to play
 

5457
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:17,990
quantify right like you're going to play
this game with humans and you want your

5458
01:33:17,990 --> 01:33:18,000
this game with humans and you want your
 

5459
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,970
this game with humans and you want your
score on average to be

5460
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:19,980
score on average to be
 

5461
01:33:19,980 --> 01:33:21,709
score on average to be
um as high as possible you know if you

5462
01:33:21,709 --> 01:33:21,719
um as high as possible you know if you
 

5463
01:33:21,719 --> 01:33:24,649
um as high as possible you know if you
can say like I am winning more than any

5464
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:24,659
can say like I am winning more than any
 

5465
01:33:24,659 --> 01:33:26,570
can say like I am winning more than any
any human alive

5466
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:26,580
any human alive
 

5467
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,250
any human alive
um then you're a champion diplomacy

5468
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:28,260
um then you're a champion diplomacy
 

5469
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,689
um then you're a champion diplomacy
player

5470
01:33:29,689 --> 01:33:29,699
player
 

5471
01:33:29,699 --> 01:33:31,250
player
um now ultimately we haven't we didn't

5472
01:33:31,250 --> 01:33:31,260
um now ultimately we haven't we didn't
 

5473
01:33:31,260 --> 01:33:32,510
um now ultimately we haven't we didn't
reach that we got to human level

5474
01:33:32,510 --> 01:33:32,520
reach that we got to human level
 

5475
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,250
reach that we got to human level
performance we actually so we played

5476
01:33:34,250 --> 01:33:34,260
performance we actually so we played
 

5477
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:36,709
performance we actually so we played
about 40 games with with real humans

5478
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:36,719
about 40 games with with real humans
 

5479
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,010
about 40 games with with real humans
online uh the bot came in second out of

5480
01:33:40,010 --> 01:33:40,020
online uh the bot came in second out of
 

5481
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:41,330
online uh the bot came in second out of
all players that played five or more

5482
01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:41,340
all players that played five or more
 

5483
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:45,110
all players that played five or more
games and um so not like number one but

5484
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:45,120
games and um so not like number one but
 

5485
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,450
games and um so not like number one but
way way higher than well what was the

5486
01:33:47,450 --> 01:33:47,460
way way higher than well what was the
 

5487
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,790
way way higher than well what was the
expertise level are the beginners are

5488
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:49,800
expertise level are the beginners are
 

5489
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:51,410
expertise level are the beginners are
they intermediate players Advanced

5490
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:51,420
they intermediate players Advanced
 

5491
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:53,510
they intermediate players Advanced
players so no sense that's a great

5492
01:33:53,510 --> 01:33:53,520
players so no sense that's a great
 

5493
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:55,010
players so no sense that's a great
question and so I think

5494
01:33:55,010 --> 01:33:55,020
question and so I think
 

5495
01:33:55,020 --> 01:33:56,510
question and so I think
this kind of goes into how do you

5496
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:56,520
this kind of goes into how do you
 

5497
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:58,370
this kind of goes into how do you
measure the performance in diplomacy and

5498
01:33:58,370 --> 01:33:58,380
measure the performance in diplomacy and
 

5499
01:33:58,380 --> 01:33:59,870
measure the performance in diplomacy and
I would argue that when you're measuring

5500
01:33:59,870 --> 01:33:59,880
I would argue that when you're measuring
 

5501
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,669
I would argue that when you're measuring
performance in a game like this you

5502
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:01,679
performance in a game like this you
 

5503
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,470
performance in a game like this you
don't actually want to measure it in

5504
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:03,480
don't actually want to measure it in
 

5505
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,990
don't actually want to measure it in
games with all expert players uh it's

5506
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,000
games with all expert players uh it's
 

5507
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,250
games with all expert players uh it's
kind of like if you're developing a

5508
01:34:07,250 --> 01:34:07,260
kind of like if you're developing a
 

5509
01:34:07,260 --> 01:34:09,590
kind of like if you're developing a
self-driving car you don't want to

5510
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:09,600
self-driving car you don't want to
 

5511
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:11,629
self-driving car you don't want to
measure that car on the road with a

5512
01:34:11,629 --> 01:34:11,639
measure that car on the road with a
 

5513
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:14,030
measure that car on the road with a
bunch of expert stunt drivers you want

5514
01:34:14,030 --> 01:34:14,040
bunch of expert stunt drivers you want
 

5515
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:15,830
bunch of expert stunt drivers you want
to put it on a road of like an actual

5516
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:15,840
to put it on a road of like an actual
 

5517
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,189
to put it on a road of like an actual
American city and see is this car

5518
01:34:18,189 --> 01:34:18,199
American city and see is this car
 

5519
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,570
American city and see is this car
crashing less often than an expert

5520
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:20,580
crashing less often than an expert
 

5521
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:21,709
crashing less often than an expert
driver would

5522
01:34:21,709 --> 01:34:21,719
driver would
 

5523
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:23,450
driver would
so so that's the metric that we've used

5524
01:34:23,450 --> 01:34:23,460
so so that's the metric that we've used
 

5525
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,430
so so that's the metric that we've used
we we're saying like we're going to

5526
01:34:25,430 --> 01:34:25,440
we we're saying like we're going to
 

5527
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,169
we we're saying like we're going to
stick this game we're gonna stick this

5528
01:34:27,169 --> 01:34:27,179
stick this game we're gonna stick this
 

5529
01:34:27,179 --> 01:34:29,390
stick this game we're gonna stick this
bot in games with a wide variety of

5530
01:34:29,390 --> 01:34:29,400
bot in games with a wide variety of
 

5531
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,669
bot in games with a wide variety of
skill levels and then are we doing

5532
01:34:31,669 --> 01:34:31,679
skill levels and then are we doing
 

5533
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,250
skill levels and then are we doing
better than a strong or expert human

5534
01:34:34,250 --> 01:34:34,260
better than a strong or expert human
 

5535
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:36,530
better than a strong or expert human
player would in the same situation

5536
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:36,540
player would in the same situation
 

5537
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,870
player would in the same situation
that's quite brilliant because I played

5538
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:38,880
that's quite brilliant because I played
 

5539
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,669
that's quite brilliant because I played
a lot of sports in my life like as a

5540
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:40,679
a lot of sports in my life like as a
 

5541
01:34:40,679 --> 01:34:42,050
a lot of sports in my life like as a
tennis Judo whatever

5542
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:42,060
tennis Judo whatever
 

5543
01:34:42,060 --> 01:34:45,169
tennis Judo whatever
and it's it's somehow almost easier to

5544
01:34:45,169 --> 01:34:45,179
and it's it's somehow almost easier to
 

5545
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:47,390
and it's it's somehow almost easier to
go against experts almost always I don't

5546
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:47,400
go against experts almost always I don't
 

5547
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:50,090
go against experts almost always I don't
I think they're more predictable in the

5548
01:34:50,090 --> 01:34:50,100
I think they're more predictable in the
 

5549
01:34:50,100 --> 01:34:52,790
I think they're more predictable in the
quality of play the the space of

5550
01:34:52,790 --> 01:34:52,800
quality of play the the space of
 

5551
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,590
quality of play the the space of
strategies you're operating under is

5552
01:34:54,590 --> 01:34:54,600
strategies you're operating under is
 

5553
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:57,350
strategies you're operating under is
narrower against experts it's more fun

5554
01:34:57,350 --> 01:34:57,360
narrower against experts it's more fun
 

5555
01:34:57,360 --> 01:34:58,790
narrower against experts it's more fun
it's really frustrating to go against

5556
01:34:58,790 --> 01:34:58,800
it's really frustrating to go against
 

5557
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,709
it's really frustrating to go against
beginners also because beginners talk

5558
01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:00,719
beginners also because beginners talk
 

5559
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,530
beginners also because beginners talk
trash to you when they somehow do beat

5560
01:35:03,530 --> 01:35:03,540
trash to you when they somehow do beat
 

5561
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:05,870
trash to you when they somehow do beat
you so that's a human thing that AI

5562
01:35:05,870 --> 01:35:05,880
you so that's a human thing that AI
 

5563
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,310
you so that's a human thing that AI
doesn't have to be worry about that but

5564
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:07,320
doesn't have to be worry about that but
 

5565
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:09,649
doesn't have to be worry about that but
yeah the variants and strategies right

5566
01:35:09,649 --> 01:35:09,659
yeah the variants and strategies right
 

5567
01:35:09,659 --> 01:35:11,510
yeah the variants and strategies right
is greater especially with natural

5568
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,520
is greater especially with natural
 

5569
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,310
is greater especially with natural
language it's just all over the place

5570
01:35:13,310 --> 01:35:13,320
language it's just all over the place
 

5571
01:35:13,320 --> 01:35:15,649
language it's just all over the place
then true yeah and honestly when you

5572
01:35:15,649 --> 01:35:15,659
then true yeah and honestly when you
 

5573
01:35:15,659 --> 01:35:18,770
then true yeah and honestly when you
look at what makes a good human

5574
01:35:18,770 --> 01:35:18,780
look at what makes a good human
 

5575
01:35:18,780 --> 01:35:20,510
look at what makes a good human
diplomacy player

5576
01:35:20,510 --> 01:35:20,520
diplomacy player
 

5577
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:21,709
diplomacy player
um obviously they're able to handle

5578
01:35:21,709 --> 01:35:21,719
um obviously they're able to handle
 

5579
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:23,030
um obviously they're able to handle
themselves in games with other expert

5580
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,040
themselves in games with other expert
 

5581
01:35:23,040 --> 01:35:25,010
themselves in games with other expert
humans but where they really shine is

5582
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:25,020
humans but where they really shine is
 

5583
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:26,209
humans but where they really shine is
when they're playing with these weak

5584
01:35:26,209 --> 01:35:26,219
when they're playing with these weak
 

5585
01:35:26,219 --> 01:35:28,129
when they're playing with these weak
players and they know how to take

5586
01:35:28,129 --> 01:35:28,139
players and they know how to take
 

5587
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:30,169
players and they know how to take
advantage of the fact that they're a

5588
01:35:30,169 --> 01:35:30,179
advantage of the fact that they're a
 

5589
01:35:30,179 --> 01:35:31,550
advantage of the fact that they're a
weak player that they won't be able to

5590
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:31,560
weak player that they won't be able to
 

5591
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,890
weak player that they won't be able to
like pull off a stab as well or that

5592
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:33,900
like pull off a stab as well or that
 

5593
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:35,750
like pull off a stab as well or that
they have certain Tendencies and they

5594
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:35,760
they have certain Tendencies and they
 

5595
01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:36,950
they have certain Tendencies and they
can take them under their wing and

5596
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
can take them under their wing and
 

5597
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,629
can take them under their wing and
persuade them to do things that might

5598
01:35:38,629 --> 01:35:38,639
persuade them to do things that might
 

5599
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:40,550
persuade them to do things that might
not even be in their interest

5600
01:35:40,550 --> 01:35:40,560
not even be in their interest
 

5601
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:42,709
not even be in their interest
um the really good diplomacy players are

5602
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
um the really good diplomacy players are
 

5603
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:45,229
um the really good diplomacy players are
able to to take advantage of the fact

5604
01:35:45,229 --> 01:35:45,239
able to to take advantage of the fact
 

5605
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,850
able to to take advantage of the fact
that there is that there are some weak

5606
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:46,860
that there is that there are some weak
 

5607
01:35:46,860 --> 01:35:48,530
that there is that there are some weak
players in the game okay so if you have

5608
01:35:48,530 --> 01:35:48,540
players in the game okay so if you have
 

5609
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,169
players in the game okay so if you have
to incorporate human play data how do

5610
01:35:51,169 --> 01:35:51,179
to incorporate human play data how do
 

5611
01:35:51,179 --> 01:35:52,790
to incorporate human play data how do
you do that how do you do that in order

5612
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
you do that how do you do that in order
 

5613
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,790
you do that how do you do that in order
to train an AI system to play diplomacy

5614
01:35:55,790 --> 01:35:55,800
to train an AI system to play diplomacy
 

5615
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:58,430
to train an AI system to play diplomacy
yeah so that's that's really the Crux of

5616
01:35:58,430 --> 01:35:58,440
yeah so that's that's really the Crux of
 

5617
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,169
yeah so that's that's really the Crux of
the problem how do we

5618
01:36:00,169 --> 01:36:00,179
the problem how do we
 

5619
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:02,390
the problem how do we
um leverage the benefits of self-play

5620
01:36:02,390 --> 01:36:02,400
um leverage the benefits of self-play
 

5621
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,729
um leverage the benefits of self-play
that have been so successful in all

5622
01:36:04,729 --> 01:36:04,739
that have been so successful in all
 

5623
01:36:04,739 --> 01:36:07,490
that have been so successful in all
these other previous games while keeping

5624
01:36:07,490 --> 01:36:07,500
these other previous games while keeping
 

5625
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,530
these other previous games while keeping
the strategy as uh as human compatible

5626
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:09,540
the strategy as uh as human compatible
 

5627
01:36:09,540 --> 01:36:10,669
the strategy as uh as human compatible
as possible

5628
01:36:10,669 --> 01:36:10,679
as possible
 

5629
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:13,729
as possible
and so what we did is we first trained a

5630
01:36:13,729 --> 01:36:13,739
and so what we did is we first trained a
 

5631
01:36:13,739 --> 01:36:15,229
and so what we did is we first trained a
language model

5632
01:36:15,229 --> 01:36:15,239
language model
 

5633
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:16,850
language model
um and then we made that language model

5634
01:36:16,850 --> 01:36:16,860
um and then we made that language model
 

5635
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,910
um and then we made that language model
controllable on a set of in a set of

5636
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:19,920
controllable on a set of in a set of
 

5637
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,010
controllable on a set of in a set of
intents what we call intense which are

5638
01:36:22,010 --> 01:36:22,020
intents what we call intense which are
 

5639
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:23,570
intents what we call intense which are
basically like an action that we want to

5640
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:23,580
basically like an action that we want to
 

5641
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,790
basically like an action that we want to
play and an action that we would like

5642
01:36:25,790 --> 01:36:25,800
play and an action that we would like
 

5643
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,709
play and an action that we would like
the other player to play and so this

5644
01:36:27,709 --> 01:36:27,719
the other player to play and so this
 

5645
01:36:27,719 --> 01:36:29,450
the other player to play and so this
gives us a way to generate dialogue

5646
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:29,460
gives us a way to generate dialogue
 

5647
01:36:29,460 --> 01:36:31,129
gives us a way to generate dialogue
that's not just trying to imitate the

5648
01:36:31,129 --> 01:36:31,139
that's not just trying to imitate the
 

5649
01:36:31,139 --> 01:36:32,689
that's not just trying to imitate the
human style

5650
01:36:32,689 --> 01:36:32,699
human style
 

5651
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:34,010
human style
um whatever a human would say in the

5652
01:36:34,010 --> 01:36:34,020
um whatever a human would say in the
 

5653
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:36,470
um whatever a human would say in the
situation but to actually give it a a an

5654
01:36:36,470 --> 01:36:36,480
situation but to actually give it a a an
 

5655
01:36:36,480 --> 01:36:38,450
situation but to actually give it a a an
intent of purpose in its communication

5656
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:38,460
intent of purpose in its communication
 

5657
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:40,970
intent of purpose in its communication
we can talk about a specific move or we

5658
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:40,980
we can talk about a specific move or we
 

5659
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:43,430
we can talk about a specific move or we
can make a specific request and the

5660
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:43,440
can make a specific request and the
 

5661
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,830
can make a specific request and the
determination of what that move is that

5662
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:45,840
determination of what that move is that
 

5663
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:48,649
determination of what that move is that
we're discussing comes from

5664
01:36:48,649 --> 01:36:48,659
we're discussing comes from
 

5665
01:36:48,659 --> 01:36:50,629
we're discussing comes from
um strategic strategic reasoning model

5666
01:36:50,629 --> 01:36:50,639
um strategic strategic reasoning model
 

5667
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:52,310
um strategic strategic reasoning model
that uses reinforcement learning and

5668
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,320
that uses reinforcement learning and
 

5669
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,790
that uses reinforcement learning and
planning so the Computing the intents

5670
01:36:55,790 --> 01:36:55,800
planning so the Computing the intents
 

5671
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,709
planning so the Computing the intents
for all the players

5672
01:36:57,709 --> 01:36:57,719
for all the players
 

5673
01:36:57,719 --> 01:37:01,430
for all the players
how's that done just so as a starting

5674
01:37:01,430 --> 01:37:01,440
how's that done just so as a starting
 

5675
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,169
how's that done just so as a starting
point is that with reinforcement

5676
01:37:03,169 --> 01:37:03,179
point is that with reinforcement
 

5677
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:04,669
point is that with reinforcement
learning or is that just optimal

5678
01:37:04,669 --> 01:37:04,679
learning or is that just optimal
 

5679
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:06,410
learning or is that just optimal
determining what the optimal is for

5680
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:06,420
determining what the optimal is for
 

5681
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,209
determining what the optimal is for
intents It's a combination of

5682
01:37:08,209 --> 01:37:08,219
intents It's a combination of
 

5683
01:37:08,219 --> 01:37:11,270
intents It's a combination of
reinforcement learning and planning

5684
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:11,280
reinforcement learning and planning
 

5685
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:12,770
reinforcement learning and planning
um actually very similar to how you

5686
01:37:12,770 --> 01:37:12,780
um actually very similar to how you
 

5687
01:37:12,780 --> 01:37:15,530
um actually very similar to how you
approach how we approached poker and how

5688
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:15,540
approach how we approached poker and how
 

5689
01:37:15,540 --> 01:37:17,750
approach how we approached poker and how
people approached like chess and go as

5690
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:17,760
people approached like chess and go as
 

5691
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,870
people approached like chess and go as
well we're using self-play and and

5692
01:37:20,870 --> 01:37:20,880
well we're using self-play and and
 

5693
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,629
well we're using self-play and and
search to try to figure out what are

5694
01:37:23,629 --> 01:37:23,639
search to try to figure out what are
 

5695
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:26,149
search to try to figure out what are
what is an optimal move for us and what

5696
01:37:26,149 --> 01:37:26,159
what is an optimal move for us and what
 

5697
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:27,530
what is an optimal move for us and what
is a desirable move that we would like

5698
01:37:27,530 --> 01:37:27,540
is a desirable move that we would like
 

5699
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:30,410
is a desirable move that we would like
this other player to play now the the

5700
01:37:30,410 --> 01:37:30,420
this other player to play now the the
 

5701
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:32,570
this other player to play now the the
difference between the way that we

5702
01:37:32,570 --> 01:37:32,580
difference between the way that we
 

5703
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,129
difference between the way that we
approached reinforcement learning and

5704
01:37:34,129 --> 01:37:34,139
approached reinforcement learning and
 

5705
01:37:34,139 --> 01:37:35,990
approached reinforcement learning and
search in this game versus those

5706
01:37:35,990 --> 01:37:36,000
search in this game versus those
 

5707
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,030
search in this game versus those
previous games is that we have to keep

5708
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:38,040
previous games is that we have to keep
 

5709
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,350
previous games is that we have to keep
it human compatible we have to

5710
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:39,360
it human compatible we have to
 

5711
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:42,110
it human compatible we have to
understand how the other person is

5712
01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:42,120
understand how the other person is
 

5713
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:43,790
understand how the other person is
likely to play rather than just assuming

5714
01:37:43,790 --> 01:37:43,800
likely to play rather than just assuming
 

5715
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:44,750
likely to play rather than just assuming
that they're going to play like a

5716
01:37:44,750 --> 01:37:44,760
that they're going to play like a
 

5717
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:47,810
that they're going to play like a
machine and how language gets them to

5718
01:37:47,810 --> 01:37:47,820
machine and how language gets them to
 

5719
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:49,910
machine and how language gets them to
play

5720
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:49,920
play
 

5721
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:51,890
play
um in a way that maximize the chance of

5722
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:51,900
um in a way that maximize the chance of
 

5723
01:37:51,900 --> 01:37:53,689
um in a way that maximize the chance of
following the intent you want them to

5724
01:37:53,689 --> 01:37:53,699
following the intent you want them to
 

5725
01:37:53,699 --> 01:37:55,490
following the intent you want them to
follow okay how do you do that how do

5726
01:37:55,490 --> 01:37:55,500
follow okay how do you do that how do
 

5727
01:37:55,500 --> 01:37:57,530
follow okay how do you do that how do
you how do you connect language to

5728
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:57,540
you how do you connect language to
 

5729
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,830
you how do you connect language to
intent so the way that RL and and

5730
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:00,840
intent so the way that RL and and
 

5731
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,810
intent so the way that RL and and
planning is done is actually not using

5732
01:38:02,810 --> 01:38:02,820
planning is done is actually not using
 

5733
01:38:02,820 --> 01:38:05,390
planning is done is actually not using
language so we're coming up with this

5734
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:05,400
language so we're coming up with this
 

5735
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,030
language so we're coming up with this
like plan for the action uh that we're

5736
01:38:08,030 --> 01:38:08,040
like plan for the action uh that we're
 

5737
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,050
like plan for the action uh that we're
gonna play and the other person's gonna

5738
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:09,060
gonna play and the other person's gonna
 

5739
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:10,550
gonna play and the other person's gonna
play and then we feed that action into

5740
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
play and then we feed that action into
 

5741
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,649
play and then we feed that action into
the dialogue model that will then send a

5742
01:38:12,649 --> 01:38:12,659
the dialogue model that will then send a
 

5743
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,510
the dialogue model that will then send a
message according to those plans so the

5744
01:38:14,510 --> 01:38:14,520
message according to those plans so the
 

5745
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:17,390
message according to those plans so the
language model there is mapping

5746
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:17,400
language model there is mapping
 

5747
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,590
language model there is mapping
action to to message to message

5748
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:21,600
action to to message to message
 

5749
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,390
action to to message to message
one word at a time

5750
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:23,400
one word at a time
 

5751
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,790
one word at a time
uh basically one message at a time so

5752
01:38:25,790 --> 01:38:25,800
uh basically one message at a time so
 

5753
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:27,350
uh basically one message at a time so
we'll we'll feed into the dialogue model

5754
01:38:27,350 --> 01:38:27,360
we'll we'll feed into the dialogue model
 

5755
01:38:27,360 --> 01:38:28,669
we'll we'll feed into the dialogue model
like here are the actions that you

5756
01:38:28,669 --> 01:38:28,679
like here are the actions that you
 

5757
01:38:28,679 --> 01:38:29,990
like here are the actions that you
should be discussing here's the message

5758
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
should be discussing here's the message
 

5759
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,510
should be discussing here's the message
here's like the the

5760
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:32,520
here's like the the
 

5761
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:33,950
here's like the the
content of the message that we would

5762
01:38:33,950 --> 01:38:33,960
content of the message that we would
 

5763
01:38:33,960 --> 01:38:35,570
content of the message that we would
like you to send and then it will

5764
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:35,580
like you to send and then it will
 

5765
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,189
like you to send and then it will
actually generate a message that

5766
01:38:37,189 --> 01:38:37,199
actually generate a message that
 

5767
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,870
actually generate a message that
corresponds to that okay does this

5768
01:38:38,870 --> 01:38:38,880
corresponds to that okay does this
 

5769
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,790
corresponds to that okay does this
actually work it works surprisingly well

5770
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:40,800
actually work it works surprisingly well
 

5771
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,729
actually work it works surprisingly well
okay how

5772
01:38:43,729 --> 01:38:43,739
okay how
 

5773
01:38:43,739 --> 01:38:46,250
okay how
oh man the the number of ways it

5774
01:38:46,250 --> 01:38:46,260
oh man the the number of ways it
 

5775
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:48,350
oh man the the number of ways it
probably goes horribly I would have

5776
01:38:48,350 --> 01:38:48,360
probably goes horribly I would have
 

5777
01:38:48,360 --> 01:38:51,110
probably goes horribly I would have
imagined it goes horribly wrong

5778
01:38:51,110 --> 01:38:51,120
imagined it goes horribly wrong
 

5779
01:38:51,120 --> 01:38:53,149
imagined it goes horribly wrong
um so how the heck is it effective at

5780
01:38:53,149 --> 01:38:53,159
um so how the heck is it effective at
 

5781
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:55,250
um so how the heck is it effective at
all I mean there are a lot of ways that

5782
01:38:55,250 --> 01:38:55,260
all I mean there are a lot of ways that
 

5783
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:58,310
all I mean there are a lot of ways that
this could fail so for example I mean

5784
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
this could fail so for example I mean
 

5785
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,229
this could fail so for example I mean
you could have a situation where you're

5786
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
you could have a situation where you're
 

5787
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,930
you could have a situation where you're
you're basically like

5788
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:01,940
you're basically like
 

5789
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:04,310
you're basically like
we don't tell the the language model

5790
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:04,320
we don't tell the the language model
 

5791
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:06,950
we don't tell the the language model
like here are the pieces of our action

5792
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:06,960
like here are the pieces of our action
 

5793
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:08,090
like here are the pieces of our action
or the other person's action that you

5794
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:08,100
or the other person's action that you
 

5795
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:09,590
or the other person's action that you
should be communicating and so like

5796
01:39:09,590 --> 01:39:09,600
should be communicating and so like
 

5797
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:10,669
should be communicating and so like
let's say you're about to attack

5798
01:39:10,669 --> 01:39:10,679
let's say you're about to attack
 

5799
01:39:10,679 --> 01:39:12,649
let's say you're about to attack
somebody you probably don't want to tell

5800
01:39:12,649 --> 01:39:12,659
somebody you probably don't want to tell
 

5801
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:13,850
somebody you probably don't want to tell
them that you're going to attack them

5802
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:13,860
them that you're going to attack them
 

5803
01:39:13,860 --> 01:39:16,010
them that you're going to attack them
but there's nothing in the language like

5804
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:16,020
but there's nothing in the language like
 

5805
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:17,209
but there's nothing in the language like
the language model is not very smart at

5806
01:39:17,209 --> 01:39:17,219
the language model is not very smart at
 

5807
01:39:17,219 --> 01:39:18,770
the language model is not very smart at
the end of the day so it doesn't really

5808
01:39:18,770 --> 01:39:18,780
the end of the day so it doesn't really
 

5809
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,750
the end of the day so it doesn't really
have a way of knowing like well what

5810
01:39:20,750 --> 01:39:20,760
have a way of knowing like well what
 

5811
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:22,070
have a way of knowing like well what
should I be talking about should I tell

5812
01:39:22,070 --> 01:39:22,080
should I be talking about should I tell
 

5813
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:23,810
should I be talking about should I tell
this person I'm about to attack them or

5814
01:39:23,810 --> 01:39:23,820
this person I'm about to attack them or
 

5815
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:25,070
this person I'm about to attack them or
not

5816
01:39:25,070 --> 01:39:25,080
not
 

5817
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,870
not
um so we have to like develop a lot of

5818
01:39:26,870 --> 01:39:26,880
um so we have to like develop a lot of
 

5819
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:28,310
um so we have to like develop a lot of
other techniques that that deal with

5820
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
other techniques that that deal with
 

5821
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:29,390
other techniques that that deal with
that

5822
01:39:29,390 --> 01:39:29,400
that
 

5823
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:30,830
that
um like one of the things we do for

5824
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:30,840
um like one of the things we do for
 

5825
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:33,050
um like one of the things we do for
example is we try to calculate if I'm

5826
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:33,060
example is we try to calculate if I'm
 

5827
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,330
example is we try to calculate if I'm
going to send this message what would I

5828
01:39:35,330 --> 01:39:35,340
going to send this message what would I
 

5829
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,530
going to send this message what would I
expect the other person to do in

5830
01:39:36,530 --> 01:39:36,540
expect the other person to do in
 

5831
01:39:36,540 --> 01:39:38,810
expect the other person to do in
response so if it's a message like hey

5832
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:38,820
response so if it's a message like hey
 

5833
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:39,890
response so if it's a message like hey
I'm going to attack you this turn

5834
01:39:39,890 --> 01:39:39,900
I'm going to attack you this turn
 

5835
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:42,229
I'm going to attack you this turn
they're probably gonna you know attack

5836
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
they're probably gonna you know attack
 

5837
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:45,169
they're probably gonna you know attack
us or or defend against that attack and

5838
01:39:45,169 --> 01:39:45,179
us or or defend against that attack and
 

5839
01:39:45,179 --> 01:39:47,330
us or or defend against that attack and
so we have a way of recognizing like hey

5840
01:39:47,330 --> 01:39:47,340
so we have a way of recognizing like hey
 

5841
01:39:47,340 --> 01:39:50,510
so we have a way of recognizing like hey
sending this message is a negative

5842
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:50,520
sending this message is a negative
 

5843
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:53,030
sending this message is a negative
expected value action and we should not

5844
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
expected value action and we should not
 

5845
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,649
expected value action and we should not
send this message

5846
01:39:54,649 --> 01:39:54,659
send this message
 

5847
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:56,990
send this message
so yes for particular kinds of messages

5848
01:39:56,990 --> 01:39:57,000
so yes for particular kinds of messages
 

5849
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,870
so yes for particular kinds of messages
you have like an extra function that

5850
01:39:59,870 --> 01:39:59,880
you have like an extra function that
 

5851
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:02,629
you have like an extra function that
does the uh estimates the value of that

5852
01:40:02,629 --> 01:40:02,639
does the uh estimates the value of that
 

5853
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:04,610
does the uh estimates the value of that
message yeah so we have these kinds of

5854
01:40:04,610 --> 01:40:04,620
message yeah so we have these kinds of
 

5855
01:40:04,620 --> 01:40:06,950
message yeah so we have these kinds of
filters that like so it's a filter so

5856
01:40:06,950 --> 01:40:06,960
filters that like so it's a filter so
 

5857
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:08,870
filters that like so it's a filter so
there's a there's a good and is that

5858
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:08,880
there's a there's a good and is that
 

5859
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:11,270
there's a there's a good and is that
filter in your network or is it rule

5860
01:40:11,270 --> 01:40:11,280
filter in your network or is it rule
 

5861
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:13,070
filter in your network or is it rule
based that's that's a that's a neural

5862
01:40:13,070 --> 01:40:13,080
based that's that's a that's a neural
 

5863
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,810
based that's that's a that's a neural
network so we're well it's a it's a

5864
01:40:14,810 --> 01:40:14,820
network so we're well it's a it's a
 

5865
01:40:14,820 --> 01:40:16,070
network so we're well it's a it's a
combination it's a neural network but

5866
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:16,080
combination it's a neural network but
 

5867
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:18,110
combination it's a neural network but
it's also using planning

5868
01:40:18,110 --> 01:40:18,120
it's also using planning
 

5869
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:20,870
it's also using planning
um it's trying to compute like what is

5870
01:40:20,870 --> 01:40:20,880
um it's trying to compute like what is
 

5871
01:40:20,880 --> 01:40:22,910
um it's trying to compute like what is
the policy that the other players are

5872
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:22,920
the policy that the other players are
 

5873
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,430
the policy that the other players are
going to play Given that this message

5874
01:40:25,430 --> 01:40:25,440
going to play Given that this message
 

5875
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,530
going to play Given that this message
um has been sent and then is that better

5876
01:40:27,530 --> 01:40:27,540
um has been sent and then is that better
 

5877
01:40:27,540 --> 01:40:29,090
um has been sent and then is that better
than not sending the message or not I

5878
01:40:29,090 --> 01:40:29,100
than not sending the message or not I
 

5879
01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:30,530
than not sending the message or not I
feel like that's how my brain works too

5880
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:30,540
feel like that's how my brain works too
 

5881
01:40:30,540 --> 01:40:32,689
feel like that's how my brain works too
like there's a language model that

5882
01:40:32,689 --> 01:40:32,699
like there's a language model that
 

5883
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,430
like there's a language model that
generates random crap and then there's

5884
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:34,440
generates random crap and then there's
 

5885
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:37,550
generates random crap and then there's
these other neural Nets they're

5886
01:40:37,550 --> 01:40:37,560
these other neural Nets they're
 

5887
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:39,709
these other neural Nets they're
essentially filters at least that's when

5888
01:40:39,709 --> 01:40:39,719
essentially filters at least that's when
 

5889
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:40,970
essentially filters at least that's when
I tweet

5890
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:40,980
I tweet
 

5891
01:40:40,980 --> 01:40:43,729
I tweet
I'll usually my process of tweeting I'll

5892
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:43,739
I'll usually my process of tweeting I'll
 

5893
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:46,250
I'll usually my process of tweeting I'll
think of something and it's hilarious to

5894
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:46,260
think of something and it's hilarious to
 

5895
01:40:46,260 --> 01:40:48,470
think of something and it's hilarious to
me and then about five seconds later the

5896
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:48,480
me and then about five seconds later the
 

5897
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,870
me and then about five seconds later the
filter Network comes in and says no no

5898
01:40:50,870 --> 01:40:50,880
filter Network comes in and says no no
 

5899
01:40:50,880 --> 01:40:52,970
filter Network comes in and says no no
that's not funny at all I mean there's

5900
01:40:52,970 --> 01:40:52,980
that's not funny at all I mean there's
 

5901
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:54,649
that's not funny at all I mean there's
some something interesting to that kind

5902
01:40:54,649 --> 01:40:54,659
some something interesting to that kind
 

5903
01:40:54,659 --> 01:40:56,689
some something interesting to that kind
of process so you have a set of actions

5904
01:40:56,689 --> 01:40:56,699
of process so you have a set of actions
 

5905
01:40:56,699 --> 01:40:59,870
of process so you have a set of actions
that you you want you have an intent

5906
01:40:59,870 --> 01:40:59,880
that you you want you have an intent
 

5907
01:40:59,880 --> 01:41:02,870
that you you want you have an intent
that you want to achieve an intent that

5908
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:02,880
that you want to achieve an intent that
 

5909
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,310
that you want to achieve an intent that
you want your opponent to achieve then

5910
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,320
you want your opponent to achieve then
 

5911
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,410
you want your opponent to achieve then
you generate messages and then you

5912
01:41:06,410 --> 01:41:06,420
you generate messages and then you
 

5913
01:41:06,420 --> 01:41:09,110
you generate messages and then you
evaluated those messages will achieve

5914
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:09,120
evaluated those messages will achieve
 

5915
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:11,510
evaluated those messages will achieve
the the the

5916
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
the the the
 

5917
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,209
the the the
uh the goal you want yeah and we're

5918
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:14,219
uh the goal you want yeah and we're
 

5919
01:41:14,219 --> 01:41:15,590
uh the goal you want yeah and we're
filtering for several things we're

5920
01:41:15,590 --> 01:41:15,600
filtering for several things we're
 

5921
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:17,330
filtering for several things we're
filtering like is this a sensible

5922
01:41:17,330 --> 01:41:17,340
filtering like is this a sensible
 

5923
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:18,770
filtering like is this a sensible
message you know so sometimes language

5924
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:18,780
message you know so sometimes language
 

5925
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,510
message you know so sometimes language
models will send will generate messages

5926
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:20,520
models will send will generate messages
 

5927
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,689
models will send will generate messages
that are just like totally nonsense

5928
01:41:23,689 --> 01:41:23,699
that are just like totally nonsense
 

5929
01:41:23,699 --> 01:41:25,490
that are just like totally nonsense
um and we try to filter those out we

5930
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:25,500
um and we try to filter those out we
 

5931
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,770
um and we try to filter those out we
also try to filter out messages that

5932
01:41:27,770 --> 01:41:27,780
also try to filter out messages that
 

5933
01:41:27,780 --> 01:41:29,330
also try to filter out messages that
that are basically lies

5934
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:29,340
that are basically lies
 

5935
01:41:29,340 --> 01:41:31,430
that are basically lies
um so you know diplomacy has this

5936
01:41:31,430 --> 01:41:31,440
um so you know diplomacy has this
 

5937
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:33,890
um so you know diplomacy has this
reputation as a game that's really about

5938
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:33,900
reputation as a game that's really about
 

5939
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:37,070
reputation as a game that's really about
um deception and lying but we try to

5940
01:41:37,070 --> 01:41:37,080
um deception and lying but we try to
 

5941
01:41:37,080 --> 01:41:38,570
um deception and lying but we try to
actually minimize the amount that the

5942
01:41:38,570 --> 01:41:38,580
actually minimize the amount that the
 

5943
01:41:38,580 --> 01:41:40,070
actually minimize the amount that the
bot would lie

5944
01:41:40,070 --> 01:41:40,080
bot would lie
 

5945
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:43,310
bot would lie
um this was actually mostly or are you

5946
01:41:43,310 --> 01:41:43,320
um this was actually mostly or are you
 

5947
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,010
um this was actually mostly or are you
no I'm just kidding okay

5948
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:46,020
no I'm just kidding okay
 

5949
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:47,750
no I'm just kidding okay
I mean like part of the reason for this

5950
01:41:47,750 --> 01:41:47,760
I mean like part of the reason for this
 

5951
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,709
I mean like part of the reason for this
is that we actually found that lying

5952
01:41:50,709 --> 01:41:50,719
is that we actually found that lying
 

5953
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:53,090
is that we actually found that lying
would make the bot perform worse in the

5954
01:41:53,090 --> 01:41:53,100
would make the bot perform worse in the
 

5955
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:54,470
would make the bot perform worse in the
long run it would end up with a lower

5956
01:41:54,470 --> 01:41:54,480
long run it would end up with a lower
 

5957
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,590
long run it would end up with a lower
score because once the bot lies

5958
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
score because once the bot lies
 

5959
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,510
score because once the bot lies
um people would never trust it again

5960
01:41:59,510 --> 01:41:59,520
um people would never trust it again
 

5961
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:01,550
um people would never trust it again
and and trust is a huge aspect of the

5962
01:42:01,550 --> 01:42:01,560
and and trust is a huge aspect of the
 

5963
01:42:01,560 --> 01:42:02,930
and and trust is a huge aspect of the
game of diplomacy taking notes here

5964
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:02,940
game of diplomacy taking notes here
 

5965
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:05,390
game of diplomacy taking notes here
because I think this is applies to

5966
01:42:05,390 --> 01:42:05,400
because I think this is applies to
 

5967
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,729
because I think this is applies to
to life lessons too oh I think it's a

5968
01:42:07,729 --> 01:42:07,739
to life lessons too oh I think it's a
 

5969
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,470
to life lessons too oh I think it's a
really yeah really strong so like lying

5970
01:42:09,470 --> 01:42:09,480
really yeah really strong so like lying
 

5971
01:42:09,480 --> 01:42:11,870
really yeah really strong so like lying
is a dangerous thing to do like you you

5972
01:42:11,870 --> 01:42:11,880
is a dangerous thing to do like you you
 

5973
01:42:11,880 --> 01:42:13,250
is a dangerous thing to do like you you
want to avoid

5974
01:42:13,250 --> 01:42:13,260
want to avoid
 

5975
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:16,189
want to avoid
obvious lying yeah I mean I think when

5976
01:42:16,189 --> 01:42:16,199
obvious lying yeah I mean I think when
 

5977
01:42:16,199 --> 01:42:17,870
obvious lying yeah I mean I think when
people play diplomacy for the first time

5978
01:42:17,870 --> 01:42:17,880
people play diplomacy for the first time
 

5979
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:20,510
people play diplomacy for the first time
they approach it as a game of deception

5980
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:20,520
they approach it as a game of deception
 

5981
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,790
they approach it as a game of deception
and lying and and they

5982
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
and lying and and they
 

5983
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,770
and lying and and they
ultimately if you talk to top diplomacy

5984
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:24,780
ultimately if you talk to top diplomacy
 

5985
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:26,390
ultimately if you talk to top diplomacy
players what they'll tell you is that

5986
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
players what they'll tell you is that
 

5987
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:28,490
players what they'll tell you is that
diplomacy is a game about trust and

5988
01:42:28,490 --> 01:42:28,500
diplomacy is a game about trust and
 

5989
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:30,109
diplomacy is a game about trust and
being able to build trust in an

5990
01:42:30,109 --> 01:42:30,119
being able to build trust in an
 

5991
01:42:30,119 --> 01:42:31,609
being able to build trust in an
environment that encourages people to

5992
01:42:31,609 --> 01:42:31,619
environment that encourages people to
 

5993
01:42:31,619 --> 01:42:33,169
environment that encourages people to
not trust anyone

5994
01:42:33,169 --> 01:42:33,179
not trust anyone
 

5995
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:35,270
not trust anyone
so so that's the ultimate tension in

5996
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
so so that's the ultimate tension in
 

5997
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,570
so so that's the ultimate tension in
diplomacy how can this AI reason about

5998
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:38,580
diplomacy how can this AI reason about
 

5999
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,250
diplomacy how can this AI reason about
whether you are being honest in your

6000
01:42:40,250 --> 01:42:40,260
whether you are being honest in your
 

6001
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,290
whether you are being honest in your
communication and how can the AI

6002
01:42:42,290 --> 01:42:42,300
communication and how can the AI
 

6003
01:42:42,300 --> 01:42:44,450
communication and how can the AI
persuade you that it is being honest

6004
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:44,460
persuade you that it is being honest
 

6005
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:45,890
persuade you that it is being honest
when it is telling you that hey I'm

6006
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:45,900
when it is telling you that hey I'm
 

6007
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:47,990
when it is telling you that hey I'm
actually going to support you this turn

6008
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:48,000
actually going to support you this turn
 

6009
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,209
actually going to support you this turn
is there some sense I don't know if you

6010
01:42:50,209 --> 01:42:50,219
is there some sense I don't know if you
 

6011
01:42:50,219 --> 01:42:52,910
is there some sense I don't know if you
step back and think that this process

6012
01:42:52,910 --> 01:42:52,920
step back and think that this process
 

6013
01:42:52,920 --> 01:42:54,550
step back and think that this process
well

6014
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
well
 

6015
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:57,169
well
indirectly help us study human

6016
01:42:57,169 --> 01:42:57,179
indirectly help us study human
 

6017
01:42:57,179 --> 01:42:59,090
indirectly help us study human
psychology

6018
01:42:59,090 --> 01:42:59,100
psychology
 

6019
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:02,330
psychology
so like if trust is the ultimate goal

6020
01:43:02,330 --> 01:43:02,340
so like if trust is the ultimate goal
 

6021
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:04,310
so like if trust is the ultimate goal
wouldn't that help us understand what

6022
01:43:04,310 --> 01:43:04,320
wouldn't that help us understand what
 

6023
01:43:04,320 --> 01:43:06,590
wouldn't that help us understand what
are the fundamental aspects of forming

6024
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:06,600
are the fundamental aspects of forming
 

6025
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:09,050
are the fundamental aspects of forming
trust between humans and between humans

6026
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:09,060
trust between humans and between humans
 

6027
01:43:09,060 --> 01:43:11,090
trust between humans and between humans
and AI I mean that's a really really

6028
01:43:11,090 --> 01:43:11,100
and AI I mean that's a really really
 

6029
01:43:11,100 --> 01:43:12,709
and AI I mean that's a really really
important question that's much bigger

6030
01:43:12,709 --> 01:43:12,719
important question that's much bigger
 

6031
01:43:12,719 --> 01:43:15,649
important question that's much bigger
than the strategy games it's how can

6032
01:43:15,649 --> 01:43:15,659
than the strategy games it's how can
 

6033
01:43:15,659 --> 01:43:17,629
than the strategy games it's how can
that that's fundamental to the human

6034
01:43:17,629 --> 01:43:17,639
that that's fundamental to the human
 

6035
01:43:17,639 --> 01:43:20,209
that that's fundamental to the human
robot interaction problem how do we form

6036
01:43:20,209 --> 01:43:20,219
robot interaction problem how do we form
 

6037
01:43:20,219 --> 01:43:21,229
robot interaction problem how do we form
Trust

6038
01:43:21,229 --> 01:43:21,239
Trust
 

6039
01:43:21,239 --> 01:43:23,689
Trust
between intelligent entities

6040
01:43:23,689 --> 01:43:23,699
between intelligent entities
 

6041
01:43:23,699 --> 01:43:25,550
between intelligent entities
so one of the things I'm really excited

6042
01:43:25,550 --> 01:43:25,560
so one of the things I'm really excited
 

6043
01:43:25,560 --> 01:43:27,830
so one of the things I'm really excited
about with diplomacy

6044
01:43:27,830 --> 01:43:27,840
about with diplomacy
 

6045
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,169
about with diplomacy
um there's never really been a good

6046
01:43:30,169 --> 01:43:30,179
um there's never really been a good
 

6047
01:43:30,179 --> 01:43:31,970
um there's never really been a good
domain to investigate these kinds of

6048
01:43:31,970 --> 01:43:31,980
domain to investigate these kinds of
 

6049
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:33,530
domain to investigate these kinds of
questions yeah

6050
01:43:33,530 --> 01:43:33,540
questions yeah
 

6051
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:36,590
questions yeah
um and diplomacy gives us a domain where

6052
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:36,600
um and diplomacy gives us a domain where
 

6053
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:39,229
um and diplomacy gives us a domain where
trust is really at the center of it

6054
01:43:39,229 --> 01:43:39,239
trust is really at the center of it
 

6055
01:43:39,239 --> 01:43:40,790
trust is really at the center of it
um and it's not just like you've hired a

6056
01:43:40,790 --> 01:43:40,800
um and it's not just like you've hired a
 

6057
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,770
um and it's not just like you've hired a
bunch of mechanical turkers that you

6058
01:43:42,770 --> 01:43:42,780
bunch of mechanical turkers that you
 

6059
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:45,350
bunch of mechanical turkers that you
know are being paid and trying to get

6060
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
know are being paid and trying to get
 

6061
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:46,669
know are being paid and trying to get
through the task as quickly as possible

6062
01:43:46,669 --> 01:43:46,679
through the task as quickly as possible
 

6063
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:48,470
through the task as quickly as possible
you have these people that are really

6064
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,480
you have these people that are really
 

6065
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,030
you have these people that are really
invested in the outcome of the game and

6066
01:43:50,030 --> 01:43:50,040
invested in the outcome of the game and
 

6067
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,109
invested in the outcome of the game and
they're really trying to do the best

6068
01:43:51,109 --> 01:43:51,119
they're really trying to do the best
 

6069
01:43:51,119 --> 01:43:52,729
they're really trying to do the best
that they can

6070
01:43:52,729 --> 01:43:52,739
that they can
 

6071
01:43:52,739 --> 01:43:55,010
that they can
um and so I'm really excited that we're

6072
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,020
um and so I'm really excited that we're
 

6073
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:57,830
um and so I'm really excited that we're
able to we actually like have put

6074
01:43:57,830 --> 01:43:57,840
able to we actually like have put
 

6075
01:43:57,840 --> 01:43:59,870
able to we actually like have put
together this we're open sourcing all of

6076
01:43:59,870 --> 01:43:59,880
together this we're open sourcing all of
 

6077
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,209
together this we're open sourcing all of
our models we're open sourcing uh all of

6078
01:44:02,209 --> 01:44:02,219
our models we're open sourcing uh all of
 

6079
01:44:02,219 --> 01:44:04,669
our models we're open sourcing uh all of
the all the code and we're making the

6080
01:44:04,669 --> 01:44:04,679
the all the code and we're making the
 

6081
01:44:04,679 --> 01:44:06,770
the all the code and we're making the
data that we've used available to

6082
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:06,780
data that we've used available to
 

6083
01:44:06,780 --> 01:44:08,510
data that we've used available to
researchers

6084
01:44:08,510 --> 01:44:08,520
researchers
 

6085
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:09,770
researchers
um so that they can investigate these

6086
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:09,780
um so that they can investigate these
 

6087
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,930
um so that they can investigate these
kinds of questions so the data of the

6088
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:11,940
kinds of questions so the data of the
 

6089
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:14,390
kinds of questions so the data of the
different the human and the AI play of

6090
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:14,400
different the human and the AI play of
 

6091
01:44:14,400 --> 01:44:16,609
different the human and the AI play of
diplomacy and the models that you use

6092
01:44:16,609 --> 01:44:16,619
diplomacy and the models that you use
 

6093
01:44:16,619 --> 01:44:19,250
diplomacy and the models that you use
for the generation of the messages and

6094
01:44:19,250 --> 01:44:19,260
for the generation of the messages and
 

6095
01:44:19,260 --> 01:44:21,830
for the generation of the messages and
the filtering yeah not not just even the

6096
01:44:21,830 --> 01:44:21,840
the filtering yeah not not just even the
 

6097
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,689
the filtering yeah not not just even the
data of the AI playing with the humans

6098
01:44:23,689 --> 01:44:23,699
data of the AI playing with the humans
 

6099
01:44:23,699 --> 01:44:26,209
data of the AI playing with the humans
but all the training data that we that

6100
01:44:26,209 --> 01:44:26,219
but all the training data that we that
 

6101
01:44:26,219 --> 01:44:28,729
but all the training data that we that
we had that we used to train the AI to

6102
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:28,739
we had that we used to train the AI to
 

6103
01:44:28,739 --> 01:44:29,870
we had that we used to train the AI to
understand how humans play the game

6104
01:44:29,870 --> 01:44:29,880
understand how humans play the game
 

6105
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:32,090
understand how humans play the game
we're setting up a system where

6106
01:44:32,090 --> 01:44:32,100
we're setting up a system where
 

6107
01:44:32,100 --> 01:44:34,550
we're setting up a system where
researchers will be able to apply

6108
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:34,560
researchers will be able to apply
 

6109
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,050
researchers will be able to apply
um to be able to gain access to that

6110
01:44:36,050 --> 01:44:36,060
um to be able to gain access to that
 

6111
01:44:36,060 --> 01:44:37,790
um to be able to gain access to that
data and be be able to to use it in

6112
01:44:37,790 --> 01:44:37,800
data and be be able to to use it in
 

6113
01:44:37,800 --> 01:44:39,350
data and be be able to to use it in
their own research we should say what is

6114
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:39,360
their own research we should say what is
 

6115
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:40,910
their own research we should say what is
the name of the system

6116
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:40,920
the name of the system
 

6117
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:43,490
the name of the system
we're calling the bot Cicero Cicero and

6118
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:43,500
we're calling the bot Cicero Cicero and
 

6119
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:45,290
we're calling the bot Cicero Cicero and
what's the name like you're open

6120
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:45,300
what's the name like you're open
 

6121
01:44:45,300 --> 01:44:46,310
what's the name like you're open
sourcing what's the name of the

01:45:02,090 --> 01:45:02,100
sites that people use to play diplomacy
 

6139
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:05,510
sites that people use to play diplomacy
on it we've got like 50 000 games of

6140
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,520
on it we've got like 50 000 games of
 

6141
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,550
on it we've got like 50 000 games of
diplomacy with you know natural language

6142
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:07,560
diplomacy with you know natural language
 

6143
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,350

communication

6144
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:09,360
communication
 

6145
01:45:09,360 --> 01:45:12,050
communication
um over 10 million messages so it's a

6146
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:12,060
um over 10 million messages so it's a
 

6147
01:45:12,060 --> 01:45:13,790
um over 10 million messages so it's a
pretty massive data set that people can

6148
01:45:13,790 --> 01:45:13,800
pretty massive data set that people can
 

6149
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:15,770
pretty massive data set that people can
use to um we're hoping that the the

6150
01:45:15,770 --> 01:45:15,780
use to um we're hoping that the the
 

6151
01:45:15,780 --> 01:45:17,149
use to um we're hoping that the the
academic Community the research

6152
01:45:17,149 --> 01:45:17,159
academic Community the research
 

6153
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:19,250
academic Community the research
Community is able to use it for for all

6154
01:45:19,250 --> 01:45:19,260
Community is able to use it for for all
 

6155
01:45:19,260 --> 01:45:20,810
Community is able to use it for for all
sorts of interesting research questions

6156
01:45:20,810 --> 01:45:20,820
sorts of interesting research questions
 

6157
01:45:20,820 --> 01:45:23,930
sorts of interesting research questions
so do you from having studied this game

6158
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:23,940
so do you from having studied this game
 

6159
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,250
so do you from having studied this game
is this

6160
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:25,260
is this
 

6161
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,490
is this
a sufficiently rich problem space to

6162
01:45:28,490 --> 01:45:28,500
a sufficiently rich problem space to
 

6163
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,770
a sufficiently rich problem space to
explore this kind of human AI

6164
01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:30,780
explore this kind of human AI
 

6165
01:45:30,780 --> 01:45:33,109
explore this kind of human AI
interaction yeah absolutely and I think

6166
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:33,119
interaction yeah absolutely and I think
 

6167
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,010
interaction yeah absolutely and I think
it's

6168
01:45:34,010 --> 01:45:34,020
it's
 

6169
01:45:34,020 --> 01:45:36,229
it's
I think it's maybe the best data set

6170
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:36,239
I think it's maybe the best data set
 

6171
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:37,910
I think it's maybe the best data set
that I can think of out there to to

6172
01:45:37,910 --> 01:45:37,920
that I can think of out there to to
 

6173
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,430
that I can think of out there to to
investigate these kinds of questions of

6174
01:45:40,430 --> 01:45:40,440
investigate these kinds of questions of
 

6175
01:45:40,440 --> 01:45:42,830
investigate these kinds of questions of
um negotiation trust

6176
01:45:42,830 --> 01:45:42,840
um negotiation trust
 

6177
01:45:42,840 --> 01:45:45,169
um negotiation trust
um persuasion I wouldn't say it's the

6178
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:45,179
um persuasion I wouldn't say it's the
 

6179
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:47,510
um persuasion I wouldn't say it's the
best data set in the world for

6180
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:47,520
best data set in the world for
 

6181
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:49,189
best data set in the world for
um human AI interaction that's a very

6182
01:45:49,189 --> 01:45:49,199
um human AI interaction that's a very
 

6183
01:45:49,199 --> 01:45:50,510
um human AI interaction that's a very
broad field but I think that it's

6184
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:50,520
broad field but I think that it's
 

6185
01:45:50,520 --> 01:45:52,370
broad field but I think that it's
definitely up there is like you know if

6186
01:45:52,370 --> 01:45:52,380
definitely up there is like you know if
 

6187
01:45:52,380 --> 01:45:54,350
definitely up there is like you know if
you're really interested in language

6188
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:54,360
you're really interested in language
 

6189
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,750
you're really interested in language
models interacting with humans in you

6190
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:56,760
models interacting with humans in you
 

6191
01:45:56,760 --> 01:45:58,669
models interacting with humans in you
know a setting where their incentives

6192
01:45:58,669 --> 01:45:58,679
know a setting where their incentives
 

6193
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:00,590
know a setting where their incentives
are not fully aligned this seems like an

6194
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:00,600
are not fully aligned this seems like an
 

6195
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,830
are not fully aligned this seems like an
ideal data set for investigating that

6196
01:46:02,830 --> 01:46:02,840
ideal data set for investigating that
 

6197
01:46:02,840 --> 01:46:05,330
ideal data set for investigating that
so you have

6198
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:05,340
so you have
 

6199
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:07,850
so you have
um you have a paper with some impressive

6200
01:46:07,850 --> 01:46:07,860
um you have a paper with some impressive
 

6201
01:46:07,860 --> 01:46:09,229
um you have a paper with some impressive
results and just an impressive paper

6202
01:46:09,229 --> 01:46:09,239
results and just an impressive paper
 

6203
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:11,330
results and just an impressive paper
they're taking this problem on

6204
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:11,340
they're taking this problem on
 

6205
01:46:11,340 --> 01:46:13,850
they're taking this problem on
what's the most exciting thing to you in

6206
01:46:13,850 --> 01:46:13,860
what's the most exciting thing to you in
 

6207
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:17,810
what's the most exciting thing to you in
terms of the results from the the paper

6208
01:46:17,810 --> 01:46:17,820
terms of the results from the the paper
 

6209
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:20,510
terms of the results from the the paper
well I think there's ideas or results

6210
01:46:20,510 --> 01:46:20,520
well I think there's ideas or results
 

6211
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,430
well I think there's ideas or results
yeah I think there's a few aspects of

6212
01:46:22,430 --> 01:46:22,440
yeah I think there's a few aspects of
 

6213
01:46:22,440 --> 01:46:25,010
yeah I think there's a few aspects of
the results and um that I think are

6214
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:25,020
the results and um that I think are
 

6215
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:26,450
the results and um that I think are
really exciting so first of all the fact

6216
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:26,460
really exciting so first of all the fact
 

6217
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:28,550
really exciting so first of all the fact
that we were able to achieve such strong

6218
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:28,560
that we were able to achieve such strong
 

6219
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:29,990
that we were able to achieve such strong
performance

6220
01:46:29,990 --> 01:46:30,000
performance
 

6221
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,070
performance
um I was

6222
01:46:31,070 --> 01:46:31,080
um I was
 

6223
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:33,590
um I was
surprised by and pleasantly surprised by

6224
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:33,600
surprised by and pleasantly surprised by
 

6225
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,510
surprised by and pleasantly surprised by
um so we played 40 games of diplomacy

6226
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:35,520
um so we played 40 games of diplomacy
 

6227
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,810
um so we played 40 games of diplomacy
with real humans and the bot placed

6228
01:46:38,810 --> 01:46:38,820
with real humans and the bot placed
 

6229
01:46:38,820 --> 01:46:41,270
with real humans and the bot placed
second out of all players that have

6230
01:46:41,270 --> 01:46:41,280
second out of all players that have
 

6231
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:42,890
second out of all players that have
played five or more games so it's about

6232
01:46:42,890 --> 01:46:42,900
played five or more games so it's about
 

6233
01:46:42,900 --> 01:46:44,810
played five or more games so it's about
80 players total

6234
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:44,820
80 players total
 

6235
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:46,550
80 players total
um 19 of whom played five or more games

6236
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
um 19 of whom played five or more games
 

6237
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,109
um 19 of whom played five or more games
and the bot was ranked second out of

6238
01:46:48,109 --> 01:46:48,119
and the bot was ranked second out of
 

6239
01:46:48,119 --> 01:46:50,149
and the bot was ranked second out of
those players

6240
01:46:50,149 --> 01:46:50,159
those players
 

6241
01:46:50,159 --> 01:46:53,390
those players
um and the bot was was really good in

6242
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:53,400
um and the bot was was really good in
 

6243
01:46:53,400 --> 01:46:55,250
um and the bot was was really good in
two Dimensions one being able to

6244
01:46:55,250 --> 01:46:55,260
two Dimensions one being able to
 

6245
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:56,990
two Dimensions one being able to
establish strong connections with the

6246
01:46:56,990 --> 01:46:57,000
establish strong connections with the
 

6247
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,030
establish strong connections with the
other players on the board being able to

6248
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
other players on the board being able to
 

6249
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:01,609
other players on the board being able to
like persuade them to work with it

6250
01:47:01,609 --> 01:47:01,619
like persuade them to work with it
 

6251
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:02,810
like persuade them to work with it
um being able to coordinate with them

6252
01:47:02,810 --> 01:47:02,820
um being able to coordinate with them
 

6253
01:47:02,820 --> 01:47:04,370
um being able to coordinate with them
about like how it's going to work with

6254
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:04,380
about like how it's going to work with
 

6255
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:07,189
about like how it's going to work with
them and then also the Raw

6256
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
them and then also the Raw
 

6257
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,990
them and then also the Raw
tactical and strategic aspects of the

6258
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:09,000
tactical and strategic aspects of the
 

6259
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,590
tactical and strategic aspects of the
game you know being able to understand

6260
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
game you know being able to understand
 

6261
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,729
game you know being able to understand
what the other players are likely to do

6262
01:47:13,729 --> 01:47:13,739
what the other players are likely to do
 

6263
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:16,129
what the other players are likely to do
being able to model their behavior and

6264
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:16,139
being able to model their behavior and
 

6265
01:47:16,139 --> 01:47:18,109
being able to model their behavior and
respond appropriately to that the bot

6266
01:47:18,109 --> 01:47:18,119
respond appropriately to that the bot
 

6267
01:47:18,119 --> 01:47:20,629
respond appropriately to that the bot
also really excelled at what are some

6268
01:47:20,629 --> 01:47:20,639
also really excelled at what are some
 

6269
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:23,270
also really excelled at what are some
interesting things that the bot said

6270
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:23,280
interesting things that the bot said
 

6271
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:25,370
interesting things that the bot said
by the way are you allowed to swear in

6272
01:47:25,370 --> 01:47:25,380
by the way are you allowed to swear in
 

6273
01:47:25,380 --> 01:47:27,470
by the way are you allowed to swear in
the um okay are there rules to what

6274
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:27,480
the um okay are there rules to what
 

6275
01:47:27,480 --> 01:47:28,850
the um okay are there rules to what
you're allowed to say and not in

6276
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:28,860
you're allowed to say and not in
 

6277
01:47:28,860 --> 01:47:30,770
you're allowed to say and not in
diplomacy you can say whatever you want

6278
01:47:30,770 --> 01:47:30,780
diplomacy you can say whatever you want
 

6279
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:32,629
diplomacy you can say whatever you want
I think the site will get very angry at

6280
01:47:32,629 --> 01:47:32,639
I think the site will get very angry at
 

6281
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:33,950
I think the site will get very angry at
you if you start like threatening

6282
01:47:33,950 --> 01:47:33,960
you if you start like threatening
 

6283
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:36,890
you if you start like threatening
somebody and if we actually like if

6284
01:47:36,890 --> 01:47:36,900
somebody and if we actually like if
 

6285
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:38,270
somebody and if we actually like if
you're threaten somebody you're supposed

6286
01:47:38,270 --> 01:47:38,280
you're threaten somebody you're supposed
 

6287
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:40,310
you're threaten somebody you're supposed
to do it politely yeah politely you know

6288
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
to do it politely yeah politely you know
 

6289
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,930
to do it politely yeah politely you know
keep it in character

6290
01:47:41,930 --> 01:47:41,940
keep it in character
 

6291
01:47:41,940 --> 01:47:42,970
keep it in character
um

6292
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:42,980
um
 

6293
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:45,229
um
we actually had a researcher watching

6294
01:47:45,229 --> 01:47:45,239
we actually had a researcher watching
 

6295
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:47,689
we actually had a researcher watching
the bot 24 7 for well whenever we play a

6296
01:47:47,689 --> 01:47:47,699
the bot 24 7 for well whenever we play a
 

6297
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:49,010
the bot 24 7 for well whenever we play a
game we had a bot watching it to make

6298
01:47:49,010 --> 01:47:49,020
game we had a bot watching it to make
 

6299
01:47:49,020 --> 01:47:50,689
game we had a bot watching it to make
sure that it wouldn't go off the rails

6300
01:47:50,689 --> 01:47:50,699
sure that it wouldn't go off the rails
 

6301
01:47:50,699 --> 01:47:51,950
sure that it wouldn't go off the rails
and start like threatening somebody or

6302
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:51,960
and start like threatening somebody or
 

6303
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:53,270
and start like threatening somebody or
something like that I would just love it

6304
01:47:53,270 --> 01:47:53,280
something like that I would just love it
 

6305
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:55,310
something like that I would just love it
if the boss started like mocking

6306
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:55,320
if the boss started like mocking
 

6307
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:58,250
if the boss started like mocking
mocking everybody like some weird quirky

6308
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:58,260
mocking everybody like some weird quirky
 

6309
01:47:58,260 --> 01:48:00,290
mocking everybody like some weird quirky
strategies would emerge have you seen

6310
01:48:00,290 --> 01:48:00,300
strategies would emerge have you seen
 

6311
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:02,270
strategies would emerge have you seen
anything interesting that you huh that's

6312
01:48:02,270 --> 01:48:02,280
anything interesting that you huh that's
 

6313
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,669
anything interesting that you huh that's
a weird that's a

6314
01:48:04,669 --> 01:48:04,679
a weird that's a
 

6315
01:48:04,679 --> 01:48:06,830
a weird that's a
that's a behavior either of the filter

6316
01:48:06,830 --> 01:48:06,840
that's a behavior either of the filter
 

6317
01:48:06,840 --> 01:48:09,109
that's a behavior either of the filter
or the language model

6318
01:48:09,109 --> 01:48:09,119
or the language model
 

6319
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,810
or the language model
that was weird to you that was yeah they

6320
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:11,820
that was weird to you that was yeah they
 

6321
01:48:11,820 --> 01:48:13,729
that was weird to you that was yeah they
were definitely like things that the bot

6322
01:48:13,729 --> 01:48:13,739
were definitely like things that the bot
 

6323
01:48:13,739 --> 01:48:16,850
were definitely like things that the bot
would would do that were not in line

6324
01:48:16,850 --> 01:48:16,860
would would do that were not in line
 

6325
01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:18,890
would would do that were not in line
with like how humans would approach the

6326
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:18,900
with like how humans would approach the
 

6327
01:48:18,900 --> 01:48:21,950
with like how humans would approach the
game and that in a good way the humans

6328
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:21,960
game and that in a good way the humans
 

6329
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,510
game and that in a good way the humans
actually you know we we've talked to

6330
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:23,520
actually you know we we've talked to
 

6331
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,830
actually you know we we've talked to
some expert diplomacy players about

6332
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:24,840
some expert diplomacy players about
 

6333
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,229
some expert diplomacy players about
these results and their takeaways that

6334
01:48:27,229 --> 01:48:27,239
these results and their takeaways that
 

6335
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:28,609
these results and their takeaways that
well maybe humans are approaching this

6336
01:48:28,609 --> 01:48:28,619
well maybe humans are approaching this
 

6337
01:48:28,619 --> 01:48:29,810
well maybe humans are approaching this
the wrong way and this is actually like

6338
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:29,820
the wrong way and this is actually like
 

6339
01:48:29,820 --> 01:48:32,330
the wrong way and this is actually like
the right way to play the game

6340
01:48:32,330 --> 01:48:32,340
the right way to play the game
 

6341
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:36,350
the right way to play the game
um so what's required to win like what

6342
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:36,360
um so what's required to win like what
 

6343
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:38,390
um so what's required to win like what
um what does it mean to mess up or to

6344
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:38,400
um what does it mean to mess up or to
 

6345
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,729
um what does it mean to mess up or to
exploit the sub-optimal behavior of a

6346
01:48:40,729 --> 01:48:40,739
exploit the sub-optimal behavior of a
 

6347
01:48:40,739 --> 01:48:44,149
exploit the sub-optimal behavior of a
player like uh is there is there

6348
01:48:44,149 --> 01:48:44,159
player like uh is there is there
 

6349
01:48:44,159 --> 01:48:45,830
player like uh is there is there
optimally rational behavior and

6350
01:48:45,830 --> 01:48:45,840
optimally rational behavior and
 

6351
01:48:45,840 --> 01:48:47,830
optimally rational behavior and
irrational behavior that you need to

6352
01:48:47,830 --> 01:48:47,840
irrational behavior that you need to
 

6353
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,030
irrational behavior that you need to
estimate that kind of stuff like what

6354
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:50,040
estimate that kind of stuff like what
 

6355
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,070
estimate that kind of stuff like what
what stands out to you like is there a

6356
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,080
what stands out to you like is there a
 

6357
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:55,729
what stands out to you like is there a
crack that you can exploit is there like

6358
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:55,739
crack that you can exploit is there like
 

6359
01:48:55,739 --> 01:48:57,770
crack that you can exploit is there like
um a weakness that you can exploit in

6360
01:48:57,770 --> 01:48:57,780
um a weakness that you can exploit in
 

6361
01:48:57,780 --> 01:48:59,750
um a weakness that you can exploit in
the game that that everybody's looking

6362
01:48:59,750 --> 01:48:59,760
the game that that everybody's looking
 

6363
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:01,310
the game that that everybody's looking
for

6364
01:49:01,310 --> 01:49:01,320
for
 

6365
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:03,649
for
well I I think

6366
01:49:03,649 --> 01:49:03,659
well I I think
 

6367
01:49:03,659 --> 01:49:04,910
well I I think
you're asking kind of two questions

6368
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:04,920
you're asking kind of two questions
 

6369
01:49:04,920 --> 01:49:07,330
you're asking kind of two questions
there so one like modeling the

6370
01:49:07,330 --> 01:49:07,340
there so one like modeling the
 

6371
01:49:07,340 --> 01:49:09,350
there so one like modeling the
irrationality and the suboptimality of

6372
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360
irrationality and the suboptimality of
 

6373
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,910
irrationality and the suboptimality of
humans

6374
01:49:10,910 --> 01:49:10,920
humans
 

6375
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:11,870
humans
um

6376
01:49:11,870 --> 01:49:11,880
um
 

6377
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:14,030
um
you can't in diplomacy you can't treat

6378
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:14,040
you can't in diplomacy you can't treat
 

6379
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,229
you can't in diplomacy you can't treat
all the other players like they're

6380
01:49:15,229 --> 01:49:15,239
all the other players like they're
 

6381
01:49:15,239 --> 01:49:17,390
all the other players like they're
machines and if you do that you're

6382
01:49:17,390 --> 01:49:17,400
machines and if you do that you're
 

6383
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:18,950
machines and if you do that you're
you're going to end up playing really

6384
01:49:18,950 --> 01:49:18,960
you're going to end up playing really
 

6385
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:20,390
you're going to end up playing really
poorly and so we actually ran this

6386
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,400
poorly and so we actually ran this
 

6387
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,689
poorly and so we actually ran this
experiment so we we trained a bot in a

6388
01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:23,699
experiment so we we trained a bot in a
 

6389
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:26,270
experiment so we we trained a bot in a
two-player zero-sum version of diplomacy

6390
01:49:26,270 --> 01:49:26,280
two-player zero-sum version of diplomacy
 

6391
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:27,530
two-player zero-sum version of diplomacy
um the same way that you might approach

6392
01:49:27,530 --> 01:49:27,540
um the same way that you might approach
 

6393
01:49:27,540 --> 01:49:30,290
um the same way that you might approach
a game like chess or poker and the bot

6394
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:30,300
a game like chess or poker and the bot
 

6395
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:31,729
a game like chess or poker and the bot
was superhuman it would crush any

6396
01:49:31,729 --> 01:49:31,739
was superhuman it would crush any
 

6397
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:33,950
was superhuman it would crush any
competitor and then we took that same

6398
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:33,960
competitor and then we took that same
 

6399
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:35,930
competitor and then we took that same
training approach and we trained a bot

6400
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:35,940
training approach and we trained a bot
 

6401
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:37,550
training approach and we trained a bot
for the full Seven Player version of the

6402
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:37,560
for the full Seven Player version of the
 

6403
01:49:37,560 --> 01:49:39,590
for the full Seven Player version of the
game through self-play without any human

6404
01:49:39,590 --> 01:49:39,600
game through self-play without any human
 

6405
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:41,510
game through self-play without any human
data and we stuck it in a game with six

6406
01:49:41,510 --> 01:49:41,520
data and we stuck it in a game with six
 

6407
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,330
data and we stuck it in a game with six
humans and it got destroyed even in the

6408
01:49:44,330 --> 01:49:44,340
humans and it got destroyed even in the
 

6409
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:45,590
humans and it got destroyed even in the
version of the game where there's no

6410
01:49:45,590 --> 01:49:45,600
version of the game where there's no
 

6411
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,209
version of the game where there's no
explicit natural language communication

6412
01:49:47,209 --> 01:49:47,219
explicit natural language communication
 

6413
01:49:47,219 --> 01:49:49,669
explicit natural language communication
it still got destroyed because it just

6414
01:49:49,669 --> 01:49:49,679
it still got destroyed because it just
 

6415
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:51,410
it still got destroyed because it just
wouldn't be able to understand how the

6416
01:49:51,410 --> 01:49:51,420
wouldn't be able to understand how the
 

6417
01:49:51,420 --> 01:49:52,550
wouldn't be able to understand how the
other players were approaching the game

6418
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:52,560
other players were approaching the game
 

6419
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,609
other players were approaching the game
and be able to to work with that

6420
01:49:54,609 --> 01:49:54,619
and be able to to work with that
 

6421
01:49:54,619 --> 01:49:57,229
and be able to to work with that
can you just Linger on that meeting like

6422
01:49:57,229 --> 01:49:57,239
can you just Linger on that meeting like
 

6423
01:49:57,239 --> 01:49:59,030
can you just Linger on that meeting like
there's an individual there's an

6424
01:49:59,030 --> 01:49:59,040
there's an individual there's an
 

6425
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,770
there's an individual there's an
individual personality each player and

6426
01:50:00,770 --> 01:50:00,780
individual personality each player and
 

6427
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:01,850
individual personality each player and
then you're supposed to remember that

6428
01:50:01,850 --> 01:50:01,860
then you're supposed to remember that
 

6429
01:50:01,860 --> 01:50:03,290
then you're supposed to remember that
but Woody means it's not able to

6430
01:50:03,290 --> 01:50:03,300
but Woody means it's not able to
 

6431
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,010
but Woody means it's not able to
understand the the players well it would

6432
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:07,020
understand the the players well it would
 

6433
01:50:07,020 --> 01:50:09,590
understand the the players well it would
for example expect the human to support

6434
01:50:09,590 --> 01:50:09,600
for example expect the human to support
 

6435
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:12,290
for example expect the human to support
it in a certain way when the human men

6436
01:50:12,290 --> 01:50:12,300
it in a certain way when the human men
 

6437
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:14,689
it in a certain way when the human men
would simply like think like no I'm not

6438
01:50:14,689 --> 01:50:14,699
would simply like think like no I'm not
 

6439
01:50:14,699 --> 01:50:16,430
would simply like think like no I'm not
supposed to support you here

6440
01:50:16,430 --> 01:50:16,440
supposed to support you here
 

6441
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:17,750
supposed to support you here
um it's kind of like you know if you

6442
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:17,760
um it's kind of like you know if you
 

6443
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:19,850
um it's kind of like you know if you
develop a self-driving car and it's

6444
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:19,860
develop a self-driving car and it's
 

6445
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:21,290
develop a self-driving car and it's
trained completely from scratch with

6446
01:50:21,290 --> 01:50:21,300
trained completely from scratch with
 

6447
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,390
trained completely from scratch with
other self-driving cars it might learn

6448
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:23,400
other self-driving cars it might learn
 

6449
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,530
other self-driving cars it might learn
to drive on the left side of the road

6450
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:24,540
to drive on the left side of the road
 

6451
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:26,330
to drive on the left side of the road
that's a totally reasonable thing to do

6452
01:50:26,330 --> 01:50:26,340
that's a totally reasonable thing to do
 

6453
01:50:26,340 --> 01:50:28,070
that's a totally reasonable thing to do
if you're with these other self-driving

6454
01:50:28,070 --> 01:50:28,080
if you're with these other self-driving
 

6455
01:50:28,080 --> 01:50:29,270
if you're with these other self-driving
cars that are also driving on the left

6456
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:29,280
cars that are also driving on the left
 

6457
01:50:29,280 --> 01:50:31,070
cars that are also driving on the left
side of the road but if you put it in an

6458
01:50:31,070 --> 01:50:31,080
side of the road but if you put it in an
 

6459
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:33,350
side of the road but if you put it in an
American city it's gonna crash but I

6460
01:50:33,350 --> 01:50:33,360
American city it's gonna crash but I
 

6461
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:34,490
American city it's gonna crash but I
guess the intuition I'm trying to build

6462
01:50:34,490 --> 01:50:34,500
guess the intuition I'm trying to build
 

6463
01:50:34,500 --> 01:50:36,410
guess the intuition I'm trying to build
up is why does it then crush a human

6464
01:50:36,410 --> 01:50:36,420
up is why does it then crush a human
 

6465
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,109
up is why does it then crush a human
play on heads up

6466
01:50:39,109 --> 01:50:39,119
play on heads up
 

6467
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:41,810
play on heads up
this is multiple this is an aspect of

6468
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:41,820
this is multiple this is an aspect of
 

6469
01:50:41,820 --> 01:50:43,850
this is multiple this is an aspect of
two player zero song versus games that

6470
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:43,860
two player zero song versus games that
 

6471
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,430
two player zero song versus games that
involve cooperation so in a two-player

6472
01:50:46,430 --> 01:50:46,440
involve cooperation so in a two-player
 

6473
01:50:46,440 --> 01:50:48,410
involve cooperation so in a two-player
zero-sum game

6474
01:50:48,410 --> 01:50:48,420
zero-sum game
 

6475
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:50,629
zero-sum game
um you can do self-play from scratch and

6476
01:50:50,629 --> 01:50:50,639
um you can do self-play from scratch and
 

6477
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:52,310
um you can do self-play from scratch and
you will arrive at the Nash equilibrium

6478
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
you will arrive at the Nash equilibrium
 

6479
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,250
you will arrive at the Nash equilibrium
where you don't have to worry about the

6480
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:55,260
where you don't have to worry about the
 

6481
01:50:55,260 --> 01:50:56,510
where you don't have to worry about the
other player

6482
01:50:56,510 --> 01:50:56,520
other player
 

6483

would would change things is if it

would would change things is if it
helped you so I what's the dynamic of

helped you so I what's the dynamic of
 

6495
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:09,950
helped you so I what's the dynamic of

do you always have to to have one friend

6500
01:51:13,609 --> 01:51:13,619
do you always have to to have one friend
 

6501
01:51:13,619 --> 01:51:17,450
do you always have to to have one friend
in the game you always want to maximize

6502
01:51:17,450 --> 01:51:17,460
in the game you always want to maximize
 

6503
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:22,070
in the game you always want to maximize
your friends and minimize your enemies

6504
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080

 

6505
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:25,070

got it and

6506
01:51:25,070 --> 01:51:25,080
got it and
 

6507
01:51:25,080 --> 01:51:28,129
got it and
boy in the the lying comes into play

6508
01:51:28,129 --> 01:51:28,139
boy in the the lying comes into play
 

6509
01:51:28,139 --> 01:51:29,450
boy in the the lying comes into play
there

6510
01:51:29,450 --> 01:51:29,460
there
 

6511
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:32,149
there
so the more friends you have the better

6512
01:51:32,149 --> 01:51:32,159
so the more friends you have the better
 

6513
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,830
so the more friends you have the better
yeah I mean I guess you have to attack

6514
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:33,840
yeah I mean I guess you have to attack
 

6515
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:34,790
yeah I mean I guess you have to attack
somebody or else you're not going to

6516
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:34,800
somebody or else you're not going to
 

6517
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:36,169
somebody or else you're not going to
make progress all right so that's the

6518
01:51:36,169 --> 01:51:36,179
make progress all right so that's the
 

6519
01:51:36,179 --> 01:51:39,590
make progress all right so that's the
tension but man this is too real this is

6520
01:51:39,590 --> 01:51:39,600
tension but man this is too real this is
 

6521
01:51:39,600 --> 01:51:41,890
tension but man this is too real this is
too real to this is too too close to

6522
01:51:41,890 --> 01:51:41,900
too real to this is too too close to
 

6523
01:51:41,900 --> 01:51:44,870
too real to this is too too close to
geopolitics of actual military conflict

6524
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:44,880
geopolitics of actual military conflict
 

6525
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:46,310
geopolitics of actual military conflict
in the world okay

6526
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:46,320
in the world okay
 

6527
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:48,050
in the world okay
uh that's fascinating so that

6528
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:48,060
uh that's fascinating so that
 

6529
01:51:48,060 --> 01:51:50,030
uh that's fascinating so that
cooperation element is what makes the

6530
01:51:50,030 --> 01:51:50,040
cooperation element is what makes the
 

6531
01:51:50,040 --> 01:51:52,550
cooperation element is what makes the
game really really hard yeah and to give

6532
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:52,560
game really really hard yeah and to give
 

6533
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:54,530
game really really hard yeah and to give
you an example of of how this

6534
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:54,540
you an example of of how this
 

6535
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,330
you an example of of how this
sub-optimality and irrationality comes

6536
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:56,340
sub-optimality and irrationality comes
 

6537
01:51:56,340 --> 01:51:58,550
sub-optimality and irrationality comes
into play there's a really common

6538
01:51:58,550 --> 01:51:58,560
into play there's a really common
 

6539
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:01,729
into play there's a really common
situation in a game of diplomacy

6540
01:52:01,729 --> 01:52:01,739
situation in a game of diplomacy
 

6541
01:52:01,739 --> 01:52:04,070
situation in a game of diplomacy
um that where one player starts to win

6542
01:52:04,070 --> 01:52:04,080
um that where one player starts to win
 

6543
01:52:04,080 --> 01:52:05,510
um that where one player starts to win
and they're like at the point where

6544
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:05,520
and they're like at the point where
 

6545
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:06,830
and they're like at the point where
they're controlling about half the map

6546
01:52:06,830 --> 01:52:06,840
they're controlling about half the map
 

6547
01:52:06,840 --> 01:52:09,169
they're controlling about half the map
yeah um and the remaining players who

6548
01:52:09,169 --> 01:52:09,179
yeah um and the remaining players who
 

6549
01:52:09,179 --> 01:52:10,310
yeah um and the remaining players who
have all been fighting each other the

6550
01:52:10,310 --> 01:52:10,320
have all been fighting each other the
 

6551
01:52:10,320 --> 01:52:12,229
have all been fighting each other the
whole game all have to like work

6552
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239
whole game all have to like work
 

6553
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:13,850
whole game all have to like work
together now to stop this other player

6554
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:13,860
together now to stop this other player
 

6555
01:52:13,860 --> 01:52:15,109
together now to stop this other player
from winning or else everybody's gonna

6556
01:52:15,109 --> 01:52:15,119
from winning or else everybody's gonna
 

6557
01:52:15,119 --> 01:52:16,430
from winning or else everybody's gonna
lose

6558
01:52:16,430 --> 01:52:16,440
lose
 

6559
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:18,530
lose
um and it's kind of like you know Game

6560
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:18,540
um and it's kind of like you know Game
 

6561
01:52:18,540 --> 01:52:19,729
um and it's kind of like you know Game
of Thrones like I don't know if you've

6562
01:52:19,729 --> 01:52:19,739
of Thrones like I don't know if you've
 

6563
01:52:19,739 --> 01:52:21,050
of Thrones like I don't know if you've
seen the show like you know you got the

6564
01:52:21,050 --> 01:52:21,060
seen the show like you know you got the
 

6565
01:52:21,060 --> 01:52:22,250
seen the show like you know you got the
the others coming from the north and

6566
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:22,260
the others coming from the north and
 

6567
01:52:22,260 --> 01:52:23,750
the others coming from the north and
like all the people have to start work

6568
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:23,760
like all the people have to start work
 

6569
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,669
like all the people have to start work
out their differences and stop them from

6570
01:52:25,669 --> 01:52:25,679
out their differences and stop them from
 

6571
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:27,590
out their differences and stop them from
from taking over

6572
01:52:27,590 --> 01:52:27,600
from taking over
 

6573
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:28,550
from taking over
um

6574
01:52:28,550 --> 01:52:28,560
um
 

6575
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:30,649
um
and the bot will do this like the bot

6576
01:52:30,649 --> 01:52:30,659
and the bot will do this like the bot
 

6577
01:52:30,659 --> 01:52:32,390
and the bot will do this like the bot
will work with the other players to stop

6578
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:32,400
will work with the other players to stop
 

6579
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,149
will work with the other players to stop
the superpower from winning but if it

6580
01:52:35,149 --> 01:52:35,159
the superpower from winning but if it
 

6581
01:52:35,159 --> 01:52:36,290
the superpower from winning but if it
doesn't really if it's trained from

6582
01:52:36,290 --> 01:52:36,300
doesn't really if it's trained from
 

6583
01:52:36,300 --> 01:52:38,030
doesn't really if it's trained from
scratch or it doesn't really have a good

6584
01:52:38,030 --> 01:52:38,040
scratch or it doesn't really have a good
 

6585
01:52:38,040 --> 01:52:40,010
scratch or it doesn't really have a good
grounding in how humans approach it it

6586
01:52:40,010 --> 01:52:40,020
grounding in how humans approach it it
 

6587
01:52:40,020 --> 01:52:42,350
grounding in how humans approach it it
will also at the same time attack the

6588
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:42,360
will also at the same time attack the
 

6589
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,629
will also at the same time attack the
other players with its extra units so

6590
01:52:44,629 --> 01:52:44,639
other players with its extra units so
 

6591
01:52:44,639 --> 01:52:46,310
other players with its extra units so
all the units that are not necessary to

6592
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:46,320
all the units that are not necessary to
 

6593
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,930
all the units that are not necessary to
stop the superpower from winning it will

6594
01:52:47,930 --> 01:52:47,940
stop the superpower from winning it will
 

6595
01:52:47,940 --> 01:52:49,970
stop the superpower from winning it will
use those to grab as many centers as

6596
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:49,980
use those to grab as many centers as
 

6597
01:52:49,980 --> 01:52:52,970
use those to grab as many centers as
possible from the other players and

6598
01:52:52,970 --> 01:52:52,980
possible from the other players and
 

6599
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:55,490
possible from the other players and
in totally rational play the other

6600
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:55,500
in totally rational play the other
 

6601
01:52:55,500 --> 01:52:56,930
in totally rational play the other
players should just live with that you

6602
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:56,940
players should just live with that you
 

6603
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:58,850
players should just live with that you
know they have to understand like hey a

6604
01:52:58,850 --> 01:52:58,860
know they have to understand like hey a
 

6605
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:00,350
know they have to understand like hey a
score of one is better than a score of

6606
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:00,360
score of one is better than a score of
 

6607
01:53:00,360 --> 01:53:01,910
score of one is better than a score of
zero so

6608
01:53:01,910 --> 01:53:01,920
zero so
 

6609
01:53:01,920 --> 01:53:04,669
zero so
um so okay he's grabbed my centers but I

6610
01:53:04,669 --> 01:53:04,679
um so okay he's grabbed my centers but I
 

6611
01:53:04,679 --> 01:53:05,990
um so okay he's grabbed my centers but I
I'll just deal with it

6612
01:53:05,990 --> 01:53:06,000
I'll just deal with it
 

6613
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,390
I'll just deal with it
but humans don't act that way right the

6614
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:08,400
but humans don't act that way right the
 

6615
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,729
but humans don't act that way right the
human gets really angry at the bot and

6616
01:53:10,729 --> 01:53:10,739
human gets really angry at the bot and
 

6617
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:13,550
human gets really angry at the bot and
ends up throwing the game because you

6618
01:53:13,550 --> 01:53:13,560
ends up throwing the game because you
 

6619
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:15,530
ends up throwing the game because you
know I'm gonna screw you over because

6620
01:53:15,530 --> 01:53:15,540
know I'm gonna screw you over because
 

6621
01:53:15,540 --> 01:53:18,649
know I'm gonna screw you over because
you did something that's not fair to me

6622
01:53:18,649 --> 01:53:18,659
you did something that's not fair to me
 

6623
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:20,450
you did something that's not fair to me
got it and are you supposed to model

6624
01:53:20,450 --> 01:53:20,460
got it and are you supposed to model
 

6625
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:22,070
got it and are you supposed to model
that is the boss supposed to model that

6626
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:22,080
that is the boss supposed to model that
 

6627
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:25,550
that is the boss supposed to model that
kind of human frustration yeah exactly

6628
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:25,560
kind of human frustration yeah exactly
 

6629
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,890
kind of human frustration yeah exactly
and so that is something that seems

6630
01:53:27,890 --> 01:53:27,900
and so that is something that seems
 

6631
01:53:27,900 --> 01:53:30,109
and so that is something that seems
almost impossible to model purely from

6632
01:53:30,109 --> 01:53:30,119
almost impossible to model purely from
 

6633
01:53:30,119 --> 01:53:31,490
almost impossible to model purely from
scratch without any human data it's a

6634
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:31,500
scratch without any human data it's a
 

6635
01:53:31,500 --> 01:53:34,129
scratch without any human data it's a
very cultural thing yeah um and so you

6636
01:53:34,129 --> 01:53:34,139
very cultural thing yeah um and so you
 

6637
01:53:34,139 --> 01:53:34,910
very cultural thing yeah um and so you
need

6638
01:53:34,910 --> 01:53:34,920
need
 

6639
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,129
need
human data to be able to understand that

6640
01:53:37,129 --> 01:53:37,139
human data to be able to understand that
 

6641
01:53:37,139 --> 01:53:39,410
human data to be able to understand that
hey that's how humans behave and you

6642
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:39,420
hey that's how humans behave and you
 

6643
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:40,550
hey that's how humans behave and you
have to work around that it might be

6644
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:40,560
have to work around that it might be
 

6645
01:53:40,560 --> 01:53:43,010
have to work around that it might be
suboptimal it might be rational but but

6646
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:43,020
suboptimal it might be rational but but
 

6647
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:45,410
suboptimal it might be rational but but
that's an aspect of humanity that you

6648
01:53:45,410 --> 01:53:45,420
that's an aspect of humanity that you
 

6649
01:53:45,420 --> 01:53:47,450
that's an aspect of humanity that you
have to have you have to deal with so

6650
01:53:47,450 --> 01:53:47,460
have to have you have to deal with so
 

6651
01:53:47,460 --> 01:53:49,250
have to have you have to deal with so
how difficult is it to train on human

6652
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:49,260
how difficult is it to train on human
 

6653
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:50,870
how difficult is it to train on human
data given that human data is very

6654
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:50,880
data given that human data is very
 

6655
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:53,570
data given that human data is very
limited versus what the US a purely

6656
01:53:53,570 --> 01:53:53,580
limited versus what the US a purely
 

6657
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,609
limited versus what the US a purely
self-play mechanism can generate that's

6658
01:53:55,609 --> 01:53:55,619
self-play mechanism can generate that's
 

6659
01:53:55,619 --> 01:53:57,109
self-play mechanism can generate that's
actually one of the major challenges

6660
01:53:57,109 --> 01:53:57,119
actually one of the major challenges
 

6661
01:53:57,119 --> 01:53:58,970
actually one of the major challenges
that we faced in the research that we

6662
01:53:58,970 --> 01:53:58,980
that we faced in the research that we
 

6663
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:00,290
that we faced in the research that we
had a good amount of human data we had

6664
01:54:00,290 --> 01:54:00,300
had a good amount of human data we had
 

6665
01:54:00,300 --> 01:54:03,229
had a good amount of human data we had
about 50 000 games what we try to do is

6666
01:54:03,229 --> 01:54:03,239
about 50 000 games what we try to do is
 

6667
01:54:03,239 --> 01:54:05,209
about 50 000 games what we try to do is
leverage as much soft play as possible

6668
01:54:05,209 --> 01:54:05,219
leverage as much soft play as possible
 

6669
01:54:05,219 --> 01:54:09,109
leverage as much soft play as possible
while still leveraging the human data so

6670
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:09,119
while still leveraging the human data so
 

6671
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:11,990
while still leveraging the human data so
what we do is we do self-play very

6672
01:54:11,990 --> 01:54:12,000
what we do is we do self-play very
 

6673
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:13,490
what we do is we do self-play very
similar to how it's been done in poker

6674
01:54:13,490 --> 01:54:13,500
similar to how it's been done in poker
 

6675
01:54:13,500 --> 01:54:17,270
similar to how it's been done in poker
and go but we try to regularize the

6676
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
and go but we try to regularize the
 

6677
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,890
and go but we try to regularize the
self-play towards the human data

6678
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:18,900
self-play towards the human data
 

6679
01:54:18,900 --> 01:54:22,970
self-play towards the human data
basically the way to think about it is

6680
01:54:22,970 --> 01:54:22,980
basically the way to think about it is
 

6681
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:27,830
basically the way to think about it is
um we penalize the bot for choosing

6682
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:27,840
um we penalize the bot for choosing
 

6683
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:30,950
um we penalize the bot for choosing
actions that are very unlikely under how

6684
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:30,960
actions that are very unlikely under how
 

6685
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,750
actions that are very unlikely under how
under the human data set

6686
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:32,760
under the human data set
 

6687
01:54:32,760 --> 01:54:34,910
under the human data set
and how do you know is there is this

6688
01:54:34,910 --> 01:54:34,920
and how do you know is there is this
 

6689
01:54:34,920 --> 01:54:36,890
and how do you know is there is this
some kind of function that says this is

6690
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:36,900
some kind of function that says this is
 

6691
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:40,189
some kind of function that says this is
human-like enough yeah so we we train a

6692
01:54:40,189 --> 01:54:40,199
human-like enough yeah so we we train a
 

6693
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:42,890
human-like enough yeah so we we train a
bot through supervised learning to model

6694
01:54:42,890 --> 01:54:42,900
bot through supervised learning to model
 

6695
01:54:42,900 --> 01:54:44,570
bot through supervised learning to model
the human play as much as possible so we

6696
01:54:44,570 --> 01:54:44,580
the human play as much as possible so we
 

6697
01:54:44,580 --> 01:54:46,609
the human play as much as possible so we
basically like train a neural net

6698
01:54:46,609 --> 01:54:46,619
basically like train a neural net
 

6699
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:49,129
basically like train a neural net
um on those 50 000 games and that gives

6700
01:54:49,129 --> 01:54:49,139
um on those 50 000 games and that gives
 

6701
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:51,169
um on those 50 000 games and that gives
us an approximate that gives us a policy

6702
01:54:51,169 --> 01:54:51,179
us an approximate that gives us a policy
 

6703
01:54:51,179 --> 01:54:53,209
us an approximate that gives us a policy
that resembles to some extent how humans

6704
01:54:53,209 --> 01:54:53,219
that resembles to some extent how humans
 

6705
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:55,129
that resembles to some extent how humans
actually play the game now this isn't a

6706
01:54:55,129 --> 01:54:55,139
actually play the game now this isn't a
 

6707
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:57,770
actually play the game now this isn't a
perfect model of human play because we

6708
01:54:57,770 --> 01:54:57,780
perfect model of human play because we
 

6709
01:54:57,780 --> 01:54:59,149
perfect model of human play because we
don't have unlimited data we don't have

6710
01:54:59,149 --> 01:54:59,159
don't have unlimited data we don't have
 

6711
01:54:59,159 --> 01:55:01,550
don't have unlimited data we don't have
unlimited neural net capacity

6712
01:55:01,550 --> 01:55:01,560
unlimited neural net capacity
 

6713
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,709
unlimited neural net capacity
um but it gives us some approximation uh

6714
01:55:03,709 --> 01:55:03,719
um but it gives us some approximation uh
 

6715
01:55:03,719 --> 01:55:05,149
um but it gives us some approximation uh
is there some data on the internet

6716
01:55:05,149 --> 01:55:05,159
is there some data on the internet
 

6717
01:55:05,159 --> 01:55:07,850
is there some data on the internet
that's useful besides just diplomacy so

6718
01:55:07,850 --> 01:55:07,860
that's useful besides just diplomacy so
 

6719
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:09,410
that's useful besides just diplomacy so
on the language side of things is there

6720
01:55:09,410 --> 01:55:09,420
on the language side of things is there
 

6721
01:55:09,420 --> 01:55:12,109
on the language side of things is there
some can you go to like Reddit

6722
01:55:12,109 --> 01:55:12,119
some can you go to like Reddit
 

6723
01:55:12,119 --> 01:55:14,209
some can you go to like Reddit
and

6724
01:55:14,209 --> 01:55:14,219
and
 

6725
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:16,010
and
um so sort of background model

6726
01:55:16,010 --> 01:55:16,020
um so sort of background model
 

6727
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:17,750
um so sort of background model
formulation that that's useful for the

6728
01:55:17,750 --> 01:55:17,760
formulation that that's useful for the
 

6729
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:19,550
formulation that that's useful for the
game of diplomacy yeah absolutely and so

6730
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:19,560
game of diplomacy yeah absolutely and so
 

6731
01:55:19,560 --> 01:55:21,290
game of diplomacy yeah absolutely and so
for the language model which

6732
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:21,300
for the language model which
 

6733
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:22,370
for the language model which
um it's kind of like a separate question

6734
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:22,380
um it's kind of like a separate question
 

6735
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:23,689
um it's kind of like a separate question
you know we didn't use the language

6736
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:23,699
you know we didn't use the language
 

6737
01:55:23,699 --> 01:55:26,990
you know we didn't use the language
model during self-play training but we

6738
01:55:26,990 --> 01:55:27,000
model during self-play training but we
 

6739
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,750
model during self-play training but we
pre-trained the language model on you

6740
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:29,760
pre-trained the language model on you
 

6741
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,970
pre-trained the language model on you
know tons of internet data as much as

6742
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:31,980
know tons of internet data as much as
 

6743
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:33,890
know tons of internet data as much as
possible and then we fine-tuned it

6744
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:33,900
possible and then we fine-tuned it
 

6745
01:55:33,900 --> 01:55:35,990
possible and then we fine-tuned it
specifically on the diplomacy games so

6746
01:55:35,990 --> 01:55:36,000
specifically on the diplomacy games so
 

6747
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,729
specifically on the diplomacy games so
we are able to like Leverage The Wider

6748
01:55:37,729 --> 01:55:37,739
we are able to like Leverage The Wider
 

6749
01:55:37,739 --> 01:55:40,790
we are able to like Leverage The Wider
data set in order to fill in

6750
01:55:40,790 --> 01:55:40,800
data set in order to fill in
 

6751
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:42,169
data set in order to fill in
some of the gaps in like how

6752
01:55:42,169 --> 01:55:42,179
some of the gaps in like how
 

6753
01:55:42,179 --> 01:55:43,870
some of the gaps in like how
communication happens more broadly

6754
01:55:43,870 --> 01:55:43,880
communication happens more broadly
 

6755
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,070
communication happens more broadly
besides just like specifically in these

6756
01:55:46,070 --> 01:55:46,080
besides just like specifically in these
 

6757
01:55:46,080 --> 01:55:48,470
besides just like specifically in these
diplomacy games Okay cool so what what's

6758
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
diplomacy games Okay cool so what what's
 

6759
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,970
diplomacy games Okay cool so what what's
some what are some interesting things

6760
01:55:49,970 --> 01:55:49,980
some what are some interesting things
 

6761
01:55:49,980 --> 01:55:51,830
some what are some interesting things
that came to life from this from this

6762
01:55:51,830 --> 01:55:51,840
that came to life from this from this
 

6763
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:54,169
that came to life from this from this
work uh to you like what are some

6764
01:55:54,169 --> 01:55:54,179
work uh to you like what are some
 

6765
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:55,550
work uh to you like what are some
insights

6766
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:55,560
insights
 

6767
01:55:55,560 --> 01:55:57,649
insights
about

6768
01:55:57,649 --> 01:55:57,659
about
 

6769
01:55:57,659 --> 01:55:58,250
about
um

6770
01:55:58,250 --> 01:55:58,260
um
 

6771
01:55:58,260 --> 01:56:00,890
um
about games where natural language is

6772
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:00,900
about games where natural language is
 

6773
01:56:00,900 --> 01:56:02,629
about games where natural language is
involved and cooperation deep

6774
01:56:02,629 --> 01:56:02,639
involved and cooperation deep
 

6775
01:56:02,639 --> 01:56:04,850
involved and cooperation deep
cooperation is involved well I think

6776
01:56:04,850 --> 01:56:04,860
cooperation is involved well I think
 

6777
01:56:04,860 --> 01:56:07,010
cooperation is involved well I think
there's a few insights um so first of

6778
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:07,020
there's a few insights um so first of
 

6779
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:07,729
there's a few insights um so first of
all

6780
01:56:07,729 --> 01:56:07,739
all
 

6781
01:56:07,739 --> 01:56:11,629
all
the fact that you can't rely purely or

6782
01:56:11,629 --> 01:56:11,639
the fact that you can't rely purely or
 

6783
01:56:11,639 --> 01:56:13,430
the fact that you can't rely purely or
even largely on self-play that you

6784
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:13,440
even largely on self-play that you
 

6785
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:14,870
even largely on self-play that you
really have to have an understanding of

6786
01:56:14,870 --> 01:56:14,880
really have to have an understanding of
 

6787
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,149
really have to have an understanding of
how humans approach the game

6788
01:56:17,149 --> 01:56:17,159
how humans approach the game
 

6789
01:56:17,159 --> 01:56:18,649
how humans approach the game
um I think that that's one of the major

6790
01:56:18,649 --> 01:56:18,659
um I think that that's one of the major
 

6791
01:56:18,659 --> 01:56:20,030
um I think that that's one of the major
conclusions that I'm drawing from this

6792
01:56:20,030 --> 01:56:20,040
conclusions that I'm drawing from this
 

6793
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:21,109
conclusions that I'm drawing from this
work

6794
01:56:21,109 --> 01:56:21,119
work
 

6795
01:56:21,119 --> 01:56:23,390
work
um and that is I think applicable more

6796
01:56:23,390 --> 01:56:23,400
um and that is I think applicable more
 

6797
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:25,250
um and that is I think applicable more
broadly to a lot of different games so

6798
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:25,260
broadly to a lot of different games so
 

6799
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:26,510
broadly to a lot of different games so
we've actually already taken the

6800
01:56:26,510 --> 01:56:26,520
we've actually already taken the
 

6801
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:27,890
we've actually already taken the
approaches that we've used in diplomacy

6802
01:56:27,890 --> 01:56:27,900
approaches that we've used in diplomacy
 

6803
01:56:27,900 --> 01:56:30,530
approaches that we've used in diplomacy
and tried them on uh Cooperative card

6804
01:56:30,530 --> 01:56:30,540
and tried them on uh Cooperative card
 

6805
01:56:30,540 --> 01:56:33,050
and tried them on uh Cooperative card
game called Hanabi and we've had a lot

6806
01:56:33,050 --> 01:56:33,060
game called Hanabi and we've had a lot
 

6807
01:56:33,060 --> 01:56:35,570
game called Hanabi and we've had a lot
of success in that game as well

6808
01:56:35,570 --> 01:56:35,580
of success in that game as well
 

6809
01:56:35,580 --> 01:56:37,550
of success in that game as well
um on the language side

6810
01:56:37,550 --> 01:56:37,560
um on the language side
 

6811
01:56:37,560 --> 01:56:40,310
um on the language side
I think the fact that we were able to

6812
01:56:40,310 --> 01:56:40,320
I think the fact that we were able to
 

6813
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,970
I think the fact that we were able to
control the language model through this

6814
01:56:43,970 --> 01:56:43,980
control the language model through this
 

6815
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:47,270
control the language model through this
intense approach was very effective

6816
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:47,280
intense approach was very effective
 

6817
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:49,310
intense approach was very effective
um and it allowed us instead of just

6818
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:49,320
um and it allowed us instead of just
 

6819
01:56:49,320 --> 01:56:51,590
um and it allowed us instead of just
imitating how humans would communicate

6820
01:56:51,590 --> 01:56:51,600
imitating how humans would communicate
 

6821
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:54,490
imitating how humans would communicate
were able to go beyond that and able to

6822
01:56:54,490 --> 01:56:54,500
were able to go beyond that and able to
 

6823
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:58,250
were able to go beyond that and able to
feed into it superhuman strategies that

6824
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:58,260
feed into it superhuman strategies that
 

6825
01:56:58,260 --> 01:57:00,770
feed into it superhuman strategies that
it can then um you know generate

6826
01:57:00,770 --> 01:57:00,780
it can then um you know generate
 

6827
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:02,390
it can then um you know generate
messages corresponding to

6828
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:02,400
messages corresponding to
 

6829
01:57:02,400 --> 01:57:04,250
messages corresponding to
is there something you could say about

6830
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:04,260
is there something you could say about
 

6831
01:57:04,260 --> 01:57:07,129
is there something you could say about
detecting whether a person or AI is

6832
01:57:07,129 --> 01:57:07,139
detecting whether a person or AI is
 

6833
01:57:07,139 --> 01:57:08,930
detecting whether a person or AI is
lying or not

6834
01:57:08,930 --> 01:57:08,940
lying or not
 

6835
01:57:08,940 --> 01:57:12,470
lying or not
the bot doesn't explicitly try to

6836
01:57:12,470 --> 01:57:12,480
the bot doesn't explicitly try to
 

6837
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:14,570
the bot doesn't explicitly try to
calculate whether somebody is lying or

6838
01:57:14,570 --> 01:57:14,580
calculate whether somebody is lying or
 

6839
01:57:14,580 --> 01:57:17,510
calculate whether somebody is lying or
not but what it will do is try to

6840
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:17,520
not but what it will do is try to
 

6841
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:19,609
not but what it will do is try to
predict what actions they're going to

6842
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:19,619
predict what actions they're going to
 

6843
01:57:19,619 --> 01:57:21,890
predict what actions they're going to
take given the communications given the

6844
01:57:21,890 --> 01:57:21,900
take given the communications given the
 

6845
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:23,689
take given the communications given the
messages that they've sent to us so

6846
01:57:23,689 --> 01:57:23,699
messages that they've sent to us so
 

6847
01:57:23,699 --> 01:57:25,550
messages that they've sent to us so
given our conversation what do I think

6848
01:57:25,550 --> 01:57:25,560
given our conversation what do I think
 

6849
01:57:25,560 --> 01:57:28,010
given our conversation what do I think
you're going to do and implicitly there

6850
01:57:28,010 --> 01:57:28,020
you're going to do and implicitly there
 

6851
01:57:28,020 --> 01:57:29,390
you're going to do and implicitly there
is a calculation about whether you're

6852
01:57:29,390 --> 01:57:29,400
is a calculation about whether you're
 

6853
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:30,950
is a calculation about whether you're
lying to me in that

6854
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:30,960
lying to me in that
 

6855
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,589
lying to me in that
you know if if you're based on your

6856
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:33,599
you know if if you're based on your
 

6857
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:34,790
you know if if you're based on your
messages if I think you're going to

6858
01:57:34,790 --> 01:57:34,800
messages if I think you're going to
 

6859
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,410
messages if I think you're going to
attack me this turn

6860
01:57:36,410 --> 01:57:36,420
attack me this turn
 

6861
01:57:36,420 --> 01:57:37,729
attack me this turn
um even though your messages say that

6862
01:57:37,729 --> 01:57:37,739
um even though your messages say that
 

6863
01:57:37,739 --> 01:57:40,250
um even though your messages say that
you're not then you know essentially the

6864
01:57:40,250 --> 01:57:40,260
you're not then you know essentially the
 

6865
01:57:40,260 --> 01:57:42,410
you're not then you know essentially the
bot is predicting that you're lying but

6866
01:57:42,410 --> 01:57:42,420
bot is predicting that you're lying but
 

6867
01:57:42,420 --> 01:57:45,350
bot is predicting that you're lying but
it doesn't view it as as lying the same

6868
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:45,360
it doesn't view it as as lying the same
 

6869
01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:47,149
it doesn't view it as as lying the same
way that we would view it as lying

6870
01:57:47,149 --> 01:57:47,159
way that we would view it as lying
 

6871
01:57:47,159 --> 01:57:49,609
way that we would view it as lying
but you could probably reformulate with

6872
01:57:49,609 --> 01:57:49,619
but you could probably reformulate with
 

6873
01:57:49,619 --> 01:57:53,209
but you could probably reformulate with
all the same data and make a classifier

6874
01:57:53,209 --> 01:57:53,219
all the same data and make a classifier
 

6875
01:57:53,219 --> 01:57:55,790
all the same data and make a classifier
lying or not yeah I think I think you

6876
01:57:55,790 --> 01:57:55,800
lying or not yeah I think I think you
 

6877
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:57,350
lying or not yeah I think I think you
could do that um that was not something

6878
01:57:57,350 --> 01:57:57,360
could do that um that was not something
 

6879
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,089
could do that um that was not something
that we were focused on but I think that

6880
01:57:59,089 --> 01:57:59,099
that we were focused on but I think that
 

6881
01:57:59,099 --> 01:58:02,149
that we were focused on but I think that
it is possible that you know if you came

6882
01:58:02,149 --> 01:58:02,159
it is possible that you know if you came
 

6883
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:03,530
it is possible that you know if you came
up with some measurements of like what

6884
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:03,540
up with some measurements of like what
 

6885
01:58:03,540 --> 01:58:04,910
up with some measurements of like what
does it mean to tell a lie because

6886
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:04,920
does it mean to tell a lie because
 

6887
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:06,950
does it mean to tell a lie because
there's there's a spectrum right like if

6888
01:58:06,950 --> 01:58:06,960
there's there's a spectrum right like if
 

6889
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:09,350
there's there's a spectrum right like if
you're withholding some information is

6890
01:58:09,350 --> 01:58:09,360
you're withholding some information is
 

6891
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:10,550
you're withholding some information is
that a lie

6892
01:58:10,550 --> 01:58:10,560
that a lie
 

6893
01:58:10,560 --> 01:58:11,810
that a lie
um if you're mostly telling the truth

6894
01:58:11,810 --> 01:58:11,820
um if you're mostly telling the truth
 

6895
01:58:11,820 --> 01:58:13,550
um if you're mostly telling the truth
but you forgot to mention this like one

6896
01:58:13,550 --> 01:58:13,560
but you forgot to mention this like one
 

6897
01:58:13,560 --> 01:58:16,490
but you forgot to mention this like one
action out of like 10 is that a lie

6898
01:58:16,490 --> 01:58:16,500
action out of like 10 is that a lie
 

6899
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:18,109
action out of like 10 is that a lie
um it's hard to draw the line but you

6900
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:18,119
um it's hard to draw the line but you
 

6901
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:19,850
um it's hard to draw the line but you
know if you're willing to do that and

6902
01:58:19,850 --> 01:58:19,860
know if you're willing to do that and
 

6903
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:22,129
know if you're willing to do that and
then you could possibly use it to uh

6904
01:58:22,129 --> 01:58:22,139
then you could possibly use it to uh
 

6905
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:24,410
then you could possibly use it to uh
dude this feels like an argument inside

6906
01:58:24,410 --> 01:58:24,420
dude this feels like an argument inside
 

6907
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,589
dude this feels like an argument inside
a relationship now what constitutes a

6908
01:58:27,589 --> 01:58:27,599
a relationship now what constitutes a
 

6909
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:29,149
a relationship now what constitutes a
lie

6910
01:58:29,149 --> 01:58:29,159
lie
 

6911
01:58:29,159 --> 01:58:31,070
lie
um depends what you mean by the

6912
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:31,080
um depends what you mean by the
 

6913
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:33,530
um depends what you mean by the
definition of the word is okay

6914
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:33,540
definition of the word is okay
 

6915
01:58:33,540 --> 01:58:34,550
definition of the word is okay
um

6916
01:58:34,550 --> 01:58:34,560
um
 

6917
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:37,010
um
still it's fascinating because trust and

6918
01:58:37,010 --> 01:58:37,020
still it's fascinating because trust and
 

6919
01:58:37,020 --> 01:58:39,709
still it's fascinating because trust and
lying is all intermixed into this and

6920
01:58:39,709 --> 01:58:39,719
lying is all intermixed into this and
 

6921
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:42,350
lying is all intermixed into this and
it's language models that are becoming

6922
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:42,360
it's language models that are becoming
 

6923
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:44,209
it's language models that are becoming
more and more sophisticated it's just a

6924
01:58:44,209 --> 01:58:44,219
more and more sophisticated it's just a
 

6925
01:58:44,219 --> 01:58:46,910
more and more sophisticated it's just a
fascinating space to explore

6926
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:46,920
fascinating space to explore
 

6927
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:47,689
fascinating space to explore
um

6928
01:58:47,689 --> 01:58:47,699
um
 

6929
01:58:47,699 --> 01:58:51,830
um
what do you see as the future of this

6930
01:58:51,830 --> 01:58:51,840
what do you see as the future of this
 

6931
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:53,689
what do you see as the future of this
work

6932
01:58:53,689 --> 01:58:53,699
work
 

6933
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:56,149
work
um that is inspired by the Breakthrough

6934
01:58:56,149 --> 01:58:56,159
um that is inspired by the Breakthrough
 

6935
01:58:56,159 --> 01:58:57,410
um that is inspired by the Breakthrough
performance that you're getting here

6936
01:58:57,410 --> 01:58:57,420
performance that you're getting here
 

6937
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:00,470
performance that you're getting here
with diplomacy

6938
01:59:00,470 --> 01:59:00,480

 

6939
01:59:00,480 --> 01:59:01,790

uh

6940
01:59:01,790 --> 01:59:01,800
uh
 

6941
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:02,810
uh
I think there's a few different

6942
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:02,820
I think there's a few different
 

6943
01:59:02,820 --> 01:59:04,609
I think there's a few different
directions to take this work

6944
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:04,619
directions to take this work
 

6945
01:59:04,619 --> 01:59:05,510
directions to take this work
um

6946
01:59:05,510 --> 01:59:05,520
um
 

6947
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,510
um
I I think really what it's showing us is

6948
01:59:08,510 --> 01:59:08,520
I I think really what it's showing us is
 

6949
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,669
I I think really what it's showing us is
the potential that language models have

6950
01:59:10,669 --> 01:59:10,679
the potential that language models have
 

6951
01:59:10,679 --> 01:59:11,990
the potential that language models have
I mean I think a lot of people didn't

6952
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:12,000
I mean I think a lot of people didn't
 

6953
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,550
I mean I think a lot of people didn't
think that this kind of result was

6954
01:59:13,550 --> 01:59:13,560
think that this kind of result was
 

6955
01:59:13,560 --> 01:59:15,770
think that this kind of result was
possible even today despite all the

6956
01:59:15,770 --> 01:59:15,780
possible even today despite all the
 

6957
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,729
possible even today despite all the
progress that's been made in language

6958
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:16,739
progress that's been made in language
 

6959
01:59:16,739 --> 01:59:19,390
progress that's been made in language
models and so it shows us how we can

6960
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:19,400
models and so it shows us how we can
 

6961
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,890
models and so it shows us how we can
Leverage The Power of things like

6962
01:59:21,890 --> 01:59:21,900
Leverage The Power of things like
 

6963
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:24,530
Leverage The Power of things like
self-play on top of language models to

6964
01:59:24,530 --> 01:59:24,540
self-play on top of language models to
 

6965
01:59:24,540 --> 01:59:25,430
self-play on top of language models to
get

6966
01:59:25,430 --> 01:59:25,440
get
 

6967
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,950
get
um increasingly better performance and

6968
01:59:27,950 --> 01:59:27,960
um increasingly better performance and
 

6969
01:59:27,960 --> 01:59:30,050
um increasingly better performance and
the ceiling is really

6970
01:59:30,050 --> 01:59:30,060
the ceiling is really
 

6971
01:59:30,060 --> 01:59:31,850
the ceiling is really
much higher than what we have right now

6972
01:59:31,850 --> 01:59:31,860
much higher than what we have right now
 

6973
01:59:31,860 --> 01:59:35,330
much higher than what we have right now
is this transferable somehow to

6974
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:35,340
is this transferable somehow to
 

6975
01:59:35,340 --> 01:59:37,129
is this transferable somehow to
to chat Bots

6976
01:59:37,129 --> 01:59:37,139
to chat Bots
 

6977
01:59:37,139 --> 01:59:40,430
to chat Bots
for the more General task of dialogue

6978
01:59:40,430 --> 01:59:40,440
for the more General task of dialogue
 

6979
01:59:40,440 --> 01:59:42,229
for the more General task of dialogue
so because there is a kind of

6980
01:59:42,229 --> 01:59:42,239
so because there is a kind of
 

6981
01:59:42,239 --> 01:59:44,750
so because there is a kind of
negotiation here a dance between

6982
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:44,760
negotiation here a dance between
 

6983
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,609
negotiation here a dance between
entities that are trying to cooperate

6984
01:59:46,609 --> 01:59:46,619
entities that are trying to cooperate
 

6985
01:59:46,619 --> 01:59:48,589
entities that are trying to cooperate
and at the same time a little bit

6986
01:59:48,589 --> 01:59:48,599
and at the same time a little bit
 

6987
01:59:48,599 --> 01:59:52,550
and at the same time a little bit
adversarial which I think Maps somewhat

6988
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
adversarial which I think Maps somewhat
 

6989
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,290
adversarial which I think Maps somewhat
to the general

6990
01:59:54,290 --> 01:59:54,300

01:59:54,300 --> 01:59:58,609
to the general
you know the entire process of Reddit or

6992
01:59:58,609 --> 01:59:58,619
you know the entire process of Reddit or
 

6993
01:59:58,619 --> 02:00:00,229
you know the entire process of Reddit or
like internet communication you're

6994
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:00,239
like internet communication you're
 

6995
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:02,570
like internet communication you're
cooperating you're adversarial you're

6996
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:02,580
cooperating you're adversarial you're
 

6997
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:04,490
cooperating you're adversarial you're
having debates you're having uh

6998
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:04,500
having debates you're having uh
 

6999
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,589
having debates you're having uh
camaraderie all that kind of stuff

7000
02:00:06,589 --> 02:00:06,599
camaraderie all that kind of stuff
 

7001
02:00:06,599 --> 02:00:08,209
camaraderie all that kind of stuff
I think one of the things that's really

7002
02:00:08,209 --> 02:00:08,219
I think one of the things that's really
 

7003
02:00:08,219 --> 02:00:10,790
I think one of the things that's really
useful about diplomacy is that we have a

7004
02:00:10,790 --> 02:00:10,800
useful about diplomacy is that we have a
 

7005
02:00:10,800 --> 02:00:13,490
useful about diplomacy is that we have a
well-defined value function there is a

7006
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:13,500
well-defined value function there is a
 

7007
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,530
well-defined value function there is a
well-defined score that the bot is

7008
02:00:15,530 --> 02:00:15,540
well-defined score that the bot is
 

7009
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:18,229
well-defined score that the bot is
trying to optimize and and in a in a

02:00:18,229 --> 02:00:18,239
trying to optimize and and in a in a
 

7011

trying to optimize and and in a in a
setting like a general chatbot setting

7012
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:20,460
setting like a general chatbot setting
 

7013
02:00:20,460 --> 02:00:23,510
setting like a general chatbot setting
it needs it would need that kind of

02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,520
it needs it would need that kind of

7040
02:00:52,729 --> 02:00:52,739
the way that we've approached AI
 

7041
02:00:52,739 --> 02:00:54,589
the way that we've approached AI
diplomacy is you condition the language

7042
02:00:54,589 --> 02:00:54,599
diplomacy is you condition the language
 

7043
02:00:54,599 --> 02:00:57,530
diplomacy is you condition the language
on an intent now that intent and

7044
02:00:57,530 --> 02:00:57,540
on an intent now that intent and
 

7045
02:00:57,540 --> 02:00:59,689
on an intent now that intent and
diplomacy is an is an action but it

7046
02:00:59,689 --> 02:00:59,699
diplomacy is an is an action but it
 

7047
02:00:59,699 --> 02:01:01,209
diplomacy is an is an action but it
doesn't have to be and you can imagine

7048
02:01:01,209 --> 02:01:01,219
doesn't have to be and you can imagine
 

7049
02:01:01,219 --> 02:01:04,910
doesn't have to be and you can imagine
you know you could have NPCs in video

7050
02:01:04,910 --> 02:01:04,920
you know you could have NPCs in video
 

7051
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:07,310
you know you could have NPCs in video
games or the metaverse or whatever where

7052
02:01:07,310 --> 02:01:07,320
games or the metaverse or whatever where
 

7053
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:09,169
games or the metaverse or whatever where
there's some intent or there's some

7054
02:01:09,169 --> 02:01:09,179
there's some intent or there's some
 

7055
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:10,189
there's some intent or there's some
objective that they're trying to

7056
02:01:10,189 --> 02:01:10,199
objective that they're trying to
 

7057
02:01:10,199 --> 02:01:11,629
objective that they're trying to
maximize and you can specify what that

7058
02:01:11,629 --> 02:01:11,639
maximize and you can specify what that
 

7059
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:12,950
maximize and you can specify what that
is

7060
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:12,960
is
 

7061
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,830
is
um and and then the language can

7062
02:01:15,830 --> 02:01:15,840
um and and then the language can
 

7063
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:18,290
um and and then the language can
correspond to that intent now I'm not

7064
02:01:18,290 --> 02:01:18,300
correspond to that intent now I'm not
 

7065
02:01:18,300 --> 02:01:19,370
correspond to that intent now I'm not
saying that this is you know happening

7066
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:19,380
saying that this is you know happening
 

7067
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:21,109
saying that this is you know happening
imminently but um I'm saying that this

7068
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,119
imminently but um I'm saying that this
 

7069
02:01:21,119 --> 02:01:22,970
imminently but um I'm saying that this
is like a future application potentially

7070
02:01:22,970 --> 02:01:22,980
is like a future application potentially
 

7071
02:01:22,980 --> 02:01:25,850
is like a future application potentially
of this direction of research so what's

7072
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:25,860
of this direction of research so what's
 

7073
02:01:25,860 --> 02:01:27,470
of this direction of research so what's
the more General formulation of this

7074
02:01:27,470 --> 02:01:27,480
the more General formulation of this
 

7075
02:01:27,480 --> 02:01:30,109
the more General formulation of this
making self-play be able to scale the

7076
02:01:30,109 --> 02:01:30,119
making self-play be able to scale the
 

7077
02:01:30,119 --> 02:01:31,910
making self-play be able to scale the
way self-play does and still maintain

7078
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
way self-play does and still maintain
 

7079
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,589
way self-play does and still maintain
human-like Behavior

7080
02:01:33,589 --> 02:01:33,599
human-like Behavior
 

7081
02:01:33,599 --> 02:01:36,589
human-like Behavior
the way that we've approached self-play

7082
02:01:36,589 --> 02:01:36,599
the way that we've approached self-play
 

7083
02:01:36,599 --> 02:01:38,629
the way that we've approached self-play
in diplomacy is like

7084
02:01:38,629 --> 02:01:38,639
in diplomacy is like
 

7085
02:01:38,639 --> 02:01:41,089
in diplomacy is like
we're we're trying to

7086
02:01:41,089 --> 02:01:41,099
we're we're trying to
 

7087
02:01:41,099 --> 02:01:43,070
we're we're trying to
come up with good intents to condition

7088
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:43,080
come up with good intents to condition
 

7089
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:44,750
come up with good intents to condition
the language model on and the space of

7090
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:44,760
the language model on and the space of
 

7091
02:01:44,760 --> 02:01:47,450
the language model on and the space of
intents is actions that can be played in

7092
02:01:47,450 --> 02:01:47,460
intents is actions that can be played in
 

7093
02:01:47,460 --> 02:01:49,550
intents is actions that can be played in
the game now there is like the potential

7094
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:49,560
the game now there is like the potential
 

7095
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:51,770
the game now there is like the potential
to have a broader set of intents things

7096
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:51,780
to have a broader set of intents things
 

7097
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,950
to have a broader set of intents things
like you know long-term cooperation or

7098
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:54,960
like you know long-term cooperation or
 

7099
02:01:54,960 --> 02:01:58,310
like you know long-term cooperation or
long-term uh objectives or you know

7100
02:01:58,310 --> 02:01:58,320
long-term uh objectives or you know
 

7101
02:01:58,320 --> 02:02:00,109
long-term uh objectives or you know
gossip about what another player was

7102
02:02:00,109 --> 02:02:00,119
gossip about what another player was
 

7103
02:02:00,119 --> 02:02:01,070
gossip about what another player was
saying

7104
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:01,080
saying
 

7105
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:02,450
saying
um these are things that we're currently

7106
02:02:02,450 --> 02:02:02,460
um these are things that we're currently
 

7107
02:02:02,460 --> 02:02:04,010
um these are things that we're currently
not conditioning the language model on

7108
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:04,020
not conditioning the language model on
 

7109
02:02:04,020 --> 02:02:06,350
not conditioning the language model on
and so it's not able to we're not able

7110
02:02:06,350 --> 02:02:06,360
and so it's not able to we're not able
 

7111
02:02:06,360 --> 02:02:08,270
and so it's not able to we're not able
to control it to say like oh you should

7112
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:08,280
to control it to say like oh you should
 

7113
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:09,470
to control it to say like oh you should
be talking about this thing right now

7114
02:02:09,470 --> 02:02:09,480
be talking about this thing right now
 

7115
02:02:09,480 --> 02:02:12,109
be talking about this thing right now
but it's quite possible that you could

7116
02:02:12,109 --> 02:02:12,119
but it's quite possible that you could
 

7117
02:02:12,119 --> 02:02:14,330
but it's quite possible that you could
expand the scope of intents to be able

7118
02:02:14,330 --> 02:02:14,340
expand the scope of intents to be able
 

7119
02:02:14,340 --> 02:02:15,830
expand the scope of intents to be able
to allow it to talk about those things

7120
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:15,840
to allow it to talk about those things
 

7121
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,169
to allow it to talk about those things
now in the process of doing that the

7122
02:02:18,169 --> 02:02:18,179
now in the process of doing that the
 

7123
02:02:18,179 --> 02:02:19,490
now in the process of doing that the
self-play would become much more

7124
02:02:19,490 --> 02:02:19,500
self-play would become much more
 

7125
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:20,930
self-play would become much more
complicated

7126
02:02:20,930 --> 02:02:20,940
complicated
 

7127
02:02:20,940 --> 02:02:23,270
complicated
um and so that is a potential for for

7128
02:02:23,270 --> 02:02:23,280
um and so that is a potential for for
 

7129
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:24,950
um and so that is a potential for for
future work okay the increasing the

7130
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:24,960
future work okay the increasing the
 

7131
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,169
future work okay the increasing the
number of intents I still am not quite

7132
02:02:27,169 --> 02:02:27,179
number of intents I still am not quite
 

7133
02:02:27,179 --> 02:02:28,070
number of intents I still am not quite
clear

7134
02:02:28,070 --> 02:02:28,080
clear
 

7135
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:32,209
clear
how you keep the self-play

7136
02:02:32,209 --> 02:02:32,219
how you keep the self-play
 

7137
02:02:32,219 --> 02:02:35,450
how you keep the self-play
integrated into the human world yeah I'm

7138
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:35,460
integrated into the human world yeah I'm
 

7139
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:38,209
integrated into the human world yeah I'm
a little bit loose on the uh uh on

7140
02:02:38,209 --> 02:02:38,219
a little bit loose on the uh uh on
 

7141
02:02:38,219 --> 02:02:39,890
a little bit loose on the uh uh on
understanding how you do that so we

7142
02:02:39,890 --> 02:02:39,900
understanding how you do that so we
 

7143
02:02:39,900 --> 02:02:42,290
understanding how you do that so we
train a neural Nets to

7144
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:42,300
train a neural Nets to
 

7145
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:43,970
train a neural Nets to
um imitate the human data as closely as

7146
02:02:43,970 --> 02:02:43,980
um imitate the human data as closely as
 

7147
02:02:43,980 --> 02:02:45,649
um imitate the human data as closely as
possible and that's what we call the

7148
02:02:45,649 --> 02:02:45,659
possible and that's what we call the
 

7149
02:02:45,659 --> 02:02:47,990
possible and that's what we call the
anchor policy and now when we're doing

7150
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:48,000
anchor policy and now when we're doing
 

7151
02:02:48,000 --> 02:02:49,189
anchor policy and now when we're doing
self-play

7152
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:49,199
self-play
 

7153
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:50,930
self-play
the the problem with the anchor policy

7154
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:50,940
the the problem with the anchor policy
 

7155
02:02:50,940 --> 02:02:53,629
the the problem with the anchor policy
is that it's not a perfect approximation

7156
02:02:53,629 --> 02:02:53,639
is that it's not a perfect approximation
 

7157
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:55,490
is that it's not a perfect approximation
of how humans actually play because we

7158
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:55,500
of how humans actually play because we
 

7159
02:02:55,500 --> 02:02:57,050
of how humans actually play because we
don't have infinite data because we

7160
02:02:57,050 --> 02:02:57,060
don't have infinite data because we
 

7161
02:02:57,060 --> 02:02:59,330
don't have infinite data because we
don't have unlimited neural network

7162
02:02:59,330 --> 02:02:59,340
don't have unlimited neural network
 

7163
02:02:59,340 --> 02:03:01,790
don't have unlimited neural network
capacity it's actually a relatively

7164
02:03:01,790 --> 02:03:01,800
capacity it's actually a relatively
 

7165
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:03,589
capacity it's actually a relatively
sub-optimal approximation of how humans

7166
02:03:03,589 --> 02:03:03,599
sub-optimal approximation of how humans
 

7167
02:03:03,599 --> 02:03:05,750
sub-optimal approximation of how humans
actually play and we can improve that

7168
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:05,760
actually play and we can improve that
 

7169
02:03:05,760 --> 02:03:10,070
actually play and we can improve that
approximation by adding planning and RL

7170
02:03:10,070 --> 02:03:10,080
approximation by adding planning and RL
 

7171
02:03:10,080 --> 02:03:13,129
approximation by adding planning and RL
and so what we do is we get a better

7172
02:03:13,129 --> 02:03:13,139
and so what we do is we get a better
 

7173
02:03:13,139 --> 02:03:15,050
and so what we do is we get a better
approximation a better model of human

7174
02:03:15,050 --> 02:03:15,060
approximation a better model of human
 

7175
02:03:15,060 --> 02:03:16,910
approximation a better model of human
play by

7176
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:16,920
play by
 

7177
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:20,629
play by
during the self-play process we say you

7178
02:03:20,629 --> 02:03:20,639
during the self-play process we say you
 

7179
02:03:20,639 --> 02:03:23,149
during the self-play process we say you
can deviate from this human anchor

7180
02:03:23,149 --> 02:03:23,159
can deviate from this human anchor
 

7181
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:25,550
can deviate from this human anchor
policy if there is an action that has

7182
02:03:25,550 --> 02:03:25,560
policy if there is an action that has
 

7183
02:03:25,560 --> 02:03:27,770
policy if there is an action that has
you know particularly High expected

7184
02:03:27,770 --> 02:03:27,780
you know particularly High expected
 

7185
02:03:27,780 --> 02:03:29,209
you know particularly High expected
value

7186
02:03:29,209 --> 02:03:29,219
value
 

7187
02:03:29,219 --> 02:03:31,669
value
um but it would have to be a really high

7188
02:03:31,669 --> 02:03:31,679
um but it would have to be a really high
 

7189
02:03:31,679 --> 02:03:33,770
um but it would have to be a really high
expected value in order to to deviate

7190
02:03:33,770 --> 02:03:33,780
expected value in order to to deviate
 

7191
02:03:33,780 --> 02:03:36,950
expected value in order to to deviate
from from this human-like policy so you

7192
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:36,960
from from this human-like policy so you
 

7193
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:38,629
from from this human-like policy so you
basically say try to maximize your

7194
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
basically say try to maximize your
 

7195
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:40,550
basically say try to maximize your
expected value while at the same time

7196
02:03:40,550 --> 02:03:40,560
expected value while at the same time
 

7197
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:42,709
expected value while at the same time
stay as close as possible to the human

7198
02:03:42,709 --> 02:03:42,719
stay as close as possible to the human
 

7199
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:45,890
stay as close as possible to the human
policy and there is a parameter that

7200
02:03:45,890 --> 02:03:45,900
policy and there is a parameter that
 

7201
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:48,410
policy and there is a parameter that
controls those the the relative

7202
02:03:48,410 --> 02:03:48,420
controls those the the relative
 

7203
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:50,570
controls those the the relative
weighting of those Computing objectives

7204
02:03:50,570 --> 02:03:50,580
weighting of those Computing objectives
 

7205
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,490
weighting of those Computing objectives
so the question I have

7206
02:03:52,490 --> 02:03:52,500
so the question I have
 

7207
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:54,649
so the question I have
is how sophisticated can the anchor

7208
02:03:54,649 --> 02:03:54,659
is how sophisticated can the anchor
 

7209
02:03:54,659 --> 02:03:56,390
is how sophisticated can the anchor
policy get

7210
02:03:56,390 --> 02:03:56,400
policy get
 

7211
02:03:56,400 --> 02:03:58,490
policy get
to have a policy that approximates human

7212
02:03:58,490 --> 02:03:58,500
to have a policy that approximates human
 

7213
02:03:58,500 --> 02:04:02,270
to have a policy that approximates human
behavior right yeah so as you increase

7214
02:04:02,270 --> 02:04:02,280
behavior right yeah so as you increase
 

7215
02:04:02,280 --> 02:04:04,629
behavior right yeah so as you increase
the number of intents as you generalize

7216
02:04:04,629 --> 02:04:04,639
the number of intents as you generalize
 

7217
02:04:04,639 --> 02:04:06,830
the number of intents as you generalize
the the space in which this is

7218
02:04:06,830 --> 02:04:06,840
the the space in which this is
 

7219
02:04:06,840 --> 02:04:08,149
the the space in which this is
applicable

7220
02:04:08,149 --> 02:04:08,159
applicable
 

7221
02:04:08,159 --> 02:04:11,149
applicable
and given that the human data is limited

7222
02:04:11,149 --> 02:04:11,159
and given that the human data is limited
 

7223
02:04:11,159 --> 02:04:14,330
and given that the human data is limited
try to anticipate a policy that works

7224
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:14,340
try to anticipate a policy that works
 

7225
02:04:14,340 --> 02:04:17,209
try to anticipate a policy that works
for in a much larger number of cases

7226
02:04:17,209 --> 02:04:17,219
for in a much larger number of cases
 

7227
02:04:17,219 --> 02:04:19,790
for in a much larger number of cases
like how how difficult is the process of

7228
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:19,800
like how how difficult is the process of
 

7229
02:04:19,800 --> 02:04:22,430
like how how difficult is the process of
forming a damn good anchor policy

7230
02:04:22,430 --> 02:04:22,440
forming a damn good anchor policy
 

7231
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:24,109
forming a damn good anchor policy
well it really comes down to how much

7232
02:04:24,109 --> 02:04:24,119
well it really comes down to how much
 

7233
02:04:24,119 --> 02:04:26,149
well it really comes down to how much
human data you have so it's all boss

7234
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
human data you have so it's all boss
 

7235
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:28,910
human data you have so it's all boss
scale in the human data I think the more

7236
02:04:28,910 --> 02:04:28,920
scale in the human data I think the more
 

7237
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:30,530
scale in the human data I think the more
human data you have the better and I

7238
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:30,540
human data you have the better and I
 

7239
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:32,030
human data you have the better and I
think that that's going to be the major

7240
02:04:32,030 --> 02:04:32,040
think that that's going to be the major
 

7241
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:35,209
think that that's going to be the major
bottleneck in in scaling to to more

7242
02:04:35,209 --> 02:04:35,219
bottleneck in in scaling to to more
 

7243
02:04:35,219 --> 02:04:36,530
bottleneck in in scaling to to more
complicated

7244
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:36,540
complicated
 

7245
02:04:36,540 --> 02:04:38,149
complicated
um domains but that said

7246
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
um domains but that said
 

7247
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:39,530
um domains but that said
you know there might be the potential

7248
02:04:39,530 --> 02:04:39,540
you know there might be the potential
 

7249
02:04:39,540 --> 02:04:41,330
you know there might be the potential
just like in the language model where we

7250
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:41,340
just like in the language model where we
 

7251
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,370
just like in the language model where we
leveraged you know tons of data on the

7252
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:43,380
leveraged you know tons of data on the
 

7253
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:45,109
leveraged you know tons of data on the
internet and then specialized it for

7254
02:04:45,109 --> 02:04:45,119
internet and then specialized it for
 

7255
02:04:45,119 --> 02:04:46,790
internet and then specialized it for
diplomacy

7256
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
diplomacy
 

7257
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,109
diplomacy
um there is the future potential that

7258
02:04:48,109 --> 02:04:48,119
um there is the future potential that
 

7259
02:04:48,119 --> 02:04:49,550
um there is the future potential that
you can leverage huge amounts of data

7260
02:04:49,550 --> 02:04:49,560
you can leverage huge amounts of data
 

7261
02:04:49,560 --> 02:04:52,550
you can leverage huge amounts of data
across the board and then specialize it

7262
02:04:52,550 --> 02:04:52,560
across the board and then specialize it
 

7263
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:54,109
across the board and then specialize it
in the data set that you have for

7264
02:04:54,109 --> 02:04:54,119
in the data set that you have for
 

7265
02:04:54,119 --> 02:04:55,490
in the data set that you have for
diplomacy and in that way you're

7266
02:04:55,490 --> 02:04:55,500
diplomacy and in that way you're
 

7267
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:56,870
diplomacy and in that way you're
essentially augmenting the amount of

7268
02:04:56,870 --> 02:04:56,880
essentially augmenting the amount of
 

7269
02:04:56,880 --> 02:04:58,370
essentially augmenting the amount of
data that you have

7270
02:04:58,370 --> 02:04:58,380
data that you have
 

7271
02:04:58,380 --> 02:05:01,330
data that you have
to what degree does this apply

7272
02:05:01,330 --> 02:05:01,340
to what degree does this apply
 

7273
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:06,169
to what degree does this apply
to the general the real world diplomacy

7274
02:05:06,169 --> 02:05:06,179
to the general the real world diplomacy
 

7275
02:05:06,179 --> 02:05:08,390
to the general the real world diplomacy
the geopolitics

7276
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:08,400
the geopolitics
 

7277
02:05:08,400 --> 02:05:10,850
the geopolitics
you know there's a game theory has a

7278
02:05:10,850 --> 02:05:10,860
you know there's a game theory has a
 

7279
02:05:10,860 --> 02:05:12,350
you know there's a game theory has a
history of being applied to understand

7280
02:05:12,350 --> 02:05:12,360
history of being applied to understand
 

7281
02:05:12,360 --> 02:05:14,930
history of being applied to understand
and to give us hope about nuclear

7282
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:14,940
and to give us hope about nuclear
 

7283
02:05:14,940 --> 02:05:17,030
and to give us hope about nuclear
weapons for example the mutually assured

7284
02:05:17,030 --> 02:05:17,040
weapons for example the mutually assured
 

7285
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,250
weapons for example the mutually assured
destruction is a game theoretic concept

7286
02:05:19,250 --> 02:05:19,260
destruction is a game theoretic concept
 

7287
02:05:19,260 --> 02:05:22,070
destruction is a game theoretic concept
that you can formulate some people say

7288
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:22,080
that you can formulate some people say
 

7289
02:05:22,080 --> 02:05:23,689
that you can formulate some people say
it's oversimplified but nevertheless

7290
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:23,699
it's oversimplified but nevertheless
 

7291
02:05:23,699 --> 02:05:26,089
it's oversimplified but nevertheless
here we are and we somehow haven't blown

7292
02:05:26,089 --> 02:05:26,099
here we are and we somehow haven't blown
 

7293
02:05:26,099 --> 02:05:29,450
here we are and we somehow haven't blown
ourselves up do you see a future where

7294
02:05:29,450 --> 02:05:29,460
ourselves up do you see a future where
 

7295
02:05:29,460 --> 02:05:31,189
ourselves up do you see a future where
this kind of

7296
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
this kind of
 

7297
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:34,250
this kind of
this kind of system can be used to help

7298
02:05:34,250 --> 02:05:34,260
this kind of system can be used to help
 

7299
02:05:34,260 --> 02:05:37,010
this kind of system can be used to help
us make decisions geopolitical decisions

7300
02:05:37,010 --> 02:05:37,020
us make decisions geopolitical decisions
 

7301
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:38,810
us make decisions geopolitical decisions
in the world

7302
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:38,820
in the world
 

7303
02:05:38,820 --> 02:05:40,729
in the world
well like I said the original motivation

7304
02:05:40,729 --> 02:05:40,739
well like I said the original motivation
 

7305
02:05:40,739 --> 02:05:42,470
well like I said the original motivation
for the game of diplomacy was the

7306
02:05:42,470 --> 02:05:42,480
for the game of diplomacy was the
 

7307
02:05:42,480 --> 02:05:44,750
for the game of diplomacy was the
failures of World War One The Diplomatic

7308
02:05:44,750 --> 02:05:44,760
failures of World War One The Diplomatic
 

7309
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:47,510
failures of World War One The Diplomatic
failures that led to War uh and the real

7310
02:05:47,510 --> 02:05:47,520
failures that led to War uh and the real
 

7311
02:05:47,520 --> 02:05:50,270
failures that led to War uh and the real
take-home message of diplomacy is that

7312
02:05:50,270 --> 02:05:50,280
take-home message of diplomacy is that
 

7313
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:53,089
take-home message of diplomacy is that
you know if people approach diplomacy

7314
02:05:53,089 --> 02:05:53,099
you know if people approach diplomacy
 

7315
02:05:53,099 --> 02:05:56,149
you know if people approach diplomacy
the right way then war is ultimately

7316
02:05:56,149 --> 02:05:56,159
the right way then war is ultimately
 

7317
02:05:56,159 --> 02:05:58,370
the right way then war is ultimately
unsuccessful

7318
02:05:58,370 --> 02:05:58,380
unsuccessful
 

7319
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,770
unsuccessful
um the way that I see at war is an

7320
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:00,780
um the way that I see at war is an
 

7321
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,089
um the way that I see at war is an
inherently negative sum game right

7322
02:06:02,089 --> 02:06:02,099
inherently negative sum game right
 

7323
02:06:02,099 --> 02:06:04,430
inherently negative sum game right
there's always a better outcome than War

7324
02:06:04,430 --> 02:06:04,440
there's always a better outcome than War
 

7325
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:07,729
there's always a better outcome than War
for all the parties involved and my hope

7326
02:06:07,729 --> 02:06:07,739
for all the parties involved and my hope
 

7327
02:06:07,739 --> 02:06:10,729
for all the parties involved and my hope
is that you know as AI progresses then

7328
02:06:10,729 --> 02:06:10,739
is that you know as AI progresses then
 

7329
02:06:10,739 --> 02:06:12,890
is that you know as AI progresses then
maybe this technology could be used to

7330
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:12,900
maybe this technology could be used to
 

7331
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:15,830
maybe this technology could be used to
help people make better decisions

7332
02:06:15,830 --> 02:06:15,840
help people make better decisions
 

7333
02:06:15,840 --> 02:06:18,050
help people make better decisions
um across the board and you know

7334
02:06:18,050 --> 02:06:18,060
um across the board and you know
 

7335
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:20,209
um across the board and you know
hopefully avoid negative some outcomes

7336
02:06:20,209 --> 02:06:20,219
hopefully avoid negative some outcomes
 

7337
02:06:20,219 --> 02:06:21,169
hopefully avoid negative some outcomes
like War

7338
02:06:21,169 --> 02:06:21,179
like War
 

7339
02:06:21,179 --> 02:06:23,570
like War
yeah I mean I just came back from

7340
02:06:23,570 --> 02:06:23,580
yeah I mean I just came back from
 

7341
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:27,229
yeah I mean I just came back from
Ukraine I'm going back there on deep

7342
02:06:27,229 --> 02:06:27,239
Ukraine I'm going back there on deep
 

7343
02:06:27,239 --> 02:06:28,790
Ukraine I'm going back there on deep
personal levels

7344
02:06:28,790 --> 02:06:28,800
personal levels
 

7345
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,050
personal levels
think a lot about

7346
02:06:32,050 --> 02:06:32,060
think a lot about
 

7347
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:35,209
think a lot about
how peace can be achieved and I'm a big

7348
02:06:35,209 --> 02:06:35,219
how peace can be achieved and I'm a big
 

7349
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:37,970
how peace can be achieved and I'm a big
believer in conversation or leaders

7350
02:06:37,970 --> 02:06:37,980
believer in conversation or leaders
 

7351
02:06:37,980 --> 02:06:38,930
believer in conversation or leaders
getting together and having

7352
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:38,940
getting together and having
 

7353
02:06:38,940 --> 02:06:40,729
getting together and having
conversations and trying to understand

7354
02:06:40,729 --> 02:06:40,739
conversations and trying to understand
 

7355
02:06:40,739 --> 02:06:42,410
conversations and trying to understand
each other

7356
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:42,420
each other
 

7357
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:44,390
each other
yeah it's fascinating to think um

7358
02:06:44,390 --> 02:06:44,400
yeah it's fascinating to think um
 

7359
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:46,310
yeah it's fascinating to think um
whether each one of those leaders can

7360
02:06:46,310 --> 02:06:46,320
whether each one of those leaders can
 

7361
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:49,010
whether each one of those leaders can
run a simulation ahead of time like if

7362
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:49,020
run a simulation ahead of time like if
 

7363
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:51,410
run a simulation ahead of time like if
I'm an

7364
02:06:51,410 --> 02:06:51,420
I'm an
 

7365
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:53,750
I'm an
what are the possible consequences if

7366
02:06:53,750 --> 02:06:53,760
what are the possible consequences if
 

7367
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:54,770
what are the possible consequences if
I'm nice what are the possible

7368
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:54,780
I'm nice what are the possible
 

7369
02:06:54,780 --> 02:06:56,689
I'm nice what are the possible
consequences

7370
02:06:56,689 --> 02:06:56,699
consequences
 

7371
02:06:56,699 --> 02:06:58,729
consequences
um my guess

7372
02:06:58,729 --> 02:06:58,739
um my guess
 

7373
02:06:58,739 --> 02:07:00,890
um my guess
is that if the president of the United

7374
02:07:00,890 --> 02:07:00,900
is that if the president of the United
 

7375
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:03,410
is that if the president of the United
States got together with uh

7376
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:03,420
States got together with uh
 

7377
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,250
States got together with uh
Vladimir zielinski and Vladimir Putin

7378
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:06,260
Vladimir zielinski and Vladimir Putin
 

7379
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:09,890
Vladimir zielinski and Vladimir Putin
that there will be significant benefits

7380
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:09,900
that there will be significant benefits
 

7381
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:11,750
that there will be significant benefits
to

7382
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
to
 

7383
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:13,310
to
um the president United States not

7384
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:13,320
um the president United States not
 

7385
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:14,750
um the president United States not
having an ego

7386
02:07:14,750 --> 02:07:14,760
having an ego
 

7387
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:16,189
having an ego
of kind of

7388
02:07:16,189 --> 02:07:16,199
of kind of
 

7389
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:18,530
of kind of
playing down of giving away a lot of

7390
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:18,540
playing down of giving away a lot of
 

7391
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:22,430
playing down of giving away a lot of
chips for the future successful world so

7392
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:22,440
chips for the future successful world so
 

7393
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:24,050
chips for the future successful world so
giving a lot of power to the two

7394
02:07:24,050 --> 02:07:24,060
giving a lot of power to the two
 

7395
02:07:24,060 --> 02:07:26,330
giving a lot of power to the two
presidents of the competing Nations to

7396
02:07:26,330 --> 02:07:26,340
presidents of the competing Nations to
 

7397
02:07:26,340 --> 02:07:29,510
presidents of the competing Nations to
achieve peace that's my guess but it'd

7398
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
achieve peace that's my guess but it'd
 

7399
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:30,950
achieve peace that's my guess but it'd
be nice to run a bunch of simulations

7400
02:07:30,950 --> 02:07:30,960
be nice to run a bunch of simulations
 

7401
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:33,050
be nice to run a bunch of simulations
but then you have to have human data

7402
02:07:33,050 --> 02:07:33,060
but then you have to have human data
 

7403
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:34,910
but then you have to have human data
right you really because it's like the

7404
02:07:34,910 --> 02:07:34,920
right you really because it's like the
 

7405
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:36,530
right you really because it's like the
game of diplomacy is fundamentally

7406
02:07:36,530 --> 02:07:36,540
game of diplomacy is fundamentally
 

7407
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:38,810
game of diplomacy is fundamentally
different than geopolitics you need data

7408
02:07:38,810 --> 02:07:38,820
different than geopolitics you need data
 

7409
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:41,510
different than geopolitics you need data
you need like I guess that's the

7410
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,520
you need like I guess that's the
 

7411
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,550
you need like I guess that's the
question I have like how transferable is

7412
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:43,560
question I have like how transferable is
 

7413
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:46,129
question I have like how transferable is
this to uh like I don't know any kind of

7414
02:07:46,129 --> 02:07:46,139
this to uh like I don't know any kind of
 

7415
02:07:46,139 --> 02:07:48,649
this to uh like I don't know any kind of
negotiation right like to any kind of

7416
02:07:48,649 --> 02:07:48,659
negotiation right like to any kind of
 

7417
02:07:48,659 --> 02:07:50,629
negotiation right like to any kind of
look some local I don't know a bunch of

7418
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
look some local I don't know a bunch of
 

7419
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:53,930
look some local I don't know a bunch of
lawyers like arguing like at a divorce

7420
02:07:53,930 --> 02:07:53,940
lawyers like arguing like at a divorce
 

7421
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:56,030
lawyers like arguing like at a divorce
like divorce lawyers like how

7422
02:07:56,030 --> 02:07:56,040
like divorce lawyers like how
 

7423
02:07:56,040 --> 02:07:57,830
like divorce lawyers like how
transferable this all kinds of human

7424
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:57,840
transferable this all kinds of human
 

7425
02:07:57,840 --> 02:07:59,990
transferable this all kinds of human
negotiation well I feel like this isn't

7426
02:07:59,990 --> 02:08:00,000
negotiation well I feel like this isn't
 

7427
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,669
negotiation well I feel like this isn't
a question that's unique to diplomacy I

7428
02:08:01,669 --> 02:08:01,679
a question that's unique to diplomacy I
 

7429
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:03,410
a question that's unique to diplomacy I
mean I think you look at RL

7430
02:08:03,410 --> 02:08:03,420
mean I think you look at RL
 

7431
02:08:03,420 --> 02:08:04,729
mean I think you look at RL
breakthroughs reinforcement learning

7432
02:08:04,729 --> 02:08:04,739
breakthroughs reinforcement learning
 

7433
02:08:04,739 --> 02:08:06,290
breakthroughs reinforcement learning
breakthroughs in previous games as well

7434
02:08:06,290 --> 02:08:06,300
breakthroughs in previous games as well
 

7435
02:08:06,300 --> 02:08:08,390
breakthroughs in previous games as well
like you know AI for Starcraft AI for

7436
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:08,400
like you know AI for Starcraft AI for
 

7437
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,370
like you know AI for Starcraft AI for
Atari you haven't really seen it

7438
02:08:10,370 --> 02:08:10,380
Atari you haven't really seen it
 

7439
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:12,770
Atari you haven't really seen it
deployed in the real world because you

7440
02:08:12,770 --> 02:08:12,780
deployed in the real world because you
 

7441
02:08:12,780 --> 02:08:14,629
deployed in the real world because you
have these problems of it's really hard

7442
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
have these problems of it's really hard
 

7443
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:16,609
have these problems of it's really hard
to collect a lot of data

7444
02:08:16,609 --> 02:08:16,619
to collect a lot of data
 

7445
02:08:16,619 --> 02:08:20,270
to collect a lot of data
um and you don't have a you don't have a

7446
02:08:20,270 --> 02:08:20,280
um and you don't have a you don't have a
 

7447
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:21,770
um and you don't have a you don't have a
well-defined action space you don't have

7448
02:08:21,770 --> 02:08:21,780
well-defined action space you don't have
 

7449
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:23,930
well-defined action space you don't have
a well-defined reward function these are

7450
02:08:23,930 --> 02:08:23,940
a well-defined reward function these are
 

7451
02:08:23,940 --> 02:08:26,089
a well-defined reward function these are
all things that you really need for

7452
02:08:26,089 --> 02:08:26,099
all things that you really need for
 

7453
02:08:26,099 --> 02:08:27,950
all things that you really need for
reinforcement learning and planning to

7454
02:08:27,950 --> 02:08:27,960
reinforcement learning and planning to
 

7455
02:08:27,960 --> 02:08:30,290
reinforcement learning and planning to
be really successful today now there are

7456
02:08:30,290 --> 02:08:30,300
be really successful today now there are
 

7457
02:08:30,300 --> 02:08:32,810
be really successful today now there are
some domains where you do have that

7458
02:08:32,810 --> 02:08:32,820
some domains where you do have that
 

7459
02:08:32,820 --> 02:08:34,810
some domains where you do have that
um code generation is one example

7460
02:08:34,810 --> 02:08:34,820
um code generation is one example
 

7461
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:36,830
um code generation is one example
theorem proving mathematics that's

7462
02:08:36,830 --> 02:08:36,840
theorem proving mathematics that's
 

7463
02:08:36,840 --> 02:08:38,089
theorem proving mathematics that's
another example where you have a

7464
02:08:38,089 --> 02:08:38,099
another example where you have a
 

7465
02:08:38,099 --> 02:08:39,350
another example where you have a
well-defined action space you have a

7466
02:08:39,350 --> 02:08:39,360
well-defined action space you have a
 

7467
02:08:39,360 --> 02:08:41,990
well-defined action space you have a
well-defined reward function and those

7468
02:08:41,990 --> 02:08:42,000
well-defined reward function and those
 

7469
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,609
well-defined reward function and those
are the kinds of domains where I can see

7470
02:08:43,609 --> 02:08:43,619
are the kinds of domains where I can see
 

7471
02:08:43,619 --> 02:08:46,370
are the kinds of domains where I can see
RL in the short term being incredibly

7472
02:08:46,370 --> 02:08:46,380
RL in the short term being incredibly
 

7473
02:08:46,380 --> 02:08:49,070
RL in the short term being incredibly
powerful but

7474
02:08:49,070 --> 02:08:49,080
powerful but
 

7475
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:51,229
powerful but
yeah I think that those are the barriers

7476
02:08:51,229 --> 02:08:51,239
yeah I think that those are the barriers
 

7477
02:08:51,239 --> 02:08:53,149
yeah I think that those are the barriers
to deploying this at scale in the real

7478
02:08:53,149 --> 02:08:53,159
to deploying this at scale in the real
 

7479
02:08:53,159 --> 02:08:55,129
to deploying this at scale in the real
world but and the hope is that in the

7480
02:08:55,129 --> 02:08:55,139
world but and the hope is that in the
 

7481
02:08:55,139 --> 02:08:57,410
world but and the hope is that in the
long run we'll be able to get there yeah

7482
02:08:57,410 --> 02:08:57,420
long run we'll be able to get there yeah
 

7483
02:08:57,420 --> 02:08:59,990
long run we'll be able to get there yeah
but you see diplomacy feels like closer

7484
02:08:59,990 --> 02:09:00,000
but you see diplomacy feels like closer
 

7485
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:01,850
but you see diplomacy feels like closer
to the real world than does Starcraft

7486
02:09:01,850 --> 02:09:01,860
to the real world than does Starcraft
 

7487
02:09:01,860 --> 02:09:04,370
to the real world than does Starcraft
like because it's natural language right

7488
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:04,380
like because it's natural language right
 

7489
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:06,229
like because it's natural language right
you're operating in a space of intense

7490
02:09:06,229 --> 02:09:06,239
you're operating in a space of intense
 

7491
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:07,910
you're operating in a space of intense
and in a space of natural language that

7492
02:09:07,910 --> 02:09:07,920
and in a space of natural language that
 

7493
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:09,890
and in a space of natural language that
feels very close to the real world and

7494
02:09:09,890 --> 02:09:09,900
feels very close to the real world and
 

7495
02:09:09,900 --> 02:09:12,050
feels very close to the real world and
it also feels like you could get data on

7496
02:09:12,050 --> 02:09:12,060
it also feels like you could get data on
 

7497
02:09:12,060 --> 02:09:14,570
it also feels like you could get data on
that from the internet

7498
02:09:14,570 --> 02:09:14,580
that from the internet
 

7499
02:09:14,580 --> 02:09:16,250
that from the internet
yeah and that's why I do think that

7500
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:16,260
yeah and that's why I do think that
 

7501
02:09:16,260 --> 02:09:19,850
yeah and that's why I do think that
diplomacy is taking a big step closer to

7502
02:09:19,850 --> 02:09:19,860
diplomacy is taking a big step closer to
 

7503
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:21,229
diplomacy is taking a big step closer to
the real world than anything that's came

02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:37,850
communication from a breadth of the
internet

7520
02:09:37,850 --> 02:09:37,860
internet
 

7521
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:39,709
internet
um that is that is a big step in that

7522
02:09:39,709 --> 02:09:39,719
um that is that is a big step in that
 

7523
02:09:39,719 --> 02:09:42,290
um that is that is a big step in that
direction we're not 100 there but um but

7524
02:09:42,290 --> 02:09:42,300
direction we're not 100 there but um but
 

7525
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:43,910
direction we're not 100 there but um but
we're getting closer at least

7526
02:09:43,910 --> 02:09:43,920
we're getting closer at least
 

7527
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:45,890
we're getting closer at least
so if we actually return back to Poker

7528
02:09:45,890 --> 02:09:45,900
so if we actually return back to Poker
 

7529
02:09:45,900 --> 02:09:48,470
so if we actually return back to Poker
and chess are some of the ideas that

7530
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:48,480
and chess are some of the ideas that
 

7531
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:49,790
and chess are some of the ideas that
you're learning here with diplomacy

7532
02:09:49,790 --> 02:09:49,800
you're learning here with diplomacy
 

7533
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:53,209
you're learning here with diplomacy
could you construct AI systems that play

7534
02:09:53,209 --> 02:09:53,219
could you construct AI systems that play
 

7535
02:09:53,219 --> 02:09:54,890
could you construct AI systems that play
like humans

7536
02:09:54,890 --> 02:09:54,900
like humans
 

7537
02:09:54,900 --> 02:09:58,490
like humans
like um make for a fun opponent

7538
02:09:58,490 --> 02:09:58,500
like um make for a fun opponent
 

7539
02:09:58,500 --> 02:10:01,129
like um make for a fun opponent
in a game with Jess yeah absolutely

7540
02:10:01,129 --> 02:10:01,139
in a game with Jess yeah absolutely
 

7541
02:10:01,139 --> 02:10:02,570
in a game with Jess yeah absolutely
we've already started looking into this

7542
02:10:02,570 --> 02:10:02,580
we've already started looking into this
 

7543
02:10:02,580 --> 02:10:04,490
we've already started looking into this
direction a bit so we tried to use the

7544
02:10:04,490 --> 02:10:04,500
direction a bit so we tried to use the
 

7545
02:10:04,500 --> 02:10:05,689
direction a bit so we tried to use the
techniques that we've developed for

7546
02:10:05,689 --> 02:10:05,699
techniques that we've developed for
 

7547
02:10:05,699 --> 02:10:08,810
techniques that we've developed for
diplomacy uh to make chess and go AIS

7548
02:10:08,810 --> 02:10:08,820
diplomacy uh to make chess and go AIS
 

7549
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:11,870
diplomacy uh to make chess and go AIS
and what we found is that it led to much

7550
02:10:11,870 --> 02:10:11,880
and what we found is that it led to much
 

7551
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:14,510
and what we found is that it led to much
more human-like strong chess and go

7552
02:10:14,510 --> 02:10:14,520
more human-like strong chess and go
 

7553
02:10:14,520 --> 02:10:17,330
more human-like strong chess and go
players the way that

7554
02:10:17,330 --> 02:10:17,340
players the way that
 

7555
02:10:17,340 --> 02:10:20,450
players the way that
AIS like stockfish today play is in a

7556
02:10:20,450 --> 02:10:20,460
AIS like stockfish today play is in a
 

7557
02:10:20,460 --> 02:10:22,729
AIS like stockfish today play is in a
very inhuman style it's very strong but

7558
02:10:22,729 --> 02:10:22,739
very inhuman style it's very strong but
 

7559
02:10:22,739 --> 02:10:24,950
very inhuman style it's very strong but
it's very different from how humans play

7560
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:24,960
it's very different from how humans play
 

7561
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,290
it's very different from how humans play
and so we can take the techniques that

7562
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:27,300
and so we can take the techniques that
 

7563
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:28,729
and so we can take the techniques that
we've developed for diplomacy we do

7564
02:10:28,729 --> 02:10:28,739
we've developed for diplomacy we do
 

7565
02:10:28,739 --> 02:10:31,930
we've developed for diplomacy we do
something similar in um in chess and go

7566
02:10:31,930 --> 02:10:31,940
something similar in um in chess and go
 

7567
02:10:31,940 --> 02:10:34,729
something similar in um in chess and go
and we end up with the bot that's both

7568
02:10:34,729 --> 02:10:34,739
and we end up with the bot that's both
 

7569
02:10:34,739 --> 02:10:37,850
and we end up with the bot that's both
strong and human-like

7570
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:37,860
strong and human-like
 

7571
02:10:37,860 --> 02:10:40,490
strong and human-like
um to elaborate on this a bit like one

7572
02:10:40,490 --> 02:10:40,500
um to elaborate on this a bit like one
 

7573
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,490
um to elaborate on this a bit like one
way to approach making a human-like AI

7574
02:10:43,490 --> 02:10:43,500
way to approach making a human-like AI
 

7575
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:47,149
way to approach making a human-like AI
for chess is to collect a bunch of human

7576
02:10:47,149 --> 02:10:47,159
for chess is to collect a bunch of human
 

7577
02:10:47,159 --> 02:10:48,830
for chess is to collect a bunch of human
games like a bunch of human Grand Master

7578
02:10:48,830 --> 02:10:48,840
games like a bunch of human Grand Master
 

7579
02:10:48,840 --> 02:10:51,050
games like a bunch of human Grand Master
games and just do supervised learning on

7580
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:51,060
games and just do supervised learning on
 

7581
02:10:51,060 --> 02:10:53,510
games and just do supervised learning on
those games but the problem is that if

7582
02:10:53,510 --> 02:10:53,520
those games but the problem is that if
 

7583
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,490
those games but the problem is that if
you do that what you end up with is an

7584
02:10:55,490 --> 02:10:55,500
you do that what you end up with is an
 

7585
02:10:55,500 --> 02:10:57,830
you do that what you end up with is an
AI That's substantially weaker than the

7586
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:57,840
AI That's substantially weaker than the
 

7587
02:10:57,840 --> 02:10:59,149
AI That's substantially weaker than the
human Grand Masters that you've trained

7588
02:10:59,149 --> 02:10:59,159
human Grand Masters that you've trained
 

7589
02:10:59,159 --> 02:11:02,450
human Grand Masters that you've trained
on because the neural net is not able to

7590
02:11:02,450 --> 02:11:02,460
on because the neural net is not able to
 

7591
02:11:02,460 --> 02:11:05,089
on because the neural net is not able to
approximate the the Nuance of the

7592
02:11:05,089 --> 02:11:05,099
approximate the the Nuance of the
 

7593
02:11:05,099 --> 02:11:07,550
approximate the the Nuance of the
strategy this goes back to the planning

7594
02:11:07,550 --> 02:11:07,560
strategy this goes back to the planning
 

7595
02:11:07,560 --> 02:11:09,169
strategy this goes back to the planning
thing that I mentioned the search thing

7596
02:11:09,169 --> 02:11:09,179
thing that I mentioned the search thing
 

7597
02:11:09,179 --> 02:11:11,450
thing that I mentioned the search thing
that I talked about before that these

7598
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:11,460
that I talked about before that these
 

7599
02:11:11,460 --> 02:11:12,649
that I talked about before that these
human Grand Masters when they're playing

7600
02:11:12,649 --> 02:11:12,659
human Grand Masters when they're playing
 

7601
02:11:12,659 --> 02:11:14,570
human Grand Masters when they're playing
they're using search and they're using

7602
02:11:14,570 --> 02:11:14,580
they're using search and they're using
 

7603
02:11:14,580 --> 02:11:17,990
they're using search and they're using
planning and the neural net alone unless

7604
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
planning and the neural net alone unless
 

7605
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,550
planning and the neural net alone unless
you have a massive neural net that's

7606
02:11:19,550 --> 02:11:19,560
you have a massive neural net that's
 

7607
02:11:19,560 --> 02:11:20,870
you have a massive neural net that's
like a thousand times bigger than what

7608
02:11:20,870 --> 02:11:20,880
like a thousand times bigger than what
 

7609
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:23,350
like a thousand times bigger than what
we have right now it's not able to

7610
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:23,360
we have right now it's not able to
 

7611
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:25,129
we have right now it's not able to
approximate those details very

7612
02:11:25,129 --> 02:11:25,139
approximate those details very
 

7613
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:26,390
approximate those details very
effectively

7614
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:26,400
effectively
 

7615
02:11:26,400 --> 02:11:30,050
effectively
and on the other hand you can leverage

7616
02:11:30,050 --> 02:11:30,060
and on the other hand you can leverage
 

7617
02:11:30,060 --> 02:11:32,689
and on the other hand you can leverage
search and planning very heavily but

7618
02:11:32,689 --> 02:11:32,699
search and planning very heavily but
 

7619
02:11:32,699 --> 02:11:34,490
search and planning very heavily but
then what you end up with is an AI that

7620
02:11:34,490 --> 02:11:34,500
then what you end up with is an AI that
 

7621
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:36,169
then what you end up with is an AI that
plays in a very different style from how

7622
02:11:36,169 --> 02:11:36,179
plays in a very different style from how
 

7623
02:11:36,179 --> 02:11:37,609
plays in a very different style from how
humans play the game

7624
02:11:37,609 --> 02:11:37,619
humans play the game
 

7625
02:11:37,619 --> 02:11:39,770
humans play the game
now if you strike this intermediate

7626
02:11:39,770 --> 02:11:39,780
now if you strike this intermediate
 

7627
02:11:39,780 --> 02:11:41,930
now if you strike this intermediate
balance by setting the um the

7628
02:11:41,930 --> 02:11:41,940
balance by setting the um the
 

7629
02:11:41,940 --> 02:11:43,430
balance by setting the um the
regularization parameters correctly and

7630
02:11:43,430 --> 02:11:43,440
regularization parameters correctly and
 

7631
02:11:43,440 --> 02:11:45,109
regularization parameters correctly and
say you can do planning but try to keep

7632
02:11:45,109 --> 02:11:45,119
say you can do planning but try to keep
 

7633
02:11:45,119 --> 02:11:47,450
say you can do planning but try to keep
it close to the human policy then you

7634
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:47,460
it close to the human policy then you
 

7635
02:11:47,460 --> 02:11:50,390
it close to the human policy then you
end up with an AI that plays in both a

7636
02:11:50,390 --> 02:11:50,400
end up with an AI that plays in both a
 

7637
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,629
end up with an AI that plays in both a
very human-like style and a very strong

7638
02:11:52,629 --> 02:11:52,639
very human-like style and a very strong
 

7639
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:55,669
very human-like style and a very strong
style and you can actually even tune it

7640
02:11:55,669 --> 02:11:55,679
style and you can actually even tune it
 

7641
02:11:55,679 --> 02:11:58,729
style and you can actually even tune it
to have a certain ELO rating so you can

7642
02:11:58,729 --> 02:11:58,739
to have a certain ELO rating so you can
 

7643
02:11:58,739 --> 02:12:00,649
to have a certain ELO rating so you can
say play in the style of like a 2800

7644
02:12:00,649 --> 02:12:00,659
say play in the style of like a 2800
 

7645
02:12:00,659 --> 02:12:02,390
say play in the style of like a 2800
elohuman

7646
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:02,400
elohuman
 

7647
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:04,070
elohuman
um I wonder if you could do specific

7648
02:12:04,070 --> 02:12:04,080
um I wonder if you could do specific
 

7649
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:06,169
um I wonder if you could do specific
type of humans or categories of humans

7650
02:12:06,169 --> 02:12:06,179
type of humans or categories of humans
 

7651
02:12:06,179 --> 02:12:09,350
type of humans or categories of humans
so not just skill but Style

7652
02:12:09,350 --> 02:12:09,360
so not just skill but Style
 

7653
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:11,450
so not just skill but Style
yeah I think so and so this is this is

7654
02:12:11,450 --> 02:12:11,460
yeah I think so and so this is this is
 

7655
02:12:11,460 --> 02:12:13,790
yeah I think so and so this is this is
where the the research gets interesting

7656
02:12:13,790 --> 02:12:13,800
where the the research gets interesting
 

7657
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:15,649
where the the research gets interesting
like you know one of the things that I

7658
02:12:15,649 --> 02:12:15,659
like you know one of the things that I
 

7659
02:12:15,659 --> 02:12:17,330
like you know one of the things that I
was thinking about is and this is

7660
02:12:17,330 --> 02:12:17,340
was thinking about is and this is
 

7661
02:12:17,340 --> 02:12:18,410
was thinking about is and this is
actually already being done I think

7662
02:12:18,410 --> 02:12:18,420
actually already being done I think
 

7663
02:12:18,420 --> 02:12:19,310
actually already being done I think
there's a researcher at the University

7664
02:12:19,310 --> 02:12:19,320
there's a researcher at the University
 

7665
02:12:19,320 --> 02:12:21,649
there's a researcher at the University
of Toronto that's working on this

7666
02:12:21,649 --> 02:12:21,659
of Toronto that's working on this
 

7667
02:12:21,659 --> 02:12:23,570
of Toronto that's working on this
um is to make an ad that plays in the

7668
02:12:23,570 --> 02:12:23,580
um is to make an ad that plays in the
 

7669
02:12:23,580 --> 02:12:26,209
um is to make an ad that plays in the
style of a particular player like Magnus

7670
02:12:26,209 --> 02:12:26,219
style of a particular player like Magnus
 

7671
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:27,890
style of a particular player like Magnus
Carlson for example you can make an AI

7672
02:12:27,890 --> 02:12:27,900
Carlson for example you can make an AI
 

7673
02:12:27,900 --> 02:12:30,050
Carlson for example you can make an AI
that plays like Magnus Carlson and then

7674
02:12:30,050 --> 02:12:30,060
that plays like Magnus Carlson and then
 

7675
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:31,310
that plays like Magnus Carlson and then
where I think this gets interesting is

7676
02:12:31,310 --> 02:12:31,320
where I think this gets interesting is
 

7677
02:12:31,320 --> 02:12:32,990
where I think this gets interesting is
like maybe you're up against Magnus

7678
02:12:32,990 --> 02:12:33,000
like maybe you're up against Magnus
 

7679
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,490
like maybe you're up against Magnus
Carlson in the world championship or

7680
02:12:34,490 --> 02:12:34,500
Carlson in the world championship or
 

7681
02:12:34,500 --> 02:12:36,950
Carlson in the world championship or
something you can play against this

7682
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:36,960
something you can play against this
 

7683
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:38,990
something you can play against this
Magnus Carlson bot to prepare against

7684
02:12:38,990 --> 02:12:39,000
Magnus Carlson bot to prepare against
 

7685
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,149
Magnus Carlson bot to prepare against
the real Magnus Carlson and you can try

7686
02:12:41,149 --> 02:12:41,159
the real Magnus Carlson and you can try
 

7687
02:12:41,159 --> 02:12:43,609
the real Magnus Carlson and you can try
to explore strategies that he might

7688
02:12:43,609 --> 02:12:43,619
to explore strategies that he might
 

7689
02:12:43,619 --> 02:12:45,169
to explore strategies that he might
struggle with

7690
02:12:45,169 --> 02:12:45,179
struggle with
 

7691
02:12:45,179 --> 02:12:46,550
struggle with
um and try to figure out like how do you

7692
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:46,560
um and try to figure out like how do you
 

7693
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:49,010
um and try to figure out like how do you
beat this player in particular

7694
02:12:49,010 --> 02:12:49,020
beat this player in particular
 

7695
02:12:49,020 --> 02:12:50,330
beat this player in particular
um on the other hand you can also have

7696
02:12:50,330 --> 02:12:50,340
um on the other hand you can also have
 

7697
02:12:50,340 --> 02:12:52,129
um on the other hand you can also have
Magnus Carlson working with this bot to

7698
02:12:52,129 --> 02:12:52,139
Magnus Carlson working with this bot to
 

7699
02:12:52,139 --> 02:12:54,290
Magnus Carlson working with this bot to
try to figure out where he's weak um and

7700
02:12:54,290 --> 02:12:54,300
try to figure out where he's weak um and
 

7701
02:12:54,300 --> 02:12:57,169
try to figure out where he's weak um and
where he needs to improve his strategy

7702
02:12:57,169 --> 02:12:57,179
where he needs to improve his strategy
 

7703
02:12:57,179 --> 02:12:59,229
where he needs to improve his strategy
um and so I can Envision this future

7704
02:12:59,229 --> 02:12:59,239
um and so I can Envision this future
 

7705
02:12:59,239 --> 02:13:03,290
um and so I can Envision this future
where data on specific chess and go

7706
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:03,300
where data on specific chess and go
 

7707
02:13:03,300 --> 02:13:04,669
where data on specific chess and go
players becomes extremely valuable

7708
02:13:04,669 --> 02:13:04,679
players becomes extremely valuable
 

7709
02:13:04,679 --> 02:13:06,890
players becomes extremely valuable
because you can use that data to create

7710
02:13:06,890 --> 02:13:06,900
because you can use that data to create
 

7711
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:09,109
because you can use that data to create
specific models of how these particular

7712
02:13:09,109 --> 02:13:09,119
specific models of how these particular
 

7713
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,510
specific models of how these particular
players play so increasingly human-like

7714
02:13:11,510 --> 02:13:11,520
players play so increasingly human-like
 

7715
02:13:11,520 --> 02:13:13,689
players play so increasingly human-like
behavior and Bots however

7716
02:13:13,689 --> 02:13:13,699
behavior and Bots however
 

7717
02:13:13,699 --> 02:13:17,089
behavior and Bots however
as you've mentioned makes cheating cheat

7718
02:13:17,089 --> 02:13:17,099
as you've mentioned makes cheating cheat
 

7719
02:13:17,099 --> 02:13:20,030
as you've mentioned makes cheating cheat
detection much harder it it does yeah

7720
02:13:20,030 --> 02:13:20,040
detection much harder it it does yeah
 

7721
02:13:20,040 --> 02:13:22,609
detection much harder it it does yeah
the way that sheet detection Works in a

7722
02:13:22,609 --> 02:13:22,619
the way that sheet detection Works in a
 

7723
02:13:22,619 --> 02:13:24,890
the way that sheet detection Works in a
game like poker and a game like chess

7724
02:13:24,890 --> 02:13:24,900
game like poker and a game like chess
 

7725
02:13:24,900 --> 02:13:27,229
game like poker and a game like chess
and go from what I understand is trying

7726
02:13:27,229 --> 02:13:27,239
and go from what I understand is trying
 

7727
02:13:27,239 --> 02:13:30,290
and go from what I understand is trying
to see like is this person making moves

7728
02:13:30,290 --> 02:13:30,300
to see like is this person making moves
 

7729
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:34,310
to see like is this person making moves
that are very common among chess AIS or

7730
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:34,320
that are very common among chess AIS or
 

7731
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:36,350
that are very common among chess AIS or
you know AIS in general

7732
02:13:36,350 --> 02:13:36,360
you know AIS in general
 

7733
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:39,530
you know AIS in general
um but very uncommon among top human

7734
02:13:39,530 --> 02:13:39,540
um but very uncommon among top human
 

7735
02:13:39,540 --> 02:13:40,490
um but very uncommon among top human
players

7736
02:13:40,490 --> 02:13:40,500
players
 

7737
02:13:40,500 --> 02:13:43,609
players
and if you have the development of these

7738
02:13:43,609 --> 02:13:43,619
and if you have the development of these
 

7739
02:13:43,619 --> 02:13:46,609
and if you have the development of these
AIS that play in a very strong style but

7740
02:13:46,609 --> 02:13:46,619
AIS that play in a very strong style but
 

7741
02:13:46,619 --> 02:13:48,890
AIS that play in a very strong style but
also a very human-like style then that

7742
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:48,900
also a very human-like style then that
 

7743
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:50,629
also a very human-like style then that
poses serious challenges for cheat

7744
02:13:50,629 --> 02:13:50,639
poses serious challenges for cheat
 

7745
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:53,270
poses serious challenges for cheat
detection and it makes you now ask

7746
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:53,280
detection and it makes you now ask
 

7747
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,890
detection and it makes you now ask
yourself a hard question about what is

7748
02:13:54,890 --> 02:13:54,900
yourself a hard question about what is
 

7749
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:57,530
yourself a hard question about what is
the role of AI systems as they become

7750
02:13:57,530 --> 02:13:57,540
the role of AI systems as they become
 

7751
02:13:57,540 --> 02:13:59,689
the role of AI systems as they become
more and more integrated in our society

7752
02:13:59,689 --> 02:13:59,699
more and more integrated in our society
 

7753
02:13:59,699 --> 02:14:03,109
more and more integrated in our society
and this kind of human AI

7754
02:14:03,109 --> 02:14:03,119
and this kind of human AI
 

7755
02:14:03,119 --> 02:14:03,770
and this kind of human AI
um

7756
02:14:03,770 --> 02:14:03,780
um
 

7757
02:14:03,780 --> 02:14:07,729
um
integration has has some deep ethical

7758
02:14:07,729 --> 02:14:07,739
integration has has some deep ethical
 

7759
02:14:07,739 --> 02:14:10,069
integration has has some deep ethical
issues that we should be aware of and

7760
02:14:10,069 --> 02:14:10,079
issues that we should be aware of and
 

7761
02:14:10,079 --> 02:14:11,510
issues that we should be aware of and
also it's a kind of cyber security

7762
02:14:11,510 --> 02:14:11,520
also it's a kind of cyber security
 

7763
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:14,810
also it's a kind of cyber security
challenge right for to make you know one

7764
02:14:14,810 --> 02:14:14,820
challenge right for to make you know one
 

7765
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:16,310
challenge right for to make you know one
of the assumptions we have when we play

7766
02:14:16,310 --> 02:14:16,320
of the assumptions we have when we play
 

7767
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:18,470
of the assumptions we have when we play
games is that there's a trust that is

7768
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,480
games is that there's a trust that is
 

7769
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:22,370
games is that there's a trust that is
only humans involved and there

7770
02:14:22,370 --> 02:14:22,380
only humans involved and there
 

7771
02:14:22,380 --> 02:14:25,129
only humans involved and there
the better AI systems to create which

7772
02:14:25,129 --> 02:14:25,139
the better AI systems to create which
 

7773
02:14:25,139 --> 02:14:27,169
the better AI systems to create which
makes it super exciting human-like AI

7774
02:14:27,169 --> 02:14:27,179
makes it super exciting human-like AI
 

7775
02:14:27,179 --> 02:14:28,790
makes it super exciting human-like AI
systems with different styles of humans

7776
02:14:28,790 --> 02:14:28,800
systems with different styles of humans
 

7777
02:14:28,800 --> 02:14:31,010
systems with different styles of humans
is really exciting but then we have to

7778
02:14:31,010 --> 02:14:31,020
is really exciting but then we have to
 

7779
02:14:31,020 --> 02:14:32,930
is really exciting but then we have to
have the defenses better and better and

7780
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:32,940
have the defenses better and better and
 

7781
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:36,169
have the defenses better and better and
better if we're to trust that we uh can

7782
02:14:36,169 --> 02:14:36,179
better if we're to trust that we uh can
 

7783
02:14:36,179 --> 02:14:39,470
better if we're to trust that we uh can
enjoy human versus human game in a

7784
02:14:39,470 --> 02:14:39,480
enjoy human versus human game in a
 

7785
02:14:39,480 --> 02:14:42,050
enjoy human versus human game in a
deeply Fair way it's fascinating so it's

7786
02:14:42,050 --> 02:14:42,060
deeply Fair way it's fascinating so it's
 

7787
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:45,709
deeply Fair way it's fascinating so it's
just uh it's humbling yeah I think there

7788
02:14:45,709 --> 02:14:45,719
just uh it's humbling yeah I think there
 

7789
02:14:45,719 --> 02:14:47,390
just uh it's humbling yeah I think there
is a lot of like negative potential for

7790
02:14:47,390 --> 02:14:47,400
is a lot of like negative potential for
 

7791
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,370
is a lot of like negative potential for
this kind of Technology but you know at

7792
02:14:49,370 --> 02:14:49,380
this kind of Technology but you know at
 

7793
02:14:49,380 --> 02:14:50,629
this kind of Technology but you know at
the same time there's a lot of upside

7794
02:14:50,629 --> 02:14:50,639
the same time there's a lot of upside
 

7795
02:14:50,639 --> 02:14:53,149
the same time there's a lot of upside
for it as well so you know for example

7796
02:14:53,149 --> 02:14:53,159
for it as well so you know for example
 

7797
02:14:53,159 --> 02:14:55,189
for it as well so you know for example
right now it's really hard to learn how

7798
02:14:55,189 --> 02:14:55,199
right now it's really hard to learn how
 

7799
02:14:55,199 --> 02:14:57,050
right now it's really hard to learn how
to get better in games like chess and

7800
02:14:57,050 --> 02:14:57,060
to get better in games like chess and
 

7801
02:14:57,060 --> 02:14:59,810
to get better in games like chess and
poker and go because the way that the AI

7802
02:14:59,810 --> 02:14:59,820
poker and go because the way that the AI
 

7803
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:01,790
poker and go because the way that the AI
plays is so foreign and incomprehensible

7804
02:15:01,790 --> 02:15:01,800
plays is so foreign and incomprehensible
 

7805
02:15:01,800 --> 02:15:03,950
plays is so foreign and incomprehensible
but if you have these AIS that are

7806
02:15:03,950 --> 02:15:03,960
but if you have these AIS that are
 

7807
02:15:03,960 --> 02:15:05,689
but if you have these AIS that are
playing you know you can say like Oh I'm

7808
02:15:05,689 --> 02:15:05,699
playing you know you can say like Oh I'm
 

7809
02:15:05,699 --> 02:15:07,850
playing you know you can say like Oh I'm
a 2000 ELO human how do I get to 2200

7810
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:07,860
a 2000 ELO human how do I get to 2200
 

7811
02:15:07,860 --> 02:15:10,729
a 2000 ELO human how do I get to 2200
now you can have an AI that plays in the

7812
02:15:10,729 --> 02:15:10,739
now you can have an AI that plays in the
 

7813
02:15:10,739 --> 02:15:13,010
now you can have an AI that plays in the
style of a 2200 elohiman and that will

7814
02:15:13,010 --> 02:15:13,020
style of a 2200 elohiman and that will
 

7815
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:15,890
style of a 2200 elohiman and that will
help you get better or you know you

7816
02:15:15,890 --> 02:15:15,900
help you get better or you know you
 

7817
02:15:15,900 --> 02:15:17,209
help you get better or you know you
mentioned this problem of like how do

7818
02:15:17,209 --> 02:15:17,219
mentioned this problem of like how do
 

7819
02:15:17,219 --> 02:15:18,770
mentioned this problem of like how do
you know that you're actually playing

7820
02:15:18,770 --> 02:15:18,780
you know that you're actually playing
 

7821
02:15:18,780 --> 02:15:20,270
you know that you're actually playing
with humans when you're playing like

7822
02:15:20,270 --> 02:15:20,280
with humans when you're playing like
 

7823
02:15:20,280 --> 02:15:22,790
with humans when you're playing like
online in video games well now we have

7824
02:15:22,790 --> 02:15:22,800
online in video games well now we have
 

7825
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:25,430
online in video games well now we have
the potential of populating these like

7826
02:15:25,430 --> 02:15:25,440
the potential of populating these like
 

7827
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,950
the potential of populating these like
Virtual Worlds with

7828
02:15:27,950 --> 02:15:27,960
Virtual Worlds with
 

7829
02:15:27,960 --> 02:15:29,870
Virtual Worlds with
um agents like AI agents that are

7830
02:15:29,870 --> 02:15:29,880
um agents like AI agents that are
 

7831
02:15:29,880 --> 02:15:31,250
um agents like AI agents that are
actually fun to play with and you don't

7832
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:31,260
actually fun to play with and you don't
 

7833
02:15:31,260 --> 02:15:33,410
actually fun to play with and you don't
have to always be playing with other

7834
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:33,420
have to always be playing with other
 

7835
02:15:33,420 --> 02:15:36,169
have to always be playing with other
humans to to you know have a fun time

7836
02:15:36,169 --> 02:15:36,179
humans to to you know have a fun time
 

7837
02:15:36,179 --> 02:15:38,450
humans to to you know have a fun time
so yeah a lot a lot of upside potential

7838
02:15:38,450 --> 02:15:38,460
so yeah a lot a lot of upside potential
 

7839
02:15:38,460 --> 02:15:40,129
so yeah a lot a lot of upside potential
too and I think you know with any sort

7840
02:15:40,129 --> 02:15:40,139
too and I think you know with any sort
 

7841
02:15:40,139 --> 02:15:41,930
too and I think you know with any sort
of tool there's there's the potential

7842
02:15:41,930 --> 02:15:41,940
of tool there's there's the potential
 

7843
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:43,669
of tool there's there's the potential
for a lot of greatness and a lot of uh

7844
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
for a lot of greatness and a lot of uh
 

7845
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,890
for a lot of greatness and a lot of uh
downsides as well so in the paper they

7846
02:15:45,890 --> 02:15:45,900
downsides as well so in the paper they
 

7847
02:15:45,900 --> 02:15:47,750
downsides as well so in the paper they
got a chance to look at there's a

7848
02:15:47,750 --> 02:15:47,760
got a chance to look at there's a
 

7849
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:50,209
got a chance to look at there's a
section on uh ethical considerations

7850
02:15:50,209 --> 02:15:50,219
section on uh ethical considerations
 

7851
02:15:50,219 --> 02:15:52,129
section on uh ethical considerations
what's in that section what are some

7852
02:15:52,129 --> 02:15:52,139
what's in that section what are some
 

7853
02:15:52,139 --> 02:15:54,109
what's in that section what are some
ethical considerations here is it some

7854
02:15:54,109 --> 02:15:54,119
ethical considerations here is it some
 

7855
02:15:54,119 --> 02:15:55,609
ethical considerations here is it some
of the stuff we've already talked about

7856
02:15:55,609 --> 02:15:55,619
of the stuff we've already talked about
 

7857
02:15:55,619 --> 02:15:56,629
of the stuff we've already talked about
there's some things that we've already

7858
02:15:56,629 --> 02:15:56,639
there's some things that we've already
 

7859
02:15:56,639 --> 02:15:57,589
there's some things that we've already
talked about

7860
02:15:57,589 --> 02:15:57,599
talked about
 

7861
02:15:57,599 --> 02:15:58,609
talked about
um I think

7862
02:15:58,609 --> 02:15:58,619
um I think
 

7863
02:15:58,619 --> 02:16:01,550
um I think
specific to diplomacy you know there's

7864
02:16:01,550 --> 02:16:01,560
specific to diplomacy you know there's
 

7865
02:16:01,560 --> 02:16:03,830
specific to diplomacy you know there's
there's also the the challenge that the

7866
02:16:03,830 --> 02:16:03,840
there's also the the challenge that the
 

7867
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,850
there's also the the challenge that the
game is

7868
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:04,860
game is
 

7869
02:16:04,860 --> 02:16:06,530
game is
you know there is a deception aspect to

7870
02:16:06,530 --> 02:16:06,540
you know there is a deception aspect to
 

7871
02:16:06,540 --> 02:16:07,550
you know there is a deception aspect to
the game

7872
02:16:07,550 --> 02:16:07,560
the game
 

7873
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,930
the game
um and so

7874
02:16:08,930 --> 02:16:08,940
um and so
 

7875
02:16:08,940 --> 02:16:11,510
um and so
you know have developing language models

7876
02:16:11,510 --> 02:16:11,520
you know have developing language models
 

7877
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,609
you know have developing language models
that are capable of deception is I think

7878
02:16:13,609 --> 02:16:13,619
that are capable of deception is I think
 

7879
02:16:13,619 --> 02:16:16,250
that are capable of deception is I think
a dicey issue and something that you

7880
02:16:16,250 --> 02:16:16,260
a dicey issue and something that you
 

7881
02:16:16,260 --> 02:16:17,750
a dicey issue and something that you
know makes research on diplomacy

7882
02:16:17,750 --> 02:16:17,760
know makes research on diplomacy
 

7883
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:19,609
know makes research on diplomacy
particularly challenging

7884
02:16:19,609 --> 02:16:19,619
particularly challenging
 

7885
02:16:19,619 --> 02:16:21,890
particularly challenging
um and

7886
02:16:21,890 --> 02:16:21,900
um and
 

7887
02:16:21,900 --> 02:16:23,870
um and
you know so so those kinds of issues of

7888
02:16:23,870 --> 02:16:23,880
you know so so those kinds of issues of
 

7889
02:16:23,880 --> 02:16:25,970
you know so so those kinds of issues of
like should we even be developing AIS

7890
02:16:25,970 --> 02:16:25,980
like should we even be developing AIS
 

7891
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,109
like should we even be developing AIS
that are capable of lying to people

7892
02:16:27,109 --> 02:16:27,119
that are capable of lying to people
 

7893
02:16:27,119 --> 02:16:28,850
that are capable of lying to people
that's something that we have to you

7894
02:16:28,850 --> 02:16:28,860
that's something that we have to you
 

7895
02:16:28,860 --> 02:16:30,890
that's something that we have to you
know think carefully about uh that's so

7896
02:16:30,890 --> 02:16:30,900
know think carefully about uh that's so
 

7897
02:16:30,900 --> 02:16:32,270
know think carefully about uh that's so
cool I mean that you have to do that

7898
02:16:32,270 --> 02:16:32,280
cool I mean that you have to do that
 

7899
02:16:32,280 --> 02:16:33,830
cool I mean that you have to do that
kind of stuff in order to figure out

7900
02:16:33,830 --> 02:16:33,840
kind of stuff in order to figure out
 

7901
02:16:33,840 --> 02:16:35,629
kind of stuff in order to figure out
where the ethical lines are but I can

7902
02:16:35,629 --> 02:16:35,639
where the ethical lines are but I can
 

7903
02:16:35,639 --> 02:16:37,490
where the ethical lines are but I can
see in the future it being illegal to

7904
02:16:37,490 --> 02:16:37,500
see in the future it being illegal to
 

7905
02:16:37,500 --> 02:16:40,849
see in the future it being illegal to
have a consumer product that

7906
02:16:40,849 --> 02:16:40,859
have a consumer product that
 

7907
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:42,410
have a consumer product that
lies

7908
02:16:42,410 --> 02:16:42,420
lies
 

7909
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:45,290
lies
yeah yeah like your personal assistant

7910
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:45,300
yeah yeah like your personal assistant
 

7911
02:16:45,300 --> 02:16:47,690
yeah yeah like your personal assistant
AI system is not a lot is always have to

7912
02:16:47,690 --> 02:16:47,700
AI system is not a lot is always have to
 

7913
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:50,270
AI system is not a lot is always have to
tell the truth but if if I ask it do I

7914
02:16:50,270 --> 02:16:50,280
tell the truth but if if I ask it do I
 

7915
02:16:50,280 --> 02:16:52,669
tell the truth but if if I ask it do I
do I look did I get fatter over the past

7916
02:16:52,669 --> 02:16:52,679
do I look did I get fatter over the past
 

7917
02:16:52,679 --> 02:16:55,009
do I look did I get fatter over the past
month I sure as hell want that AI system

7918
02:16:55,009 --> 02:16:55,019
month I sure as hell want that AI system
 

7919
02:16:55,019 --> 02:16:58,310
month I sure as hell want that AI system
to lie to me uh so there's a trade-off

7920
02:16:58,310 --> 02:16:58,320
to lie to me uh so there's a trade-off
 

7921
02:16:58,320 --> 02:17:00,610
to lie to me uh so there's a trade-off
between lying and being and being nice

7922
02:17:00,610 --> 02:17:00,620
between lying and being and being nice
 

7923
02:17:00,620 --> 02:17:03,250
between lying and being and being nice
after somehow find

7924
02:17:03,250 --> 02:17:03,260
after somehow find
 

7925
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,270
after somehow find
where's the ethics in that and we're

7926
02:17:05,270 --> 02:17:05,280
where's the ethics in that and we're
 

7927
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,250
where's the ethics in that and we're
back to discussions inside relationships

7928
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:07,260
back to discussions inside relationships
 

7929
02:17:07,260 --> 02:17:08,929
back to discussions inside relationships
anyway what were you saying oh yeah I

7930
02:17:08,929 --> 02:17:08,939
anyway what were you saying oh yeah I
 

7931
02:17:08,939 --> 02:17:10,250
anyway what were you saying oh yeah I
was getting like yeah this yeah that's

7932
02:17:10,250 --> 02:17:10,260
was getting like yeah this yeah that's
 

7933
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:11,509
was getting like yeah this yeah that's
kind of going to the question of like

7934
02:17:11,509 --> 02:17:11,519
kind of going to the question of like
 

7935
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:12,950
kind of going to the question of like
what what is a lot you know is a white

7936
02:17:12,950 --> 02:17:12,960
what what is a lot you know is a white
 

7937
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:15,230
what what is a lot you know is a white
lie a bad lie is it an ethical lie yeah

7938
02:17:15,230 --> 02:17:15,240
lie a bad lie is it an ethical lie yeah
 

7939
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:18,290
lie a bad lie is it an ethical lie yeah
you know those kinds of questions uh boy

7940
02:17:18,290 --> 02:17:18,300
you know those kinds of questions uh boy
 

7941
02:17:18,300 --> 02:17:21,169
you know those kinds of questions uh boy
we return time and time again to deep

7942
02:17:21,169 --> 02:17:21,179
we return time and time again to deep
 

7943
02:17:21,179 --> 02:17:23,389
we return time and time again to deep
human questions as we design AI systems

7944
02:17:23,389 --> 02:17:23,399
human questions as we design AI systems
 

7945
02:17:23,399 --> 02:17:24,950
human questions as we design AI systems
that's exactly what they do they put a

7946
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:24,960
that's exactly what they do they put a
 

7947
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:27,589
that's exactly what they do they put a
mirror to humanity to help us understand

7948
02:17:27,589 --> 02:17:27,599
mirror to humanity to help us understand
 

7949
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:28,849
mirror to humanity to help us understand
ourselves

7950
02:17:28,849 --> 02:17:28,859
ourselves
 

7951
02:17:28,859 --> 02:17:30,889
ourselves
there's there's also the issue of like

7952
02:17:30,889 --> 02:17:30,899
there's there's also the issue of like
 

7953
02:17:30,899 --> 02:17:32,509
there's there's also the issue of like
you know in these diplomacy experiments

7954
02:17:32,509 --> 02:17:32,519
you know in these diplomacy experiments
 

7955
02:17:32,519 --> 02:17:34,250
you know in these diplomacy experiments
in order to do

7956
02:17:34,250 --> 02:17:34,260
in order to do
 

7957
02:17:34,260 --> 02:17:36,290
in order to do
a fair comparison you know what we found

7958
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:36,300
a fair comparison you know what we found
 

7959
02:17:36,300 --> 02:17:39,650
a fair comparison you know what we found
is that there's an inherent anti-ai bias

7960
02:17:39,650 --> 02:17:39,660
is that there's an inherent anti-ai bias
 

7961
02:17:39,660 --> 02:17:41,509
is that there's an inherent anti-ai bias
in these kinds of games so we actually

7962
02:17:41,509 --> 02:17:41,519
in these kinds of games so we actually
 

7963
02:17:41,519 --> 02:17:43,910
in these kinds of games so we actually
played a tournament in a non-language

7964
02:17:43,910 --> 02:17:43,920
played a tournament in a non-language
 

7965
02:17:43,920 --> 02:17:45,950
played a tournament in a non-language
version of the game where you know we we

7966
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:45,960
version of the game where you know we we
 

7967
02:17:45,960 --> 02:17:47,509
version of the game where you know we we
told the participants like hey in every

7968
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:47,519
told the participants like hey in every
 

7969
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:48,950
told the participants like hey in every
single game there's going to be an AI

7970
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
single game there's going to be an AI
 

7971
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:51,469
single game there's going to be an AI
and what we found is that the humans

7972
02:17:51,469 --> 02:17:51,479
and what we found is that the humans
 

7973
02:17:51,479 --> 02:17:53,570
and what we found is that the humans
would spend basically the entire game

7974
02:17:53,570 --> 02:17:53,580
would spend basically the entire game
 

7975
02:17:53,580 --> 02:17:54,770
would spend basically the entire game
like trying to figure out who the bot

7976
02:17:54,770 --> 02:17:54,780
like trying to figure out who the bot
 

7977
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:55,849
like trying to figure out who the bot
was and then as soon as they thought

7978
02:17:55,849 --> 02:17:55,859
was and then as soon as they thought
 

7979
02:17:55,859 --> 02:17:57,110
was and then as soon as they thought
they figured it out they would all team

7980
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
they figured it out they would all team
 

7981
02:17:57,120 --> 02:17:58,969
they figured it out they would all team
up and try to kill it

7982
02:17:58,969 --> 02:17:58,979
up and try to kill it
 

7983
02:17:58,979 --> 02:18:02,690
up and try to kill it
um and you know overcoming that inherent

7984
02:18:02,690 --> 02:18:02,700
um and you know overcoming that inherent
 

7985
02:18:02,700 --> 02:18:05,990
um and you know overcoming that inherent
anti-ai bias is is a challenge um on the

7986
02:18:05,990 --> 02:18:06,000
anti-ai bias is is a challenge um on the
 

7987
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,370
anti-ai bias is is a challenge um on the
flip side

7988
02:18:07,370 --> 02:18:07,380
flip side
 

7989
02:18:07,380 --> 02:18:11,089
flip side
I think when robots become the enemy

7990
02:18:11,089 --> 02:18:11,099
I think when robots become the enemy
 

7991
02:18:11,099 --> 02:18:13,490
I think when robots become the enemy
that's when we get to heal our human

7992
02:18:13,490 --> 02:18:13,500
that's when we get to heal our human
 

7993
02:18:13,500 --> 02:18:17,089
that's when we get to heal our human
divisions and then we can become one as

7994
02:18:17,089 --> 02:18:17,099
divisions and then we can become one as
 

7995
02:18:17,099 --> 02:18:18,830
divisions and then we can become one as
long as we have one enemy it's it's that

7996
02:18:18,830 --> 02:18:18,840
long as we have one enemy it's it's that
 

7997
02:18:18,840 --> 02:18:20,929
long as we have one enemy it's it's that
Reagan thing when aliens show up that's

7998
02:18:20,929 --> 02:18:20,939
Reagan thing when aliens show up that's
 

7999
02:18:20,939 --> 02:18:22,910
Reagan thing when aliens show up that's
when we we put our side our divisions

8000
02:18:22,910 --> 02:18:22,920
when we we put our side our divisions
 

8001
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:25,610
when we we put our side our divisions
we've become one one human species right

8002
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:25,620
we've become one one human species right
 

8003
02:18:25,620 --> 02:18:26,870
we've become one one human species right
you might have our differences but we're

8004
02:18:26,870 --> 02:18:26,880
you might have our differences but we're
 

8005
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:29,389
you might have our differences but we're
at least all human at least we all hate

8006
02:18:29,389 --> 02:18:29,399
at least all human at least we all hate
 

8007
02:18:29,399 --> 02:18:32,330
at least all human at least we all hate
the robots no no no I think there will

8008
02:18:32,330 --> 02:18:32,340
the robots no no no I think there will
 

8009
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:33,650
the robots no no no I think there will
be actually in the future something like

8010
02:18:33,650 --> 02:18:33,660
be actually in the future something like
 

8011
02:18:33,660 --> 02:18:35,750
be actually in the future something like
a civil rights movement for robots I

8012
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
a civil rights movement for robots I
 

8013
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,070
a civil rights movement for robots I
think that's the fascinating things

8014
02:18:37,070 --> 02:18:37,080
think that's the fascinating things
 

8015
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:40,070
think that's the fascinating things
about AI systems and is they ask they

8016
02:18:40,070 --> 02:18:40,080
about AI systems and is they ask they
 

8017
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:42,290
about AI systems and is they ask they
force us to ask about

8018
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:42,300
force us to ask about
 

8019
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:44,270
force us to ask about
ethical questions about what is

8020
02:18:44,270 --> 02:18:44,280
ethical questions about what is
 

8021
02:18:44,280 --> 02:18:46,429
ethical questions about what is
sentience what is uh how do we feel

8022
02:18:46,429 --> 02:18:46,439
sentience what is uh how do we feel
 

8023
02:18:46,439 --> 02:18:47,870
sentience what is uh how do we feel
about systems that are capable of

8024
02:18:47,870 --> 02:18:47,880
about systems that are capable of
 

8025
02:18:47,880 --> 02:18:49,370
about systems that are capable of
suffering or capable of displaying

8026
02:18:49,370 --> 02:18:49,380
suffering or capable of displaying
 

8027
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:52,070
suffering or capable of displaying
suffering and how do we design products

8028
02:18:52,070 --> 02:18:52,080
suffering and how do we design products
 

8029
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:54,410
suffering and how do we design products
that show emotion and not how do we feel

8030
02:18:54,410 --> 02:18:54,420
that show emotion and not how do we feel
 

8031
02:18:54,420 --> 02:18:57,410
that show emotion and not how do we feel
about that lying is another topic are we

8032
02:18:57,410 --> 02:18:57,420
about that lying is another topic are we
 

8033
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:00,589
about that lying is another topic are we
going to allow Bots to lie and not and

8034
02:19:00,589 --> 02:19:00,599
going to allow Bots to lie and not and
 

8035
02:19:00,599 --> 02:19:02,450
going to allow Bots to lie and not and
where's the balance between being nice

8036
02:19:02,450 --> 02:19:02,460
where's the balance between being nice
 

8037
02:19:02,460 --> 02:19:05,209
where's the balance between being nice
and and telling the truth I mean these

8038
02:19:05,209 --> 02:19:05,219
and and telling the truth I mean these
 

8039
02:19:05,219 --> 02:19:07,370
and and telling the truth I mean these
are all fascinating human questions it's

8040
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:07,380
are all fascinating human questions it's
 

8041
02:19:07,380 --> 02:19:09,310
are all fascinating human questions it's
like so exciting to be in the century

8042
02:19:09,310 --> 02:19:09,320
like so exciting to be in the century
 

8043
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:12,770
like so exciting to be in the century
when we create systems that

8044
02:19:12,770 --> 02:19:12,780
when we create systems that
 

8045
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:15,349
when we create systems that
take these philosophical questions that

8046
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
take these philosophical questions that
 

8047
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,929
take these philosophical questions that
have been asked for centuries and now we

8048
02:19:17,929 --> 02:19:17,939
have been asked for centuries and now we
 

8049
02:19:17,939 --> 02:19:20,509
have been asked for centuries and now we
can engineer them inside systems where

8050
02:19:20,509 --> 02:19:20,519
can engineer them inside systems where
 

8051
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:22,370
can engineer them inside systems where
like you really have to answer them

8052
02:19:22,370 --> 02:19:22,380
like you really have to answer them
 

8053
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:23,870
like you really have to answer them
because you'll have

8054
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:23,880
because you'll have
 

8055
02:19:23,880 --> 02:19:26,629
because you'll have
transformational impact on human society

8056
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:26,639
transformational impact on human society
 

8057
02:19:26,639 --> 02:19:29,270
transformational impact on human society
depending on what you design inside

8058
02:19:29,270 --> 02:19:29,280
depending on what you design inside
 

8059
02:19:29,280 --> 02:19:32,089
depending on what you design inside
those systems it's fascinating and like

8060
02:19:32,089 --> 02:19:32,099
those systems it's fascinating and like
 

8061
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:34,070
those systems it's fascinating and like

02:20:41,750 --> 02:20:41,760
you know there's a lot of people trying
 

8123
02:20:41,760 --> 02:20:43,309
you know there's a lot of people trying
to figure that out right now

8124
02:20:43,309 --> 02:20:43,319
to figure that out right now
 

8125
02:20:43,319 --> 02:20:44,929
to figure that out right now
um and you know I should say like the

8126
02:20:44,929 --> 02:20:44,939
um and you know I should say like the
 

8127
02:20:44,939 --> 02:20:46,370
um and you know I should say like the
amount of progress that's been made

8128
02:20:46,370 --> 02:20:46,380
amount of progress that's been made
 

8129
02:20:46,380 --> 02:20:48,050
amount of progress that's been made
especially in the past few years is

8130
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:48,060
especially in the past few years is
 

8131
02:20:48,060 --> 02:20:50,030
especially in the past few years is
truly phenomenal I mean you look at

8132
02:20:50,030 --> 02:20:50,040
truly phenomenal I mean you look at
 

8133
02:20:50,040 --> 02:20:53,030
truly phenomenal I mean you look at
where AI was 10 years ago and the idea

8134
02:20:53,030 --> 02:20:53,040
where AI was 10 years ago and the idea
 

8135
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:54,410
where AI was 10 years ago and the idea
that you could have AIS that can

8136
02:20:54,410 --> 02:20:54,420
that you could have AIS that can
 

8137
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:56,030
that you could have AIS that can
generate language and generate images

8138

generate language and generate images
 

8139
02:20:56,040 --> 02:20:58,309
generate language and generate images
the way they're doing today and able to

8140
02:20:58,309 --> 02:20:58,319
the way they're doing today and able to
 

8141
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:00,410
the way they're doing today and able to
play a game like diplomacy was just like

8142
02:21:00,410 --> 02:21:00,420
play a game like diplomacy was just like
 

8143
02:21:00,420 --> 02:21:01,790

um even even five years ago let alone

8146
02:21:03,770 --> 02:21:03,780
um even even five years ago let alone
 

8147
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:05,630
um even even five years ago let alone
ten years ago

8148
02:21:05,630 --> 02:21:05,640
ten years ago
 

8149
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:06,830
ten years ago
um

8150
02:21:06,830 --> 02:21:06,840
um
 

8151
02:21:06,840 --> 02:21:09,410
um
now there are there are aspects of AI

8152
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:09,420
now there are there are aspects of AI
 

8153
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:12,110
now there are there are aspects of AI
that I think are still lacking um

8154
02:21:12,110 --> 02:21:12,120
that I think are still lacking um
 

8155
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:15,770
that I think are still lacking um
I think there's General agreements that

8156
02:21:15,770 --> 02:21:15,780
I think there's General agreements that
 

8157
02:21:15,780 --> 02:21:17,809
I think there's General agreements that
one of the major issues with AI today is

8158
02:21:17,809 --> 02:21:17,819
one of the major issues with AI today is
 

8159
02:21:17,819 --> 02:21:19,490
one of the major issues with AI today is
that it's very data inefficient it's

8160
02:21:19,490 --> 02:21:19,500
that it's very data inefficient it's
 

8161
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:22,250
that it's very data inefficient it's
very it requires a huge number of

8162
02:21:22,250 --> 02:21:22,260
very it requires a huge number of
 

8163
02:21:22,260 --> 02:21:24,650
very it requires a huge number of
samples of training examples to be able

8164
02:21:24,650 --> 02:21:24,660
samples of training examples to be able
 

8165
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:26,389
samples of training examples to be able
to train you know you look at an AI that

8166
02:21:26,389 --> 02:21:26,399
to train you know you look at an AI that
 

8167
02:21:26,399 --> 02:21:29,030
to train you know you look at an AI that
plays go and it needs millions of games

8168
02:21:29,030 --> 02:21:29,040
plays go and it needs millions of games
 

8169
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:31,309
plays go and it needs millions of games
of go to uh to learn how to play the

8170
02:21:31,309 --> 02:21:31,319
of go to uh to learn how to play the
 

8171
02:21:31,319 --> 02:21:33,349
of go to uh to learn how to play the
game well whereas a human can pick it up

8172
02:21:33,349 --> 02:21:33,359
game well whereas a human can pick it up
 

8173
02:21:33,359 --> 02:21:34,910
game well whereas a human can pick it up
in like you know I don't know how many

8174
02:21:34,910 --> 02:21:34,920
in like you know I don't know how many
 

8175
02:21:34,920 --> 02:21:37,070
in like you know I don't know how many
games does a human go player go go Grand

8176
02:21:37,070 --> 02:21:37,080
games does a human go player go go Grand
 

8177
02:21:37,080 --> 02:21:39,170
games does a human go player go go Grand
Master play in their lifetime probably

8178
02:21:39,170 --> 02:21:39,180
Master play in their lifetime probably
 

8179
02:21:39,180 --> 02:21:41,870
Master play in their lifetime probably
you know in the thousands or tens of

8180
02:21:41,870 --> 02:21:41,880
you know in the thousands or tens of
 

8181
02:21:41,880 --> 02:21:43,790
you know in the thousands or tens of
thousands I guess

8182
02:21:43,790 --> 02:21:43,800
thousands I guess
 

8183
02:21:43,800 --> 02:21:44,870
thousands I guess
um

8184
02:21:44,870 --> 02:21:44,880
um
 

8185
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:46,730
um
so that's that's one issue overcome

8186
02:21:46,730 --> 02:21:46,740
so that's that's one issue overcome
 

8187
02:21:46,740 --> 02:21:48,170
so that's that's one issue overcome
efficiency overcoming this challenge of

8188
02:21:48,170 --> 02:21:48,180
efficiency overcoming this challenge of
 

8189
02:21:48,180 --> 02:21:49,670
efficiency overcoming this challenge of
data efficiency and this is particularly

8190
02:21:49,670 --> 02:21:49,680
data efficiency and this is particularly
 

8191
02:21:49,680 --> 02:21:52,130
data efficiency and this is particularly
important if we want to deploy AI

8192
02:21:52,130 --> 02:21:52,140
important if we want to deploy AI
 

8193
02:21:52,140 --> 02:21:55,309
important if we want to deploy AI
systems in real world settings

8194
02:21:55,309 --> 02:21:55,319
systems in real world settings
 

8195
02:21:55,319 --> 02:21:56,510
systems in real world settings
um where they're interacting with humans

8196
02:21:56,510 --> 02:21:56,520
um where they're interacting with humans
 

8197
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:57,650
um where they're interacting with humans
because you know for example with

8198
02:21:57,650 --> 02:21:57,660
because you know for example with
 

8199
02:21:57,660 --> 02:22:00,050
because you know for example with
robotics it's really hard to generate a

8200
02:22:00,050 --> 02:22:00,060
robotics it's really hard to generate a
 

8201
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:02,270
robotics it's really hard to generate a
huge number of samples it's it's a

8202
02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:02,280
huge number of samples it's it's a
 

8203
02:22:02,280 --> 02:22:03,770
huge number of samples it's it's a
different story when you're working in

8204
02:22:03,770 --> 02:22:03,780
different story when you're working in
 

8205
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:05,990
different story when you're working in
these you know totally virtual games

8206
02:22:05,990 --> 02:22:06,000
these you know totally virtual games
 

8207
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:07,490
these you know totally virtual games
where you can play a million games and

8208
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:07,500
where you can play a million games and
 

8209
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:09,410
where you can play a million games and
it's no big deal I was planning on just

8210
02:22:09,410 --> 02:22:09,420
it's no big deal I was planning on just
 

8211
02:22:09,420 --> 02:22:10,849
it's no big deal I was planning on just
launching like a thousand of these

8212
02:22:10,849 --> 02:22:10,859
launching like a thousand of these
 

8213
02:22:10,859 --> 02:22:12,950
launching like a thousand of these
robots in Austin I don't think it's

8214
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:12,960
robots in Austin I don't think it's
 

8215
02:22:12,960 --> 02:22:15,230
robots in Austin I don't think it's
illegal for Lego robots to roam the

8216
02:22:15,230 --> 02:22:15,240
illegal for Lego robots to roam the
 

8217
02:22:15,240 --> 02:22:17,389
illegal for Lego robots to roam the
streets and just collect data that's not

8218
02:22:17,389 --> 02:22:17,399
streets and just collect data that's not
 

8219
02:22:17,399 --> 02:22:18,469
streets and just collect data that's not
of course the worst that could happen

8220
02:22:18,469 --> 02:22:18,479
of course the worst that could happen
 

8221
02:22:18,479 --> 02:22:20,270
of course the worst that could happen
yeah I kind of I mean that's one way to

8222
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:20,280
yeah I kind of I mean that's one way to
 

8223
02:22:20,280 --> 02:22:21,889
yeah I kind of I mean that's one way to
overcome the data efficiency problem is

8224
02:22:21,889 --> 02:22:21,899
overcome the data efficiency problem is
 

8225
02:22:21,899 --> 02:22:24,889
overcome the data efficiency problem is
like scale it yeah like I actually tried

8226
02:22:24,889 --> 02:22:24,899
like scale it yeah like I actually tried
 

8227
02:22:24,899 --> 02:22:27,469
like scale it yeah like I actually tried
to see if there's a law against robots

8228
02:22:27,469 --> 02:22:27,479
to see if there's a law against robots
 

8229
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:30,590
to see if there's a law against robots
like Lego robots just operating

8230
02:22:30,590 --> 02:22:30,600
like Lego robots just operating
 

8231
02:22:30,600 --> 02:22:32,990
like Lego robots just operating
in in this in the streets of a major

8232
02:22:32,990 --> 02:22:33,000
in in this in the streets of a major
 

8233
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:35,030
in in this in the streets of a major
city and there isn't I couldn't find any

8234
02:22:35,030 --> 02:22:35,040
city and there isn't I couldn't find any
 

8235
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:36,889
city and there isn't I couldn't find any
so

8236
02:22:36,889 --> 02:22:36,899
so
 

8237
02:22:36,899 --> 02:22:38,090
so
um I'll take it all the way to the

8238
02:22:38,090 --> 02:22:38,100
um I'll take it all the way to the
 

8239
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:39,710
um I'll take it all the way to the
Supreme Court

8240
02:22:39,710 --> 02:22:39,720
Supreme Court
 

8241
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:42,050
Supreme Court
robot rights okay anyway sorry you were

8242
02:22:42,050 --> 02:22:42,060
robot rights okay anyway sorry you were
 

8243
02:22:42,060 --> 02:22:45,170
robot rights okay anyway sorry you were
saying so the so what what are the ideas

8244
02:22:45,170 --> 02:22:45,180
saying so the so what what are the ideas
 

8245
02:22:45,180 --> 02:22:47,150
saying so the so what what are the ideas
for getting becoming more data efficient

8246
02:22:47,150 --> 02:22:47,160
for getting becoming more data efficient
 

8247
02:22:47,160 --> 02:22:49,670
for getting becoming more data efficient
uh I mean that's that's the trillion

8248
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:49,680
uh I mean that's that's the trillion
 

8249
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:51,230
uh I mean that's that's the trillion
dollar question in AI today I mean if

8250
02:22:51,230 --> 02:22:51,240
dollar question in AI today I mean if
 

8251
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:52,490
dollar question in AI today I mean if
you can figure out how to make AI

8252
02:22:52,490 --> 02:22:52,500
you can figure out how to make AI
 

8253
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:54,830
you can figure out how to make AI
systems more more data efficient then

8254
02:22:54,830 --> 02:22:54,840
systems more more data efficient then
 

8255
02:22:54,840 --> 02:22:56,330
systems more more data efficient then
that's

8256
02:22:56,330 --> 02:22:56,340
that's
 

8257
02:22:56,340 --> 02:22:58,429
that's
a huge breakthrough so nobody really

8258
02:22:58,429 --> 02:22:58,439
a huge breakthrough so nobody really
 

8259
02:22:58,439 --> 02:23:00,170
a huge breakthrough so nobody really
knows right now it could be just a

8260
02:23:00,170 --> 02:23:00,180
knows right now it could be just a
 

8261
02:23:00,180 --> 02:23:02,210
knows right now it could be just a
gigantic background model language model

8262
02:23:02,210 --> 02:23:02,220
gigantic background model language model
 

8263
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:04,849
gigantic background model language model
and then you do

8264
02:23:04,849 --> 02:23:04,859
and then you do
 

8265
02:23:04,859 --> 02:23:06,710
and then you do
um the training becomes like prompting

8266
02:23:06,710 --> 02:23:06,720
um the training becomes like prompting
 

8267
02:23:06,720 --> 02:23:08,090
um the training becomes like prompting
that model

8268
02:23:08,090 --> 02:23:08,100
that model
 

8269
02:23:08,100 --> 02:23:09,830
that model
to uh

8270
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:09,840
to uh
 

8271
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:12,290
to uh
to essentially do a kind of querying a

8272
02:23:12,290 --> 02:23:12,300
to essentially do a kind of querying a
 

8273
02:23:12,300 --> 02:23:13,849
to essentially do a kind of querying a
search into the space of the things it's

8274
02:23:13,849 --> 02:23:13,859
search into the space of the things it's
 

8275
02:23:13,859 --> 02:23:16,130
search into the space of the things it's
learned to customize that to whatever

8276
02:23:16,130 --> 02:23:16,140
learned to customize that to whatever
 

8277
02:23:16,140 --> 02:23:17,929
learned to customize that to whatever
problem you're trying to solve so maybe

8278
02:23:17,929 --> 02:23:17,939
problem you're trying to solve so maybe
 

8279
02:23:17,939 --> 02:23:19,490
problem you're trying to solve so maybe
if you form a large enough language

8280
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:19,500
if you form a large enough language
 

8281
02:23:19,500 --> 02:23:21,710
if you form a large enough language
model you can go quite quite a long way

8282
02:23:21,710 --> 02:23:21,720
model you can go quite quite a long way
 

8283
02:23:21,720 --> 02:23:23,870
model you can go quite quite a long way
that you know I think there's some truth

8284
02:23:23,870 --> 02:23:23,880
that you know I think there's some truth
 

8285
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:25,130
that you know I think there's some truth
to that I mean you look at the way

8286
02:23:25,130 --> 02:23:25,140
to that I mean you look at the way
 

8287
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:26,750
to that I mean you look at the way
humans approach

8288
02:23:26,750 --> 02:23:26,760
humans approach
 

8289
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:28,370
humans approach
um a game like poker they're not coming

8290
02:23:28,370 --> 02:23:28,380
um a game like poker they're not coming
 

8291
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:30,290
um a game like poker they're not coming
at it from scratch they're coming at it

8292
02:23:30,290 --> 02:23:30,300
at it from scratch they're coming at it
 

8293
02:23:30,300 --> 02:23:31,849
at it from scratch they're coming at it
with a huge amount of background

8294
02:23:31,849 --> 02:23:31,859
with a huge amount of background
 

8295
02:23:31,859 --> 02:23:34,670
with a huge amount of background
knowledge about you know how humans work

8296
02:23:34,670 --> 02:23:34,680
knowledge about you know how humans work
 

8297
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:36,770
knowledge about you know how humans work
how the world Works

8298
02:23:36,770 --> 02:23:36,780
how the world Works
 

8299
02:23:36,780 --> 02:23:40,130
how the world Works
um the idea of money so they're able to

8300
02:23:40,130 --> 02:23:40,140
um the idea of money so they're able to
 

8301
02:23:40,140 --> 02:23:42,170
um the idea of money so they're able to
leverage that kind of information to uh

8302
02:23:42,170 --> 02:23:42,180
leverage that kind of information to uh
 

8303
02:23:42,180 --> 02:23:44,750
leverage that kind of information to uh
to to pick up the game faster uh so it's

8304
02:23:44,750 --> 02:23:44,760
to to pick up the game faster uh so it's
 

8305
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:46,429
to to pick up the game faster uh so it's
not really a fair comparison to then

8306
02:23:46,429 --> 02:23:46,439
not really a fair comparison to then
 

8307
02:23:46,439 --> 02:23:47,929
not really a fair comparison to then
compare it to an AI That's like learning

8308
02:23:47,929 --> 02:23:47,939
compare it to an AI That's like learning
 

8309
02:23:47,939 --> 02:23:49,250
compare it to an AI That's like learning
from scratch and maybe one of the ways

8310
02:23:49,250 --> 02:23:49,260
from scratch and maybe one of the ways
 

8311
02:23:49,260 --> 02:23:50,929
from scratch and maybe one of the ways
that we address this uh sample

8312
02:23:50,929 --> 02:23:50,939
that we address this uh sample
 

8313
02:23:50,939 --> 02:23:53,809
that we address this uh sample
complexity problem is by allowing AIS to

8314
02:23:53,809 --> 02:23:53,819
complexity problem is by allowing AIS to
 

8315
02:23:53,819 --> 02:23:55,490
complexity problem is by allowing AIS to
leverage that general knowledge across a

8316
02:23:55,490 --> 02:23:55,500
leverage that general knowledge across a
 

8317
02:23:55,500 --> 02:23:57,889
leverage that general knowledge across a
ton of different domains

8318
02:23:57,889 --> 02:23:57,899
ton of different domains
 

8319
02:23:57,899 --> 02:24:00,710
ton of different domains
so like I said you did uh a lot of

8320
02:24:00,710 --> 02:24:00,720
so like I said you did uh a lot of
 

8321
02:24:00,720 --> 02:24:02,870
so like I said you did uh a lot of
incredible work in the space of research

8322
02:24:02,870 --> 02:24:02,880
incredible work in the space of research
 

8323
02:24:02,880 --> 02:24:04,969
incredible work in the space of research
and actually Building Systems what

8324
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:04,979
and actually Building Systems what
 

8325
02:24:04,979 --> 02:24:06,830
and actually Building Systems what
advice would you give to uh let's start

8326
02:24:06,830 --> 02:24:06,840
advice would you give to uh let's start
 

8327
02:24:06,840 --> 02:24:08,929
advice would you give to uh let's start
with beginners what advice would you

8328
02:24:08,929 --> 02:24:08,939
with beginners what advice would you
 

8329
02:24:08,939 --> 02:24:10,849
with beginners what advice would you
give to beginners interested in machine

8330
02:24:10,849 --> 02:24:10,859
give to beginners interested in machine
 

8331
02:24:10,859 --> 02:24:13,309
give to beginners interested in machine
learning just there at the very start of

8332
02:24:13,309 --> 02:24:13,319
learning just there at the very start of
 

8333
02:24:13,319 --> 02:24:14,630
learning just there at the very start of
their Journey they're in high school and

8334
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:14,640
their Journey they're in high school and
 

8335
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,210
their Journey they're in high school and
college thinking like this seems like a

8336
02:24:17,210 --> 02:24:17,220
college thinking like this seems like a
 

8337
02:24:17,220 --> 02:24:19,250
college thinking like this seems like a
fascinating world what advice would you

8338
02:24:19,250 --> 02:24:19,260
fascinating world what advice would you
 

8339
02:24:19,260 --> 02:24:20,750
fascinating world what advice would you
give them

8340
02:24:20,750 --> 02:24:20,760
give them
 

8341
02:24:20,760 --> 02:24:22,969
give them
um I I would say

8342
02:24:22,969 --> 02:24:22,979
um I I would say
 

8343
02:24:22,979 --> 02:24:25,130
um I I would say
that there are a lot of people working

8344
02:24:25,130 --> 02:24:25,140
that there are a lot of people working
 

8345
02:24:25,140 --> 02:24:27,650
that there are a lot of people working
on similar aspects of machine learning

8346
02:24:27,650 --> 02:24:27,660
on similar aspects of machine learning
 

8347
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:30,230
on similar aspects of machine learning
and to not be afraid to try something a

8348
02:24:30,230 --> 02:24:30,240
and to not be afraid to try something a
 

8349
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:32,809
and to not be afraid to try something a
bit different my own path

8350
02:24:32,809 --> 02:24:32,819
bit different my own path
 

8351
02:24:32,819 --> 02:24:36,110
bit different my own path
in AI is pretty atypical for a machine

8352
02:24:36,110 --> 02:24:36,120
in AI is pretty atypical for a machine
 

8353
02:24:36,120 --> 02:24:38,030
in AI is pretty atypical for a machine
learning researcher today I mean I

8354
02:24:38,030 --> 02:24:38,040
learning researcher today I mean I
 

8355
02:24:38,040 --> 02:24:40,730
learning researcher today I mean I
started out working on Game Theory and

8356
02:24:40,730 --> 02:24:40,740
started out working on Game Theory and
 

8357
02:24:40,740 --> 02:24:43,070
started out working on Game Theory and
um and then shifting more towards

8358
02:24:43,070 --> 02:24:43,080
um and then shifting more towards
 

8359
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,570
um and then shifting more towards
reinforcement learning as time went on

8360
02:24:44,570 --> 02:24:44,580
reinforcement learning as time went on
 

8361
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:46,429
reinforcement learning as time went on
and that actually had a lot of benefits

8362
02:24:46,429 --> 02:24:46,439
and that actually had a lot of benefits
 

8363
02:24:46,439 --> 02:24:48,469
and that actually had a lot of benefits
I think because it allowed me to look at

8364
02:24:48,469 --> 02:24:48,479
I think because it allowed me to look at
 

8365
02:24:48,479 --> 02:24:49,849
I think because it allowed me to look at
these problems in a very different way

8366
02:24:49,849 --> 02:24:49,859
these problems in a very different way
 

8367
02:24:49,859 --> 02:24:52,610
these problems in a very different way
from the way a lot of machine learning

8368
02:24:52,610 --> 02:24:52,620
from the way a lot of machine learning
 

8369
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:57,230
from the way a lot of machine learning
researchers view it and that comes with

8370
02:24:57,230 --> 02:24:57,240
researchers view it and that comes with
 

8371
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:58,670
researchers view it and that comes with
um drawbacks in some respects like I

8372
02:24:58,670 --> 02:24:58,680
um drawbacks in some respects like I
 

8373
02:24:58,680 --> 02:24:59,690
um drawbacks in some respects like I
think there's definitely aspects of

8374
02:24:59,690 --> 02:24:59,700
think there's definitely aspects of
 

8375
02:24:59,700 --> 02:25:01,910
think there's definitely aspects of
machine learning where you know I'm

8376
02:25:01,910 --> 02:25:01,920
machine learning where you know I'm
 

8377
02:25:01,920 --> 02:25:04,130
machine learning where you know I'm
weaker than most of the researchers out

8378
02:25:04,130 --> 02:25:04,140
weaker than most of the researchers out
 

8379
02:25:04,140 --> 02:25:06,050
weaker than most of the researchers out
there but I think that diversity of

8380
02:25:06,050 --> 02:25:06,060
there but I think that diversity of
 

8381
02:25:06,060 --> 02:25:07,429
there but I think that diversity of
perspective

8382
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
perspective
 

8383
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:09,230
perspective
um you know when I'm working with my

8384
02:25:09,230 --> 02:25:09,240
um you know when I'm working with my
 

8385
02:25:09,240 --> 02:25:10,130
um you know when I'm working with my
teammates

8386
02:25:10,130 --> 02:25:10,140
teammates
 

8387
02:25:10,140 --> 02:25:10,969
teammates
um there's something that I'm bringing

8388
02:25:10,969 --> 02:25:10,979
um there's something that I'm bringing
 

8389
02:25:10,979 --> 02:25:11,870
um there's something that I'm bringing
to the table and there's something that

8390
02:25:11,870 --> 02:25:11,880
to the table and there's something that
 

8391
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:13,309
to the table and there's something that
they're bringing to the table and that

8392
02:25:13,309 --> 02:25:13,319
they're bringing to the table and that
 

8393
02:25:13,319 --> 02:25:14,389
they're bringing to the table and that
kind of collaboration becomes very

8394
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
kind of collaboration becomes very
 

8395
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:16,309
kind of collaboration becomes very
fruitful for that reason so there could

8396
02:25:16,309 --> 02:25:16,319
fruitful for that reason so there could
 

8397
02:25:16,319 --> 02:25:20,030
fruitful for that reason so there could
be problems like like poker like you've

8398
02:25:20,030 --> 02:25:20,040
be problems like like poker like you've
 

8399
02:25:20,040 --> 02:25:21,889
be problems like like poker like you've
chosen diplomacy that could be problems

8400
02:25:21,889 --> 02:25:21,899
chosen diplomacy that could be problems
 

8401
02:25:21,899 --> 02:25:23,630
chosen diplomacy that could be problems
like that still out there that you can

8402
02:25:23,630 --> 02:25:23,640
like that still out there that you can
 

8403
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:25,849
like that still out there that you can
just tackle even if it seems extremely

8404
02:25:25,849 --> 02:25:25,859
just tackle even if it seems extremely
 

8405
02:25:25,859 --> 02:25:28,370
just tackle even if it seems extremely
difficult

8406
02:25:28,370 --> 02:25:28,380

 

8407
02:25:28,380 --> 02:25:29,389

um I think that there's a lot of

8408
02:25:29,389 --> 02:25:29,399
um I think that there's a lot of
 

8409
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,010
um I think that there's a lot of
challenges challenges left and I think

8410
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:31,020
challenges challenges left and I think
 

8411
02:25:31,020 --> 02:25:35,030
challenges challenges left and I think
having a diversity of viewpoints and

8412
02:25:35,030 --> 02:25:35,040
having a diversity of viewpoints and
 

8413
02:25:35,040 --> 02:25:37,490
having a diversity of viewpoints and
backgrounds is really helpful for

8414
02:25:37,490 --> 02:25:37,500
backgrounds is really helpful for
 

8415
02:25:37,500 --> 02:25:39,290
backgrounds is really helpful for
working together to figure out how to

8416
02:25:39,290 --> 02:25:39,300
working together to figure out how to
 

8417
02:25:39,300 --> 02:25:41,210
working together to figure out how to
tackle those kinds of challenges so as a

8418
02:25:41,210 --> 02:25:41,220
tackle those kinds of challenges so as a
 

8419
02:25:41,220 --> 02:25:43,250
tackle those kinds of challenges so as a
beginner so that I would say that's

8420
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:43,260
beginner so that I would say that's
 

8421
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:46,190
beginner so that I would say that's
that's more for like a grad student they

8422
02:25:46,190 --> 02:25:46,200
that's more for like a grad student they
 

8423
02:25:46,200 --> 02:25:47,630
that's more for like a grad student they
already built up a base like a complete

8424
02:25:47,630 --> 02:25:47,640
already built up a base like a complete
 

8425
02:25:47,640 --> 02:25:49,670
already built up a base like a complete
beginner what's a good journey so for

8426
02:25:49,670 --> 02:25:49,680
beginner what's a good journey so for
 

8427
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:51,770
beginner what's a good journey so for
you that was doing some more on the math

8428
02:25:51,770 --> 02:25:51,780
you that was doing some more on the math
 

8429
02:25:51,780 --> 02:25:54,110
you that was doing some more on the math
side of things doing Game Theory all

8430
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:54,120
side of things doing Game Theory all
 

8431
02:25:54,120 --> 02:25:56,210
side of things doing Game Theory all
that good so it's basically build up a

8432
02:25:56,210 --> 02:25:56,220
that good so it's basically build up a
 

8433
02:25:56,220 --> 02:25:58,429
that good so it's basically build up a
foundation in something so programming

8434
02:25:58,429 --> 02:25:58,439
foundation in something so programming
 

8435
02:25:58,439 --> 02:26:01,130
foundation in something so programming
mathematics it could even be physics but

8436
02:26:01,130 --> 02:26:01,140
mathematics it could even be physics but
 

8437
02:26:01,140 --> 02:26:03,230
mathematics it could even be physics but
build build that Foundation

8438
02:26:03,230 --> 02:26:03,240
build build that Foundation
 

8439
02:26:03,240 --> 02:26:05,090
build build that Foundation
yeah I would say build a strong

8440
02:26:05,090 --> 02:26:05,100
yeah I would say build a strong
 

8441
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:06,710
yeah I would say build a strong
foundation in math and computer science

8442
02:26:06,710 --> 02:26:06,720
foundation in math and computer science
 

8443
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:08,389
foundation in math and computer science
and statistics in these kinds of areas

8444
02:26:08,389 --> 02:26:08,399
and statistics in these kinds of areas
 

8445
02:26:08,399 --> 02:26:11,270
and statistics in these kinds of areas
but but don't be afraid to try something

8446
02:26:11,270 --> 02:26:11,280
but but don't be afraid to try something
 

8447
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:12,590
but but don't be afraid to try something
that's different and learn something

8448
02:26:12,590 --> 02:26:12,600
that's different and learn something
 

8449
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,750
that's different and learn something
that's different from you know the the

8450
02:26:14,750 --> 02:26:14,760
that's different from you know the the
 

8451
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:15,889
that's different from you know the the
thing that everybody else is doing to

8452
02:26:15,889 --> 02:26:15,899
thing that everybody else is doing to
 

8453
02:26:15,899 --> 02:26:17,750
thing that everybody else is doing to
get into machine learning um you know

8454
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:17,760
get into machine learning um you know
 

8455
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:20,270
get into machine learning um you know
there's there's value in having a

8456
02:26:20,270 --> 02:26:20,280
there's there's value in having a
 

8457
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:22,969
there's there's value in having a
different background than everybody else

8458
02:26:22,969 --> 02:26:22,979
different background than everybody else
 

8459
02:26:22,979 --> 02:26:25,790
different background than everybody else
um yeah so but certainly having a strong

8460
02:26:25,790 --> 02:26:25,800
um yeah so but certainly having a strong
 

8461
02:26:25,800 --> 02:26:27,050
um yeah so but certainly having a strong
math background especially in things

8462
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:27,060
math background especially in things
 

8463
02:26:27,060 --> 02:26:29,270
math background especially in things
like linear algebra and statistics and

8464
02:26:29,270 --> 02:26:29,280
like linear algebra and statistics and
 

8465
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,590
like linear algebra and statistics and
probability

8466
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:30,600
probability
 

8467
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:32,270
probability
um are incredibly helpful today for for

8468
02:26:32,270 --> 02:26:32,280
um are incredibly helpful today for for
 

8469
02:26:32,280 --> 02:26:34,550
um are incredibly helpful today for for
learning about and understanding machine

8470
02:26:34,550 --> 02:26:34,560
learning about and understanding machine
 

8471
02:26:34,560 --> 02:26:36,830
learning about and understanding machine
learning do you think one day we'll be

8472
02:26:36,830 --> 02:26:36,840
learning do you think one day we'll be
 

8473
02:26:36,840 --> 02:26:38,389
learning do you think one day we'll be
able to since you're taking steps from

8474
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:38,399
able to since you're taking steps from
 

8475
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,790
able to since you're taking steps from
poker to diplomacy one day we'll be able

8476
02:26:40,790 --> 02:26:40,800
poker to diplomacy one day we'll be able
 

8477
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:43,130
poker to diplomacy one day we'll be able
to uh

8478
02:26:43,130 --> 02:26:43,140
to uh
 

8479
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:46,370
to uh
figure out how to live life optimally

8480
02:26:46,370 --> 02:26:46,380
figure out how to live life optimally
 

8481
02:26:46,380 --> 02:26:49,010
figure out how to live life optimally
well what is it like in in poker and

8482
02:26:49,010 --> 02:26:49,020
well what is it like in in poker and
 

8483
02:26:49,020 --> 02:26:50,570
well what is it like in in poker and
diplomacy you need a value function you

8484
02:26:50,570 --> 02:26:50,580
diplomacy you need a value function you
 

8485
02:26:50,580 --> 02:26:53,270
diplomacy you need a value function you
need to have a reward system and so what

8486
02:26:53,270 --> 02:26:53,280
need to have a reward system and so what
 

8487
02:26:53,280 --> 02:26:54,349
need to have a reward system and so what
does it mean to live a life that's

8488
02:26:54,349 --> 02:26:54,359
does it mean to live a life that's
 

8489
02:26:54,359 --> 02:26:58,190
does it mean to live a life that's
optimal so okay so then you can exactly

8490
02:26:58,190 --> 02:26:58,200
optimal so okay so then you can exactly
 

8491
02:26:58,200 --> 02:27:00,410
optimal so okay so then you can exactly
like lay down a reward function being

8492
02:27:00,410 --> 02:27:00,420
like lay down a reward function being
 

8493
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:04,070
like lay down a reward function being
like I want to be rich or I want to be

8494
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:04,080
like I want to be rich or I want to be
 

8495
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,030
like I want to be rich or I want to be
um

8496
02:27:05,030 --> 02:27:05,040
um
 

8497
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:07,849
um
I want to be in a happy relationship and

8498
02:27:07,849 --> 02:27:07,859
I want to be in a happy relationship and
 

8499
02:27:07,859 --> 02:27:09,710
I want to be in a happy relationship and
then you'll say well

8500
02:27:09,710 --> 02:27:09,720
then you'll say well
 

8501
02:27:09,720 --> 02:27:11,570
then you'll say well
do X

8502
02:27:11,570 --> 02:27:11,580
do X
 

8503
02:27:11,580 --> 02:27:13,490
do X
you know there's there's a lot of uh

8504
02:27:13,490 --> 02:27:13,500
you know there's there's a lot of uh
 

8505
02:27:13,500 --> 02:27:15,770
you know there's there's a lot of uh
talk today about in in AI safety circles

8506
02:27:15,770 --> 02:27:15,780
talk today about in in AI safety circles
 

8507
02:27:15,780 --> 02:27:18,290
talk today about in in AI safety circles
about like this specification of you

8508
02:27:18,290 --> 02:27:18,300
about like this specification of you
 

8509
02:27:18,300 --> 02:27:20,630
about like this specification of you
know reward functions so you you say

8510
02:27:20,630 --> 02:27:20,640
know reward functions so you you say
 

8511
02:27:20,640 --> 02:27:23,090
know reward functions so you you say
like okay my objective is to be rich and

8512
02:27:23,090 --> 02:27:23,100
like okay my objective is to be rich and
 

8513
02:27:23,100 --> 02:27:24,889
like okay my objective is to be rich and
maybe the AI tells you like okay well if

8514
02:27:24,889 --> 02:27:24,899
maybe the AI tells you like okay well if
 

8515
02:27:24,899 --> 02:27:25,910
maybe the AI tells you like okay well if
you want to maximize the probability

8516
02:27:25,910 --> 02:27:25,920
you want to maximize the probability
 

8517
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:28,429
you want to maximize the probability
that you're rich go rob a bank sure and

8518
02:27:28,429 --> 02:27:28,439
that you're rich go rob a bank sure and
 

8519
02:27:28,439 --> 02:27:30,290
that you're rich go rob a bank sure and
so you wanna is that is that really what

8520
02:27:30,290 --> 02:27:30,300
so you wanna is that is that really what
 

8521
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:31,969
so you wanna is that is that really what
you want is your objective really to be

8522
02:27:31,969 --> 02:27:31,979
you want is your objective really to be
 

8523
02:27:31,979 --> 02:27:34,730
you want is your objective really to be
rich at all costs or is it more nuanced

8524
02:27:34,730 --> 02:27:34,740
rich at all costs or is it more nuanced
 

8525
02:27:34,740 --> 02:27:36,349
rich at all costs or is it more nuanced
than that so the understand the

8526
02:27:36,349 --> 02:27:36,359
than that so the understand the
 

8527
02:27:36,359 --> 02:27:39,349
than that so the understand the
consequences yeah

8528
02:27:39,349 --> 02:27:39,359
consequences yeah
 

8529
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:44,510
consequences yeah
yeah so yeah that that's so maybe life

8530
02:27:44,510 --> 02:27:44,520
yeah so yeah that that's so maybe life
 

8531
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:46,309
yeah so yeah that that's so maybe life
is more about defining the reward

8532
02:27:46,309 --> 02:27:46,319
is more about defining the reward
 

8533
02:27:46,319 --> 02:27:48,290
is more about defining the reward
function that minimizes the unintended

8534
02:27:48,290 --> 02:27:48,300
function that minimizes the unintended
 

8535
02:27:48,300 --> 02:27:49,550
function that minimizes the unintended
consequences

8536
02:27:49,550 --> 02:27:49,560
consequences
 

8537
02:27:49,560 --> 02:27:52,610
consequences
than it is about the actual policy that

8538
02:27:52,610 --> 02:27:52,620
than it is about the actual policy that
 

8539
02:27:52,620 --> 02:27:54,230
than it is about the actual policy that
gets you to the rewards function maybe

8540
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:54,240
gets you to the rewards function maybe
 

8541
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:57,349
gets you to the rewards function maybe
life is just about constantly updating

8542
02:27:57,349 --> 02:27:57,359
life is just about constantly updating
 

8543
02:27:57,359 --> 02:27:59,450
life is just about constantly updating
the reward function

8544
02:27:59,450 --> 02:27:59,460
the reward function
 

8545
02:27:59,460 --> 02:28:01,370
the reward function
I think one of the challenges in life is

8546
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:01,380
I think one of the challenges in life is
 

8547
02:28:01,380 --> 02:28:03,590
I think one of the challenges in life is
is figuring out exactly what that reward

8548
02:28:03,590 --> 02:28:03,600
is figuring out exactly what that reward
 

8549
02:28:03,600 --> 02:28:05,809
is figuring out exactly what that reward
function is sometimes it's pretty hard

8550
02:28:05,809 --> 02:28:05,819
function is sometimes it's pretty hard
 

8551
02:28:05,819 --> 02:28:07,910
function is sometimes it's pretty hard
to specify the same way that you know

8552
02:28:07,910 --> 02:28:07,920
to specify the same way that you know
 

8553
02:28:07,920 --> 02:28:09,710
to specify the same way that you know
trying to handcraft the optimal policy

8554
02:28:09,710 --> 02:28:09,720
trying to handcraft the optimal policy
 

8555
02:28:09,720 --> 02:28:11,389
trying to handcraft the optimal policy
in a game like chess is really difficult

8556
02:28:11,389 --> 02:28:11,399
in a game like chess is really difficult
 

8557
02:28:11,399 --> 02:28:13,670
in a game like chess is really difficult
it's not so clear-cut what the reward

8558
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:13,680
it's not so clear-cut what the reward
 

8559
02:28:13,680 --> 02:28:15,710
it's not so clear-cut what the reward
function is for for life

8560
02:28:15,710 --> 02:28:15,720
function is for for life
 

8561
02:28:15,720 --> 02:28:20,150
function is for for life
I think one day AI will figure it out

8562
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:20,160

 

8563
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,370

and I wonder what that would be until

8564
02:28:22,370 --> 02:28:22,380
and I wonder what that would be until
 

8565
02:28:22,380 --> 02:28:23,510
and I wonder what that would be until
then

8566
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:23,520
then
 

8567
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:25,429
then
I just really appreciate the kind of

8568
02:28:25,429 --> 02:28:25,439
I just really appreciate the kind of
 

8569
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:27,349
I just really appreciate the kind of
work you're doing and um it's it's

8570
02:28:27,349 --> 02:28:27,359
work you're doing and um it's it's
 

8571
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:29,690
work you're doing and um it's it's
really fascinating taking a leap into a

8572
02:28:29,690 --> 02:28:29,700
really fascinating taking a leap into a
 

8573
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:33,230
really fascinating taking a leap into a
more and more real world like

8574
02:28:33,230 --> 02:28:33,240
more and more real world like
 

8575
02:28:33,240 --> 02:28:36,469
more and more real world like
um problem space and just achieving

8576
02:28:36,469 --> 02:28:36,479
um problem space and just achieving
 

8577
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:39,469
um problem space and just achieving
incredible results by applying

8578
02:28:39,469 --> 02:28:39,479
incredible results by applying
 

8579
02:28:39,479 --> 02:28:41,450
incredible results by applying
reinforcement learning no since I saw
