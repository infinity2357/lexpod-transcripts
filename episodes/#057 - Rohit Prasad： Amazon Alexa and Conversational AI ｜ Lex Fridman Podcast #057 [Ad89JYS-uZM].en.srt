00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:19,219
so I think the comparison with
 

307
00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:21,879
so I think the comparison with
human-like versus the other aspect which

308

human-like versus the other aspect which

human-like versus the other aspect which
is also super human has to be taken into

is also super human has to be taken into
 

311
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,269
is also super human has to be taken into
consideration so I think we need to

312
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:25,279
consideration so I think we need to
 

313
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,909
consideration so I think we need to

00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:38,149
infrastructure than just the thing that
 

325
00:06:38,149 --> 00:06:38,679
infrastructure than just the thing that
sits there

326
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:38,689
sits there
 

327
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,899
sits there
in the room with you but it certainly

328
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:40,909
in the room with you but it certainly
 

329
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:45,159
in the room with you but it certainly
feels to us mere humans that there's

330
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,169
feels to us mere humans that there's
 

331
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,419
feels to us mere humans that there's
just another little creature there when

332
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:49,429
just another little creature there when
 

333
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:50,409
just another little creature there when
you're interacting with it you're not

334
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:50,419
you're interacting with it you're not
 

335
00:06:50,419 --> 00:06:51,819
you're interacting with it you're not
interacting with the entirety of the

336
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:51,829
interacting with the entirety of the
 

337
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,139
interacting with the entirety of the
infrastructure you're interacting with

338
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:53,149
infrastructure you're interacting with
 

339
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:56,679
infrastructure you're interacting with
the device the feeling is okay sure we

340
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:56,689
the device the feeling is okay sure we
 

341
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:59,529
the device the feeling is okay sure we
anthropomorphize things but that feeling

342
00:06:59,529 --> 00:06:59,539
anthropomorphize things but that feeling
 

343
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,559
anthropomorphize things but that feeling
is still there so what do you think we

344
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:02,569
is still there so what do you think we
 

345
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:05,169
is still there so what do you think we
as humans the purity of the interaction

346
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:05,179
as humans the purity of the interaction
 

347
00:07:05,179 --> 00:07:07,479
as humans the purity of the interaction
with a smart assistant what do you think

348
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:07,489
with a smart assistant what do you think
 

349
00:07:07,489 --> 00:07:10,479
with a smart assistant what do you think
we look for in that interaction I think

350
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:10,489
we look for in that interaction I think
 

351
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,699
we look for in that interaction I think
in the certain interactions I think will

352
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:12,709
in the certain interactions I think will
 

353
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:14,889
in the certain interactions I think will
be very much where it does feel like a

354
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:14,899
be very much where it does feel like a
 

355
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,589
be very much where it does feel like a
human because it has a persona of its

356
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
human because it has a persona of its
 

357
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,529
human because it has a persona of its
own and in certain ones it wouldn't be

358
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:20,539
own and in certain ones it wouldn't be
 

359
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,869
own and in certain ones it wouldn't be
so I think a simple example to think of

360
00:07:22,869 --> 00:07:22,879
so I think a simple example to think of
 

361
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,850
so I think a simple example to think of
it is if you're walking through the

362
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:24,860
it is if you're walking through the
 

363
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,319
it is if you're walking through the
house and you just want to turn on your

364
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:26,329
house and you just want to turn on your
 

365
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,779
house and you just want to turn on your
lights on and off and you're issuing a

366
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:28,789
lights on and off and you're issuing a
 

367
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:30,999
lights on and off and you're issuing a
command that's not very much like a

368
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:31,009
command that's not very much like a
 

369
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,499
command that's not very much like a
human-like interaction and that's where

370
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:32,509
human-like interaction and that's where
 

371
00:07:32,509 --> 00:07:34,149
human-like interaction and that's where
the AI shouldn't come back and have a

372
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:34,159
the AI shouldn't come back and have a
 

373
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,279
the AI shouldn't come back and have a
conversation with you just it should

374
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:36,289
conversation with you just it should
 

375
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,859
conversation with you just it should
simply complete that command so those I

376
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:38,869
simply complete that command so those I
 

377
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:40,989
simply complete that command so those I
think the blend of we have to think

378
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:40,999
think the blend of we have to think
 

379
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,419
think the blend of we have to think
about this is not human human alone it

380
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:43,429
about this is not human human alone it
 

381
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,189
about this is not human human alone it
is a human machine interaction and

382
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
is a human machine interaction and
 

383
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,799
is a human machine interaction and
certain aspects of humans are needed and

384
00:07:47,799 --> 00:07:47,809
certain aspects of humans are needed and
 

385
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:50,079
certain aspects of humans are needed and
certain aspects are in situations demand

386
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,089
certain aspects are in situations demand
 

387
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:52,149
certain aspects are in situations demand
it to be like a machine so I told you

388
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:52,159
it to be like a machine so I told you
 

389
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,429
it to be like a machine so I told you
it's gonna be full soft cause in parts

390
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:54,439
it's gonna be full soft cause in parts
 

391
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,589
it's gonna be full soft cause in parts
what was the difference between human

392
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:56,599
what was the difference between human
 

393
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:58,929
what was the difference between human
and machine in that interaction when we

394
00:07:58,929 --> 00:07:58,939
and machine in that interaction when we
 

395
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,569
and machine in that interaction when we
interact to humans especially those our

396
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:01,579
interact to humans especially those our
 

397
00:08:01,579 --> 00:08:06,609
interact to humans especially those our
friends and loved ones versus you and a

friends and loved ones versus you and a
 

399
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,659
friends and loved ones versus you and a
machine that you also are close with I

400
00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:09,669
machine that you also are close with I
 

401
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,129
machine that you also are close with I
think they you have to think about the

402
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:12,139
think they you have to think about the
 

403
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,350
think they you have to think about the
roles the AI plays right so and it

404
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,360
roles the AI plays right so and it
 

405
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,790
roles the AI plays right so and it
differs from different customer to

406
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:15,800
differs from different customer to
 

407
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,229
differs from different customer to
customer different situation to

00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:26,569
friend at times an assistant an advisor
 

415
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:29,529
friend at times an assistant an advisor
down the line so I think most a eyes

416
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:29,539
down the line so I think most a eyes
 

417
00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:31,449
down the line so I think most a eyes
will have this kind of attributes and it

418
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:31,459
will have this kind of attributes and it
 

419
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:33,219
will have this kind of attributes and it
will be very situational in nature so

420
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:33,229
will be very situational in nature so
 

421
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:35,019
will be very situational in nature so
where is the boundary I think the

422
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:35,029
where is the boundary I think the
 

423
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:37,179
where is the boundary I think the
boundary depends on exact context in

424
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:37,189
boundary depends on exact context in
 

425
00:08:37,189 --> 00:08:38,429
boundary depends on exact context in
which you are interacting what they are

so the depth and the richness of natural

428
00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:41,779
so the depth and the richness of natural

it means to be intelligent you know
there's a lot of criticism of that kind

436
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:51,860
there's a lot of criticism of that kind
 

437
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,340
there's a lot of criticism of that kind
of

of

of
but what do you think it's a good test

440
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:54,870
but what do you think it's a good test
 

441
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,720
but what do you think it's a good test
of intelligence in your view in the

you think about this human intelligence

448
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:06,540
you think about this human intelligence
 

449
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,510
you think about this human intelligence
what it means to define it what it means

450
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:08,520
what it means to define it what it means
 

451
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,850
what it means to define it what it means
to reach that level I do think the

452
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:10,860
to reach that level I do think the
 

453
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,000
to reach that level I do think the
ability to converse is an sign of an

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:16,260
ultimate intelligence I think that is no
 

457
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,950
ultimate intelligence I think that is no
question about it so if you think about

458
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:18,960
question about it so if you think about
 

459
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,710
question about it so if you think about
all aspects of humans there are sensors

460
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:21,720
all aspects of humans there are sensors
 

461
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,100
all aspects of humans there are sensors
we have and those are basically a data

462
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:25,110
we have and those are basically a data
 

463
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,930
we have and those are basically a data
collection mechanism and based on that

464
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:26,940
collection mechanism and based on that
 

465
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,910
collection mechanism and based on that
we make some decisions with our sensory

466
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:28,920
we make some decisions with our sensory
 

467
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,720
we make some decisions with our sensory
brains right and from that perspective I

468
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:32,730
brains right and from that perspective I
 

469
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,760
brains right and from that perspective I
think that there are elements we have to

470
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:34,770
think that there are elements we have to
 

471
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:36,650
think that there are elements we have to
talk about how we sense the world and

472
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:36,660
talk about how we sense the world and
 

473
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,650
talk about how we sense the world and
then how we act based on what we sense

474
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:39,660
then how we act based on what we sense
 

475
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,850
then how we act based on what we sense
those elements clearly machines have but

476
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:43,860
those elements clearly machines have but
 

477
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,920
those elements clearly machines have but
then there's the other aspects of

478
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:45,930
then there's the other aspects of
 

479
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,620
then there's the other aspects of
computation that is way better I also

480
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:48,630
computation that is way better I also
 

481
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,510
computation that is way better I also
mentioned about memory again in terms of

482
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:50,520
mentioned about memory again in terms of

intelligence and don't you think the
 

611
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,660
intelligence and don't you think the

so so I would say human machine dialogue

630
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:58,250
so so I would say human machine dialogue
 

631
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,270
so so I would say human machine dialogue
is definitely one of the best tests of

detail it's not just 20 minutes but the
 

719
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,350
detail it's not just 20 minutes but the
quality of the conversation too that

720
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:48,360
quality of the conversation too that
 

721
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,960
quality of the conversation too that
matters and the beauty of this

competition before I answer that
question on what failure means is first

726
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:54,449
question on what failure means is first
 

727
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:57,560
question on what failure means is first
that you actually converse with millions

728
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:57,570
that you actually converse with millions
 

729
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,389
that you actually converse with millions
and millions of customers as these

social BOTS so during the judging phases

732
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:02,820
social BOTS so during the judging phases
 

733
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,569
social BOTS so during the judging phases
there are multiple phases before we get

734
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:05,579
there are multiple phases before we get
 

735
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,460
there are multiple phases before we get
to the finals which is a very controlled

736
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:07,470
to the finals which is a very controlled
 

737
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:09,650
to the finals which is a very controlled
judging in a situation where we have we

738
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:09,660
judging in a situation where we have we
 

739
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,569
judging in a situation where we have we
bring in judges and we have interactors

740
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:11,579
bring in judges and we have interactors
 

741
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,600
bring in judges and we have interactors
who interact with these social BOTS that

742
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:14,610
who interact with these social BOTS that
 

743
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,069
who interact with these social BOTS that
is a much more controlled setting but

744
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
is a much more controlled setting but
 

745
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,130
is a much more controlled setting but
till the point we get to the finals all

746
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,140
till the point we get to the finals all
 

747
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,019
till the point we get to the finals all
the judging is essentially by the

748
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:21,029
the judging is essentially by the
 

749
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:23,569
the judging is essentially by the
customers of Alexa and there you

750
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:23,579
customers of Alexa and there you
 

751
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:26,389
customers of Alexa and there you
basically rate on a simple question how

752
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
basically rate on a simple question how
 

753
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,030
basically rate on a simple question how
good your experience was so that's where

754
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,040
good your experience was so that's where
 

755
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,710
good your experience was so that's where
we are not testing for a 20 minute

756
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
we are not testing for a 20 minute
 

757
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,110
we are not testing for a 20 minute
boundary being claw across because you

758
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
boundary being claw across because you
 

759
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,680
boundary being claw across because you
do want

760
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:33,690
do want
 

761
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,770
do want
to be very much like a clear-cut winner

762
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:36,780
to be very much like a clear-cut winner
 

763
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,500
to be very much like a clear-cut winner
be chosen and and it's an absolute bar

764
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:39,510
be chosen and and it's an absolute bar
 

765
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,260
be chosen and and it's an absolute bar
so did you really break that 20-minute

766
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:42,270
so did you really break that 20-minute
 

767
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,300
so did you really break that 20-minute
barrier is why we have to test it in a

768
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:44,310
barrier is why we have to test it in a
 

769
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,820
barrier is why we have to test it in a
more controlled setting with actors

770
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:46,830
more controlled setting with actors
 

771
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:49,550
more controlled setting with actors
essentially in tractors and see how the

772
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:49,560
essentially in tractors and see how the
 

773
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,770
essentially in tractors and see how the
conversation goes so this is why it's a

774
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:51,780
conversation goes so this is why it's a
 

775
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,340
conversation goes so this is why it's a
subtle difference between how it's being

776
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,350
subtle difference between how it's being
 

777
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,920
subtle difference between how it's being
tested in the field with real customers

778
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:57,930
tested in the field with real customers
 

779
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:00,200
tested in the field with real customers
versus in the lab to award the prize so

780
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:00,210
versus in the lab to award the prize so
 

781
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:03,160
versus in the lab to award the prize so
on the latter one what it means is that

782
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,170
on the latter one what it means is that
 

783
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:06,410
on the latter one what it means is that
essentially the that there are three

784
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:06,420
essentially the that there are three
 

785
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,710
essentially the that there are three
judges and two of them have to say this

786
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:09,720
judges and two of them have to say this
 

787
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,340
judges and two of them have to say this
conversation is stalled essentially got

788
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:13,350
conversation is stalled essentially got
 

789
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:15,320
conversation is stalled essentially got
it and the judges the human experts

790
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,330
it and the judges the human experts
 

791
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,600
it and the judges the human experts
judges or human experts okay great so

792
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:17,610
judges or human experts okay great so
 

793
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,090
judges or human experts okay great so
this is in the third year so what's been

794
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,100
this is in the third year so what's been
 

795
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,220
this is in the third year so what's been
the evolution how far it's in the DARPA

796
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:22,230
the evolution how far it's in the DARPA
 

797
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,770
the evolution how far it's in the DARPA
challenge in the first year the

798
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:24,780
challenge in the first year the
 

799
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,540
challenge in the first year the
autonomous vehicles nobody finished in

800
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:26,550
autonomous vehicles nobody finished in
 

801
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,790
autonomous vehicles nobody finished in

swearing the way we take care of that is

972
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,140
swearing the way we take care of that is
 

973
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,650
swearing the way we take care of that is
that there is a sensitive filter we have

974
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:58,660
that there is a sensitive filter we have
 

975
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,390
that there is a sensitive filter we have
built that show you see words and so

976
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
built that show you see words and so
 

977
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,100
built that show you see words and so
it's more than keywords a little more in

00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,110
it's more than keywords a little more in
 

979
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,590
it's more than keywords a little more in
terms of of course there's key word base

981
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,080
terms of of course there's key word base
to but there's more in terms of these

devices so we have put
 

995
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,320
devices so we have put
lot of guardrails for the conversation

996
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,330
lot of guardrails for the conversation
 

997

the demands so you do want the
 

1029
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,020
the demands so you do want the
universities to have a clear place where

1030
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,030
universities to have a clear place where
 

1031

universities to have a clear place where
they can invent and research and not

so this is in a way that if you're so

1042

feel industry and academia need to work
 

1047
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,890
feel industry and academia need to work
well this is a great example and a great

1048
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:31,900
well this is a great example and a great
 

1049
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,550
well this is a great example and a great
way for universities to participate so

1050
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:35,560
way for universities to participate so

what do you think it takes to build a

what do you think it takes to build a
 

1053
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,030
what do you think it takes to build a
system that wins the allow surprise I

1054
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,040
system that wins the allow surprise I
 

1055
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,400
system that wins the allow surprise I
think you have to start focusing on

1056
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:43,410
think you have to start focusing on
 

1057
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,120
think you have to start focusing on
aspects of reasoning that it is there

1058
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,130
aspects of reasoning that it is there
 

1059
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:52,160
aspects of reasoning that it is there
are still more lookups of what intense

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,170
are still more lookups of what intense
 

1061
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,840
are still more lookups of what intense

those are rather than really reasoning

1064
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:58,840
those are rather than really reasoning
 

1065
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,920
those are rather than really reasoning
about the elements of the of the

1066
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:01,930
about the elements of the of the
 

1067
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,800
about the elements of the of the
conversation for instance if you have if

1068
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:04,810
conversation for instance if you have if
 

1069
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:07,170
conversation for instance if you have if
you're playing if the conversation is

00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:07,180
you're playing if the conversation is
 

1071
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,480
you're playing if the conversation is
about games and it's about a recent

sports event there's so much context in
 

1075
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,300
sports event there's so much context in
war and you have to understand the

1076
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,310
war and you have to understand the
 

1077
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:17,520
war and you have to understand the
entities that are being mentioned so

1078

entities that are being mentioned so
 

1079

that the conversation is coherent rather

that the conversation is coherent rather
 

1081
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,470
that the conversation is coherent rather
than you suddenly just switch to knowing

00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
than you suddenly just switch to knowing
 

1083
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,320
than you suddenly just switch to knowing
some fact about a sports entity and

1084
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,330
some fact about a sports entity and
 

1085
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,820
some fact about a sports entity and
you're just relating that rather than

1086

you're just relating that rather than
 

1087
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,440
you're just relating that rather than
understanding the true context of the

1088
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:28,450
understanding the true context of the
 

1089
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,170
understanding the true context of the
game like you if you just said I learned

1090
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:31,180
game like you if you just said I learned
 

1091
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,490
game like you if you just said I learned
this fun fact about

1092
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:33,500
this fun fact about
 

1093
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,250
this fun fact about
Tom Brady rather than really say how he

1094
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:36,260
Tom Brady rather than really say how he
 

1095
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,460
Tom Brady rather than really say how he
played the game the previous night then

1096
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:39,470
played the game the previous night then
 

1097
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,289
played the game the previous night then
the conversation is not really that

1098
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:41,299
the conversation is not really that
 

1099
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:44,860
the conversation is not really that
intelligent so you have to go to more

1100
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:44,870
intelligent so you have to go to more
 

1101
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,110
intelligent so you have to go to more
reasoning elements of understanding the

1102
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
reasoning elements of understanding the
 

1103
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,049
reasoning elements of understanding the
context of the dialogue and giving more

1104
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:50,059
context of the dialogue and giving more
 

1105
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:51,880
context of the dialogue and giving more
appropriate responses which tells you

1106
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:51,890
appropriate responses which tells you
 

1107
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,039
appropriate responses which tells you
that we are still quite far because a

1108
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,049
that we are still quite far because a
 

1109
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:56,380
that we are still quite far because a
lot of times it's more facts being

1110
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,390
lot of times it's more facts being
 

1111
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,659
lot of times it's more facts being
looked after and something that's close

1112
00:22:58,659 --> 00:22:58,669
looked after and something that's close
 

1113
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,760
looked after and something that's close
enough as an answer but not really the

1114
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:00,770
enough as an answer but not really the
 

1115
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,580
enough as an answer but not really the
answer so that is where the research

what happens when you're done so they

1278
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:24,500
what happens when you're done so they
 

1279
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,830
what happens when you're done so they
ask you a simple question on a scale of

00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:26,840
ask you a simple question on a scale of
 

1281
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,200
ask you a simple question on a scale of
one to five how likely are you to

1282
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,210
one to five how likely are you to
 

1283
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:32,020
one to five how likely are you to
interact with this social bot again that

interact with this social bot again that
 

1285
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:34,690
interact with this social bot again that
is a good feedback and customers can

1286
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:34,700
is a good feedback and customers can
 

1287
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,840
is a good feedback and customers can
also leave more open-ended feedback and

1288
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:36,850
also leave more open-ended feedback and
 

1289
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:41,710
also leave more open-ended feedback and
I think partly that to me is one part of

evaluation or NSF funded study and you
 

1301
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,930
evaluation or NSF funded study and you
have a nice corpus this is where it's

00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:00,770
is amazing is this
 

1307
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,440
is amazing is this
beautiful thing then and then the

constructed challenge okay you said the

1326
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,350
constructed challenge okay you said the
 

1327
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,780

00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,450
context my this particular one was just
 

1347
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,210

00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,160
was in terms of learning I think just we

00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:11,390
aspect of it in terms of if you think
 

1363
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:15,460
aspect of it in terms of if you think
about how we as humans learn it is quite

1364
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:15,470
about how we as humans learn it is quite
 

1365
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,490
about how we as humans learn it is quite
complex and it's also not unimodal that

1366
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:18,500
complex and it's also not unimodal that
 

1367
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,180
complex and it's also not unimodal that
you are fed a ton of text or audio and

you are fed a ton of text or audio and
 

1369
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,520
you are fed a ton of text or audio and
you just learn that way no you are you

1370
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:24,530
you just learn that way no you are you
 

1371
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:26,500
you just learn that way no you are you
learn by experience you learn by seeing

1372
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,510

think the next wave of research is going

1382
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:41,780
think the next wave of research is going
 

1383
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:45,850
think the next wave of research is going
to be with less data not just less human

1384
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:45,860
to be with less data not just less human
 

1385
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,610
to be with less data not just less human
not just with less label data but also

1386
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:48,620
not just with less label data but also
 

1387
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,520
not just with less label data but also
with a lot of week supervision and where

1388
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:51,530
with a lot of week supervision and where
 

1389
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:54,880
with a lot of week supervision and where
you can increase the learning rate I

1390
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:54,890
you can increase the learning rate I
 

1391
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,650
you can increase the learning rate I
don't mean less data in terms of not

1392
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:56,660
don't mean less data in terms of not
 

1393
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,810
don't mean less data in terms of not
having a lot of data to learn from that

1394
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:58,820
having a lot of data to learn from that
 

1395
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,820
having a lot of data to learn from that
we are generating so much data but it is

1396
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:00,830
we are generating so much data but it is
 

1397
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:03,640
we are generating so much data but it is
more about from a aspect of how fast can

1398
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:03,650
more about from a aspect of how fast can
 

1399
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,640
more about from a aspect of how fast can
you learn so improving the quality of

1400
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:06,650
you learn so improving the quality of
 

1401
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,800
you learn so improving the quality of
the data that's the quality data and

1402
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:08,810
the data that's the quality data and
 

1403
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,630
the data that's the quality data and
learning process I think more on the

1404
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
learning process I think more on the
 

1405
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,850
learning process I think more on the
learning process I think we have to we

1406
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:12,860
learning process I think we have to we
 

1407
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,110
learning process I think we have to we
as humans learn with a lot of

1408
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:14,120
as humans learn with a lot of
 

1409
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,800
as humans learn with a lot of
noisy data right and and I think that's

1410
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:17,810
noisy data right and and I think that's
 

1411
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,560
noisy data right and and I think that's
the part that I don't think should

1412
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:20,570
the part that I don't think should
 

1413
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,660
the part that I don't think should
change what should change is how we

1414
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:22,670
change what should change is how we
 

1415
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,790
change what should change is how we
learn right so if you look at you

1416
00:29:24,790 --> 00:29:24,800
learn right so if you look at you
 

1417
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,260
learn right so if you look at you
mentioned supervised learning we have

1418
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,270
mentioned supervised learning we have
 

1419
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,600
mentioned supervised learning we have
making transformative shifts from moving

1420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,610
making transformative shifts from moving
 

1421
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:30,010
making transformative shifts from moving
to more unsupervised more week

1422
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,020
to more unsupervised more week
 

1423
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,130
to more unsupervised more week
supervision those are the key aspects of

1424
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:33,140
supervision those are the key aspects of
 

1425
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,130
supervision those are the key aspects of
how to learn and I think in that setting

1426
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:36,140
how to learn and I think in that setting
 

1427
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,890
how to learn and I think in that setting
you I hope you agree with me that having

you I hope you agree with me that having
 

1429
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,310
you I hope you agree with me that having
other senses is very crucial in terms of

1430
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:42,320
other senses is very crucial in terms of
 

1431
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,220
other senses is very crucial in terms of
how you learn so absolutely and from a

1432
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:45,230
how you learn so absolutely and from a
 

1433
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:47,230
how you learn so absolutely and from a
machine learning perspective which I

1434
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:47,240
machine learning perspective which I
 

1435
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,240
machine learning perspective which I
hope we get a chance to talk to a few

1436
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:49,250
hope we get a chance to talk to a few
 

1437
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,280
hope we get a chance to talk to a few
aspects that are fascinating there but

1438
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:51,290
aspects that are fascinating there but
 

1439
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,490
aspects that are fascinating there but
just stick on the point a sort of a body

00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:02,930
interface or there's a ring and so on I
 

1447
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,830

Alexa the future looks like if it begins

1460
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:25,430
Alexa the future looks like if it begins
 

1461
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,660
Alexa the future looks like if it begins
to shift what his body looks like what

1462
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:28,670
to shift what his body looks like what
 

1463
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,910
to shift what his body looks like what
uh what may be beyond the Alexa what do

1464
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:30,920
uh what may be beyond the Alexa what do
 

1465
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,260
uh what may be beyond the Alexa what do
you think are the different devices in

1466
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,270
you think are the different devices in
 

1467
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:35,710
you think are the different devices in
the home as they start to embody their

1468
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:35,720
the home as they start to embody their
 

1469
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,120
the home as they start to embody their
intelligence more and more what do you

1470
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:37,130
intelligence more and more what do you
 

1471
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:39,270
intelligence more and more what do you
think that looks like philosophically a

1472
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:39,280
think that looks like philosophically a
 

1473
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,260
think that looks like philosophically a
future what do you think that looks I

1474
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:41,270
future what do you think that looks I
 

1475
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,390
future what do you think that looks I
think let's look at what's happening

1476
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,400
think let's look at what's happening
 

1477
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,100
think let's look at what's happening
today you mentioned I think all our

1478
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,110
today you mentioned I think all our
 

1479
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:47,170
today you mentioned I think all our
devices as an Amazon devices we also

1480
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:47,180
devices as an Amazon devices we also
 

1481
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,270
devices as an Amazon devices we also
wanted to point out Alexa is already

1482
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,280
wanted to point out Alexa is already
 

1483
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,070
wanted to point out Alexa is already
integrated a lot of third-party devices

1484
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,080
integrated a lot of third-party devices
 

1485
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,920
integrated a lot of third-party devices
which also come in lots of forms and

1486
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:53,930
which also come in lots of forms and
 

1487
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:57,150
which also come in lots of forms and
shapes some in robots right some and

1488
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,160
shapes some in robots right some and
 

1489
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,940
shapes some in robots right some and
microwaves some in appliances of that

1490
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:00,950
microwaves some in appliances of that
 

1491
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,400
microwaves some in appliances of that
you use in everyday life so I think it

1492
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:03,410
you use in everyday life so I think it
 

1493
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:06,850
you use in everyday life so I think it
is it's not just the shape Alexa takes

1494
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:06,860
is it's not just the shape Alexa takes
 

1495
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,700
is it's not just the shape Alexa takes
in terms of form factors but it's also

1496
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:09,710
in terms of form factors but it's also
 

1497
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,690
in terms of form factors but it's also
where all it's available it's getting in

1498
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:13,700
where all it's available it's getting in
 

1499
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,190
where all it's available it's getting in
cars it's getting in different

1500
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:15,200
cars it's getting in different
 

1501
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,650
cars it's getting in different
appliances in homes even toothbrushes

1502
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:17,660
appliances in homes even toothbrushes
 

1503
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,440
appliances in homes even toothbrushes
right so I think you have to think about

1504
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:20,450
right so I think you have to think about
 

1505
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:25,840
right so I think you have to think about
it is not a physical assistant it will

1506
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:25,850
it is not a physical assistant it will
 

1507
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:27,760
it is not a physical assistant it will
be in some embodiment

1508
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:27,770
be in some embodiment
 

1509
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,350
be in some embodiment
as you said we already have these nice

1510
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:29,360
as you said we already have these nice
 

1511
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,040
as you said we already have these nice
devices but I think it's also important

1512
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:33,050
devices but I think it's also important
 

1513
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,840
devices but I think it's also important
to think of it it is a virtual assistant

1514
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:34,850
to think of it it is a virtual assistant
 

1515
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:37,450
to think of it it is a virtual assistant
it does superhuman in the sense that it

1516
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:37,460
it does superhuman in the sense that it
 

1517
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,450
it does superhuman in the sense that it
is in multiple places at the same time

1518
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:39,460
is in multiple places at the same time
 

1519
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:43,840
is in multiple places at the same time
so I think the the actual embodiment in

1520
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:43,850
so I think the the actual embodiment in
 

1521
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,890
so I think the the actual embodiment in
some sense to me doesn't matter I think

1522
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:47,900
some sense to me doesn't matter I think
 

1523
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,850
some sense to me doesn't matter I think
you have to think of it as not as

1524
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:50,860
you have to think of it as not as
 

1525
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,190
you have to think of it as not as
human-like and more of what its

1526
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,200
human-like and more of what its
 

1527
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,070
human-like and more of what its
capabilities are that derive a lot of

1528
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,080
capabilities are that derive a lot of
 

1529
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,470
capabilities are that derive a lot of
benefit for customers and how there are

1530
00:31:59,470 --> 00:31:59,480
benefit for customers and how there are
 

1531
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,420
benefit for customers and how there are
different ways to delighted and delight

1532
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,430
different ways to delighted and delight
 

1533
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,660
different ways to delighted and delight
customers and different experiences and

1534
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:03,670
customers and different experiences and
 

1535
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,910
customers and different experiences and
I think I am a big fan of it not being

1536
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:06,920
I think I am a big fan of it not being
 

1537
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,760
I think I am a big fan of it not being
in just human like it should be

1538
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:09,770
in just human like it should be
 

1539
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:11,440
in just human like it should be
human-like in certain situations Alexa

1540
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:11,450
human-like in certain situations Alexa

this AI so if I could trivialize what
 

1551
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,830
this AI so if I could trivialize what
we're talking about so if you look at

00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:26,840
we're talking about so if you look at

00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:32,380
the way Steve Jobs thought about the
interaction with the device that Apple

1556
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:32,390
interaction with the device that Apple
 

1557
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,320
interaction with the device that Apple
produced there was a extreme focus on

1558
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,330

1561
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,980
controlling the experience by making
sure there's only the Apple produced

1562
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:38,990
sure there's only the Apple produced

devices you see the voice of Alexa being

1564
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:43,700
devices you see the voice of Alexa being
 

1565
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,090
devices you see the voice of Alexa being
taking all kinds of forms depending on

00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:46,100
taking all kinds of forms depending on
 

1567
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,880
taking all kinds of forms depending on
what the customers want and that means

1568
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:47,890
what the customers want and that means
 

1569
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,170
what the customers want and that means
that means it could be anywhere from the

1570
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:50,180
that means it could be anywhere from the
 

1571
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:53,140
that means it could be anywhere from the
microwave to a vacuum cleaner to the

1572
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:53,150
microwave to a vacuum cleaner to the

think voice is an essence it's not all
but it's a key aspect I think to your

1580
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,530
but it's a key aspect I think to your
 

1581
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,220
but it's a key aspect I think to your
question in terms of you should be able

1582
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:06,230
question in terms of you should be able
 

1583
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:09,430
question in terms of you should be able
to recognize Alexa and that's a huge

1584
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:09,440
to recognize Alexa and that's a huge
 

1585
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,170
to recognize Alexa and that's a huge
problem I think in terms of a huge

1586
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:11,180
problem I think in terms of a huge
 

1587
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,580
problem I think in terms of a huge
scientific problem I should say like

1588
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:12,590
scientific problem I should say like
 

1589
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,340
scientific problem I should say like
what are the traits what makes it look

1590
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,350
what are the traits what makes it look
 

1591
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,990
what are the traits what makes it look
like Alexa especially in different

1592
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:17,000
like Alexa especially in different
 

1593
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,310
like Alexa especially in different
settings and especially if it's

1594
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:18,320
settings and especially if it's
 

1595
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,040
settings and especially if it's
primarily voice what it is but LX is not

1596
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,050
primarily voice what it is but LX is not
 

1597
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,780
primarily voice what it is but LX is not
just voice either right I mean we have

1598
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:22,790
just voice either right I mean we have
 

1599
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,720
just voice either right I mean we have
devices with a screen now you're seeing

1600
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:25,730
devices with a screen now you're seeing
 

1601
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,900
devices with a screen now you're seeing
just other behaviors of Alexa so I think

1602
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:28,910
just other behaviors of Alexa so I think
 

1603
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,550
just other behaviors of Alexa so I think
they're in very early stages of what

1604
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:30,560
they're in very early stages of what
 

1605
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,680
they're in very early stages of what
that means and this will be an important

1606
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:32,690
that means and this will be an important
 

1607
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,290
that means and this will be an important
profit for the following years but I do

1608
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:35,300
profit for the following years but I do
 

1609
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,320
profit for the following years but I do
believe that being able to recognize and

1610
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:38,330
believe that being able to recognize and
 

1611
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,750
believe that being able to recognize and
tell when it's Alexa versus it's not as

1612
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:40,760
tell when it's Alexa versus it's not as
 

1613
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,700
tell when it's Alexa versus it's not as
going to be important from an Alexa

1614
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:42,710
going to be important from an Alexa
 

1615
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:44,260
going to be important from an Alexa
perspective I'm not speaking for the

1616
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:44,270
perspective I'm not speaking for the
 

1617
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,350

entire AI Thank You Marie but from but I

1618
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
entire AI Thank You Marie but from but I
 

1619
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,880
entire AI Thank You Marie but from but I
think attribution and as we go into more

1620
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:51,890
think attribution and as we go into more
 

1621
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:55,360
think attribution and as we go into more
of understanding who did what that

1622
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,370
of understanding who did what that
 

1623
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,850
of understanding who did what that
identity of the AI is crucial in the

1624
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:57,860
identity of the AI is crucial in the
 

1625
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,130
identity of the AI is crucial in the
coming world I think from the broad AI

1626
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:00,140
coming world I think from the broad AI
 

1627
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,570
coming world I think from the broad AI
community perspective that's also a

1628
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:01,580
community perspective that's also a
 

1629
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,640
community perspective that's also a
fascinating problem so basically if I

1630
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:03,650
fascinating problem so basically if I
 

1631
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,400
fascinating problem so basically if I
close my eyes and listen to the voice

1632
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:05,410
close my eyes and listen to the voice
 

1633
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,840
close my eyes and listen to the voice
what would it take for me to recognize

1634
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:07,850
what would it take for me to recognize
 

1635
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,820
what would it take for me to recognize
that this is Alexa exactly or at least

respond I need to double check that but
 

1903
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,809
respond I need to double check that but
I'm pretty positive about it I think you

1904
00:39:41,809 --> 00:39:41,819
I'm pretty positive about it I think you
 

1905

do it because I think I've too soon but
 

1907
00:39:44,069 --> 00:39:47,599
do it because I think I've too soon but
that's like that's like hell like I was

1908
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:47,609
that's like that's like hell like I was
 

1909
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,190
that's like that's like hell like I was
born in your brand of champagne and

1910
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
born in your brand of champagne and
 

1911
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,099
born in your brand of champagne and
whatever the year good thing yeah so in

1912
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:52,109
whatever the year good thing yeah so in
 

1913
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:54,109
whatever the year good thing yeah so in
terms of the metaphysical I think it's

1914
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:54,119
terms of the metaphysical I think it's
 

1915
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:58,099
terms of the metaphysical I think it's
early does it have the historic

1916
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:58,109
early does it have the historic
 

1917
00:39:58,109 --> 00:39:59,750
early does it have the historic

knowledge about herself
 

1919
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,510
knowledge about herself
to be able to do that maybe have we

1920
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:02,520
to be able to do that maybe have we
 

1921
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,609
to be able to do that maybe have we
crossed that boundary not yet right in

1922
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:04,619
crossed that boundary not yet right in
 

1923
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,800
crossed that boundary not yet right in
terms of being thank you have you

1924
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:06,810
terms of being thank you have you
 

1925
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:09,020
terms of being thank you have you
thought about it quite a bit but I

1926
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,030
thought about it quite a bit but I
 

1927
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,579
thought about it quite a bit but I
wouldn't say that we have come to a

1928
00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:10,589
wouldn't say that we have come to a
 

1929
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:12,319
wouldn't say that we have come to a
clear decision in terms of what it

1930
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:12,329
clear decision in terms of what it
 

1931
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:14,930
clear decision in terms of what it
should look like but you can imagine

1932
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:14,940
should look like but you can imagine
 

1933
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,120
should look like but you can imagine
though and I bring this back to the

1934
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,130
though and I bring this back to the
 

1935
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:18,720
though and I bring this back to the

1937
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:21,060
Alexa prize social BOTS one
there you will start seeing some of that

1938
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,070
there you will start seeing some of that
 

1939
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,250
there you will start seeing some of that
like you these bots have their identity

1940
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:23,260
like you these bots have their identity
 

1941
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,670
like you these bots have their identity
and in terms of that you may find you

1942

know this is such a great research topic

1944
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,330
know this is such a great research topic
 

1945
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:31,320
know this is such a great research topic
that some academia team may think of

1946
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:31,330
that some academia team may think of
 

1947
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,220
that some academia team may think of
these problems and start solving them -

1948
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:34,230
these problems and start solving them -
 

1949
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:39,240
these problems and start solving them -
so let me ask a question it's kind of

1950
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,250
so let me ask a question it's kind of
 

1951
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,960
so let me ask a question it's kind of
difficult I think but it feels

1952
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:41,970
difficult I think but it feels
 

1953
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:43,710
difficult I think but it feels
fascinating to me because I'm fascinated

1954
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:43,720
fascinating to me because I'm fascinated
 

1955
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:46,710
fascinating to me because I'm fascinated
with psychology it feels that the more

1956
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:46,720
with psychology it feels that the more
 

1957
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,109
with psychology it feels that the more
personality you have the more dangerous

1958
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
personality you have the more dangerous
 

1959
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,520
personality you have the more dangerous
it is in terms of a customer perspective

1960
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,530
it is in terms of a customer perspective
 

1961
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,050
it is in terms of a customer perspective
of products if you want to create a

1962
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:55,060
of products if you want to create a
 

1963
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,780
of products if you want to create a
product that's useful by dangerous I

1964
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:57,790
product that's useful by dangerous I
 

1965
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,870
product that's useful by dangerous I
mean creating an experience that upsets

1966
00:41:00,870 --> 00:41:00,880
mean creating an experience that upsets
 

1967
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,570
mean creating an experience that upsets
me and so what how do you get that right

1968
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:06,580
me and so what how do you get that right
 

1969
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,480
me and so what how do you get that right
because if you look at the relationships

1970
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:09,490
because if you look at the relationships
 

1971
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,940
because if you look at the relationships
maybe I'm just a screwed-up Russian but

1972
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:11,950
maybe I'm just a screwed-up Russian but
 

1973
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,250
maybe I'm just a screwed-up Russian but
if you look at the real human to human

1974
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:14,260
if you look at the real human to human
 

1975
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,810
if you look at the real human to human
relationship some of our deepest

1976
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:15,820
relationship some of our deepest
 

1977
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,599
relationship some of our deepest
relationships have fights have tension

1978
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:18,609
relationships have fights have tension
 

1979
00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:21,720
relationships have fights have tension
have the push and pull have a little

1980
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:21,730
have the push and pull have a little
 

1981
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:25,530
have the push and pull have a little
flavor in them do you want to have such

1982
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:25,540
flavor in them do you want to have such
 

1983
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,200
flavor in them do you want to have such
flavor in an interaction with Alexa how

1984
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,210
flavor in an interaction with Alexa how
 

1985
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,690
flavor in an interaction with Alexa how
do you think about that so there's one

1986
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:30,700
do you think about that so there's one
 

1987
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,400
do you think about that so there's one
other common thing that you didn't say

1988
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,410
other common thing that you didn't say
 

1989
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,770
other common thing that you didn't say
but is we think of it as paramount for

1990
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:34,780
but is we think of it as paramount for
 

1991
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,980
but is we think of it as paramount for
any deep relationship that's trust trust

1992
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:37,990
any deep relationship that's trust trust
 

1993
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,380
any deep relationship that's trust trust
yeah so I think if you trust every

1994
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:40,390
yeah so I think if you trust every
 

1995
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:43,830
yeah so I think if you trust every
attribute you said mm-hmm a fight some

1996
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:43,840
attribute you said mm-hmm a fight some
 

1997
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,320
attribute you said mm-hmm a fight some
tension yeah is or healthy but the

1998
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,330
tension yeah is or healthy but the
 

1999
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:49,530
tension yeah is or healthy but the
waters sort of unknowable in this

2000
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:49,540
waters sort of unknowable in this
 

2001
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,590
waters sort of unknowable in this
instance is trust and I think the bar to

2002
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:52,600
instance is trust and I think the bar to
 

2003
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,080
instance is trust and I think the bar to
earn customer trust for AI is very high

2004
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,090
earn customer trust for AI is very high
 

2005
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:58,080
earn customer trust for AI is very high
in some sense more than a human it's

2006
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,090
in some sense more than a human it's
 

2007
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,280
in some sense more than a human it's
it's not just about personal information

2008
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:01,290
it's not just about personal information
 

2009
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,560
it's not just about personal information
or your data it's also about your

2010
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:04,570
or your data it's also about your
 

2011
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,140
or your data it's also about your
actions on a daily basis how trustworthy

2012
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,150
actions on a daily basis how trustworthy
 

2013
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,480
actions on a daily basis how trustworthy
are you in terms of consistency in terms

2014
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:09,490
are you in terms of consistency in terms
 

2015
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:12,300
are you in terms of consistency in terms
of how accurate are you in understanding

2016
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:12,310
of how accurate are you in understanding
 

2017
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,400
of how accurate are you in understanding
me like if if you're talking to a person

2018
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,410
me like if if you're talking to a person
 

2019
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:16,109
me like if if you're talking to a person
on the phone if you have a problem with

2020
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:16,119
on the phone if you have a problem with
 

2021
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:17,310
on the phone if you have a problem with
your let's say your internet or

2022
00:42:17,310 --> 00:42:17,320
your let's say your internet or
 

2023
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,480
your let's say your internet or
something if the person is not

2024
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:18,490
something if the person is not
 

2025
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:20,130
something if the person is not
understanding you lose trust right away

2026
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:20,140
understanding you lose trust right away
 

2027
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,830
understanding you lose trust right away
you don't want to talk to that person

2028
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:21,840
you don't want to talk to that person
 

2029
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,109
you don't want to talk to that person
that whole example gets amplified by a

2030
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:25,119
that whole example gets amplified by a
 

2031
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:27,720
that whole example gets amplified by a
factor of 10 because as when you're a

2032
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:27,730
factor of 10 because as when you're a
 

2033
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,000
factor of 10 because as when you're a
human interacting with an AI you have a

2034
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,010
human interacting with an AI you have a
 

2035
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:32,130
human interacting with an AI you have a
certain expectation either you expect it

2036
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,140
certain expectation either you expect it
 

2037
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:32,490
certain expectation either you expect it
to be

2038
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:32,500
to be
 

2039
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,170
to be
very intelligent and then you get upset

2040
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:34,180
very intelligent and then you get upset
 

2041
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,180
very intelligent and then you get upset
why is it behaving this way more you

2042
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:36,190
why is it behaving this way more you
 

2043
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,120
why is it behaving this way more you
expect it to be not so intelligent and

2044
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:39,130
expect it to be not so intelligent and
 

2045
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,530
expect it to be not so intelligent and
when it surprises you're like really

2046
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:40,540
when it surprises you're like really
 

2047
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,840
when it surprises you're like really
you're trying to be too small so I think

2048
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:42,850
you're trying to be too small so I think
 

2049
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:44,910
you're trying to be too small so I think
we grapple with these hard questions as

2050
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:44,920
we grapple with these hard questions as
 

2051
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:48,030
we grapple with these hard questions as
well but I think the key is actions need

2052
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,040
well but I think the key is actions need
 

2053
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,610
well but I think the key is actions need
to be trustworthy from these a is not

2054
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:50,620
to be trustworthy from these a is not
 

2055
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,830
to be trustworthy from these a is not
just about data protection your personal

2056
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:52,840
just about data protection your personal
 

2057
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,950
just about data protection your personal
information protection but also from how

2058
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:55,960
information protection but also from how
 

2059
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,160
information protection but also from how
accurate it accomplishes all commands

2060
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,170
accurate it accomplishes all commands
 

2061
00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:01,710
accurate it accomplishes all commands
are all interactions well it's tough to

2062
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:01,720
are all interactions well it's tough to
 

2063
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,990
are all interactions well it's tough to
hear because Trust you're absolutely

2064
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
hear because Trust you're absolutely
 

2065
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,030
hear because Trust you're absolutely
right but Trust is such a high bar with

2066
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,040
right but Trust is such a high bar with
 

2067
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,670
right but Trust is such a high bar with
AI systems because people and I see this

2068
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:08,680
AI systems because people and I see this
 

2069
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,080
AI systems because people and I see this
because I work with autonomous vehicles

2070
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,090
because I work with autonomous vehicles
 

2071
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,900
because I work with autonomous vehicles
I mean the bar this placed on AI system

2072
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:12,910
I mean the bar this placed on AI system
 

2073
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:15,600
I mean the bar this placed on AI system
is unreasonably high yeah that is going

2074
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:15,610
is unreasonably high yeah that is going
 

2075
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:18,660
is unreasonably high yeah that is going
to be as I agree with you and I think of

2076
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:18,670
to be as I agree with you and I think of
 

2077
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,600
to be as I agree with you and I think of
it is it's it's a challenge and it's

2078
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:21,610
it is it's it's a challenge and it's
 

2079
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:25,470
it is it's it's a challenge and it's
also keeps my job so from that

2080
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:25,480
also keeps my job so from that
 

2081
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:28,110
also keeps my job so from that
perspective that I totally I think of it

2082
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:28,120
perspective that I totally I think of it
 

2083
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,210
perspective that I totally I think of it
at both sides as a customer and as a

2084
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:30,220
at both sides as a customer and as a
 

2085
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,120
at both sides as a customer and as a
researcher I think as a researcher yes

2086
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:33,130
researcher I think as a researcher yes
 

2087
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,920
researcher I think as a researcher yes
occasionally it will frustrate me that

2088
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:34,930
occasionally it will frustrate me that
 

2089
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,220
occasionally it will frustrate me that
why is the bar so high for these AIS and

2090
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:38,230
why is the bar so high for these AIS and
 

2091
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:40,470
why is the bar so high for these AIS and
as a customer then I say absolutely it

2092
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
as a customer then I say absolutely it
 

2093
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,420
as a customer then I say absolutely it
has to be that high right so I think

2094
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:42,430
has to be that high right so I think
 

2095
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,450
has to be that high right so I think
that's the trade-off we have to balance

2096
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:44,460
that's the trade-off we have to balance
 

2097
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,370
that's the trade-off we have to balance
but doesn't change the fundamentals that

2098
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:47,380
but doesn't change the fundamentals that
 

2099
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,220
but doesn't change the fundamentals that
trust has to be own and the question

2100
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:50,230
trust has to be own and the question
 

2101
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:53,130
trust has to be own and the question
then becomes is are we holding the AIS

2102
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:53,140
then becomes is are we holding the AIS
 

2103
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,990
then becomes is are we holding the AIS
to a different bar and accuracy and

2104
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:55,000
to a different bar and accuracy and
 

2105
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,150
to a different bar and accuracy and
mistakes then we hold humans that's

2106
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:57,160
mistakes then we hold humans that's
 

2107
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,860
mistakes then we hold humans that's
going to be a great societal questions

2108
00:43:58,860 --> 00:43:58,870
going to be a great societal questions
 

2109
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,140
going to be a great societal questions
for years to come I think for us well

2110
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,150
for years to come I think for us well
 

2111
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:03,030
for years to come I think for us well
one of the questions that we grapple as

2112
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
one of the questions that we grapple as
 

2113
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,000
one of the questions that we grapple as
a society now that I think about a lot I

2114
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,010
a society now that I think about a lot I
 

2115
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,500
a society now that I think about a lot I
think a lot of people know I think about

2116
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:07,510
think a lot of people know I think about
 

2117
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,890
think a lot of people know I think about
a lot and Alexis taking on head-on is

2118
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:10,900
a lot and Alexis taking on head-on is
 

2119
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,590
a lot and Alexis taking on head-on is
privacy is the reality is us giving over

2120
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:16,600
privacy is the reality is us giving over
 

2121
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,720
privacy is the reality is us giving over
data to any AI system can be used to

2122
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:21,730
data to any AI system can be used to
 

2123
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,020
data to any AI system can be used to
enrich our lives in in in profound ways

2124
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:25,030
enrich our lives in in in profound ways
 

2125

enrich our lives in in in profound ways
so if maybe basically any product that

so if maybe basically any product that
does anything awesome for you would the

imagine the worst case possible scenario
of what can you possibly do with that

00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,589
on all these kinds of factors and so
here's the lux in the middle of all of

here's the lux in the middle of all of

here's the lux in the middle of all of
it in the home trying to do good things

2156
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:00,960
it in the home trying to do good things
 

2157
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,349
it in the home trying to do good things
for the customers so how do you think

2158
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:03,359
for the customers so how do you think
 

2159
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,390
for the customers so how do you think
about privacy in this context the smart

2160
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:05,400
about privacy in this context the smart
 

2161
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,010
about privacy in this context the smart
assistants in the home how do you

2162
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:07,020
assistants in the home how do you
 

2163
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,300
assistants in the home how do you
maintain how do you earn trust

2164
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:08,310
maintain how do you earn trust
 

2165
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,000
maintain how do you earn trust
absolutely so as you said Trust is the

2166
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,010
absolutely so as you said Trust is the
 

2167
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:13,640
absolutely so as you said Trust is the
key here so you start with trust and

2168
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:13,650
key here so you start with trust and
 

2169
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:16,880
key here so you start with trust and
then privacy is a key aspect of it it

2170
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:16,890
then privacy is a key aspect of it it
 

2171
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,620
then privacy is a key aspect of it it
has to be designed from very beginning

2172
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:18,630
has to be designed from very beginning
 

2173
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:21,880
has to be designed from very beginning
about that and we believe in two

2174
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:21,890
about that and we believe in two
 

2175
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,260
about that and we believe in two
fundamental principles one is

2176
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:24,270
fundamental principles one is
 

2177
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:27,080
fundamental principles one is
transparency and second is control so if

2178
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,090
transparency and second is control so if
 

2179
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,859
transparency and second is control so if
by transparency I mean when we build

2180
00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:29,869
by transparency I mean when we build
 

2181
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,240
by transparency I mean when we build
what is now called smart speaker or the

2182
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:32,250
what is now called smart speaker or the

what is now called smart speaker or the
first echo we were quite judicious about

2184
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:35,550
first echo we were quite judicious about
 

2185
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:38,480
first echo we were quite judicious about
making these right trade-offs on

2186
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:38,490
making these right trade-offs on
 

2187
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:41,630
making these right trade-offs on
customers behalf that it is pretty clear

2188
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:41,640
customers behalf that it is pretty clear

00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,790
the light ring comes up we also had we
put a physical mute button on it just so

2200
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:55,800
put a physical mute button on it just so
 

2201
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,560
put a physical mute button on it just so
you're if you didn't want it to be

2202
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:57,570
you're if you didn't want it to be
 

2203
00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:58,820
you're if you didn't want it to be
listening even for the weak word then

2204
00:45:58,820 --> 00:45:58,830
listening even for the weak word then
 

2205
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,160
listening even for the weak word then
you turn the power button on the mute

2206
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:01,170
you turn the power button on the mute
 

2207
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,770
you turn the power button on the mute
button on and that disables the

2208
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:03,780
button on and that disables the
 

2209
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:05,960
button on and that disables the
microphones that's just the first

2210
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:05,970
microphones that's just the first
 

2211
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,060
microphones that's just the first
decision on essentially transparency and

2212
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:08,070
decision on essentially transparency and
 

2213
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,570
decision on essentially transparency and
control over then even when we launched

2214
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:11,580
control over then even when we launched
 

2215
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,310
control over then even when we launched
we gave the control in the hands of the

2216
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:13,320
we gave the control in the hands of the
 

2217
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,839
we gave the control in the hands of the
customers that you can go and look at

2218
00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:14,849
customers that you can go and look at
 

2219
00:46:14,849 --> 00:46:16,250
customers that you can go and look at
any of your individual utterances that

2220
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:16,260
any of your individual utterances that
 

2221
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:19,599
any of your individual utterances that
is recorded and delete them anytime and

2222
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:19,609
is recorded and delete them anytime and
 

2223
00:46:19,609 --> 00:46:22,070
is recorded and delete them anytime and
we have cut to true to that promise

2224
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:22,080
we have cut to true to that promise
 

2225
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,339
we have cut to true to that promise
right so and that is super again a great

2226
00:46:25,339 --> 00:46:25,349
right so and that is super again a great
 

2227
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:28,310
right so and that is super again a great
instance of showing how you have the

2228
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,320
instance of showing how you have the
 

2229
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,470
instance of showing how you have the
control then we made it even easier you

2230
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:30,480
control then we made it even easier you
 

2231
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,230
control then we made it even easier you
can say lecture delete what I said today

2232
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:32,240
can say lecture delete what I said today
 

2233
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,230
can say lecture delete what I said today
so that is now making it even just just

2234
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:36,240
so that is now making it even just just
 

2235
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,450
so that is now making it even just just
more control in your hands with what's

2236
00:46:38,450 --> 00:46:38,460
more control in your hands with what's
 

2237
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,790
more control in your hands with what's
most convenient about this technology is

2238
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:40,800
most convenient about this technology is
 

2239
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,570
most convenient about this technology is
voice you delete it with your voice now

2240
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:43,580
voice you delete it with your voice now
 

2241
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,550
voice you delete it with your voice now
so these are the types of decisions we

2242
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
so these are the types of decisions we
 

2243
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,880
so these are the types of decisions we
continually make we just recently

2244
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:48,890
continually make we just recently
 

2245
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:51,650
continually make we just recently
launched this feature called what we

2246
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:51,660
launched this feature called what we
 

2247
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,870
launched this feature called what we
think of it as if you wanted humans not

2248
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:53,880
think of it as if you wanted humans not
 

2249
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:57,530
think of it as if you wanted humans not
to review your data because smile you

2250
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:57,540
to review your data because smile you
 

2251
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:58,550
to review your data because smile you
mentioned supervised

2252
00:46:58,550 --> 00:46:58,560
mentioned supervised
 

2253
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,550
mentioned supervised
so you in supervised learning humans

2254
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:01,560
so you in supervised learning humans
 

2255
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,160
so you in supervised learning humans
have to give some annotation and that

2256
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:04,170
have to give some annotation and that
 

2257
00:47:04,170 --> 00:47:06,530
have to give some annotation and that
also is now a feature where you can

2258
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:06,540
also is now a feature where you can
 

2259
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,720
also is now a feature where you can
essentially if you selected that flag

2260
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:08,730
essentially if you selected that flag
 

2261
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:10,850
essentially if you selected that flag
your data will not be reviewed by a

2262
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:10,860
your data will not be reviewed by a
 

2263
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,280
your data will not be reviewed by a
human so these are the types of controls

2264
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:13,290
human so these are the types of controls
 

2265
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:16,550
human so these are the types of controls
that we have to constantly offer with

2266
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
that we have to constantly offer with
 

2267
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:21,020
that we have to constantly offer with
customers so why do you think about as

2268
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,030
customers so why do you think about as
 

2269
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:24,350
customers so why do you think about as
people so much that so that so

2270
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:24,360
people so much that so that so
 

2271
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
people so much that so that so
everything you just said is really

everything you just said is really
 

2273
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:27,920
everything you just said is really
powerful to the control the ability to

powerful to the control the ability to
 

2275
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:29,900
powerful to the control the ability to
leak because we collect we have studies

2276
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:29,910
leak because we collect we have studies
 

2277
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:31,700
leak because we collect we have studies
here running at MIT that collects huge

2278
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:31,710
here running at MIT that collects huge
 

2279
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,620
here running at MIT that collects huge
amounts of data and people consent and

amounts of data and people consent and
 

2281
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,770
amounts of data and people consent and
so on the ability to delete that data is

2282
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:36,780
so on the ability to delete that data is
 

2283
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:39,200
so on the ability to delete that data is
really empowering and almost nobody ever

2284
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:39,210
really empowering and almost nobody ever
 

2285
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:41,330
really empowering and almost nobody ever
asked to delete it but the ability to

00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:41,340
asked to delete it but the ability to
 

2287
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:44,300
asked to delete it but the ability to
have that control is really powerful but

2288
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:44,310
have that control is really powerful but
 

2289
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,310
have that control is really powerful but
still you know there's these popular

it but let me just ask is Alexa

2316
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:16,710
it but let me just ask is Alexa
 

2317
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,390
it but let me just ask is Alexa
listening no Alexa listens only for the

2318
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:20,400
listening no Alexa listens only for the
 

2319
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,910
listening no Alexa listens only for the
wake word on the device right and awake

2320
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:22,920
wake word on the device right and awake
 

2321
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,930
wake word on the device right and awake
word is the words like Alexa Amazon echo

2322
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:26,940
word is the words like Alexa Amazon echo
 

2323
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:29,180
word is the words like Alexa Amazon echo
and you but do you only choose one at a

2324
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:29,190
and you but do you only choose one at a
 

2325
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:31,340
and you but do you only choose one at a
time so you choose one and it listens

2326
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:31,350
time so you choose one and it listens
 

2327
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,370
time so you choose one and it listens
only for that on our devices so that's

2328
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:34,380
only for that on our devices so that's
 

2329
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,530
only for that on our devices so that's
first from a listening perspective we

2330
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:36,540
first from a listening perspective we
 

2331
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,000
first from a listening perspective we
have to be very clear that it's just the

2332
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,010
have to be very clear that it's just the
 

2333
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:39,830
have to be very clear that it's just the
wake word so you said why is there this

2334
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:39,840
wake word so you said why is there this
 

2335
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:41,810
wake word so you said why is there this
anxiety if you make yeah it's because

2336
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:41,820
anxiety if you make yeah it's because
 

2337
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,000
anxiety if you make yeah it's because
there's a lot of confusion what it

2338
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:44,010
there's a lot of confusion what it
 

2339
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:46,490
there's a lot of confusion what it
really listens to right and you and I

2340
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:46,500
really listens to right and you and I
 

2341
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:47,930
really listens to right and you and I
think it's partly on us to keep

2342
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:47,940
think it's partly on us to keep
 

2343
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:51,080
think it's partly on us to keep
educating our customers and the general

2344
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,090
educating our customers and the general
 

2345
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:53,360
educating our customers and the general
media more in terms of like how what

2346
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:53,370
media more in terms of like how what
 

2347
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:55,220
media more in terms of like how what
really happens and we've done a lot of

2348
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:55,230
really happens and we've done a lot of
 

2349
00:48:55,230 --> 00:48:59,870
really happens and we've done a lot of
it and with our pages on information are

2350
00:48:59,870 --> 00:48:59,880
it and with our pages on information are
 

2351
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,680
it and with our pages on information are
clear but still people have to have more

2352
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:03,690
clear but still people have to have more
 

2353
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,570
clear but still people have to have more
there's always a hunger for information

2354

more more comfortable to the benefits we
get by sharing more data first let me

2488
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:53,990
get by sharing more data first let me
 

2489
00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:55,600
get by sharing more data first let me
answer that part and then I'll want to

2490
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:55,610
answer that part and then I'll want to
 

2491
00:51:55,610 --> 00:51:57,100
answer that part and then I'll want to
go back to the other aspect you were

2492
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:57,110
go back to the other aspect you were
 

2493
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:01,030
go back to the other aspect you were
mentioning so as a society on a general

2494
00:52:01,030 --> 00:52:01,040
mentioning so as a society on a general
 

2495

2499
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,390
society doesn't mean that everyone is
and I think we have to respect that

2500
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:07,400
and I think we have to respect that
 

2501
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:10,240
and I think we have to respect that
I don't think one-size-fits-all is

2502
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,250
I don't think one-size-fits-all is

always gonna be the answer for all right
by definition so I think that's is

2506
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
by definition so I think that's is
 

2507
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,380
by definition so I think that's is
something to keep in mind in these going

2508
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:17,390
something to keep in mind in these going
 

2509
00:52:17,390 --> 00:52:22,060
something to keep in mind in these going
back to your on what more magical

2510
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:22,070
back to your on what more magical
 

2511
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:24,040
back to your on what more magical
experiences can be launched in these

2512
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:24,050
experiences can be launched in these
 

2513
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,310
experiences can be launched in these
kind of AI settings I think again if you

2514
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:27,320
kind of AI settings I think again if you
 

2515
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,610
kind of AI settings I think again if you
give the control we it's possible

2516
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:30,620
give the control we it's possible
 

2517
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,470
give the control we it's possible
certain parts of it so if you have a

2518
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:32,480
certain parts of it so if you have a
 

2519
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,480
certain parts of it so if you have a
feature called follow-up mode where you

2520
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:34,490
feature called follow-up mode where you
 

2521
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:38,650
feature called follow-up mode where you
if you turn it on and Alexa after you've

2522
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:38,660
if you turn it on and Alexa after you've
 

2523
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,830
if you turn it on and Alexa after you've
spoken to it will open the mics again

2524
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:41,840
spoken to it will open the mics again
 

2525
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,470
spoken to it will open the mics again
thinking you lanced something again yeah

2526
00:52:44,470 --> 00:52:44,480
thinking you lanced something again yeah
 

2527
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:46,690
thinking you lanced something again yeah
like if you're adding lists to your

2528
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:46,700
like if you're adding lists to your
 

2529
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,760
like if you're adding lists to your
shopping items so right or a shopping

2530
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:48,770

00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:52,420
list or to-do list
you're not done you want to keep so in

2534
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:52,430
you're not done you want to keep so in
 

2535
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:54,220
you're not done you want to keep so in
that setting it's awesome that it opens

2536
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:54,230
that setting it's awesome that it opens
 

2537

of things which you can empower so I and
 

2543
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:02,500
of things which you can empower so I and
then another feature we have which is

2544
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:02,510
then another feature we have which is
 

2545
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,680
then another feature we have which is
called Alexa guard I said it only

2546
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:05,690
called Alexa guard I said it only
 

2547
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:07,960
called Alexa guard I said it only
listens for the wake word all right but

2548
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:07,970
listens for the wake word all right but
 

2549
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:10,060
listens for the wake word all right but
if you have a let's say you're going to

2550
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,070
if you have a let's say you're going to
 

2551
00:53:10,070 --> 00:53:12,640
if you have a let's say you're going to
say Lex you leave your home and you want

2552
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:12,650
say Lex you leave your home and you want
 

2553
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:14,590
say Lex you leave your home and you want
a lexer to listen for a couple of sound

2554
00:53:14,590 --> 00:53:14,600
a lexer to listen for a couple of sound
 

2555
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,780
a lexer to listen for a couple of sound
events like smoke alarm going off or

2556
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:16,790
events like smoke alarm going off or
 

2557
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:19,390
events like smoke alarm going off or
someone breaking your glass right so

2558
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:19,400
someone breaking your glass right so
 

2559
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,490
someone breaking your glass right so
it's like just to keep your peace of

2560
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:21,500
it's like just to keep your peace of
 

2561
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,150
it's like just to keep your peace of
mind so you can say Alexa on guard or

2562
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160
mind so you can say Alexa on guard or
 

2563
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,390
mind so you can say Alexa on guard or
I'm away or and then it can be listening

2564
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,400
I'm away or and then it can be listening
 

2565
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,560
I'm away or and then it can be listening
for these sound events and when you're

2566
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:29,570
for these sound events and when you're
 

2567
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:32,560
for these sound events and when you're
home it you come out of that mode right

2568
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:32,570
home it you come out of that mode right
 

2569
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:34,540
home it you come out of that mode right
so this is another one where you again

2570
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:34,550
so this is another one where you again
 

2571
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:36,550
so this is another one where you again
gave controls in the hands of the user

2572
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:36,560
gave controls in the hands of the user
 

2573
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,339
gave controls in the hands of the user
or the custom

2574
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:37,349
or the custom
 

2575
00:53:37,349 --> 00:53:40,489
or the custom
and to enable some experience that is

2576
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:40,499
and to enable some experience that is
 

2577
00:53:40,499 --> 00:53:43,279
and to enable some experience that is
you higher utility and maybe even more

2578
00:53:43,279 --> 00:53:43,289
you higher utility and maybe even more
 

2579
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:44,690
you higher utility and maybe even more
delightful in the certain settings like

2580
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:44,700
delightful in the certain settings like
 

2581
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:47,180
delightful in the certain settings like
follow up more and so forth again this

2582
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:47,190
follow up more and so forth again this
 

2583
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:48,769
follow up more and so forth again this
general principle is the same

2584
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:48,779
general principle is the same
 

2585
00:53:48,779 --> 00:53:52,849
general principle is the same
control in the hands of the Castro so I

2586
00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:52,859
control in the hands of the Castro so I
 

2587
00:53:52,859 --> 00:53:54,799
control in the hands of the Castro so I
know we kind of started with a lot of

2588
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:54,809
know we kind of started with a lot of
 

2589
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:55,910
know we kind of started with a lot of
philosophy and a lot of interesting

2590
00:53:55,910 --> 00:53:55,920
philosophy and a lot of interesting
 

2591
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,739
philosophy and a lot of interesting
topics and we'll just jumping all over

2592
00:53:57,739 --> 00:53:57,749
topics and we'll just jumping all over
 

2593
00:53:57,749 --> 00:53:59,599
topics and we'll just jumping all over
the place but really some of the

2594
00:53:59,599 --> 00:53:59,609
the place but really some of the
 

2595
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:02,180
the place but really some of the
fascinating things at the alexa team and

2596
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:02,190
fascinating things at the alexa team and
 

2597
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:04,549
fascinating things at the alexa team and
Amazon's doings in the the algorithm

2598
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:04,559
Amazon's doings in the the algorithm
 

2599
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,200
Amazon's doings in the the algorithm

2603
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:11,229
deep learning machine learning and and
so on so can you give a brief history of

2604
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:11,239
so on so can you give a brief history of
 

2605
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:14,809
so on so can you give a brief history of
Alexa from the perspective of just

00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:25,440
in Amazon everything starts with the
 

2615
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,130
in Amazon everything starts with the
customer and we have a process called

2616
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:28,140
customer and we have a process called
 

2617

specifically then the product echo there

2620
00:54:35,150 --> 00:54:35,160
specifically then the product echo there
 

2621
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,799
specifically then the product echo there
was a working backwards document

2622
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:36,809
was a working backwards document
 

2623
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:38,630
was a working backwards document
essentially that reflected what it would

2624
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
essentially that reflected what it would
 

2625
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,469

a full-fledged document along the way
 

2631
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,930
a full-fledged document along the way
changed into what all it can do right

2632
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:50,940
changed into what all it can do right
 

2633
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,059
changed into what all it can do right
you can but the inspiration was the Star

2634
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:53,069
you can but the inspiration was the Star

Trek computer so when you think of it

2636
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:54,930
Trek computer so when you think of it
 

2637
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:57,079
Trek computer so when you think of it
that way you know everything is possible

2638
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:57,089
that way you know everything is possible
 

2639
00:54:57,089 --> 00:54:58,430
that way you know everything is possible
but when you launch a product you have

2640
00:54:58,430 --> 00:54:58,440
but when you launch a product you have
 

2641
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,819
but when you launch a product you have
to start with someplace and when I

2642
00:55:01,819 --> 00:55:01,829
to start with someplace and when I
 

2643
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:04,700
to start with someplace and when I
joined we the product was already in

2644
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:04,710
joined we the product was already in
 

2645
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,609
joined we the product was already in
conception and we started working on the

2646
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:07,619
conception and we started working on the
 

2647
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,170
conception and we started working on the
far field speech recognition because

2648
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:09,180
far field speech recognition because
 

2649
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,059
far field speech recognition because
that was the first thing to solve by

2650
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:11,069
that was the first thing to solve by
 

2651
00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:12,499
that was the first thing to solve by
that we mean that you should be able to

2652
00:55:12,499 --> 00:55:12,509
that we mean that you should be able to
 

2653
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,870
that we mean that you should be able to
speak to the device from a distance and

2654
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
speak to the device from a distance and
 

2655
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,299
speak to the device from a distance and
in those days that wasn't a common

2656
00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:17,309
in those days that wasn't a common
 

2657
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:21,109
in those days that wasn't a common
practice and even in the previous

2658
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
practice and even in the previous
 

2659
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,969
practice and even in the previous
research world I was in was considered

2660
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:22,979
research world I was in was considered
 

2661
00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:24,950
research world I was in was considered
to an unsolvable problem then in terms

2662
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:24,960
to an unsolvable problem then in terms
 

2663
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,529
to an unsolvable problem then in terms
of whether you can converse from a

00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:27,539
of whether you can converse from a
 

2665
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:29,599
of whether you can converse from a
length and here I'm still talking about

2666
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:29,609
length and here I'm still talking about
 

2667
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:31,759
length and here I'm still talking about
the first part of the problem where you

2668
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:31,769
the first part of the problem where you
 

2669
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:34,099
the first part of the problem where you
say get the attention of the device as

2670
00:55:34,099 --> 00:55:34,109
say get the attention of the device as
 

2671
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:36,279
say get the attention of the device as
in by saying what we call the wake word

2672
00:55:36,279 --> 00:55:36,289
in by saying what we call the wake word
 

2673
00:55:36,289 --> 00:55:39,920
in by saying what we call the wake word
which means the word Alexa has to be

2674
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:39,930
which means the word Alexa has to be
 

2675
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:41,779
which means the word Alexa has to be
detected with a very high accuracy

2676
00:55:41,779 --> 00:55:41,789
detected with a very high accuracy
 

2677
00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:45,200
detected with a very high accuracy
because it is a very common word it has

2678
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:45,210
because it is a very common word it has
 

2679
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,599
because it is a very common word it has
sound units that map with words like I

2680
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:47,609
sound units that map with words like I
 

2681
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:50,210
sound units that map with words like I
like you or Alec Alex

2682
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:50,220
like you or Alec Alex
 

2683
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,800
like you or Alec Alex
right so it's a undoubtably hard problem

2684
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:54,810
right so it's a undoubtably hard problem
 

2685
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:58,040
right so it's a undoubtably hard problem
to detect the right mentions of Alexa's

2686
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:58,050
to detect the right mentions of Alexa's
 

2687
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:01,940
to detect the right mentions of Alexa's
address to the device versus I like

2688
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:01,950
address to the device versus I like
 

2689
00:56:01,950 --> 00:56:03,890
address to the device versus I like
Alexa you have to pick up that signal

2690
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:03,900
Alexa you have to pick up that signal
 

2691
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,440
Alexa you have to pick up that signal
when there's a lot of noise not only

2692
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:06,450
when there's a lot of noise not only
 

2693
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,870
when there's a lot of noise not only
noise north conversation they are in the

2694
00:56:08,870 --> 00:56:08,880
noise north conversation they are in the
 

2695
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,280

house while you remember on the device

2696
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,290
house while you remember on the device
 

2697
00:56:10,290 --> 00:56:11,840
house while you remember on the device
you are simply listening for the wake

2698
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:11,850
you are simply listening for the wake
 

2699
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:14,390
you are simply listening for the wake
word Alexa and there's a lot of words

podcast conversation out loud like

2726
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:49,410
podcast conversation out loud like
 

2727
00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:51,320
podcast conversation out loud like
what's the probability that an Alexa

2728
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:51,330
what's the probability that an Alexa
 

2729
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,970
what's the probability that an Alexa
device will go off because we mention

2730
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:52,980
device will go off because we mention
 

2731
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:56,750
device will go off because we mention
Alexa like a million times so it will we

2732
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:56,760
Alexa like a million times so it will we
 

2733
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,980
Alexa like a million times so it will we
have done a lot of different things

2734
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:57,990
have done a lot of different things
 

2735
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:02,140
have done a lot of different things
where we can figure out that there is

2736
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:02,150
where we can figure out that there is
 

2737
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:05,330
where we can figure out that there is
the device the speech is coming from a

the device the speech is coming from a
 

2739
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,810
the device the speech is coming from a
human versus over there also I mean in

2740
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:08,820
human versus over there also I mean in
 

2741
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:11,240
human versus over there also I mean in
terms of like also it is think about ads

2742
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:11,250
terms of like also it is think about ads
 

2743
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,210
terms of like also it is think about ads
or so we have also launched a technology

2744
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:14,220
or so we have also launched a technology
 

2745
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,430
or so we have also launched a technology
for watermarking kind of approaches in

2746
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:16,440
for watermarking kind of approaches in
 

2747
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:19,370
for watermarking kind of approaches in
terms of filtering it out but yes if

2748
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:19,380
terms of filtering it out but yes if
 

2749
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,740
terms of filtering it out but yes if
this kind of a podcast is happening it's

2750
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:21,750
this kind of a podcast is happening it's
 

2751
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,450
this kind of a podcast is happening it's
possible your device will wake up a few

2752
00:57:23,450 --> 00:57:23,460
possible your device will wake up a few
 

2753
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,230
possible your device will wake up a few
times it's an unsolved problem but it is

2754
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:26,240
times it's an unsolved problem but it is
 

2755
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:30,530
times it's an unsolved problem but it is
definitely something we care very much

2756
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:30,540
definitely something we care very much
 

2757
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:32,300
definitely something we care very much
about but the idea is you wanna detect

2758
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:32,310

00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,290
part so that was the first relief that's
 

2767
00:57:43,290 --> 00:57:45,290
part so that was the first relief that's
the first of the world's best detector

the first of the world's best detector
 

2769
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:45,740
the first of the world's best detector
of course

2770
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:45,750
of course
 

2771
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:47,900
of course
yeah the FIR world's best wait word

2772
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:47,910
yeah the FIR world's best wait word
 

2773
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:49,910
yeah the FIR world's best wait word

house or 20 feet away and you still get
 

2783
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:02,180
house or 20 feet away and you still get
an answer so that was the first part the

2784
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:02,190
an answer so that was the first part the
 

2785
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:03,650
an answer so that was the first part the
next is

2786
00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:03,660
next is
 

2787
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:06,319
next is
you're speaking to the device of course

2788
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:06,329
you're speaking to the device of course
 

2789

was this is this before neural networks

2830
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:53,760
was this is this before neural networks
 

2831
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,380
was this is this before neural networks
began to start to seriously prove

2832
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:57,390
began to start to seriously prove
 

2833
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,980
began to start to seriously prove
themselves in audio space yeah this is

2834
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:00,990
themselves in audio space yeah this is
 

2835
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:05,150
themselves in audio space yeah this is
around so I joined in 2013 in April

2836
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:05,160
around so I joined in 2013 in April
 

2837
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,970
around so I joined in 2013 in April
right so the early research in neural

2838
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:07,980
right so the early research in neural
 

2839
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,279
right so the early research in neural
networks coming back and showing some

2840
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:10,289
networks coming back and showing some
 

2841
00:59:10,289 --> 00:59:12,319
networks coming back and showing some
promising results in speech recognition

2842
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:12,329
promising results in speech recognition
 

2843
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:13,940
promising results in speech recognition
space had started happening but it was

2844
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:13,950
space had started happening but it was
 

2845
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:17,029
space had started happening but it was
very early yeah but we just took now

2846
00:59:17,029 --> 00:59:17,039
very early yeah but we just took now
 

2847
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:19,819
very early yeah but we just took now
build on that on the very first thing we

2848
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:19,829
build on that on the very first thing we
 

2849
00:59:19,829 --> 00:59:22,609
build on that on the very first thing we
did when when I join and we with the

2850
00:59:22,609 --> 00:59:22,619
did when when I join and we with the
 

2851
00:59:22,619 --> 00:59:24,710
did when when I join and we with the
team and remember it was a very smudge

2852
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:24,720
team and remember it was a very smudge
 

2853
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,569
team and remember it was a very smudge
of a start-up environment which is great

2854
00:59:26,569 --> 00:59:26,579
of a start-up environment which is great
 

2855
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:30,500
of a start-up environment which is great
about Amazon and we double down on deep

2856
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:30,510
about Amazon and we double down on deep
 

2857
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:34,250
about Amazon and we double down on deep
learning right away and we we knew will

2858
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:34,260
learning right away and we we knew will
 

2859
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:36,859
learning right away and we we knew will
have to improve accuracy fast and

2860
00:59:36,859 --> 00:59:36,869
have to improve accuracy fast and
 

2861
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,349
have to improve accuracy fast and
because of that we worked on and the

2862
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
because of that we worked on and the
 

2863
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,299
because of that we worked on and the
scale of data once you have a device

2864
00:59:41,299 --> 00:59:41,309
scale of data once you have a device
 

2865
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,519
scale of data once you have a device
like this if it is successful will

2866
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:43,529
like this if it is successful will
 

2867
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:45,620
like this if it is successful will
improve big time like you'll suddenly

2868
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:45,630
improve big time like you'll suddenly
 

2869
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,769
improve big time like you'll suddenly
have large volumes of data to learn from

2870
00:59:48,769 --> 00:59:48,779
have large volumes of data to learn from
 

2871
00:59:48,779 --> 00:59:50,510
have large volumes of data to learn from
to make the customer experience better

2872
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:50,520
to make the customer experience better
 

2873
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:52,789
to make the customer experience better
so how do you scale deep learning so we

2874
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:52,799
so how do you scale deep learning so we
 

2875
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,359
so how do you scale deep learning so we
did are one of the first works in in

2876
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:55,369
did are one of the first works in in
 

2877
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:58,250
did are one of the first works in in
training with distributed GPUs and where

2878
00:59:58,250 --> 00:59:58,260
training with distributed GPUs and where
 

2879
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,859
training with distributed GPUs and where
the training time was you know was

2880
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:00,869
the training time was you know was
 

2881
01:00:00,869 --> 01:00:03,380
the training time was you know was
linear in terms of like in the amount of

2882
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:03,390
linear in terms of like in the amount of
 

2883
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:05,779
linear in terms of like in the amount of
data so that was quite important work

2884
01:00:05,779 --> 01:00:05,789
data so that was quite important work
 

2885
01:00:05,789 --> 01:00:08,089
data so that was quite important work
where it was algorithmic improvements as

2886
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:08,099
where it was algorithmic improvements as
 

2887
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:09,140
where it was algorithmic improvements as
well as a lot of engineering

2888
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:09,150
well as a lot of engineering
 

2889
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:11,000
well as a lot of engineering
improvements to be able to train on

2890
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,010
improvements to be able to train on
 

2891
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,180
improvements to be able to train on
thousands and thousand of speech and

2892
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:14,190
thousands and thousand of speech and
 

2893
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:16,519
thousands and thousand of speech and
that was an important factor so the if

2894
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:16,529
that was an important factor so the if
 

2895
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:17,520
that was an important factor so the if
you ask me like

2896
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:17,530
you ask me like
 

2897
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:20,790
you ask me like
back in 2013 and 2014 when we launched

2898
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:20,800
back in 2013 and 2014 when we launched
 

2899
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,010
back in 2013 and 2014 when we launched

we had available on AWS even then was

2904
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:33,400
we had available on AWS even then was
 

2905
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,810
we had available on AWS even then was
all came together for us to be able to

2906
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:35,820
all came together for us to be able to
 

2907
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,220
all came together for us to be able to
solve the far field speech recognition

2908
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:38,230
solve the far field speech recognition
 

2909
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,960
solve the far field speech recognition
to the extent it could be useful to the

2910
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:39,970
to the extent it could be useful to the
 

2911
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,700
to the extent it could be useful to the
customers it still not solved like I

2912
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:41,710
customers it still not solved like I
 

2913
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,230
customers it still not solved like I
mean it's not that we are perfect at

2914
01:00:43,230 --> 01:00:43,240
mean it's not that we are perfect at
 

2915
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,420
mean it's not that we are perfect at
recognizing speech but we are great at

2916
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:45,430
recognizing speech but we are great at
 

2917
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:47,730
recognizing speech but we are great at
it in terms of the settings that are in

2918
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:47,740
it in terms of the settings that are in
 

2919
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,380
it in terms of the settings that are in
homes right so and that was important

2920
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:49,390
homes right so and that was important
 

2921
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:51,990
homes right so and that was important
even in the early stages the first even

2922
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:52,000
even in the early stages the first even
 

2923
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,170
even in the early stages the first even
I'm trying to look back at that time if

2924
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:55,180
I'm trying to look back at that time if
 

2925
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:58,890
I'm trying to look back at that time if
I remember correctly that it was it

2926
01:00:58,890 --> 01:00:58,900
I remember correctly that it was it
 

2927
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:00,300
I remember correctly that it was it
seems like the task will be pretty

2928
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:00,310
seems like the task will be pretty
 

2929
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:03,750
seems like the task will be pretty
daunting so like so we kind of take it

2930
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
daunting so like so we kind of take it
 

2931
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,530
daunting so like so we kind of take it
for granted that it works now yes right

2932
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:07,540
for granted that it works now yes right
 

2933
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:10,200
for granted that it works now yes right
so let me like how first time you

2934
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:10,210
so let me like how first time you
 

2935
01:01:10,210 --> 01:01:12,150
so let me like how first time you
mentioned startup I wasn't familiar how

2936
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:12,160
mentioned startup I wasn't familiar how
 

2937
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,440
mentioned startup I wasn't familiar how
big the team was I kind of because I

2938
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:13,450
big the team was I kind of because I
 

2939
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:15,210
big the team was I kind of because I
know there's a lot of really smart

2940
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:15,220
know there's a lot of really smart
 

2941
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,560
know there's a lot of really smart
people working on looks and I was very

2942
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:16,570
people working on looks and I was very
 

2943
01:01:16,570 --> 01:01:21,000
people working on looks and I was very
very large team how big was the team how

2944
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:21,010
very large team how big was the team how
 

2945
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,400
very large team how big was the team how
likely were you to fail in the highs of

2946
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:23,410
likely were you to fail in the highs of
 

2947
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:29,130
likely were you to fail in the highs of
everyone else like what I'll give you a

2948
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:29,140
everyone else like what I'll give you a
 

2949
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:31,860
everyone else like what I'll give you a
very interesting anecdote on that when I

2950
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:31,870
very interesting anecdote on that when I
 

2951
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:34,650
very interesting anecdote on that when I
joined the team the speech recognition

2952
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:34,660
joined the team the speech recognition
 

2953
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,730
joined the team the speech recognition
team was six people my first meeting and

2954
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:38,740
team was six people my first meeting and
 

2955
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,040
team was six people my first meeting and
we had hired a few more people it was 10

2956
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,050
we had hired a few more people it was 10
 

2957
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,670
we had hired a few more people it was 10
people 9 out of 10 people thought it

2958
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:44,680
people 9 out of 10 people thought it
 

2959
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:50,400
people 9 out of 10 people thought it
can't be done who was the one the one

2960
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:50,410
can't be done who was the one the one
 

2961
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:53,520
can't be done who was the one the one
was me and actually I should say and one

2962
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:53,530
was me and actually I should say and one
 

2963
01:01:53,530 --> 01:01:57,810
was me and actually I should say and one
was say my optimistic yeah and and 8th

2964
01:01:57,810 --> 01:01:57,820
was say my optimistic yeah and and 8th
 

2965
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,060
was say my optimistic yeah and and 8th
we're trying to convince let's go to the

2966
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:00,070
we're trying to convince let's go to the
 

2967
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,760
we're trying to convince let's go to the
management and say let's not work on

2968
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:02,770
management and say let's not work on
 

2969
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,650
management and say let's not work on
this problem let's work on some other

2970
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:04,660
this problem let's work on some other
 

2971
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,920
this problem let's work on some other
problem like either telephony speech for

2972
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:07,930
problem like either telephony speech for
 

2973
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:10,290
problem like either telephony speech for
customer service calls and so forth but

2974
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:10,300
customer service calls and so forth but
 

2975
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:11,610
customer service calls and so forth but
this was the kind of belief you must

2976
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:11,620
this was the kind of belief you must
 

2977
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:13,620
this was the kind of belief you must
have and I had experience with far-field

2978
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:13,630
have and I had experience with far-field
 

2979
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,630
have and I had experience with far-field
speech recognition and I my eyes lit up

2980
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:15,640
speech recognition and I my eyes lit up
 

2981
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,580
speech recognition and I my eyes lit up
and I saw a problem like that saying

2982
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:17,590
and I saw a problem like that saying
 

2983
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:20,300
and I saw a problem like that saying
okay we have been in speech recognition

2984
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:20,310
okay we have been in speech recognition
 

2985
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:23,280
okay we have been in speech recognition
always looking for that killer app and

2986
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:23,290
always looking for that killer app and
 

2987
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:26,580
always looking for that killer app and
this was a killer use case to bring

2988
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:26,590
this was a killer use case to bring
 

2989
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,230
this was a killer use case to bring
something delightful in the hands of

2990
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,240
something delightful in the hands of
 

2991
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,780
something delightful in the hands of
customers you mentioned you the way kind

2992
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:30,790
customers you mentioned you the way kind
 

2993
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:31,270
customers you mentioned you the way kind
of think of

2994
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:31,280
of think of
 

2995
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,860
of think of
the product way in the future have a

2996
01:02:32,860 --> 01:02:32,870
the product way in the future have a
 

2997
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:34,750
the product way in the future have a
press release and an FAQ and you think

2998
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:34,760
press release and an FAQ and you think
 

2999
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,750
press release and an FAQ and you think
backwards that's did you have that the

3000
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:37,760
backwards that's did you have that the
 

3001
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,200
backwards that's did you have that the
team have the echo and mind

3002
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:40,210
team have the echo and mind
 

3003
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,640
team have the echo and mind
so this far-field speech recognition

3004
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:42,650
so this far-field speech recognition
 

3005
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:44,350
so this far-field speech recognition
actually putting a thing in the home

3006
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:44,360
actually putting a thing in the home
 

3007
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:46,390
actually putting a thing in the home
that works it's able to interact with

3008
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
that works it's able to interact with
 

3009
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,640
that works it's able to interact with
was that the press release what was the

3010
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:48,650
was that the press release what was the
 

3011
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:51,550
was that the press release what was the
way close I would say in terms of the as

3012
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:51,560
way close I would say in terms of the as
 

3013
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:54,130
way close I would say in terms of the as
I said the vision was started computer

3014
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:54,140
I said the vision was started computer
 

3015
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:57,670
I said the vision was started computer
right or the inspiration and from there

3016
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
right or the inspiration and from there
 

3017
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,860
right or the inspiration and from there
I can't divulge all the exact

3018
01:02:59,860 --> 01:02:59,870
I can't divulge all the exact
 

3019
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,470
I can't divulge all the exact
specifications but one of the first

3020
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,480
specifications but one of the first
 

3021
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,360
specifications but one of the first
things that was magical on a lexer was

3022
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:07,370
things that was magical on a lexer was
 

3023
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,990
things that was magical on a lexer was
music it brought me to back to music

3024
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:11,000
music it brought me to back to music
 

3025
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,760
music it brought me to back to music
because my taste was still and when I

3026
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:12,770
because my taste was still and when I
 

3027
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,890
because my taste was still and when I
was an undergrad right so I still listen

3028
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:14,900
was an undergrad right so I still listen
 

3029
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,130
was an undergrad right so I still listen
to those songs and I it was too hard for

3030
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:18,140
to those songs and I it was too hard for
 

3031
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,340
to those songs and I it was too hard for
me to be a music fan with a phone right

3032
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:21,350
me to be a music fan with a phone right
 

3033
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,080
me to be a music fan with a phone right
so I and I don't I hate things in my

3034
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:23,090
so I and I don't I hate things in my
 

3035
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,050
so I and I don't I hate things in my
ears so from that perspective it was

3036
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:26,060
ears so from that perspective it was
 

3037
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:29,980
ears so from that perspective it was
quite hard and and and music was part of

3038
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:29,990
quite hard and and and music was part of
 

3039
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:33,310
quite hard and and and music was part of
the at least the documents I have seen

3040
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:33,320
the at least the documents I have seen
 

3041
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,260
the at least the documents I have seen
right so so from that perspective I

3042
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:35,270
right so so from that perspective I
 

3043
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:39,280
right so so from that perspective I
think yes in terms of our how far are we

3044
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:39,290
think yes in terms of our how far are we
 

3045
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,680
think yes in terms of our how far are we
from the original vision I can't reveal

3046
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:41,690
from the original vision I can't reveal
 

3047
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:44,020
from the original vision I can't reveal
that words that's why I have done a fun

3048
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:44,030
that words that's why I have done a fun
 

3049
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,510
that words that's why I have done a fun
at work because every day we go in and

3050
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:46,520
at work because every day we go in and
 

3051
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:48,010
at work because every day we go in and
thinking like these are the new set of

3052
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:48,020
thinking like these are the new set of
 

3053
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:49,510
thinking like these are the new set of
challenges to solve yeah that's a great

3054
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
challenges to solve yeah that's a great
 

3055
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:52,390
challenges to solve yeah that's a great
way to do great engineering is you think

3056
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:52,400
way to do great engineering is you think
 

3057
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,980
way to do great engineering is you think
of the product press release I like that

3058
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:53,990
of the product press release I like that
 

3059
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:54,340
of the product press release I like that
idea

3060
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:54,350
idea
 

3061
01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:56,710
idea
maybe we'll talk about it a bit later

3062
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:56,720
maybe we'll talk about it a bit later
 

3063
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,600
maybe we'll talk about it a bit later
was just a super nice way to have

3064
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:58,610
was just a super nice way to have
 

3065
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,100
was just a super nice way to have
focused I'll tell you this you're a

3066
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:00,110
focused I'll tell you this you're a
 

3067
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,500
focused I'll tell you this you're a
scientist and a lot of my scientists

3068
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:02,510
scientist and a lot of my scientists
 

3069
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:04,900
scientist and a lot of my scientists
have adopted that they they have now

3070
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:04,910
have adopted that they they have now
 

3071
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:07,390
have adopted that they they have now
they love it as a process because it was

3072
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:07,400
they love it as a process because it was
 

3073
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,000
they love it as a process because it was
very a scientist you're trained to write

3074
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:10,010
very a scientist you're trained to write
 

3075
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:12,040
very a scientist you're trained to write
great papers but they are all after

3076
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:12,050
great papers but they are all after
 

3077
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:13,720
great papers but they are all after
you've done the research or you're

3078
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:13,730
you've done the research or you're
 

3079
01:04:13,730 --> 01:04:15,940
you've done the research or you're
proven lie and your PhD dissertation

3080
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:15,950
proven lie and your PhD dissertation
 

3081
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,890
proven lie and your PhD dissertation
proposal is something that comes closest

3082
01:04:17,890 --> 01:04:17,900
proposal is something that comes closest
 

3083
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:21,250
proposal is something that comes closest
or a DARPA proposal or NSF proposal is

3084
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:21,260
or a DARPA proposal or NSF proposal is
 

3085
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,230
or a DARPA proposal or NSF proposal is
the closest that comes to a press

3086
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:23,240
the closest that comes to a press
 

3087
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,030
the closest that comes to a press
release but that process is now

3088
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:25,040
release but that process is now
 

3089
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:27,250
release but that process is now
ingrained in our scientists which is

3090
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:27,260
ingrained in our scientists which is
 

3091
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:31,300
ingrained in our scientists which is
like delightful for me to see you write

3092
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:31,310
like delightful for me to see you write
 

3093
01:04:31,310 --> 01:04:32,650
like delightful for me to see you write
the paper first then make it happen

3094
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:32,660
the paper first then make it happen
 

3095
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,150
the paper first then make it happen
that's right in fact that's not

3096
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:34,160
that's right in fact that's not
 

3097
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:36,940
that's right in fact that's not
state-of-the-art results or you leave

3098
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:36,950
state-of-the-art results or you leave
 

3099
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:38,980
state-of-the-art results or you leave
the results section open well you have a

3100
01:04:38,980 --> 01:04:38,990
the results section open well you have a
 

3101
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,530
the results section open well you have a
thesis about here's what I expect right

3102
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:41,540
thesis about here's what I expect right
 

3103
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,800
thesis about here's what I expect right
and here's what it will change

3104
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:43,810
and here's what it will change
 

3105
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,110
and here's what it will change
Yeah right so I think it is a great

3106
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:46,120
Yeah right so I think it is a great
 

3107
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,020
Yeah right so I think it is a great
thing it works for researchers as well

3108
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:48,030
thing it works for researchers as well
 

3109
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:51,530
thing it works for researchers as well
they're so far field recognition yeah

3110
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,540
they're so far field recognition yeah
 

3111
01:04:51,540 --> 01:04:54,810
they're so far field recognition yeah
what was the big leap what what were the

3112
01:04:54,810 --> 01:04:54,820
what was the big leap what what were the
 

3113
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,880
what was the big leap what what were the
breakthroughs and yeah what was that

3114
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:56,890
breakthroughs and yeah what was that
 

3115
01:04:56,890 --> 01:04:59,070
breakthroughs and yeah what was that
journey liked it today yeah I think the

3116
01:04:59,070 --> 01:04:59,080
journey liked it today yeah I think the
 

3117
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,600
journey liked it today yeah I think the
as you said first there was a lot of

3118
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:00,610
as you said first there was a lot of
 

3119
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:02,790
as you said first there was a lot of
skepticism on whether far-field speech

3120
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:02,800
skepticism on whether far-field speech
 

3121
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:04,890
skepticism on whether far-field speech
recognition will ever work to be good

3122
01:05:04,890 --> 01:05:04,900
recognition will ever work to be good
 

3123
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,830
recognition will ever work to be good
enough right and what we first did was

3124
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:07,840
enough right and what we first did was
 

3125
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:10,350
enough right and what we first did was
got a lot of training data in a far

3126
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:10,360
got a lot of training data in a far
 

3127
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:13,500
got a lot of training data in a far
field setting and that was extremely

3128
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:13,510
field setting and that was extremely
 

3129
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,260
field setting and that was extremely
hard to get because none of it existed

3130
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:15,270
hard to get because none of it existed
 

3131
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:18,840
hard to get because none of it existed
so how do you collect data in far field

3132
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:18,850
so how do you collect data in far field
 

3133
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,180
so how do you collect data in far field
set up right with no customer bases

3134
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:21,190
set up right with no customer bases
 

3135
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:23,010
set up right with no customer bases
there's no customer base right so that

3136
01:05:23,010 --> 01:05:23,020
there's no customer base right so that
 

3137
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,650
there's no customer base right so that
was first innovation and once we had

3138
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:25,660
was first innovation and once we had
 

3139
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,320
was first innovation and once we had
that the next thing was ok you if you

3140
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:28,330
that the next thing was ok you if you
 

3141
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:31,110
that the next thing was ok you if you
have the data first of all we didn't

3142
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:31,120
have the data first of all we didn't
 

3143
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:33,480
have the data first of all we didn't
talk about like what would magical mean

3144
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:33,490
talk about like what would magical mean
 

3145
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:35,970
talk about like what would magical mean
in this kind of a setting what is good

3146
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:35,980
in this kind of a setting what is good
 

3147
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:38,280
in this kind of a setting what is good
enough for customers right that's always

3148
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:38,290
enough for customers right that's always
 

3149
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:40,680
enough for customers right that's always
since you've never done this before what

3150
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:40,690
since you've never done this before what
 

3151
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:43,410
since you've never done this before what
would be magical so so it wasn't just a

3152
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:43,420
would be magical so so it wasn't just a
 

3153
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:46,410
would be magical so so it wasn't just a
research problem you had to put some in

3154
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:46,420
research problem you had to put some in
 

3155
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,180
research problem you had to put some in
terms of accuracy and customer

3156
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:48,190
terms of accuracy and customer
 

3157
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,640
terms of accuracy and customer
experience features some stakes on the

3158
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:50,650
experience features some stakes on the
 

3159
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,140
experience features some stakes on the
ground saying here is where I think

3160
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:52,150
ground saying here is where I think
 

3161
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:55,080
ground saying here is where I think
should it should get to so you

3162
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:55,090
should it should get to so you
 

3163
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,730
should it should get to so you
established a bar and then how do you

3164
01:05:56,730 --> 01:05:56,740
established a bar and then how do you
 

3165
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,470
established a bar and then how do you
measure progress toward is given you

3166
01:05:58,470 --> 01:05:58,480
measure progress toward is given you
 

3167
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,160
measure progress toward is given you
have no customer right now so from that

3168
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:02,170
have no customer right now so from that
 

3169
01:06:02,170 --> 01:06:04,950
have no customer right now so from that
perspective we went so first was the

3170
01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:04,960
perspective we went so first was the
 

3171
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,270
perspective we went so first was the
data without customers second was

3172
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:08,280
data without customers second was
 

3173
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,830
data without customers second was
doubling down on deep learning as a way

3174
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:10,840
doubling down on deep learning as a way
 

3175
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,830
doubling down on deep learning as a way
to learn and I can just tell you that

3176
01:06:13,830 --> 01:06:13,840
to learn and I can just tell you that
 

3177
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:16,800
to learn and I can just tell you that
the combination of the two cut our error

3178
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:16,810
the combination of the two cut our error
 

3179
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,890
the combination of the two cut our error
rates by a factor of five from where we

3180
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:19,900
rates by a factor of five from where we
 

3181
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,130
rates by a factor of five from where we
were when I started to within six months

3182
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:23,140
were when I started to within six months
 

3183
01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:26,130
were when I started to within six months
of having that data we at that point and

3184
01:06:26,130 --> 01:06:26,140
of having that data we at that point and
 

3185
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:28,980
of having that data we at that point and
I got the conviction that this will work

3186
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:28,990
I got the conviction that this will work
 

3187
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:31,680
I got the conviction that this will work
right so because that was magical in

3188
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:31,690
right so because that was magical in
 

3189
01:06:31,690 --> 01:06:33,770
right so because that was magical in
terms of when it started working and

3190
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:33,780
terms of when it started working and
 

3191
01:06:33,780 --> 01:06:36,810
terms of when it started working and
that reached them who came close to the

3192
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:36,820
that reached them who came close to the
 

3193
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:39,600
that reached them who came close to the
magical bar back to the bar right that

3194
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:39,610
magical bar back to the bar right that
 

3195
01:06:39,610 --> 01:06:43,680
magical bar back to the bar right that
we felt would be where people will use

3196
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:43,690
we felt would be where people will use
 

3197
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:45,990
we felt would be where people will use
it that was critical because you you

3198
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:46,000
it that was critical because you you
 

3199
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,290
it that was critical because you you
really have one chance at this if we had

3200
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:49,300
really have one chance at this if we had
 

3201
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:51,390
really have one chance at this if we had
launched in November 2014 years when we

3202
01:06:51,390 --> 01:06:51,400
launched in November 2014 years when we
 

3203
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,100
launched in November 2014 years when we
launched and if it was below the bar I

3204
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:53,110
launched and if it was below the bar I
 

3205
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:56,730
launched and if it was below the bar I
don't think this category exists if you

3206
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:56,740
don't think this category exists if you
 

3207
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,690
don't think this category exists if you
don't need the bar

3208
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:57,700
don't need the bar
 

3209
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,690
don't need the bar
yeah and just having looked at

3210
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:00,700
yeah and just having looked at
 

3211
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,990
yeah and just having looked at
voice-based interactions like in the car

3212
01:07:02,990 --> 01:07:03,000
voice-based interactions like in the car
 

3213
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,960
voice-based interactions like in the car
or earlier systems it's a source of huge

3214
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:06,970
or earlier systems it's a source of huge
 

3215
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:08,910
or earlier systems it's a source of huge
frustration for people in fact we use

3216
01:07:08,910 --> 01:07:08,920
frustration for people in fact we use
 

3217
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,980
frustration for people in fact we use
voice based interaction for collecting

3218
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:10,990
voice based interaction for collecting
 

3219
01:07:10,990 --> 01:07:14,010
voice based interaction for collecting
data on subjects to measure frustration

3220
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:14,020
data on subjects to measure frustration
 

3221
01:07:14,020 --> 01:07:16,049
data on subjects to measure frustration
so as a training set for computer vision

3222
01:07:16,049 --> 01:07:16,059
so as a training set for computer vision
 

3223
01:07:16,059 --> 01:07:19,260
so as a training set for computer vision
for face data so we can get a data set

3224
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:19,270
for face data so we can get a data set
 

3225
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:21,210
for face data so we can get a data set
of frustrated people that's the best way

3226
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:21,220
of frustrated people that's the best way
 

3227
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,130
of frustrated people that's the best way
to get frustrated people is having them

3228
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:23,140
to get frustrated people is having them
 

3229
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:24,870
to get frustrated people is having them
interact with a voice based system in

3230
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
interact with a voice based system in
 

3231
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,480
interact with a voice based system in
the car so this is that bar I imagine

3232
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:27,490
the car so this is that bar I imagine
 

3233
01:07:27,490 --> 01:07:29,579
the car so this is that bar I imagine
it's pretty high it was very high and we

3234
01:07:29,579 --> 01:07:29,589
it's pretty high it was very high and we
 

3235
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:32,160
it's pretty high it was very high and we
talked about how also errors are

3236
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:32,170
talked about how also errors are
 

3237
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:34,589
talked about how also errors are
perceived from a eyes versus errors by

3238
01:07:34,589 --> 01:07:34,599
perceived from a eyes versus errors by
 

3239
01:07:34,599 --> 01:07:37,920
perceived from a eyes versus errors by
humans but we are not done with the

3240
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:37,930
humans but we are not done with the
 

3241
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,410
humans but we are not done with the
problems that ended up we had to solve

3242
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:40,420
problems that ended up we had to solve
 

3243
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:42,180
problems that ended up we had to solve
to get it to launch so do you want the

3244
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:42,190
to get it to launch so do you want the
 

3245
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:48,750
to get it to launch so do you want the
next one so the next one was what I

3246
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:48,760
next one so the next one was what I
 

3247
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,280
next one so the next one was what I
think of as multi-domain

3248
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:50,290
think of as multi-domain
 

3249
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:53,069
think of as multi-domain
natural language understanding it's very

3250
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:53,079
natural language understanding it's very
 

3251
01:07:53,079 --> 01:07:56,400
natural language understanding it's very
I wouldn't say easy but it is during

3252
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:56,410
I wouldn't say easy but it is during
 

3253
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:00,599
I wouldn't say easy but it is during
those days solving it understanding in

3254
01:08:00,599 --> 01:08:00,609
those days solving it understanding in
 

3255
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:04,339
those days solving it understanding in
one domain and narrow domain was doable

3256
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:04,349
one domain and narrow domain was doable
 

3257
01:08:04,349 --> 01:08:07,650
one domain and narrow domain was doable
but for these multiple domains like

3258
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:07,660
but for these multiple domains like
 

3259
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:10,920
but for these multiple domains like
music like information other kinds of

01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:16,750
it is in terms of the number of skills

alexa has and the confusion space has
 

3269
01:08:18,489 --> 01:08:21,499
alexa has and the confusion space has
like grown by three orders of magnitude

3270
01:08:21,499 --> 01:08:21,509
like grown by three orders of magnitude
 

3271
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:24,150
like grown by three orders of magnitude
it was still daunting even those days

3272
01:08:24,150 --> 01:08:24,160
it was still daunting even those days
 

3273
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,789
it was still daunting even those days

3285
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:39,329

problem even if you have gotten the
 

3287
01:08:39,339 --> 01:08:42,419
problem even if you have gotten the
words recognized how do you make sense

3288
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:42,429
words recognized how do you make sense
 

3289
01:08:42,429 --> 01:08:47,039

of them in those days there was still a

3290
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:47,049
of them in those days there was still a
 

3291
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:49,979
of them in those days there was still a
lot of emphasis on rule-based systems

3292
01:08:49,979 --> 01:08:49,989
lot of emphasis on rule-based systems
 

3293
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:52,470
lot of emphasis on rule-based systems
for writing grammar patterns to

01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
for writing grammar patterns to
 

3295
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,329
for writing grammar patterns to
understand the intent but we had a

3296
01:08:54,329 --> 01:08:54,339
understand the intent but we had a
 

3297
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,329
understand the intent but we had a
statistical first approach even then

3298
01:08:56,329 --> 01:08:56,339
statistical first approach even then
 

3299
01:08:56,339 --> 01:08:58,860
statistical first approach even then
where for a language understanding we

3300
01:08:58,860 --> 01:08:58,870
where for a language understanding we
 

3301
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:02,910
where for a language understanding we
had in even those starting days and an

01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:02,920
had in even those starting days and an
 

3303
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,709
had in even those starting days and an
entity recognizer and an intent

classifier which was all trained
 

3307
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:09,720

01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:09,730
statistically in fact we had to build
 

3309
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:10,190

fix bugs that statistical models have
 

3315
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,810
fix bugs that statistical models have
right so it was just a different mindset

3316
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:17,820
right so it was just a different mindset
 

3317
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:20,380
right so it was just a different mindset
where we focused on data-driven

01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:20,390
where we focused on data-driven

01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,430
where we focused on data-driven
statistical understanding wins in the

end if you have a huge dataset yes it is

3322
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:25,350
end if you have a huge dataset yes it is
 

3323
01:09:25,350 --> 01:09:27,080
end if you have a huge dataset yes it is
contingent on that and that's why it

3324
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:27,090
contingent on that and that's why it
 

3325
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:28,760
contingent on that and that's why it
came back to how do you get the data

3326
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:28,770
came back to how do you get the data
 

3327
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:31,940
came back to how do you get the data
before customers the fact that this is

01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:31,950
before customers the fact that this is
 

3329
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,880
before customers the fact that this is
why data becomes crucial to get a to the

01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:41,570
system built in build up and notice that
 

3335
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:43,610
system built in build up and notice that
for here we were talking about human

3336
01:09:43,610 --> 01:09:43,620
for here we were talking about human
 

3337
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:46,180
for here we were talking about human
machine dialogue even those early days

3338
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:46,190
machine dialogue even those early days
 

3339
01:09:46,190 --> 01:09:49,460
machine dialogue even those early days
even it was very much transactional do

3340
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:49,470
even it was very much transactional do
 

3341
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,710
even it was very much transactional do
one thing one shot a transition great

3342
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:51,720
one thing one shot a transition great
 

3343
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,660
one thing one shot a transition great
way there was a lot of debate on how

3344
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:53,670
way there was a lot of debate on how
 

3345
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,190
way there was a lot of debate on how
much should Alex our talk back in terms

3346
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:55,200
much should Alex our talk back in terms
 

3347
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:58,790
much should Alex our talk back in terms
of if you misunderstood you or you said

3348
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
of if you misunderstood you or you said
 

3349
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,030
of if you misunderstood you or you said
play songs by the stones and let's say

3350
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,040
play songs by the stones and let's say
 

3351
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:04,700
play songs by the stones and let's say
it doesn't know you know early days

3352
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:04,710
it doesn't know you know early days
 

3353
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,730
it doesn't know you know early days
knowledge can be sparse who were the

3354
01:10:07,730 --> 01:10:07,740
knowledge can be sparse who were the
 

3355
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:10,700
knowledge can be sparse who were the
stones right I the Rolling Stones right

3356
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:10,710
stones right I the Rolling Stones right
 

3357
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:14,420
stones right I the Rolling Stones right
so our and you don't want them match to

3358
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:14,430
so our and you don't want them match to
 

3359
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:17,060
so our and you don't want them match to
be Stone Temple Pilots or Rolling Stones

3360
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:17,070
be Stone Temple Pilots or Rolling Stones
 

3361
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,710
be Stone Temple Pilots or Rolling Stones
right so you don't know which one it is

3362
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:18,720
right so you don't know which one it is
 

3363
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,700
right so you don't know which one it is
so these kind of other signals to know

3364
01:10:22,700 --> 01:10:22,710
so these kind of other signals to know
 

3365
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:24,850
so these kind of other signals to know
there we had great assets right from

3366
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:24,860
there we had great assets right from
 

3367
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:28,310
there we had great assets right from
Amazon in terms of you acts like what is

3368
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:28,320
Amazon in terms of you acts like what is
 

3369
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,290
Amazon in terms of you acts like what is
it what kind of yeah hurry solve that

3370
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:30,300
it what kind of yeah hurry solve that
 

3371
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,300
it what kind of yeah hurry solve that
problem in terms of what we think of it

3372
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:32,310
problem in terms of what we think of it
 

3373
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:34,190
problem in terms of what we think of it
as an entity resolution problem right so

3374
01:10:34,190 --> 01:10:34,200
as an entity resolution problem right so
 

3375
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,670
as an entity resolution problem right so
is one is it right I mean the even if

3376
01:10:37,670 --> 01:10:37,680
is one is it right I mean the even if
 

3377
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,620
is one is it right I mean the even if
you figured out the stones is an entity

3378
01:10:39,620 --> 01:10:39,630
you figured out the stones is an entity
 

3379
01:10:39,630 --> 01:10:41,630
you figured out the stones is an entity
you have to resolve it to whether it's

3380
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:41,640
you have to resolve it to whether it's
 

3381
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,970
you have to resolve it to whether it's
the stones or the temple violence or

3382
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:43,980
the stones or the temple violence or
 

3383
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:45,740
the stones or the temple violence or
some other stones maybe I misunderstood

3384
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:45,750
some other stones maybe I misunderstood
 

3385
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,810
some other stones maybe I misunderstood
is the resolution the job of the

3386
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:47,820
is the resolution the job of the
 

3387
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,390
is the resolution the job of the
algorithm or is the job of UX

3388
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
algorithm or is the job of UX
 

3389
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,010
algorithm or is the job of UX
communicating with the human to help

3390
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:52,020
communicating with the human to help
 

3391
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:54,590
communicating with the human to help
there as well there is both right it is

3392
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:54,600
there as well there is both right it is
 

3393
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:58,040
there as well there is both right it is
law you want 90 percent or high 90s to

3394
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:58,050
law you want 90 percent or high 90s to
 

3395
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,410
law you want 90 percent or high 90s to
be done without any further questioning

3396
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:00,420
be done without any further questioning
 

3397
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:03,770
be done without any further questioning
or UX right so but that it's absolutely

3398
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:03,780
or UX right so but that it's absolutely
 

3399
01:11:03,780 --> 01:11:06,620
or UX right so but that it's absolutely
okay just like as humans we asked the

3400
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:06,630
okay just like as humans we asked the
 

3401
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,180
okay just like as humans we asked the
question I didn't understand your likes

3402
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:08,190
question I didn't understand your likes
 

3403
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:10,070
question I didn't understand your likes
yeah it's fine for a lecture to

3404
01:11:10,070 --> 01:11:10,080
yeah it's fine for a lecture to
 

3405
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:11,510
yeah it's fine for a lecture to
occasionally say I did not understand

3406
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:11,520
occasionally say I did not understand
 

3407
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,360
occasionally say I did not understand
you right and and that's a important way

3408
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:14,370
you right and and that's a important way
 

3409
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:15,830
you right and and that's a important way
to learn and I'll talk about where we

3410
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:15,840
to learn and I'll talk about where we
 

3411
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,600
to learn and I'll talk about where we
have come with more self learning with

3412
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:17,610
have come with more self learning with
 

3413
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:19,779
have come with more self learning with
these kind of feedback signals

3414
01:11:19,779 --> 01:11:19,789
these kind of feedback signals
 

3415
01:11:19,789 --> 01:11:22,689
these kind of feedback signals
but in those days just solving the

3416
01:11:22,689 --> 01:11:22,699
but in those days just solving the
 

3417
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:24,790
but in those days just solving the
ability of understanding the intent and

3418
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
ability of understanding the intent and
 

3419
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,009
ability of understanding the intent and
resolving to an action where action

3420
01:11:27,009 --> 01:11:27,019
resolving to an action where action
 

3421
01:11:27,019 --> 01:11:28,930
resolving to an action where action
could be play a particular artist or a

3422
01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:28,940
could be play a particular artist or a
 

3423
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:32,379
could be play a particular artist or a
particular song was super hot again -

3424
01:11:32,379 --> 01:11:32,389
particular song was super hot again -
 

3425
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,359
particular song was super hot again -
the bar was high as as you're talking

3426
01:11:34,359 --> 01:11:34,369
the bar was high as as you're talking
 

3427
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:37,770
the bar was high as as you're talking
about right so while we launched it in

3428
01:11:37,770 --> 01:11:37,780
about right so while we launched it in
 

3429
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:41,080
about right so while we launched it in
sort of 13 big domains I would say in

3430
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:41,090
sort of 13 big domains I would say in
 

3431
01:11:41,090 --> 01:11:43,390
sort of 13 big domains I would say in
terms of or thing we think of it as 13

3432
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:43,400
terms of or thing we think of it as 13
 

3433
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,399
terms of or thing we think of it as 13
the big skills we had like music is a

3434
01:11:45,399 --> 01:11:45,409
the big skills we had like music is a
 

3435
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:48,040
the big skills we had like music is a
massive one when we launched it and now

3436
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,050

01:12:02,950 --> 01:12:02,960
it as music information right so it's
 

3447
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,109
it as music information right so it's
all whether it's a part of information

all whether it's a part of information
 

3449
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,569
all whether it's a part of information
right so then we launched we didn't have

3450
01:12:07,569 --> 01:12:07,579
right so then we launched we didn't have

this year which is our AI conference we
 

3533
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,850
this year which is our AI conference we
launched what is called Alexa

3534
01:13:46,850 --> 01:13:46,860
launched what is called Alexa
 

3535

conversations that is providing the
 

3537
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:52,569
conversations that is providing the
ability for developers to author

3538
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:52,579
ability for developers to author
 

3539
01:13:52,579 --> 01:13:55,520
ability for developers to author
multi-tone experiences on Alexa with no

3540
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:55,530
multi-tone experiences on Alexa with no
 

3541
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:58,250
multi-tone experiences on Alexa with no
code essentially in terms of the code

3542
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:58,260
code essentially in terms of the code
 

3543
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,589
code essentially in terms of the code
dialogue code initially it was like you

3544
01:14:00,589 --> 01:14:00,599
dialogue code initially it was like you
 

3545
01:14:00,599 --> 01:14:03,049
dialogue code initially it was like you
know all these IVR systems you have to

3546
01:14:03,049 --> 01:14:03,059
know all these IVR systems you have to
 

3547
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:06,500
know all these IVR systems you have to
fully author if the customer says this

3548
01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:06,510
fully author if the customer says this
 

3549
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:08,600
fully author if the customer says this
do that right so the whole dialogue flow

3550
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:08,610
do that right so the whole dialogue flow
 

3551
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:12,589
do that right so the whole dialogue flow
is hand author and with Alexa

3552
01:14:12,589 --> 01:14:12,599
is hand author and with Alexa
 

3553
01:14:12,599 --> 01:14:14,660
is hand author and with Alexa
conversations the way it is that you

just provide a sample interaction data

3556
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:16,679
just provide a sample interaction data
 

3557
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:18,319
just provide a sample interaction data
with your service or an API let's say

3558
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:18,329
with your service or an API let's say
 

3559
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:21,080
with your service or an API let's say
you're Adam take its that provides a

3560
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:21,090
you're Adam take its that provides a
 

3561
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:23,569
you're Adam take its that provides a
service for buying movie tickets you

3562
01:14:23,569 --> 01:14:23,579
service for buying movie tickets you
 

3563
01:14:23,579 --> 01:14:25,310
service for buying movie tickets you
provide a few examples of how your

3564
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:25,320
provide a few examples of how your
 

3565
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,989
provide a few examples of how your
customers will interact with your api's

3566
01:14:26,989 --> 01:14:26,999
customers will interact with your api's
 

3567
01:14:26,999 --> 01:14:28,879
customers will interact with your api's
and then the dialogue flow is

3568
01:14:28,879 --> 01:14:28,889
and then the dialogue flow is
 

3569
01:14:28,889 --> 01:14:30,439
and then the dialogue flow is
automatically constructed using a

3570

capability out and then the second part

3580
01:14:41,689 --> 01:14:41,699
capability out and then the second part
 

3581
01:14:41,699 --> 01:14:44,060
capability out and then the second part
of it which shows even increased utility

3582
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:44,070
of it which shows even increased utility
 

3583
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:48,020
of it which shows even increased utility
for customers is you and I when we

3584
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:48,030
for customers is you and I when we
 

3585
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,169
for customers is you and I when we
interact with Alexa or any customer as I

3586
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:51,179
interact with Alexa or any customer as I

even do you think I'm looking for just
movies for curiosity whether the

3600
01:15:13,220 --> 01:15:13,230
movies for curiosity whether the
 

3601
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,500

Avengers are still in theater or when

3602
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:15,510
Avengers are still in theater or when
 

3603
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,029
Avengers are still in theater or when
it's maybe it's gone and maybe it will

3604
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:17,039
it's maybe it's gone and maybe it will
 

3605
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:19,640
it's maybe it's gone and maybe it will
come on my mr. so I may watch it on

3606
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:19,650
come on my mr. so I may watch it on
 

3607
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:23,930
come on my mr. so I may watch it on
prime which happened to me so so from

01:15:23,930 --> 01:15:23,940
prime which happened to me so so from
 

3609
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:26,209
prime which happened to me so so from
that perspective now you're looking into

3610
01:15:26,209 --> 01:15:26,219
that perspective now you're looking into
 

3611
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:29,419
that perspective now you're looking into
what is my goal and let's say I now

3612
01:15:29,419 --> 01:15:29,429
what is my goal and let's say I now
 

3613
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:33,379
what is my goal and let's say I now
complete the movie ticket purchase maybe

3614
01:15:33,379 --> 01:15:33,389
complete the movie ticket purchase maybe

01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:38,059
I would like to get dinner nearby so
 

3617
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:41,000
I would like to get dinner nearby so
what is really the goal here is it night

3618
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:41,010
what is really the goal here is it night
 

3619
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:44,810
what is really the goal here is it night
out or is it movies as and just go watch

3620
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:44,820
out or is it movies as and just go watch
 

3621
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:47,760
out or is it movies as and just go watch
a movie here the answer is we don't know

3622
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:47,770
a movie here the answer is we don't know
 

3623
01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:51,440
a movie here the answer is we don't know
so can Alexa now figure we have the

3624
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:51,450
so can Alexa now figure we have the
 

3625
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:54,210
so can Alexa now figure we have the
intelligence that I think this metal

3626
01:15:54,210 --> 01:15:54,220
intelligence that I think this metal
 

3627
01:15:54,220 --> 01:15:56,760

goal is really night or at least say to

3628
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:56,770
goal is really night or at least say to
 

3629
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,590
goal is really night or at least say to
the customer when you have completed the

3630
01:15:58,590 --> 01:15:58,600
the customer when you have completed the
 

3631
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,540
the customer when you have completed the
purchase of movie tickets from Adam

3632
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:00,550
purchase of movie tickets from Adam
 

3633

tickets or Fandango or picture anyone
 

3635
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:06,290
tickets or Fandango or picture anyone
then the next thing is do you want to

3636
01:16:06,290 --> 01:16:06,300
then the next thing is do you want to
 

3637
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:10,320
then the next thing is do you want to
get to get an uber to the theater right

3638
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:10,330
get to get an uber to the theater right
 

3639
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:13,290
get to get an uber to the theater right
or do you want to book a restaurant next

3640
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:13,300
or do you want to book a restaurant next
 

3641
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:17,520
or do you want to book a restaurant next
to it and and then not ask the same

3642
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:17,530
to it and and then not ask the same
 

3643
01:16:17,530 --> 01:16:19,140
to it and and then not ask the same
information over and over again what

01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,150
information over and over again what
 

3645
01:16:19,150 --> 01:16:23,100

01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:26,530
right so so this is where you shift the
 

3649
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:29,400
right so so this is where you shift the
cognitive burden from the customer to

cognitive burden from the customer to
 

3651

01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:09,250
uber now so it will shift context into
 

3683
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:12,360
uber now so it will shift context into
another experience or skill on another

another experience or skill on another
 

3685
01:17:12,370 --> 01:17:13,770
another experience or skill on another
service so that's a dynamic

01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:22,870
simply complete transactions which are
 

3695
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:25,530
simply complete transactions which are
well thought through if you as a

01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:31,960
accomplishing that so it's kind of as I
 

3703

you say so my question is there it seems

3712
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
you say so my question is there it seems
 

3713
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:47,550
you say so my question is there it seems
maybe it's a dumb question but it would

3714
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:47,560
maybe it's a dumb question but it would
 

3715
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,510
maybe it's a dumb question but it would
help a lot of elects remembered me what

3716
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:51,520
help a lot of elects remembered me what
 

3717
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,240
help a lot of elects remembered me what
I said previously right

3718
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:54,250
I said previously right
 

3719
01:17:54,250 --> 01:17:57,960
I said previously right
it is it's trying to use some memory for

3720
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:57,970
it is it's trying to use some memory for
 

3721
01:17:57,970 --> 01:17:59,760
it is it's trying to use some memory for
the custom year it is using a lot of

3722
01:17:59,760 --> 01:17:59,770
the custom year it is using a lot of
 

3723
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:01,860
the custom year it is using a lot of
memory within that so right now not so

3724
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:01,870
memory within that so right now not so
 

3725
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,810
memory within that so right now not so
much in terms of okay which restaurant

3726
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:03,820
much in terms of okay which restaurant
 

3727
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:06,000
much in terms of okay which restaurant
do you prefer right that is a more

3728
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:06,010
do you prefer right that is a more
 

3729
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:07,410
do you prefer right that is a more
long-term memory but within the

3730
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:07,420
long-term memory but within the
 

3731
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:09,780
long-term memory but within the
short-term memory within the session it

3732
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:09,790
short-term memory within the session it
 

3733
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,370
short-term memory within the session it
is remembering how many people did you

3734
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:11,380
is remembering how many people did you
 

3735
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:14,250
is remembering how many people did you
so if you said buy four tickets not has

3736
01:18:14,250 --> 01:18:14,260
so if you said buy four tickets not has
 

3737
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,370
so if you said buy four tickets not has
made an implicit assumption that you

3738
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:17,380
made an implicit assumption that you
 

3739
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:19,500
made an implicit assumption that you
were gonna have you need for at least

3740
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:19,510
were gonna have you need for at least
 

3741
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:21,870
were gonna have you need for at least
four seats at a restaurant right so

3742
01:18:21,870 --> 01:18:21,880
four seats at a restaurant right so
 

3743
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,730
four seats at a restaurant right so
these are the kind of context its

3744
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:23,740
these are the kind of context its
 

3745
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:25,410
these are the kind of context its
preserving between these skills but

3746
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:25,420

on your preferences and then you can
 

4043
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,400
on your preferences and then you can
rank the responses from the scale and

rank the responses from the scale and
 

4045
01:24:38,410 --> 01:24:39,900
rank the responses from the scale and
then choose the best response for the

01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:39,910
then choose the best response for the
 

4047
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:42,660
then choose the best response for the
customer so that's on the more natural

01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:17,610
neural networks a reason do you see that
 

4369
01:31:17,610 --> 01:31:20,649
neural networks a reason do you see that
new approaches need to be invented to

4370
01:31:20,649 --> 01:31:20,659
new approaches need to be invented to
 

4371
01:31:20,659 --> 01:31:23,839

take the next big leap absolutely I

4372
01:31:23,839 --> 01:31:23,849
take the next big leap absolutely I
 

4373
01:31:23,849 --> 01:31:26,330
take the next big leap absolutely I
think there has to be a lot more

4374
01:31:26,330 --> 01:31:26,340
think there has to be a lot more
 

4375
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:28,970
think there has to be a lot more
investment and I think in many different

4376

investment and I think in many different
 

4377
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:31,100
investment and I think in many different
ways and there are these I would say

4378
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:31,110
ways and there are these I would say
 

4379
01:31:31,110 --> 01:31:33,260

nuggets of research forming in a good
 

4381
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:37,310
nuggets of research forming in a good
way like learning with less data or like

4382
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:37,320

zero short learning one-shot learning
and the active learning stuff you've

4386
01:31:40,790 --> 01:31:40,800
and the active learning stuff you've
 

4387
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,459
and the active learning stuff you've
talked about is yes incredible since so

4388
01:31:43,459 --> 01:31:43,469
talked about is yes incredible since so
 

4389
01:31:43,469 --> 01:31:45,290

transfer learning is also super critical

4390
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:45,300
transfer learning is also super critical
 

4391
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:46,850
transfer learning is also super critical
especially when you're thinking about

01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:46,860
especially when you're thinking about
 

4393
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,280
especially when you're thinking about

next wave of the technology but there is
 

4419
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:21,620
next wave of the technology but there is
a good news the good news is that I

by prediction tasks yes so and so we

4426
01:32:29,240 --> 01:32:29,250
by prediction tasks yes so and so we
 

4427
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:33,649
by prediction tasks yes so and so we
haven't exhausted that so we don't need

haven't exhausted that so we don't need
 

4429
01:32:33,659 --> 01:32:35,359
haven't exhausted that so we don't need
to give up on the deep learning

4430
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:35,369
to give up on the deep learning
 

4431
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:38,120
to give up on the deep learning
approaches for that so that's just I

another way how hard of a problem do you

4482
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:35,130
another way how hard of a problem do you
 

4483
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:39,410
another way how hard of a problem do you
think that is hardest of them I would

4484
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:39,420
think that is hardest of them I would
 

4485
01:33:39,420 --> 01:33:42,770
think that is hardest of them I would
say hardest of them because again the

4486
01:33:42,770 --> 01:33:42,780
say hardest of them because again the
 

4487
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,790

4489
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,490
hypothesis space of is really really
large and when you go back in time like

4490
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:49,500
large and when you go back in time like
 

4491
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:52,190
large and when you go back in time like
you were saying I wanna I want Alexei to

you were saying I wanna I want Alexei to
 

4493
01:33:52,200 --> 01:33:54,380
you were saying I wanna I want Alexei to
remember more things that once you go

4494
01:33:54,380 --> 01:33:54,390
remember more things that once you go

01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:59,660
beyond a session of interaction which is
my session I mean a a time span which is

4498
01:33:59,660 --> 01:33:59,670
my session I mean a a time span which is
 

4499
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,210
my session I mean a a time span which is

restaurant I like and then when I'm

4502
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:04,410
restaurant I like and then when I'm
 

4503
01:34:04,410 --> 01:34:05,990
restaurant I like and then when I'm
planning a night out to say do you want

4504
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:06,000
planning a night out to say do you want
 

4505
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,060
planning a night out to say do you want
to go to the same restaurant now you're

4506
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:08,070
to go to the same restaurant now you're
 

4507
01:34:08,070 --> 01:34:11,570
to go to the same restaurant now you're
up the steaks big time and and this is

4508
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:11,580
up the steaks big time and and this is
 

4509
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,520
up the steaks big time and and this is
where the reasoning dimension also goes

4510
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:13,530
where the reasoning dimension also goes
 

4511
01:34:13,530 --> 01:34:16,030
where the reasoning dimension also goes
very very big so you think the space

4512
01:34:16,030 --> 01:34:16,040
very very big so you think the space
 

4513
01:34:16,040 --> 01:34:18,580
very very big so you think the space
will be elaborating that a little bit

4514
01:34:18,580 --> 01:34:18,590
will be elaborating that a little bit
 

4515
01:34:18,590 --> 01:34:20,930
will be elaborating that a little bit
just philosophically speaking do you

4516
01:34:20,930 --> 01:34:20,940
just philosophically speaking do you
 

4517
01:34:20,940 --> 01:34:24,050
just philosophically speaking do you
think when you reason about trying to

4518
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:24,060
think when you reason about trying to
 

4519
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:27,440
think when you reason about trying to
model what the goal of a person is in

4520
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:27,450
model what the goal of a person is in

actually the Alexa prize is a little bit

4540
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:51,560
actually the Alexa prize is a little bit

actually the Alexa prize is a little bit
after that creating a customer like

after that creating a customer like

01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:58,070
after that creating a customer like
there's so many of the interactions it

4544
01:34:58,070 --> 01:34:58,080
there's so many of the interactions it
 

4545
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,480
there's so many of the interactions it
feels like are clustered in groups that

4546
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:02,490
feels like are clustered in groups that
 

4547
01:35:02,490 --> 01:35:06,500
feels like are clustered in groups that
are don't require general reasoning I

4548
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:06,510
are don't require general reasoning I
 

4549
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:08,600

think you're you right in terms of the

4550
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:08,610
think you're you right in terms of the
 

4551
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:10,940
think you're you right in terms of the
head of the distribution of all the

4552
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:10,950
head of the distribution of all the
 

4553
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:12,740
head of the distribution of all the
possible things customers may want to

4554
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:12,750
possible things customers may want to
 

4555
01:35:12,750 --> 01:35:15,890
possible things customers may want to
accomplish but the tail is long and it's

4556
01:35:15,890 --> 01:35:15,900
accomplish but the tail is long and it's
 

4557
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:19,880
accomplish but the tail is long and it's
diverse right so from many many long

4558
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:19,890
diverse right so from many many long
 

4559
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:24,470
diverse right so from many many long
tails from that perspective I think you

4560
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:24,480
tails from that perspective I think you
 

4561
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,620
tails from that perspective I think you
have to solve that problem otherwise and

4562
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:27,630
have to solve that problem otherwise and
 

4563
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:29,420
have to solve that problem otherwise and
everyone's very different like I mean we

4564
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:29,430
everyone's very different like I mean we
 

4565
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:31,880
everyone's very different like I mean we
see this already in terms of the skills

4566
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:31,890
see this already in terms of the skills
 

4567
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:34,160
see this already in terms of the skills
right I mean if you if you're an average

4568
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:34,170
right I mean if you if you're an average
 

4569
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:36,140
right I mean if you if you're an average
surfer which I am now

4570
01:35:36,140 --> 01:35:36,150
surfer which I am now
 

4571
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:39,650
surfer which I am now
right but somebody is asking Alexa about

4572
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:39,660
right but somebody is asking Alexa about
 

4573
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:42,200
right but somebody is asking Alexa about
surfing conditions right and there's a

4574
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:42,210
surfing conditions right and there's a
 

4575
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:44,570
surfing conditions right and there's a
skill that is there for them to get to

4576
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:44,580
skill that is there for them to get to
 

4577
01:35:44,580 --> 01:35:47,120
skill that is there for them to get to
right that tells you that the tail is

4578
01:35:47,120 --> 01:35:47,130
right that tells you that the tail is
 

4579
01:35:47,130 --> 01:35:50,330
right that tells you that the tail is
massive like in terms of like what kind

4580
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:50,340
massive like in terms of like what kind
 

4581
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:52,420
massive like in terms of like what kind
of skills people have created it's

4582
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:52,430
of skills people have created it's
 

4583
01:35:52,430 --> 01:35:54,710
of skills people have created it's
humongous in terms of it and which means

4584
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:54,720
humongous in terms of it and which means
 

4585
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:57,920
humongous in terms of it and which means
there are these diverse needs and and

4586
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:57,930
there are these diverse needs and and
 

4587
01:35:57,930 --> 01:35:59,270
there are these diverse needs and and
when you start looking at the

4588
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,280
when you start looking at the
 

4589
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:01,430
when you start looking at the
combinations of these right even if your

4590
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
combinations of these right even if your
 

4591
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:05,390
combinations of these right even if your
pairs of skills and and 90000 choose two

4592
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:05,400
pairs of skills and and 90000 choose two
 

4593
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,340
pairs of skills and and 90000 choose two
it's still a big concept of combination

4594
01:36:07,340 --> 01:36:07,350
it's still a big concept of combination
 

4595
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:10,190
it's still a big concept of combination
so I'm saying there's a huge to do here

4596
01:36:10,190 --> 01:36:10,200
so I'm saying there's a huge to do here
 

4597
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:14,350
so I'm saying there's a huge to do here
now and I think customers are you know

4598
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:14,360
now and I think customers are you know
 

4599
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:18,200
now and I think customers are you know
wonderfully frustrated with things and

4600
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:18,210
wonderfully frustrated with things and
 

4601
01:36:18,210 --> 01:36:20,240
wonderfully frustrated with things and
then I'm gonna keep getting to do better

4602
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:20,250
then I'm gonna keep getting to do better
 

4603
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,770
then I'm gonna keep getting to do better
things for that so and they're not known

4604
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:21,780
things for that so and they're not known
 

4605
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:24,950
things for that so and they're not known
to be super patient so you have to do it

4606
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:24,960
to be super patient so you have to do it
 

4607
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,110
to be super patient so you have to do it
fast you have to do it fast yeah so

4608
01:36:27,110 --> 01:36:27,120
fast you have to do it fast yeah so
 

4609
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:28,670
fast you have to do it fast yeah so

kind of think of what the future product
 

4617
01:36:36,720 --> 01:36:37,850
kind of think of what the future product
will look like and you kind of make it

4618
01:36:37,850 --> 01:36:37,860
will look like and you kind of make it
 

4619
01:36:37,860 --> 01:36:39,340
will look like and you kind of make it
happen you work backwards

4620
01:36:39,340 --> 01:36:39,350
happen you work backwards
 

4621
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:43,130
happen you work backwards
so can you draft for me you probably

4622
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:43,140
so can you draft for me you probably
 

4623
01:36:43,140 --> 01:36:47,030
so can you draft for me you probably
have one paquimé makeup on for 10 20 30

40 years out that you see the Alexa team

4626
01:36:51,560 --> 01:36:51,570
40 years out that you see the Alexa team
 

4627
01:36:51,570 --> 01:36:53,750
40 years out that you see the Alexa team
putting out just in broad strokes

4628
01:36:53,750 --> 01:36:53,760
putting out just in broad strokes
 

4629
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,550
putting out just in broad strokes
something that you dream about I think

4630
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:57,560
something that you dream about I think
 

4631
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,750
something that you dream about I think
let's start with the five years first

4632
01:36:59,750 --> 01:36:59,760
let's start with the five years first
 

4633
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,690
let's start with the five years first
okay so and I'll get to the Fortius

4634
01:37:02,690 --> 01:37:02,700
okay so and I'll get to the Fortius
 

4635
01:37:02,700 --> 01:37:10,220
okay so and I'll get to the Fortius
through in broad strokes this term I

4636
01:37:10,220 --> 01:37:10,230
through in broad strokes this term I
 

4637
01:37:10,230 --> 01:37:11,840
through in broad strokes this term I
think the five year is where I mean I

4638
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:11,850
think the five year is where I mean I
 

4639
01:37:11,850 --> 01:37:14,030
think the five year is where I mean I
think of in these spaces it's hard

4640
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:14,040
think of in these spaces it's hard
 

4641
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:16,010
think of in these spaces it's hard
especially if you're in thick of things

4642
01:37:16,010 --> 01:37:16,020
especially if you're in thick of things
 

4643
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:17,750
especially if you're in thick of things
to think beyond the five year space

4644
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:17,760
to think beyond the five year space
 

4645
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,240
to think beyond the five year space
because a lot of things change right I

4646
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:20,250
because a lot of things change right I
 

4647
01:37:20,250 --> 01:37:22,340
because a lot of things change right I
mean if you ask me five years back will

4648
01:37:22,340 --> 01:37:22,350
mean if you ask me five years back will
 

4649
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:25,220
mean if you ask me five years back will
Alexa will be here I wouldn't have I

4650
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:25,230
Alexa will be here I wouldn't have I
 

4651
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:27,860
Alexa will be here I wouldn't have I
think it has surpassed my imagination of

4652
01:37:27,860 --> 01:37:27,870
think it has surpassed my imagination of
 

4653
01:37:27,870 --> 01:37:30,770
think it has surpassed my imagination of
that time right so I think then from the

4654
01:37:30,770 --> 01:37:30,780
that time right so I think then from the
 

4655
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,920
that time right so I think then from the
next five years perspective from a AI

4656
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:33,930
next five years perspective from a AI
 

4657
01:37:33,930 --> 01:37:37,790
next five years perspective from a AI
perspective what we're gonna see is that

4658
01:37:37,790 --> 01:37:37,800
perspective what we're gonna see is that
 

4659
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,590
perspective what we're gonna see is that
notion which you said goal-oriented

4660
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
notion which you said goal-oriented

get closed they won't be different and
 

4667
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:47,900
get closed they won't be different and
I'll give you why that's the case

4668
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:47,910
I'll give you why that's the case
 

4669

that was just in shock just to comment

4700
01:38:35,540 --> 01:38:35,550
that was just in shock just to comment
 

4701
01:38:35,550 --> 01:38:37,370
that was just in shock just to comment
quickly I've never bought in you think

4702
01:38:37,370 --> 01:38:37,380
quickly I've never bought in you think
 

4703
01:38:37,380 --> 01:38:39,110
quickly I've never bought in you think
through Alexa there haven't bought

4704
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:39,120
through Alexa there haven't bought
 

4705
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,510
through Alexa there haven't bought
before on Amazon on a desktop after I

4706
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
before on Amazon on a desktop after I
 

4707
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:43,190

clicked in a bunch you read a much

4708
01:38:43,190 --> 01:38:43,200
clicked in a bunch you read a much
 

4709
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,080
clicked in a bunch you read a much
reviews that kind of stuff so it's

4710
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:45,090
reviews that kind of stuff so it's
 

4711
01:38:45,090 --> 01:38:47,960
reviews that kind of stuff so it's
repurchase so now you think in even for

4712
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:47,970
repurchase so now you think in even for
 

4713
01:38:47,970 --> 01:38:50,390
repurchase so now you think in even for
something that you felt like is is a

4714
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:50,400
something that you felt like is is a
 

4715
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:52,490
something that you felt like is is a
finite goal I think the space is huge

4716
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:52,500
finite goal I think the space is huge
 

4717
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,670
finite goal I think the space is huge
because even products the attributes are

4718
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:55,680
because even products the attributes are
 

4719
01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,770
because even products the attributes are
many like and you want to look at

4720
01:38:57,770 --> 01:38:57,780
many like and you want to look at
 

4721
01:38:57,780 --> 01:39:00,170
many like and you want to look at
reviews some on Amazon some outside some

4722
01:39:00,170 --> 01:39:00,180
reviews some on Amazon some outside some
 

4723
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,790
reviews some on Amazon some outside some
you want to look at what Zenit is saying

4724
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:01,800
you want to look at what Zenit is saying
 

4725
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:05,030
you want to look at what Zenit is saying
or another consumer forum is saying

4726
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:05,040
or another consumer forum is saying
 

4727
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,800
or another consumer forum is saying
about even a product for instance right

4728
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:06,810
about even a product for instance right
 

4729
01:39:06,810 --> 01:39:09,140
about even a product for instance right
so that's just that's just shopping

4730
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:09,150
so that's just that's just shopping
 

4731
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:11,780
so that's just that's just shopping
where you could you could argue the

4732
01:39:11,780 --> 01:39:11,790
where you could you could argue the
 

4733
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:14,150
where you could you could argue the
ultimate goal is sort of known and we

4734
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:14,160
ultimate goal is sort of known and we
 

4735
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:16,010
ultimate goal is sort of known and we
haven't talked about Alexa what's the

4736
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:16,020
haven't talked about Alexa what's the
 

4737
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,710
haven't talked about Alexa what's the
weather in Cape Cod this weekend right

4738
01:39:18,710 --> 01:39:18,720
weather in Cape Cod this weekend right
 

4739
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:21,860
weather in Cape Cod this weekend right
so why am I asking that weather question

4740
01:39:21,860 --> 01:39:21,870
so why am I asking that weather question
 

4741
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:25,790
so why am I asking that weather question
right so I think I think of it as how do

4742
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:25,800
right so I think I think of it as how do
 

4743
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:28,400
right so I think I think of it as how do
you complete goals with minimum steps

4744
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:28,410
you complete goals with minimum steps
 

4745
01:39:28,410 --> 01:39:30,560
you complete goals with minimum steps
for our customers right and when you

4746
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:30,570
for our customers right and when you
 

4747
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:32,960
for our customers right and when you
think of it that way the distinction

4748
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:32,970
think of it that way the distinction
 

4749
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:35,570
think of it that way the distinction
between goal-oriented and conversations

4750
01:39:35,570 --> 01:39:35,580
between goal-oriented and conversations
 

4751
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:39,110
between goal-oriented and conversations
for open domain say goes away I may want

4752
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:39,120
for open domain say goes away I may want
 

4753
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:41,810
for open domain say goes away I may want
to know what happened in the

4754
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:41,820
to know what happened in the
 

4755
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:44,660
to know what happened in the
presidential debate right and is it I'm

4756
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:44,670
presidential debate right and is it I'm
 

4757
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:46,130
presidential debate right and is it I'm
seeking just information on I'm looking

4758
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:46,140
seeking just information on I'm looking
 

4759
01:39:46,140 --> 01:39:49,100
seeking just information on I'm looking
at who's winning winning the debates

4760
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:49,110
at who's winning winning the debates
 

4761
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:52,820
at who's winning winning the debates
right so these are all quite hard

4762
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:52,830
right so these are all quite hard
 

4763
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:54,710
right so these are all quite hard
problems so even the five-year horizon

4764
01:39:54,710 --> 01:39:54,720
problems so even the five-year horizon
 

4765
01:39:54,720 --> 01:39:58,910
problems so even the five-year horizon
problem I'm like I sure hope we'll solve

4766
01:39:58,910 --> 01:39:58,920
problem I'm like I sure hope we'll solve
 

4767
01:39:58,920 --> 01:40:01,550
problem I'm like I sure hope we'll solve
these new year you're optimistic because

4768
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:01,560
these new year you're optimistic because
 

4769
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:02,560
these new year you're optimistic because
that's the hard problem

4770
01:40:02,560 --> 01:40:02,570
that's the hard problem
 

4771
01:40:02,570 --> 01:40:07,069
that's the hard problem
which part the reasoning you know enough

4772
01:40:07,069 --> 01:40:07,079
which part the reasoning you know enough
 

4773
01:40:07,079 --> 01:40:10,399
which part the reasoning you know enough
to be able to help explore complex goals

4774
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:10,409
to be able to help explore complex goals
 

4775
01:40:10,409 --> 01:40:11,870
to be able to help explore complex goals
that are beyond something simplistic

4776
01:40:11,870 --> 01:40:11,880
that are beyond something simplistic
 

4777
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:14,839
that are beyond something simplistic
that feels like it could be well five

4778
01:40:14,839 --> 01:40:14,849
that feels like it could be well five
 

4779
01:40:14,849 --> 01:40:17,629
that feels like it could be well five
years is a nice it's a nice bar form

4780
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:17,639
years is a nice it's a nice bar form
 

4781
01:40:17,639 --> 01:40:19,879
years is a nice it's a nice bar form
right I think you will

4782
01:40:19,879 --> 01:40:19,889
right I think you will
 

4783
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:22,220
right I think you will
it's a like nice ambition and do we have

4784
01:40:22,220 --> 01:40:22,230
it's a like nice ambition and do we have
 

4785
01:40:22,230 --> 01:40:24,529
it's a like nice ambition and do we have
press releases for that absolutely can I

4786
01:40:24,529 --> 01:40:24,539
press releases for that absolutely can I
 

4787
01:40:24,539 --> 01:40:26,299
press releases for that absolutely can I
tell you what specifically the roadmap

4788
01:40:26,299 --> 01:40:26,309
tell you what specifically the roadmap
 

4789
01:40:26,309 --> 01:40:29,930
tell you what specifically the roadmap
will be no right and what and will be

4790
01:40:29,930 --> 01:40:29,940
will be no right and what and will be
 

4791
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:31,640
will be no right and what and will be
solve all of it in the five-year space

4792
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:31,650
solve all of it in the five-year space
 

4793
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,279
solve all of it in the five-year space
now this is we will work on this forever

4794
01:40:34,279 --> 01:40:34,289
now this is we will work on this forever
 

4795
01:40:34,289 --> 01:40:36,979
now this is we will work on this forever
actually if we this is the hardest of

4796
01:40:36,979 --> 01:40:36,989
actually if we this is the hardest of
 

4797
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,890
actually if we this is the hardest of
the eye problems and I don't see if that

4798
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:39,900
the eye problems and I don't see if that
 

4799
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:41,870
the eye problems and I don't see if that
being solved even in a 40 year horizon

4800
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:41,880
being solved even in a 40 year horizon
 

4801
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,359
being solved even in a 40 year horizon
because even if you limit to the human

4802
01:40:44,359 --> 01:40:44,369
because even if you limit to the human
 

4803
01:40:44,369 --> 01:40:46,220
because even if you limit to the human
intelligence we know we are quite far

4804
01:40:46,220 --> 01:40:46,230
intelligence we know we are quite far
 

4805
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:49,580
intelligence we know we are quite far
from that in fact every aspects of our

4806
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:49,590
from that in fact every aspects of our
 

4807
01:40:49,590 --> 01:40:53,060
from that in fact every aspects of our
sensing to do neural processing to how

4808
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:53,070
sensing to do neural processing to how
 

4809
01:40:53,070 --> 01:40:55,790
sensing to do neural processing to how
brain stores information and how it

4810
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:55,800
brain stores information and how it
 

4811
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:57,259
brain stores information and how it
processes it we don't yet know how to

4812
01:40:57,259 --> 01:40:57,269
processes it we don't yet know how to
 

4813
01:40:57,269 --> 01:40:59,390
processes it we don't yet know how to
represent knowledge all right so we're

4814
01:40:59,390 --> 01:40:59,400
represent knowledge all right so we're
 

4815
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:03,379
represent knowledge all right so we're
and still in those are early stages so I

4816
01:41:03,379 --> 01:41:03,389
and still in those are early stages so I
 

4817
01:41:03,389 --> 01:41:05,209
and still in those are early stages so I
wanted to start that's why at the

4818
01:41:05,209 --> 01:41:05,219
wanted to start that's why at the
 

4819
01:41:05,219 --> 01:41:07,189
wanted to start that's why at the
five-year yeah because the five-year

4820
01:41:07,189 --> 01:41:07,199
five-year yeah because the five-year
 

4821
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:09,680
five-year yeah because the five-year
success would look like that and solving

4822
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:09,690
success would look like that and solving
 

4823
01:41:09,690 --> 01:41:12,020
success would look like that and solving
these complex goals and the forty year

4824
01:41:12,020 --> 01:41:12,030
these complex goals and the forty year
 

4825
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:14,989
these complex goals and the forty year
would be where it's just natural to talk

4826
01:41:14,989 --> 01:41:14,999
would be where it's just natural to talk
 

4827
