00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,550
from afar right and and after i go
through that process

808
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:02,560

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,870
entire
cohort this entire generation of

starvation
 

957
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,150
starvation
and that's an incredible difficult task

958
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,160
and that's an incredible difficult task
 

959
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,669
and that's an incredible difficult task
but equally inspirational to watch these

960
00:17:55,669 --> 00:17:55,679
but equally inspirational to watch these
 

961
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,750
but equally inspirational to watch these
human beings devote every minute of

962
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
human beings devote every minute of
 

963
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,950

every day
to save a child i mean in my view

966
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
to save a child i mean in my view
 

967
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,669
to save a child i mean in my view
nothing is more important than that

968
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
nothing is more important than that
 

969
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,430
nothing is more important than that
action maybe on that point real quick

970
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:07,440
action maybe on that point real quick
 

971
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,909
action maybe on that point real quick
so there is suffering at scale

972
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:09,919
so there is suffering at scale
 

973
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,029
so there is suffering at scale
starvation at scale there's

974
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
starvation at scale there's
 

975
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,510
starvation at scale there's
i mean the numbers um

976
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:15,520
i mean the numbers um
 

977
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,270
i mean the numbers um
maybe you can mention in yemen what are

978
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:17,280
maybe you can mention in yemen what are
 

979
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,630
maybe you can mention in yemen what are
the numbers in terms of people and

980
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
the numbers in terms of people and
 

981
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,390
the numbers in terms of people and
starvation but

982
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
starvation but
 

983
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,909
starvation but
from a perspective of a nurse

984
00:18:21,909 --> 00:18:21,919
from a perspective of a nurse
 

985
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,070
from a perspective of a nurse
practitioner or a doctor

986
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:24,080
practitioner or a doctor
 

987
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,669
practitioner or a doctor
you always have you're treating one

988
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:25,679
you always have you're treating one
 

989
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,150
you always have you're treating one
person in front of you

990
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,160
person in front of you
 

991
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,750
person in front of you
so how do you make sense of that

992
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:29,760
so how do you make sense of that
 

993
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,270
so how do you make sense of that
calculus

994
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
calculus

here how long you know 35 minutes or so

danger of psychic numbing which can
happen when you think about suffering on

happen when you think about suffering on
such a large scale

this young girl in
and you know just because of

1110
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:35,919
and you know just because of
 

1111
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,390
and you know just because of
sort of the gender dynamics in yemen you

1112
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:38,400
sort of the gender dynamics in yemen you
 

1113
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,470
sort of the gender dynamics in yemen you
know there had to be

1114
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
know there had to be
 

1115
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,710
know there had to be
a parent or a relative there to stay

1116
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
a parent or a relative there to stay
 

1117
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,830
a parent or a relative there to stay
with the child while they're at the

1118
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
with the child while they're at the
 

1119
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,510
with the child while they're at the
clinic and it was a male relative and so

1120
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:47,520
clinic and it was a male relative and so
 

1121
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,430
clinic and it was a male relative and so
you know what many doctors in that

1122
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:49,440
you know what many doctors in that
 

1123
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,950
you know what many doctors in that
instance would do would just turn them

1124
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:50,960
instance would do would just turn them
 

1125
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,430
instance would do would just turn them
away and instead what makia did is she

1126
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
away and instead what makia did is she
 

1127
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,430
away and instead what makia did is she
walked into one of the rooms talked to

1128
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
walked into one of the rooms talked to
 

1129
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,110
walked into one of the rooms talked to
one of the other mothers and convinced

one of the other mothers and convinced
 

1131
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,350
one of the other mothers and convinced
them to become the temporary guardian

1132

1137
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,830
relative could could arrive so you know
she's flexible she she finds solutions

1138
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:07,840
she's flexible she she finds solutions
 

1139
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,350
she's flexible she she finds solutions
rather than allowing the problems to

rather than allowing the problems to
 

1141
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,630
rather than allowing the problems to
deter solutions one child at a time yeah

when leaders do that
it becomes aspirational right it becomes

00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:31,440
it becomes aspirational right it becomes
 

2683
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,630
it becomes aspirational right it becomes
aspirational for other leaders um

2684
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640
aspirational for other leaders um
 

2685
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,950
aspirational for other leaders um
uh in the progressive world at least and

2686
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:36,960
uh in the progressive world at least and
 

2687
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,910
uh in the progressive world at least and
also it rings the alarm bells for

2688
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:39,920
also it rings the alarm bells for
 

2689
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,150
also it rings the alarm bells for
other authoritarian leaders and says you

2690
00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:42,160
other authoritarian leaders and says you
 

2691
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,790
other authoritarian leaders and says you
know what there are lines right there

2692
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:44,800
know what there are lines right there
 

2693
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,950
know what there are lines right there
are things that can't be done or there

2694
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:46,960
are things that can't be done or there
 

2695
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,790
are things that can't be done or there
will be significant consequences like

2696
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:48,800
will be significant consequences like
 

2697
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:50,150
will be significant consequences like
you will not be able to fly into our

2698
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:50,160
you will not be able to fly into our
 

2699
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:53,589
you will not be able to fly into our
airspace anymore um and sanctions i

2700
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:53,599
airspace anymore um and sanctions i
 

2701
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,510
airspace anymore um and sanctions i
think need to be concrete and individual

2702
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:55,520
think need to be concrete and individual
 

2703
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:57,270
think need to be concrete and individual
to some in addition to the sort of the

2704
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
to some in addition to the sort of the
 

2705
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,390
to some in addition to the sort of the
larger scope

2706
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
larger scope
 

2707
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,190
larger scope
but when they're concrete and individual

2708
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
but when they're concrete and individual
 

2709
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,270
but when they're concrete and individual
uh i think often they're felt in a

2710
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:03,280
uh i think often they're felt in a
 

2711
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,790
uh i think often they're felt in a
different way

2712
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
different way
 

2713
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:06,549
different way
you mean felt obviously by the

2714
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:06,559
you mean felt obviously by the
 

2715
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:08,309
you mean felt obviously by the
individuals and so the

2716
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,319
individuals and so the
 

2717
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:10,950
individuals and so the
the ripple effects of that

2718
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
the ripple effects of that
 

2719
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,069
the ripple effects of that
uh it

2720
00:50:12,069 --> 00:50:12,079
uh it
 

2721
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,589
uh it
might have um

2722
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599

 

2723
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,069

the power to steer the direction of

2724
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:18,079
the power to steer the direction of
 

2725
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:19,589
the power to steer the direction of
nations because of the nature of

2726
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:19,599
nations because of the nature of
 

2727
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,510
nations because of the nature of
authoritarian regimes yes right there

likely never to happen of course because
 

2741
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,950
likely never to happen of course because
someone has to be in custody to go on

2742
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:36,960
someone has to be in custody to go on
 

2743

that these geopolitical decisions have
on real people's lives and that's the

2982
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
on real people's lives and that's the
 

2983
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,589
on real people's lives and that's the
that that's the intent

2984
00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:55,599
that that's the intent
 

2985
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,069
that that's the intent
i create each film with

2986
00:54:58,069 --> 00:54:58,079
i create each film with
 

2987
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,549
i create each film with
now how i choose each story that's the

2988
00:55:00,549 --> 00:55:00,559
now how i choose each story that's the
 

2989
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,710
now how i choose each story that's the
the magic potion piece of it right and

2990
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
the magic potion piece of it right and
 

2991
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,789
the magic potion piece of it right and
and um often one flows rather

2992
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:04,799
and um often one flows rather
 

2993
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,190
and um often one flows rather
organically into another frankly

2994
00:55:07,190 --> 00:55:07,200
organically into another frankly
 

2995
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,950
organically into another frankly
so you just kind of like you said you go

2996
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:08,960
so you just kind of like you said you go
 

2997
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,789
so you just kind of like you said you go
with instinct a little bit to some

2998
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
with instinct a little bit to some
 

2999
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,030
with instinct a little bit to some
extent but oftentimes i choose the next

3000
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
extent but oftentimes i choose the next
 

3001
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,589
extent but oftentimes i choose the next
project based on relationships i've

3002
00:55:15,589 --> 00:55:15,599
project based on relationships i've
 

3003
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,990
project based on relationships i've
developed yeah in the last film

3004
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:18,000
developed yeah in the last film
 

3005
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,030
developed yeah in the last film
right

3006
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
right
 

3007
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,109
right
and so one often flows into another

3008
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,119
and so one often flows into another
 

3009
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:22,870
and so one often flows into another
through relationships i develop and then

3010
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:22,880
through relationships i develop and then
 

3011
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,270
through relationships i develop and then

you need a sandbag on that man exactly
 

3111
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,829
you need a sandbag on that man exactly
so no no see

3112
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
so no no see
 

3113
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,870
so no no see
no sandbag and and like the the stand is

3114
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:22,880
no sandbag and and like the the stand is
 

3115
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,470
no sandbag and and like the the stand is
actually bending under the weight of

3116
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
actually bending under the weight of
 

3117
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,710
actually bending under the weight of
that thing it could fall on us it could

3118
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:26,720
that thing it could fall on us it could
 

3119
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,990
that thing it could fall on us it could
fall it probably won't reach us but it

3120
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,000
fall it probably won't reach us but it
 

3121
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:29,589
fall it probably won't reach us but it
could but the danger

3122
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:29,599
could but the danger
 

3123
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,589
could but the danger
live under that danger embrace that

3124
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:31,599
live under that danger embrace that
 

3125
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:32,710
live under that danger embrace that
danger

3126
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
danger
 

3127
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,309
danger
love it yeah

3128
00:57:34,309 --> 00:57:34,319
love it yeah
 

3129
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:35,829
love it yeah
because that thing is easier to

3130
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:35,839
because that thing is easier to
 

3131
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,069
because that thing is easier to
transport than a heavier one yeah

3132
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:38,079
transport than a heavier one yeah
 

3133
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,549
transport than a heavier one yeah
sandbag that's extra weight so if you

3134
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:40,559
sandbag that's extra weight so if you
 

3135
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,030
sandbag that's extra weight so if you
keep like uh p people tell me there's

3136
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,040
keep like uh p people tell me there's
 

3137
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,349
keep like uh p people tell me there's
the right way to do stuff like here's

3138
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:45,359
the right way to do stuff like here's
 

3139
00:57:45,359 --> 00:57:47,430
the right way to do stuff like here's
these giant cases with all kinds of

3140
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:47,440
these giant cases with all kinds of
 

3141
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,349
these giant cases with all kinds of
padding for transporting stuff i

3142
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
padding for transporting stuff i
 

3143
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,270
padding for transporting stuff i
transport most of the equipment in a

3144
00:57:51,270 --> 00:57:51,280
transport most of the equipment in a
 

3145
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,069
transport most of the equipment in a
garbage bag yeah so i i that's just a

3146
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
garbage bag yeah so i i that's just a
 

3147
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:56,150
garbage bag yeah so i i that's just a
preference because that's somehow

3148
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:56,160
preference because that's somehow
 

3149
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,109
preference because that's somehow
that chaos allows me to sit to ignore

3150
00:57:59,109 --> 00:57:59,119
that chaos allows me to sit to ignore
 

3151
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,309
that chaos allows me to sit to ignore
all the stupidity of uh loving the

3152
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
all the stupidity of uh loving the
 

3153
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,230
all the stupidity of uh loving the
equipment and focusing on the story so

3154
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:06,240
equipment and focusing on the story so
 

3155
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,750
equipment and focusing on the story so
that said i've never shot anything

3156
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
that said i've never shot anything
 

3157
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,390
that said i've never shot anything
like worthwhile

3158
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
like worthwhile
 

3159
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,270
like worthwhile
like

3160
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:13,280
like
 

3161
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:15,829
like
uh there is power to the visual yeah

3162
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:15,839
uh there is power to the visual yeah
 

3163
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:19,589
uh there is power to the visual yeah
yeah like definitely and so

3164
00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:19,599
yeah like definitely and so
 

3165
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,870
yeah like definitely and so
finding a certain angle a certain light

3166
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:22,880
finding a certain angle a certain light
 

3167
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,109
finding a certain angle a certain light
whether it's natural light or additional

3168
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:25,119
whether it's natural light or additional
 

3169
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:27,270
whether it's natural light or additional
artificial lighting

artificial lighting
 

3171
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,510
artificial lighting
just capturing a tear capturing

3172
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
just capturing a tear capturing
 

3173
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,349
just capturing a tear capturing
when the person forgets themselves for a

3174
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:33,359
when the person forgets themselves for a
 

3175
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:34,230
when the person forgets themselves for a
moment

3176
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
moment
 

3177
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:36,470
moment
and looks out into the distance missing

3178
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
and looks out into the distance missing

somebody thinking about somebody
 

3181
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,230
somebody thinking about somebody
all of those like moments you can

3182
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:40,240
all of those like moments you can
 

3183
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,510
all of those like moments you can
capture

3184
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:41,520
capture
 

3185
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,710
capture
a lens a camera can do magic with that

3186
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:44,720
a lens a camera can do magic with that
 

3187
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,309
a lens a camera can do magic with that
um i don't even know the question i'm

3188
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
um i don't even know the question i'm
 

3189
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:47,750
um i don't even know the question i'm
asking you but how

3190
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:47,760
asking you but how
 

3191
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,190
asking you but how
do

3192
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:49,200
do
 

3193
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,670
do
both technical and philosophical how do

3194
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680
both technical and philosophical how do
 

3195
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,589
both technical and philosophical how do
you capture the visual power that you're

3196
00:58:53,589 --> 00:58:53,599
you capture the visual power that you're
 

3197
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,470
you capture the visual power that you're
after

3198
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:54,480
after
 

3199
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,750
after
yeah

3200
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:55,760
yeah
 

3201
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,829
yeah
so so many of my films

3202
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
so so many of my films
 

3203
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,190
so so many of my films
i think

3204
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,200
i think
 

3205
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:02,309
i think
are built on the premise of access

3206
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:02,319
are built on the premise of access
 

3207
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,589
are built on the premise of access
right build on this notion that um

3208
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:07,599

 

3209
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:08,549

the

3210
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
the
 

3211
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:10,630
the
the biggest hurdle

3212
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:10,640
the biggest hurdle
 

3213
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,030
the biggest hurdle
to the story is getting there

3214
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:13,040
to the story is getting there
 

3215
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:16,230
to the story is getting there
being there in the room or being there

3216
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:16,240
being there in the room or being there
 

3217
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,670
being there in the room or being there
on the boat

3218
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:17,680
on the boat
 

3219
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,150
on the boat
while a crisis is unfolding

3220
00:59:20,150 --> 00:59:20,160
while a crisis is unfolding
 

3221
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,390
while a crisis is unfolding
and that access typically is really

3222
00:59:22,390 --> 00:59:22,400
and that access typically is really
 

3223
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:26,309
and that access typically is really
nuanced and difficult to gain

3224
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
nuanced and difficult to gain
 

3225
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:29,109
nuanced and difficult to gain
and and then trust flows from that right

3226
00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:29,119
and and then trust flows from that right
 

3227
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:30,789
and and then trust flows from that right
because usually it takes a long time to

3228
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:30,799
because usually it takes a long time to
 

3229
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:33,030
because usually it takes a long time to
gain that access

3230
00:59:33,030 --> 00:59:33,040
gain that access
 

3231
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,270
gain that access
because that access is so hard fought

3232
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
because that access is so hard fought
 

3233
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,870
because that access is so hard fought
it necessarily informs

3234
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:40,880
it necessarily informs
 

3235
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,630
it necessarily informs
how we film

3236
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:42,640
how we film
 

3237
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,589
how we film
right

3238
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:43,599
right
 

3239
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,309
right
to be in a room at sadaka hospital in

3240
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
to be in a room at sadaka hospital in
 

3241
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,109
to be in a room at sadaka hospital in
southern yemen i can't have five people

3242
00:59:49,109 --> 00:59:49,119
southern yemen i can't have five people
 

3243
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,390
southern yemen i can't have five people
in that room

3244
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:50,400
in that room
 

3245
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,430
in that room
right i can't have a boom mic

3246
00:59:53,430 --> 00:59:53,440
right i can't have a boom mic
 

3247
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,829
right i can't have a boom mic
over a scene

3248
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:55,839
over a scene
 

3249
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,030
over a scene
i want

3250
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:57,040
i want
 

3251
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,430
i want
creatively the opposite of that as well

3252
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
creatively the opposite of that as well
 

3253
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,190
creatively the opposite of that as well
so it's not just a logistical question

3254
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
so it's not just a logistical question
 

3255
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,430
so it's not just a logistical question
it's also a creative question

3256
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:03,440
it's also a creative question
 

3257
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,270
it's also a creative question
to capture intimate moments where

3258
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
to capture intimate moments where
 

3259
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,190
to capture intimate moments where
families are dealing with suffering

3260
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
families are dealing with suffering
 

3261
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,349
families are dealing with suffering
children and dying children and and

3262
01:00:11,349 --> 01:00:11,359
children and dying children and and
 

3263
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,589

caretaking is is active and ongoing all

3264
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
caretaking is is active and ongoing all
 

3265
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:14,710
caretaking is is active and ongoing all
the time

3266
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:14,720
the time
 

3267
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,549
the time
you don't want to interrupt that moment

3268
01:00:16,549 --> 01:00:16,559
you don't want to interrupt that moment
 

3269
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,789
you don't want to interrupt that moment
and so that informs how i do things so

3270
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
and so that informs how i do things so
 

3271
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:22,549
and so that informs how i do things so
we go fleet and nimble and small

3272
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
we go fleet and nimble and small
 

3273
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,510
we go fleet and nimble and small
those are all really good words for

3274
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
those are all really good words for
 

3275
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,349
those are all really good words for
but but but so it's logistical on the

3276
01:00:27,349 --> 01:00:27,359
but but but so it's logistical on the
 

3277
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,430
but but but so it's logistical on the
one hand but it's also a creative choice

3278
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
one hand but it's also a creative choice
 

3279
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:31,910
one hand but it's also a creative choice
right so when we filmed hunger ward

3280
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:31,920
right so when we filmed hunger ward
 

3281
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,150
right so when we filmed hunger ward
two people were filming the entire film

3282
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:34,160
two people were filming the entire film
 

3283
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,470
two people were filming the entire film
right me and my director of photography

3284
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:36,480
right me and my director of photography
 

3285
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,990
right me and my director of photography
that was the two people in the room two

3286
01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:38,000
that was the two people in the room two
 

3287
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:38,950
that was the two people in the room two
people in the room

3288
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:38,960
people in the room
 

3289
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,789
people in the room
yeah wow that's it the whole film right

3290
01:00:40,789 --> 01:00:40,799
yeah wow that's it the whole film right
 

3291
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:42,390
yeah wow that's it the whole film right
we had a field producer as well and he's

3292
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:42,400
we had a field producer as well and he's
 

3293
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,150
we had a field producer as well and he's
part of the country but in terms of cam

3294
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:44,160
part of the country but in terms of cam
 

3295
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,910
part of the country but in terms of cam
it's just two people and we're doing

3296
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
it's just two people and we're doing
 

3297
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,470
it's just two people and we're doing
everything and we have lenses

3298
01:00:48,470 --> 01:00:48,480
everything and we have lenses
 

3299
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:49,430
everything and we have lenses
um

3300
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:49,440
um
 

3301
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,670
um
that you know are long enough that we

3302
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:51,680
that you know are long enough that we
 

3303
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,510
that you know are long enough that we
don't have to move to capture the film

3304
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
don't have to move to capture the film
 

3305
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,670
don't have to move to capture the film
so we can tuck into a corner sometimes

3306
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:55,680
so we can tuck into a corner sometimes
 

3307
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,549
so we can tuck into a corner sometimes
right

3308
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
right
 

3309
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:58,710
right
and so just what's long mean that means

3310
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
and so just what's long mean that means
 

3311
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,069
and so just what's long mean that means
they're standing farther away and they

3312
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:00,079
they're standing farther away and they
 

3313
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:02,230
they're standing farther away and they
can zoom lens it's not a prime lens so

3314
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,240
can zoom lens it's not a prime lens so
 

3315
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,910
can zoom lens it's not a prime lens so
it's not a fixed focal length right

3316
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
it's not a fixed focal length right
 

3317
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,270
it's not a fixed focal length right
because a fixed focal length you have to

3318
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:05,280
because a fixed focal length you have to
 

3319
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,950
because a fixed focal length you have to
move a lot more in order to capture

3320
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
move a lot more in order to capture
 

3321
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,309
move a lot more in order to capture
action with with a zoom lens um you know

3322
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
action with with a zoom lens um you know
 

3323
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:13,030
action with with a zoom lens um you know
maybe a 105 at the long end you know i

3324
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
maybe a 105 at the long end you know i
 

3325
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,430
maybe a 105 at the long end you know i
can tuck into a corner and just film

3326
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,440
can tuck into a corner and just film
 

3327
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,349
can tuck into a corner and just film
from 15 feet away instead of having to

3328
01:01:17,349 --> 01:01:17,359
from 15 feet away instead of having to
 

3329
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:19,510
from 15 feet away instead of having to
get right up on someone right so you

3330
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520
get right up on someone right so you
 

3331
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:20,950
get right up on someone right so you
you're less likely to interrupt the

3332
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:20,960
you're less likely to interrupt the
 

3333
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:22,230
you're less likely to interrupt the
scene

3334
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:22,240
scene
 

3335
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,230
scene
and and you can kind of become the fly

3336
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:24,240
and and you can kind of become the fly
 

3337
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,910
and and you can kind of become the fly
on the wall sometimes

3338
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:25,920
on the wall sometimes
 

3339
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,470
on the wall sometimes
so so you know i'm very intentional

3340
01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:28,480
so so you know i'm very intentional
 

3341
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,510
so so you know i'm very intentional
about that piece of it so that we can we

3342
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:31,520
about that piece of it so that we can we
 

3343
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,510
about that piece of it so that we can we
can capture those vulnerable moments and

3344
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:33,520
can capture those vulnerable moments and
 

3345
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,309
can capture those vulnerable moments and
not interrupt them

3346
01:01:36,309 --> 01:01:36,319
not interrupt them
 

3347
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,390
not interrupt them
that's really fascinating too

3348
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:38,400
that's really fascinating too
 

3349
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,510
that's really fascinating too
because the access

3350
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520

 

3351
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,950

i don't often think about this but

3352
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:42,960
i don't often think about this but
 

3353
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,829
i don't often think about this but
that's probably true for me as well

3354
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:45,839
that's probably true for me as well
 

3355
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:47,829
that's probably true for me as well
um

3356
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
um
 

3357
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,829
um
part of the storytelling

3358
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
part of the storytelling
 

3359
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,710
part of the storytelling
is to be in the room and that's the hard

3360
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:52,720
is to be in the room and that's the hard
 

3361
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:55,510
is to be in the room and that's the hard
part yeah for me most of my films that's

3362
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:55,520
part yeah for me most of my films that's
 

3363
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,109
part yeah for me most of my films that's
the hardest part actually as hard as

3364
01:01:57,109 --> 01:01:57,119
the hardest part actually as hard as
 

3365
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:59,750
the hardest part actually as hard as
hunger award and lifeboat were to film

3366
01:01:59,750 --> 01:01:59,760
hunger award and lifeboat were to film
 

3367
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,710
hunger award and lifeboat were to film
and 50 feet from syria

3368
01:02:02,710 --> 01:02:02,720
and 50 feet from syria
 

3369
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,150
and 50 feet from syria
the getting their piece of it for the

3370
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:04,160
the getting their piece of it for the
 

3371
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,549
the getting their piece of it for the
last two was much harder yeah and it's

3372
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:06,559
last two was much harder yeah and it's
 

3373
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:09,270
last two was much harder yeah and it's
also it's a it's a creative act

3374
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:09,280
also it's a it's a creative act
 

3375
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:11,750
also it's a it's a creative act
it's it's like i don't know if it is for

3376
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:11,760
it's it's like i don't know if it is for
 

3377
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,910
it's it's like i don't know if it is for
you but it's the kind of people you talk

to
it's uh

3382
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:16,640

film

3392
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:25,520
film
 

3393
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,510
film
so like it's not just like you're trying

3394
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:27,520
so like it's not just like you're trying
 

3395
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,670
so like it's not just like you're trying
to get access it's like

3396
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
to get access it's like
 

3397
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:32,549
to get access it's like
it's everything it's like it builds

3398
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:32,559
it's everything it's like it builds
 

3399
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,230
it's everything it's like it builds
it builds and builds and builds and

3400
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:34,240
it builds and builds and builds and
 

3401
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:36,309
it builds and builds and builds and
builds on itself yeah yeah

3402
01:02:36,309 --> 01:02:36,319
builds on itself yeah yeah
 

3403
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:38,549
builds on itself yeah yeah
i mean part of the thing even saying you

3404
01:02:38,549 --> 01:02:38,559
i mean part of the thing even saying you
 

3405
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:40,069
i mean part of the thing even saying you
know talking about some of these leaders

3406
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
know talking about some of these leaders
 

3407
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:41,750
know talking about some of these leaders
and conversations with them

3408
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:41,760
and conversations with them
 

3409
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,670
and conversations with them
it's almost like

3410
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:43,680
it's almost like
 

3411
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,069
it's almost like
staring your life into the direction of

3412
01:02:46,069 --> 01:02:46,079
staring your life into the direction of
 

3413
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:47,750
staring your life into the direction of
the difficult

3414
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:47,760
the difficult
 

3415
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:48,789
the difficult
of like

3416
01:02:48,789 --> 01:02:48,799
of like
 

3417
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,109
of like
taking the leap

3418
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
taking the leap
 

3419
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,630
taking the leap
and

3420
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:52,640
and
 

3421
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:56,150
and
uh if you're a good human being

3422
01:02:56,150 --> 01:02:56,160
uh if you're a good human being
 

3423
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,309
uh if you're a good human being
and a lot of people

3424
01:02:58,309 --> 01:02:58,319
and a lot of people
 

3425
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:01,670
and a lot of people
know who you are as a human like not not

3426
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
know who you are as a human like not not
 

3427
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,069
know who you are as a human like not not
as a name but as really who you are yeah

3428
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
as a name but as really who you are yeah
 

3429
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,309
as a name but as really who you are yeah
that like putting that attention out

3430
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:06,319

logistical
ability of the project because we have

4076
01:14:54,229 --> 01:14:54,239
ability of the project because we have
 

4077
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:57,110
ability of the project because we have
to go so small right i can't

4078
01:14:57,110 --> 01:14:57,120
to go so small right i can't
 

4079
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,430
to go so small right i can't
i can't afford nor can i bring a huge

4080
01:14:59,430 --> 01:14:59,440
i can't afford nor can i bring a huge
 

4081
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,110
i can't afford nor can i bring a huge
hundred thousand dollar lens so if i

4082
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
hundred thousand dollar lens so if i
 

4083
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,270
hundred thousand dollar lens so if i
give you a trillion dollars a trillion

4084
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:03,280
give you a trillion dollars a trillion
 

4085
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,030
give you a trillion dollars a trillion
dollars yeah wow

4086
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
dollars yeah wow
 

4087
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,430
dollars yeah wow
unlimited yes there's still huge

constraints that have nothing to do with

4090
01:15:08,709 --> 01:15:08,719
constraints that have nothing to do with
 

4091
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,030
constraints that have nothing to do with
money yeah like you just said yeah

4092
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:11,040
money yeah like you just said yeah
 

4093
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,149
money yeah like you just said yeah
so what

4094
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
so what
 

4095
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,070
so what
what cameras would you use you know what

4096
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:14,080
what cameras would you use you know what
 

4097
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:15,910
what cameras would you use you know what
i do with the trillion dollars

4098
01:15:15,910 --> 01:15:15,920
i do with the trillion dollars
 

4099
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,750
i do with the trillion dollars
i could do a lot of things

4100
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:17,760
i could do a lot of things
 

4101
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,709
i could do a lot of things
you're only allowed to fund the film and

no corrupt stuff where you like
use the film to actually help children

4106
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
use the film to actually help children
 

4107
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,310
use the film to actually help children
no you're not allowed to do any of that

4108
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
no you're not allowed to do any of that
 

4109
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,510
no you're not allowed to do any of that
what i would do with the children is i

4110
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
what i would do with the children is i
 

4111
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,030
what i would do with the children is i
wouldn't invest in a well i guess i

4112
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
wouldn't invest in a well i guess i
 

4113
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,470
wouldn't invest in a well i guess i
would invest in chrome i would i would

4114
01:15:30,470 --> 01:15:30,480
would invest in chrome i would i would
 

4115
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:31,990
would invest in chrome i would i would
increase capacity

4116
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
increase capacity
 

4117
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,229
increase capacity
to do more films what i would do so i

4118
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:34,239
to do more films what i would do so i
 

4119
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:37,669
to do more films what i would do so i
would buy basically the perfect little

4120
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
would buy basically the perfect little
 

4121
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:38,709
would buy basically the perfect little
you know

4122
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:38,719
you know
 

4123
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:41,030
you know
mini equipment set right but then i

4124
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
mini equipment set right but then i
 

4125
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,310
mini equipment set right but then i
would train

4126
01:15:42,310 --> 01:15:42,320
would train
 

4127
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,790
would train
three teams maybe to do the same thing

4128
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
three teams maybe to do the same thing
 

4129
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,470
three teams maybe to do the same thing
that i've been doing so we could

4130
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:46,480
that i've been doing so we could
 

4131
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:48,709
that i've been doing so we could
multiply and scale up more and more

4132
01:15:48,709 --> 01:15:48,719
multiply and scale up more and more
 

4133
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,630
multiply and scale up more and more
stories yeah that's what i would do with

4134
01:15:50,630 --> 01:15:50,640
stories yeah that's what i would do with
 

4135
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,390
stories yeah that's what i would do with
them but the actual setup

4136
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:52,400
them but the actual setup
 

4137
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,830
them but the actual setup
would remain small

4138
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:53,840
would remain small
 

4139
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:56,630
would remain small
and nimble yeah

4140
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
and nimble yeah
 

4141
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:59,030
and nimble yeah
and uh what about

4142
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
and uh what about
 

4143
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:01,350
and uh what about
lighting do you usually use natural

4144
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
lighting do you usually use natural
 

4145
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:04,149
lighting do you usually use natural
light do you ever do

4146
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
light do you ever do
 

4147
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,070
light do you ever do
i mean sorry for the technical questions

4148
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
i mean sorry for the technical questions
 

4149
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:08,149
i mean sorry for the technical questions
here but

4150
01:16:08,149 --> 01:16:08,159
here but
 

4151
01:16:08,159 --> 01:16:09,110
here but
um

4152
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:09,120

highlighting the drama of the human face

4154
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
highlighting the drama of the human face
 

4155
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:12,470

01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
uh
 

4159
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,950
uh
that's the visual that's art that's like

4160
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
that's the visual that's art that's like
 

4161
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,790
that's the visual that's art that's like
to reveal reality yeah

4162
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
to reveal reality yeah
 

4163
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:24,149
to reveal reality yeah
at its deepest is art and uh do you use

4164
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
at its deepest is art and uh do you use
 

4165
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,990
at its deepest is art and uh do you use
lighting lighting's such a big part of

4166
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
lighting lighting's such a big part of
 

4167
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,070
lighting lighting's such a big part of
that you use do you ever do artificial

4168
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:28,080
that you use do you ever do artificial
 

4169
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,310
that you use do you ever do artificial
lighting do you try to do natural always

4170
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
lighting do you try to do natural always
 

4171
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,229
lighting do you try to do natural always
you know the best lighting instrument in

4172
01:16:32,229 --> 01:16:32,239
you know the best lighting instrument in
 

4173
01:16:32,239 --> 01:16:34,630
you know the best lighting instrument in
the world is the sun

4174
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:34,640
the world is the sun
 

4175
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:36,950
the world is the sun
at the right moment of the day

4176
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:36,960
at the right moment of the day
 

4177
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,350
at the right moment of the day
and so i predominantly use natural light

4178
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:41,360
and so i predominantly use natural light
 

4179
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,910
and so i predominantly use natural light
um

4180
01:16:43,910 --> 01:16:43,920

 

4181
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,390

at certain moments

4182
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
at certain moments
 

4183
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,950
at certain moments
and just shape natural light

4184
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:48,960
and just shape natural light
 

4185
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,630
and just shape natural light
during the course of these small human

4186
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:50,640
during the course of these small human
 

4187
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:53,270
during the course of these small human
right stocks that's not to say we don't

4188
01:16:53,270 --> 01:16:53,280
right stocks that's not to say we don't
 

4189
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,510
right stocks that's not to say we don't
bring instruments sometimes but when we

4190
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:55,520
bring instruments sometimes but when we
 

4191
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,229
bring instruments sometimes but when we
do

4192
01:16:56,229 --> 01:16:56,239
do
 

4193
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:59,030
do
they're very small and again

4194
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
they're very small and again
 

4195
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:01,270
they're very small and again
compact so

4196
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:01,280
compact so
 

4197
01:17:01,280 --> 01:17:04,470
compact so
for example i have this small little um

4198
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
for example i have this small little um
 

4199
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,630
for example i have this small little um
tube kit that's just three instruments

4200
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
tube kit that's just three instruments
 

4201
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:08,310
tube kit that's just three instruments
right that you can charge with the usb

4202
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:08,320
right that you can charge with the usb
 

4203
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:10,550
right that you can charge with the usb
because electricity is often a major

4204
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:10,560
because electricity is often a major
 

4205
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:12,630
because electricity is often a major
issue where we go so there's just three

4206
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:12,640
issue where we go so there's just three
 

4207
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,950
issue where we go so there's just three
little tube lights with magnetic backs

4208
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
little tube lights with magnetic backs
 

4209
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,510
little tube lights with magnetic backs
that if we find in a situation where you

4210
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
that if we find in a situation where you
 

4211
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,510
that if we find in a situation where you
know we can't get enough exposure for a

4212
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:19,520
know we can't get enough exposure for a
 

4213
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:21,430
know we can't get enough exposure for a
hallway or something and we have the

4214
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:21,440
hallway or something and we have the
 

4215
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:23,430
hallway or something and we have the
time to throw it up we'll throw it up if

4216
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:23,440
time to throw it up we'll throw it up if
 

4217
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,270
time to throw it up we'll throw it up if
people are walking if if collaborators

4218
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:25,280
people are walking if if collaborators
 

4219
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,189
people are walking if if collaborators
are walking down that hallway a lot for

4220
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
are walking down that hallway a lot for
 

4221
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:29,350
are walking down that hallway a lot for
example at night just so we can see them

4222
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:29,360
example at night just so we can see them
 

4223
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:32,229
example at night just so we can see them
right so it's instances like that or

4224
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:32,239
right so it's instances like that or
 

4225
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,390
right so it's instances like that or
if we do do an interview which

4226
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
if we do do an interview which
 

4227
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:36,550
if we do do an interview which
we don't do very often but if we do just

4228
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:36,560
we don't do very often but if we do just
 

4229
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,830
we don't do very often but if we do just
so we have a key light on the face

4230
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
so we have a key light on the face
 

4231
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,950
so we have a key light on the face
right

4232
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:40,960
right
 

4233
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,030
right
and i always bring in a reflector or two

4234
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
and i always bring in a reflector or two
 

4235
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,189
and i always bring in a reflector or two
you know just to shape natural light as

4236
01:17:45,189 --> 01:17:45,199
you know just to shape natural light as
 

4237
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:48,470
you know just to shape natural light as
well in ways but it's um

4238
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:48,480
well in ways but it's um
 

4239
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,110
well in ways but it's um
it's about shaping rather than producing

4240
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:51,120
it's about shaping rather than producing
 

4241
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,030
it's about shaping rather than producing
light for us

4242
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:53,040
light for us
 

4243
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,350
light for us
got it as we sit surrounded by black

4244
01:17:55,350 --> 01:17:55,360
got it as we sit surrounded by black
 

4245
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,510
got it as we sit surrounded by black
curtains in complete natural life

4246
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:57,520
curtains in complete natural life
 

4247

how much of the work is done in the edit

4268
01:18:21,270 --> 01:18:21,280
how much of the work is done in the edit
 

4269
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,270
how much of the work is done in the edit
that's another question i'm curious

4270
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:23,280
that's another question i'm curious
 

4271
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:26,550
that's another question i'm curious
about yeah and how much do you

4272
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:26,560
about yeah and how much do you
 

4273
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,709
about yeah and how much do you
uh sort of anticipate that

4274
01:18:28,709 --> 01:18:28,719
uh sort of anticipate that
 

4275
01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:31,669
uh sort of anticipate that
like when you're actually shooting

4276
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
like when you're actually shooting
 

4277
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,950
like when you're actually shooting
are you thinking of the final

4278
01:18:34,950 --> 01:18:34,960
are you thinking of the final
 

4279
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:37,910
are you thinking of the final
story as it appears on screen

4280
01:18:37,910 --> 01:18:37,920
story as it appears on screen
 

4281
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,709
story as it appears on screen
or are you just collecting as a human

4282
01:18:40,709 --> 01:18:40,719
or are you just collecting as a human
 

4283
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:42,630
or are you just collecting as a human
collecting little bits of story here and

4284
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:42,640
collecting little bits of story here and
 

4285
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,870
collecting little bits of story here and
there and in the edit is where most of

4286
01:18:44,870 --> 01:18:44,880
there and in the edit is where most of
 

4287
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,270
there and in the edit is where most of
the storytelling happens i've developed

4288
01:18:47,270 --> 01:18:47,280
the storytelling happens i've developed
 

4289
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,390
the storytelling happens i've developed
this sort of

4290
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
this sort of
 

4291
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:50,390
this sort of
mental paradigm for myself over the

4292
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:50,400
mental paradigm for myself over the
 

4293
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,310
mental paradigm for myself over the
years um

4294
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:52,320
years um
 

4295
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,870
years um
that speaks to that and and i call it

4296
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:54,880
that speaks to that and and i call it
 

4297
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:57,990
that speaks to that and and i call it
the three creations right and so

4298
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
the three creations right and so
 

4299
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,310
the three creations right and so
when i'm doing a film the first creation

4300
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
when i'm doing a film the first creation
 

4301
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,830
when i'm doing a film the first creation
for me is

4302
01:19:01,830 --> 01:19:01,840
for me is
 

4303
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:03,030
for me is
you know

4304
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,040
you know
 

4305
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:05,990
you know
my preconception or visualization of

4306
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
my preconception or visualization of
 

4307
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,390
my preconception or visualization of
what the film is going to be before i

4308
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:08,400
what the film is going to be before i
 

4309
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,630
what the film is going to be before i
shoot it right so i have this this

4310
01:19:10,630 --> 01:19:10,640
shoot it right so i have this this
 

4311
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,590
shoot it right so i have this this
entire vision of of what a film is gonna

4312
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:13,600
entire vision of of what a film is gonna
 

4313
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:14,390
entire vision of of what a film is gonna
be

4314
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:14,400
be
 

4315
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,390
be
um and and sometimes it could be pretty

4316
01:19:16,390 --> 01:19:16,400
um and and sometimes it could be pretty
 

4317
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:17,910
um and and sometimes it could be pretty
specific like i'll i'll think through

4318
01:19:17,910 --> 01:19:17,920
specific like i'll i'll think through
 

4319
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,990
specific like i'll i'll think through
the scenes if i if i know the locations

4320
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:20,000
the scenes if i if i know the locations
 

4321
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,510
the scenes if i if i know the locations
and everything and i'll have this idea

4322
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
and everything and i'll have this idea
 

4323
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,310
and everything and i'll have this idea
of what i'm going to create right

4324
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
of what i'm going to create right
 

4325
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:27,350
of what i'm going to create right
and then i'm there filming right and

4326
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:27,360
and then i'm there filming right and
 

4327
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:29,830
and then i'm there filming right and
always without fail

4328
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:29,840
always without fail
 

4329
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,510
always without fail
reality is something altogether

4330
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:31,520
reality is something altogether
 

4331
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,390
reality is something altogether
different

4332
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:32,400
different
 

4333
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:34,070
different
than what i thought it would be but it's

4334
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:34,080
than what i thought it would be but it's
 

4335
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:35,430
than what i thought it would be but it's
still good to have the original idea

4336
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:35,440
still good to have the original idea
 

4337
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:37,350
still good to have the original idea
yeah yeah but if i tried to hold to that

4338
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
yeah yeah but if i tried to hold to that
 

4339
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,669
yeah yeah but if i tried to hold to that
original vision right and to create a

4340
01:19:39,669 --> 01:19:39,679
original vision right and to create a
 

4341
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:41,350
original vision right and to create a
film out of that idea

4342
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:41,360
film out of that idea
 

4343
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,510
film out of that idea
they'd be crap all the films would be so

4344
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:43,520
they'd be crap all the films would be so
 

4345
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:45,590
they'd be crap all the films would be so
we i have to adapt i have to evolve my

4346
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:45,600
we i have to adapt i have to evolve my
 

4347
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,630
we i have to adapt i have to evolve my
approach and then embrace what is

4348
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
approach and then embrace what is
 

4349
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,470
approach and then embrace what is
actually occurring with the people

4350
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:50,480
actually occurring with the people
 

4351
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:52,950
actually occurring with the people
actually doing it and then re-envision

4352
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:52,960
actually doing it and then re-envision
 

4353
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,110
actually doing it and then re-envision
so that re-envisioning is very active

4354
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:55,120
so that re-envisioning is very active
 

4355
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,510
so that re-envisioning is very active
during the entire filming process and so

4356
01:19:57,510 --> 01:19:57,520
during the entire filming process and so
 

4357
01:19:57,520 --> 01:19:59,830
during the entire filming process and so
that's the second creation that's the

4358
01:19:59,830 --> 01:19:59,840
that's the second creation that's the
 

4359
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:02,950
that's the second creation that's the
the rethinking and re-visualizing

4360
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:02,960
the rethinking and re-visualizing
 

4361
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:04,070
the rethinking and re-visualizing
based on what we're actually

4362
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,080
based on what we're actually
 

4363
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,229
based on what we're actually
experiencing and seeing what this film

4364
01:20:06,229 --> 01:20:06,239
experiencing and seeing what this film
 

4365
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:07,910
experiencing and seeing what this film
is going to be

4366
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
is going to be
 

4367
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,510
is going to be
and then

4368
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
and then
 

4369
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,149
and then
i finish filming right and we bring the

4370
01:20:12,149 --> 01:20:12,159
i finish filming right and we bring the
 

4371
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:13,830
i finish filming right and we bring the
hard drives back and we plug in the hard

4372
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:13,840
hard drives back and we plug in the hard
 

4373
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:16,550
hard drives back and we plug in the hard
drives um in the edit bay

4374
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:16,560
drives um in the edit bay
 

4375
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:17,590
drives um in the edit bay
and

4376
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
and
 

4377
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,830
and
oftentimes you know because it's two of

4378
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:19,840
oftentimes you know because it's two of
 

4379
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,590
oftentimes you know because it's two of
us filming most of the time

4380
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:21,600
us filming most of the time
 

4381
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,510
us filming most of the time
i haven't seen all the footage

4382
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:23,520
i haven't seen all the footage
 

4383
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:25,669
i haven't seen all the footage
because in the field it's all about just

4384
01:20:25,669 --> 01:20:25,679
because in the field it's all about just
 

4385
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:28,229
because in the field it's all about just
filming right and then just transferring

4386
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
filming right and then just transferring
 

4387
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,070
filming right and then just transferring
the footage and getting on safely you

4388
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
the footage and getting on safely you
 

4389
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,910
the footage and getting on safely you
know clone to multiple drives i don't

4390
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:31,920
know clone to multiple drives i don't
 

4391
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,590
know clone to multiple drives i don't
have a chance to review everything i

4392
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
have a chance to review everything i
 

4393
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,430
have a chance to review everything i
can't do rushes like you do on a large

4394
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:35,440
can't do rushes like you do on a large
 

4395
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:38,149
can't do rushes like you do on a large
feature so because i'm filming half of

4396
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:38,159
feature so because i'm filming half of
 

4397
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:41,030
feature so because i'm filming half of
it i know what i've filmed right but i

4398
01:20:41,030 --> 01:20:41,040
it i know what i've filmed right but i
 

4399
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:42,550
it i know what i've filmed right but i
haven't seen everything the director

4400
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
haven't seen everything the director
 

4401
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:46,070
haven't seen everything the director
photography has filmed right so the next

4402
01:20:46,070 --> 01:20:46,080
photography has filmed right so the next
 

4403
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:49,270
photography has filmed right so the next
stage for me is reviewing every single

4404
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:49,280
stage for me is reviewing every single
 

4405
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,910
stage for me is reviewing every single
frame of what's been filmed

4406
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
frame of what's been filmed
 

4407
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,030
frame of what's been filmed
and that's where discovery happens the

4408
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:55,040
and that's where discovery happens the
 

4409
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:56,950
and that's where discovery happens the
third time right or second time rather

4410
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:56,960
third time right or second time rather
 

4411
01:20:56,960 --> 01:20:58,709
third time right or second time rather
is is wow

4412
01:20:58,709 --> 01:20:58,719
is is wow
 

4413
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:01,590
is is wow
now i thought we'd film this

4414
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:01,600
now i thought we'd film this
 

4415
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:03,189
now i thought we'd film this
but actually

4416
01:21:03,189 --> 01:21:03,199
but actually
 

4417
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,510
but actually
um there's this over here and then i

4418
01:21:05,510 --> 01:21:05,520
um there's this over here and then i
 

4419
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,590
um there's this over here and then i
have to open up this second vision and

4420
01:21:07,590 --> 01:21:07,600
have to open up this second vision and
 

4421
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,750
have to open up this second vision and
turn in and transform it into a third

4422
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:09,760
turn in and transform it into a third
 

4423
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,669
turn in and transform it into a third
vision for the film based on what's

4424
01:21:11,669 --> 01:21:11,679
vision for the film based on what's
 

4425
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:13,830
vision for the film based on what's
actually on the hard drive so you're is

4426
01:21:13,830 --> 01:21:13,840
actually on the hard drive so you're is
 

4427
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,390
actually on the hard drive so you're is
this like a daily process so what i do

4428
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
this like a daily process so what i do
 

4429
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,870
this like a daily process so what i do
the fruit my process is that

4430
01:21:18,870 --> 01:21:18,880
the fruit my process is that
 

4431
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:20,950
the fruit my process is that
once if it's a really difficult project

4432
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
once if it's a really difficult project
 

4433
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,629
once if it's a really difficult project
i'll take a break before i go through

4434
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:22,639
i'll take a break before i go through
 

4435
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,030
i'll take a break before i go through
this yeah just just for healing you know

4436
01:21:25,030 --> 01:21:25,040
this yeah just just for healing you know
 

4437
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,350
this yeah just just for healing you know
and some space away and fresh eyes and

4438
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
and some space away and fresh eyes and
 

4439
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,030
and some space away and fresh eyes and
usually that's about a month

4440
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:29,040
usually that's about a month
 

4441
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:31,830
usually that's about a month
and then once i re-engage i re-engage

4442
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:31,840
and then once i re-engage i re-engage
 

4443
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:35,430
and then once i re-engage i re-engage
whole hog i re-engage fully and it and i

4444
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:35,440
whole hog i re-engage fully and it and i
 

4445
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,830
whole hog i re-engage fully and it and i
review every single frame and as i do

4446
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:37,840
review every single frame and as i do
 

4447
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:40,870
review every single frame and as i do
that i create a spreadsheet

4448
01:21:40,870 --> 01:21:40,880
that i create a spreadsheet
 

4449
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,110
that i create a spreadsheet
and for hunger war that spreadsheet was

4450
01:21:43,110 --> 01:21:43,120
and for hunger war that spreadsheet was
 

4451
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:45,110
and for hunger war that spreadsheet was
i don't know 1500 lines long or

4452
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
i don't know 1500 lines long or
 

4453
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,990
i don't know 1500 lines long or
something where it's basically log notes

4454
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:48,000
something where it's basically log notes
 

4455
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,229
something where it's basically log notes
and i and i watch every scene and i take

4456
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
and i and i watch every scene and i take
 

4457
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,270
and i and i watch every scene and i take
notes

4458
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:51,280
notes
 

4459
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,310
notes
and i i know really what we have and

4460
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:54,320
and i i know really what we have and
 

4461
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:55,990
and i i know really what we have and
once i've gone through that process that

4462
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
once i've gone through that process that
 

4463
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,229
once i've gone through that process that
takes about a month and i really know

4464
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
takes about a month and i really know
 

4465
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,390
takes about a month and i really know
what we came back with i create an

4466
01:22:00,390 --> 01:22:00,400
what we came back with i create an
 

4467
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,070
what we came back with i create an
outline for the film

4468
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:02,080
outline for the film
 

4469
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,229
outline for the film
from that and that's the third visioning

4470
01:22:04,229 --> 01:22:04,239
from that and that's the third visioning
 

4471
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:05,590
from that and that's the third visioning
right

4472
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
right
 

4473
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,669
right
that's usually completely different than

4474
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:07,679
that's usually completely different than
 

4475
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:09,590
that's usually completely different than
my original vision for the film to some

4476
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:09,600
my original vision for the film to some
 

4477
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,550
my original vision for the film to some
extent right but i have to stay open to

4478
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:12,560
extent right but i have to stay open to
 

4479
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:14,709
extent right but i have to stay open to
that entire process

4480
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
that entire process
 

4481
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:16,709
that entire process
um or or i'd be trying to create

4482
01:22:16,709 --> 01:22:16,719
um or or i'd be trying to create
 

4483
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:18,070
um or or i'd be trying to create
something that i can't

4484
01:22:18,070 --> 01:22:18,080
something that i can't
 

4485
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,590
something that i can't
really create

4486
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
really create
 

4487
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,510
really create
so i think that's those are the three

4488
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:21,520
so i think that's those are the three
 

4489
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:24,310
so i think that's those are the three
creations for me that's so cool to to

4490
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
creations for me that's so cool to to
 

4491
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,709
creations for me that's so cool to to
know what we have

4492
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:26,719
know what we have
 

4493
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:29,350
know what we have
uh just to lay it all out

4494
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
uh just to lay it all out
 

4495
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,830
uh just to lay it all out
and to load it in into your mind yeah

4496
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:31,840
and to load it in into your mind yeah
 

4497
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,030
and to load it in into your mind yeah
because like

4498
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
because like
 

4499
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,590
because like
this is the capture of reality we have

4500
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:35,600
this is the capture of reality we have
 

4501
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,510
this is the capture of reality we have
it's a very kind of scientific process

4502
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:37,520
it's a very kind of scientific process
 

4503
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:38,790
it's a very kind of scientific process
too because um

4504
01:22:38,790 --> 01:22:38,800
too because um
 

4505
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,070
too because um
you know in science you collect a bunch

4506
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,080
you know in science you collect a bunch
 

4507
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,070
you know in science you collect a bunch
of data about a phenomena yeah and now

4508
01:22:42,070 --> 01:22:42,080
of data about a phenomena yeah and now
 

4509
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:43,750
of data about a phenomena yeah and now
you have to like analyze that data but

4510
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:43,760
you have to like analyze that data but
 

4511
01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:45,990
you have to like analyze that data but
now your phenomena is long gone

4512
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:46,000
now your phenomena is long gone
 

4513
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,270
now your phenomena is long gone
yeah yeah right right now you just have

4514
01:22:47,270 --> 01:22:47,280
yeah yeah right right now you just have
 

4515
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,430
yeah yeah right right now you just have
the data just the data and you have to

4516
01:22:49,430 --> 01:22:49,440
the data just the data and you have to
 

4517
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:51,750
the data just the data and you have to
uh write a paper about it like analyze

4518
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:51,760
uh write a paper about it like analyze
 

4519
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,830
uh write a paper about it like analyze
the data it's the similar things

4520
01:22:53,830 --> 01:22:53,840
the data it's the similar things
 

4521
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,590
the data it's the similar things
you have to like load it all in where's

4522
01:22:55,590 --> 01:22:55,600
you have to like load it all in where's
 

4523
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,870
you have to like load it all in where's
the story

4524
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:56,880
the story
 

4525
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:57,910
the story
how

4526
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
how
 

4527
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,990
how
how how do you

4528
01:22:59,990 --> 01:23:00,000
how how do you
 

4529
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,950
how how do you
that last probably profound

4530
01:23:02,950 --> 01:23:02,960
that last probably profound
 

4531
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,390
that last probably profound
piece of

4532
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:04,400
piece of
 

4533
01:23:04,400 --> 01:23:07,189
piece of
doing the editing like in your mind like

4534
01:23:07,189 --> 01:23:07,199
doing the editing like in your mind like
 

4535
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:08,070
doing the editing like in your mind like
what

4536
01:23:08,070 --> 01:23:08,080
what
 

4537
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:10,470
what
uh how to lay those things out well it's

4538
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:10,480
uh how to lay those things out well it's
 

4539
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,070
uh how to lay those things out well it's
almost like the scientific process right

4540
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:12,080
almost like the scientific process right
 

4541
01:23:12,080 --> 01:23:13,669
almost like the scientific process right
i have a hypothesis

4542
01:23:13,669 --> 01:23:13,679
i have a hypothesis
 

4543
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:15,430
i have a hypothesis
a creative hypothesis right not a

4544
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:15,440
a creative hypothesis right not a
 

4545
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,830
a creative hypothesis right not a
scientific one yes and but then i'm

4546
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:17,840
scientific one yes and but then i'm
 

4547
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,669
scientific one yes and but then i'm
testing the hypothesis during the course

4548
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
testing the hypothesis during the course
 

4549
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:22,790
testing the hypothesis during the course
of filming right and i have to stay true

4550
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:22,800
of filming right and i have to stay true
 

4551
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:24,709
of filming right and i have to stay true
to what the data tells me in the end

4552
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:24,719
to what the data tells me in the end
 

4553
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,550
to what the data tells me in the end
creatively so it's very similar to the

4554
01:23:26,550 --> 01:23:26,560
creatively so it's very similar to the
 

4555
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,910
creatively so it's very similar to the
scientific processes i don't know what

4556
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:27,920
scientific processes i don't know what
 

4557
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:28,870
scientific processes i don't know what
we should

4558
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
we should
 

4559
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,110
we should
we should probably coin that yeah

4560
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:31,120
we should probably coin that yeah
 

4561
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,070
we should probably coin that yeah
creative

4562
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,080
creative
 

4563
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:33,750
creative
scientific process or something like

4564
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:33,760
scientific process or something like
 

4565
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:34,550
scientific process or something like
that

4566
01:23:34,550 --> 01:23:34,560
that
 

4567
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:35,830
that
but then you

4568
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
but then you
 

4569
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,149
but then you
actually do the edit and you watch

4570
01:23:38,149 --> 01:23:38,159
actually do the edit and you watch
 

4571
01:23:38,159 --> 01:23:39,350
actually do the edit and you watch
that's also

4572
01:23:39,350 --> 01:23:39,360
that's also
 

4573
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,629
that's also
uh iterative in a sense because maybe

4574
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
uh iterative in a sense because maybe
 

4575
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,390
uh iterative in a sense because maybe
uh when you have a film that's 20 30 40

4576
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
uh when you have a film that's 20 30 40
 

4577
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,270
uh when you have a film that's 20 30 40
minutes or if it's feature line

4578
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
minutes or if it's feature line
 

4579
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,149
minutes or if it's feature line
uh

4580
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
uh
 

4581
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,070
uh
like in it

4582
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
like in it
 

4583
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,470
like in it
do you ever have it where it sucks

4584
01:23:54,470 --> 01:23:54,480
do you ever have it where it sucks
 

4585
01:23:54,480 --> 01:23:56,070
do you ever have it where it sucks
like it's not is there a stage where it

all put together in this way this
 

4597
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,110
all put together in this way this
doesn't this is not working right this

or do you
 

4603
01:24:10,159 --> 01:24:11,910
or do you
is it always like an incremental step

4604
01:24:11,910 --> 01:24:11,920
is it always like an incremental step
 

4605
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,110
is it always like an incremental step
towards better and better it's

4606
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
towards better and better it's
 

4607
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,950
towards better and better it's
incremental yeah it's incremental yeah

4608

incremental yeah it's incremental yeah
 

4609
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:17,270
incremental yeah it's incremental yeah
and there's always some moment in the

4610
01:24:17,270 --> 01:24:17,280
and there's always some moment in the
 

4611
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,790
and there's always some moment in the
editing process where there's a

4612
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:18,800
editing process where there's a
 

4613
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:21,430
editing process where there's a
breakthrough where suddenly i understand

4614
01:24:21,430 --> 01:24:21,440
breakthrough where suddenly i understand
 

4615
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:23,270
breakthrough where suddenly i understand
how it fits together

4616
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
how it fits together
 

4617
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,270
how it fits together
more fully and you have to be like you

4618
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:25,280
more fully and you have to be like you
 

4619
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,030
more fully and you have to be like you
said resilient you have to be patient

4620
01:24:27,030 --> 01:24:27,040
said resilient you have to be patient
 

4621
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,350
said resilient you have to be patient
that that moment will come yeah exactly

4622
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
that that moment will come yeah exactly
 

4623
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,229
that that moment will come yeah exactly
are you ultra self-critical or are you

4624
01:24:32,229 --> 01:24:32,239
are you ultra self-critical or are you

i don't think those are mutually

4630
01:24:37,350 --> 01:24:37,360
i don't think those are mutually
 

4631
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,470
i don't think those are mutually
exclusive

4632
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:38,480
exclusive
 

4633
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,030
exclusive
right so you just oscillate or you or

4634
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
right so you just oscillate or you or
 

4635
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,390
right so you just oscillate or you or
they're like dance partners or something

they're dance partners yeah yeah
 

4639
01:24:44,080 --> 01:24:45,510
they're dance partners yeah yeah
definitely dancing all the way through

4640
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
definitely dancing all the way through
 

4641
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,270
definitely dancing all the way through
the process

4642
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:47,280
the process
 

4643
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,590
the process
by way of advice

01:24:52,709 --> 01:24:52,719
you know to young filmmakers
 

4647
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:56,870
you know to young filmmakers
how to film something that

4648
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880

 

4649
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,390

is recognized

by the world in some way
i would say you know first off learn

4654
01:25:02,709 --> 01:25:02,719
i would say you know first off learn
 

4655
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:04,229
i would say you know first off learn
your craft

4656
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
your craft
 

4657
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:08,790
your craft
right um because i i think craft is

4658
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
right um because i i think craft is
 

4659
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:11,590
right um because i i think craft is
incredibly foundational right to

4660
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:11,600
incredibly foundational right to
 

4661
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:12,709
incredibly foundational right to
creating

4662
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
creating
 

4663
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,310
creating
a powerful story

4664
01:25:14,310 --> 01:25:14,320
a powerful story
 

4665
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:15,910
a powerful story
and sorry to interrupt but when you say

4666
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
and sorry to interrupt but when you say
 

4667
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:18,629
and sorry to interrupt but when you say
craft do you mean just the raw technical

4668
01:25:18,629 --> 01:25:18,639
craft do you mean just the raw technical
 

4669
01:25:18,639 --> 01:25:20,629
craft do you mean just the raw technical
the director of photography like the

4670
01:25:20,629 --> 01:25:20,639
the director of photography like the
 

4671
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:22,870
the director of photography like the
filming aspect is it the storytelling is

4672
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
filming aspect is it the storytelling is
 

4673
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,709
filming aspect is it the storytelling is
the acts is the whole thing i think

4674
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:24,719
the acts is the whole thing i think
 

4675
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:26,149
the acts is the whole thing i think
craft is more than just knowing how to

4676
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:26,159
craft is more than just knowing how to
 

4677
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:28,149
craft is more than just knowing how to
push record on a camera or what lens to

4678
01:25:28,149 --> 01:25:28,159
push record on a camera or what lens to
 

4679
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:30,390
push record on a camera or what lens to
use right that's part of it right

4680
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,400
use right that's part of it right
 

4681
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:33,110
use right that's part of it right
but i i think um

4682
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:33,120
but i i think um
 

4683
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,030
but i i think um
at least in non-fiction

4684
01:25:35,030 --> 01:25:35,040
at least in non-fiction
 

4685
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:37,350
at least in non-fiction
you know i'm i'm a product

4686
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:37,360
you know i'm i'm a product
 

4687
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:39,590
you know i'm i'm a product
to some extent of

4688
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:39,600
to some extent of
 

4689
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,910
to some extent of
having to know how to do it all

4690
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
having to know how to do it all
 

4691
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,390
having to know how to do it all
right having to teach myself how to do

4692
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:44,400
right having to teach myself how to do
 

4693
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:45,510
right having to teach myself how to do
it all because i didn't go to film

4694
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:45,520
it all because i didn't go to film
 

4695
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,910
it all because i didn't go to film

in more sort of behind the scenes and
 

4749
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:44,390
in more sort of behind the scenes and
shaping a story when you started

realize that you're pretty good at this

4758
01:26:53,669 --> 01:26:53,679
realize that you're pretty good at this
 

4759

or was it a grind
 

4761
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,830
or was it a grind
that's a good question max um i think

4762
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
that's a good question max um i think
 

4763
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:02,229
that's a good question max um i think
i definitely knew right away

4764
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
i definitely knew right away
 

4765
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:04,709
i definitely knew right away
that it was more my wheelhouse

4766
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
that it was more my wheelhouse
 

4767
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,790
that it was more my wheelhouse
right and and i think part of that was

4768
01:27:06,790 --> 01:27:06,800
right and and i think part of that was
 

4769
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:08,950
right and and i think part of that was
because i um

4770
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
because i um
 

4771
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,189
because i um
i i grew up in

4772
01:27:11,189 --> 01:27:11,199
i i grew up in
 

4773
01:27:11,199 --> 01:27:13,350
i i grew up in
sort of a world of imagination

4774
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:13,360
sort of a world of imagination
 

4775
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,470
sort of a world of imagination
um and i think that active imagination

4776
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:16,480
um and i think that active imagination
 

4777
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:20,310
um and i think that active imagination

us to double our footage
 

5001
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,070

sometimes the director of photography is
in another room

5020
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,080
in another room
 

5021

filming a different scene if it makes

5022
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:29,440
filming a different scene if it makes
 

5023
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,430
filming a different scene if it makes
sense sometimes we're cross-shooting in

5024
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:31,440
sense sometimes we're cross-shooting in
 

5025
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:33,189
sense sometimes we're cross-shooting in
the same room yeah right it just depends

5026
01:31:33,189 --> 01:31:33,199
the same room yeah right it just depends
 

5027
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:35,910
the same room yeah right it just depends
on the needs of the moment um so so we

5028
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:35,920
on the needs of the moment um so so we
 

5029
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:37,430
on the needs of the moment um so so we
come back with double footage it's one

5030
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:37,440
come back with double footage it's one
 

5031
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:40,149
come back with double footage it's one
thing but as a director so that's you

5032

where where you have a lot of choices
ahead of you and and you're doing it

um a translated release so there's
actually that's an interesting little so

5288
01:36:08,310 --> 01:36:08,320
actually that's an interesting little so
 

5289

5294
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:14,239
so for example you know i think the

01:36:14,239 --> 01:36:16,870
so for example you know i think the
large you know broadcast companies have

5296

large you know broadcast companies have
this formalized process where they

5298
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,040
this formalized process where they
 

5299
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:20,629
this formalized process where they
present a piece of paper

5300
01:36:20,629 --> 01:36:20,639
present a piece of paper
 

5301
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:22,470
present a piece of paper
right yes and

5302
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:22,480
right yes and
 

5303
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:25,109
right yes and
the subject reads it and they sign it

5304
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:25,119
the subject reads it and they sign it
 

5305
01:36:25,119 --> 01:36:27,350
the subject reads it and they sign it
and then you have permission and that's

5306
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
and then you have permission and that's
 

5307
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,590
and then you have permission and that's
irrevocable right so it'll hold up in

5308
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:29,600
irrevocable right so it'll hold up in
 

5309
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:30,870
irrevocable right so it'll hold up in
court

5310
01:36:30,870 --> 01:36:30,880
court
 

5311
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,750
court
that's not how i operate right and so

5312
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:33,760
that's not how i operate right and so
 

5313
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:34,629
that's not how i operate right and so
um

5314
01:36:34,629 --> 01:36:34,639
um
 

5315
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:36,790
um
it's it's just

5316
01:36:36,790 --> 01:36:36,800
it's it's just
 

5317
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,310
it's it's just
for example that doesn't work if

5318
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
for example that doesn't work if
 

5319
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,229
for example that doesn't work if
someone's illiterate and can't read that

5320
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
someone's illiterate and can't read that
 

5321
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,390
someone's illiterate and can't read that
piece of paper right right what if they

5322
01:36:42,390 --> 01:36:42,400
piece of paper right right what if they
 

5323
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:44,149
piece of paper right right what if they
don't know how to sign their name right

5324
01:36:44,149 --> 01:36:44,159
don't know how to sign their name right
 

5325
01:36:44,159 --> 01:36:44,950
don't know how to sign their name right
so instead you have to have a

5326
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
so instead you have to have a
 

5327
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,510
so instead you have to have a
conversation

5328
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
conversation
 

5329
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,350
conversation
ask questions have them ask questions

5330
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:49,360
ask questions have them ask questions
 

5331
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,910
ask questions have them ask questions
come to a complete understanding before

5332
01:36:51,910 --> 01:36:51,920
come to a complete understanding before
 

5333
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:53,590
come to a complete understanding before
you even know whether they understand

5334
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:53,600
you even know whether they understand
 

5335
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:55,350
you even know whether they understand
what you're asking right and then in

5336
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:55,360
what you're asking right and then in
 

5337
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,590
what you're asking right and then in
that case if someone's illiterate then

5338
01:36:57,590 --> 01:36:57,600
that case if someone's illiterate then
 

5339
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,430
that case if someone's illiterate then
you have that conversation you sit down

5340
01:36:59,430 --> 01:36:59,440
you have that conversation you sit down
 

5341
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:01,030
you have that conversation you sit down
and it takes a long time sometimes but

5342
01:37:01,030 --> 01:37:01,040
and it takes a long time sometimes but
 

5343
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:03,189
and it takes a long time sometimes but
you have to do it and then if they still

5344
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199
you have to do it and then if they still
 

5345
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,790
you have to do it and then if they still
want to participate and they give you

5346
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:04,800
want to participate and they give you
 

5347
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,109
want to participate and they give you
their consent you know they can't sign a

5348
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:07,119
their consent you know they can't sign a
 

5349
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:09,910
their consent you know they can't sign a
piece of paper right so then you just do

5350
01:37:09,910 --> 01:37:09,920
piece of paper right so then you just do
 

5351
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,070
piece of paper right so then you just do
in their native language right direct

5352
01:37:12,070 --> 01:37:12,080

some of them couldn't swim
 

5733
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:01,270
some of them couldn't swim
and so we found ourselves in this moment

5734
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
and so we found ourselves in this moment
 

5735
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,910
and so we found ourselves in this moment
where we had a choice we could film

5736
01:44:03,910 --> 01:44:03,920
where we had a choice we could film
 

5737
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:06,790
where we had a choice we could film
someone drowned in front of us or we

5738
01:44:06,790 --> 01:44:06,800
someone drowned in front of us or we
 

5739
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:08,550
someone drowned in front of us or we
could put our cameras down and pull them

5740
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:08,560
could put our cameras down and pull them
 

5741
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:09,830
could put our cameras down and pull them
out of the water

out of the water
 

5743
01:44:09,840 --> 01:44:11,510
out of the water
and so that's what we did

5744
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
and so that's what we did
 

5745
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,229
and so that's what we did
we put our cameras in the bottom of the

5746
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
we put our cameras in the bottom of the
 

5747
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:15,990
we put our cameras in the bottom of the
zodiac and just started pulling people

5748
01:44:15,990 --> 01:44:16,000
zodiac and just started pulling people

out of the water
 

5751
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,950
out of the water
and um

5752
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:18,960

was going to find myself faced with that
dilemma of the moment as a documentarian

5770
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
dilemma of the moment as a documentarian
 

5771
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,830
dilemma of the moment as a documentarian
but there was no question in my mind

5772
01:44:39,830 --> 01:44:39,840
but there was no question in my mind
 

5773
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:41,510
but there was no question in my mind
that i had to put my camera down and

regardless of how the film would have
 

5793
01:44:57,920 --> 01:44:59,350
regardless of how the film would have
been different if i hadn't made that

5794
01:44:59,350 --> 01:44:59,360
been different if i hadn't made that

was going to shift westward across the
 

6105
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:43,589
was going to shift westward across the
mediterranean so i started to research

6106
01:50:43,589 --> 01:50:43,599
mediterranean so i started to research
 

6107
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,589
mediterranean so i started to research
that and discovered that was exactly the

6108
01:50:45,589 --> 01:50:45,599
that and discovered that was exactly the
 

6109
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:46,629
that and discovered that was exactly the
case

6110
01:50:46,629 --> 01:50:46,639
case
 

6111
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:48,229
case
and then further

6112
01:50:48,229 --> 01:50:48,239
and then further
 

6113
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:51,350
and then further
stumbled upon the fact that

6114
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:51,360
stumbled upon the fact that
 

6115
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:53,270
stumbled upon the fact that
nation states hadn't really stepped up

6116
01:50:53,270 --> 01:50:53,280
nation states hadn't really stepped up
 

6117
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,510
nation states hadn't really stepped up
to address it and that there were

6118
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:55,520
to address it and that there were
 

6119
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,830
to address it and that there were
hundreds of asylum seekers often

6120
01:50:57,830 --> 01:50:57,840
hundreds of asylum seekers often
 

6121
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:59,510
hundreds of asylum seekers often
drowning in these flimsy crafts that

6122
01:50:59,510 --> 01:50:59,520
drowning in these flimsy crafts that
 

6123
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:01,830
drowning in these flimsy crafts that
were pushed off from the shores of libya

6124
01:51:01,830 --> 01:51:01,840
were pushed off from the shores of libya
 

6125
01:51:01,840 --> 01:51:03,589
were pushed off from the shores of libya
because the eu

6126
01:51:03,589 --> 01:51:03,599
because the eu
 

6127
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,589
because the eu
wasn't doing its duty to um patrol those

6128
01:51:07,589 --> 01:51:07,599
wasn't doing its duty to um patrol those
 

6129
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,589
wasn't doing its duty to um patrol those
waters from a humanitarian standpoint

6130
01:51:09,589 --> 01:51:09,599
waters from a humanitarian standpoint
 

6131
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:10,550
waters from a humanitarian standpoint
and so

6132
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,560
and so
 

6133
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,709
and so
the net result of that was that this

6134
01:51:12,709 --> 01:51:12,719
the net result of that was that this
 

6135
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:14,629
the net result of that was that this
whole sort of like humanitarian

6136
01:51:14,629 --> 01:51:14,639
whole sort of like humanitarian
 

6137

interesting
 

6435
01:56:41,199 --> 01:56:42,870
interesting
what do you think about that bending the

6436
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:42,880
what do you think about that bending the
 

6437
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,669

law
 

6443
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,750
law
but is there

6444
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:51,760
but is there
 

6445
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:53,189
but is there
does that

6446
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
does that
 

6447
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:57,030
does that
uh just generally speaking bending

6448
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:57,040
uh just generally speaking bending
 

6449
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,750
uh just generally speaking bending
the rules and so on you know just

6450
01:56:59,750 --> 01:56:59,760
the rules and so on you know just
 

6451
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:02,070
the rules and so on you know just
to elaborate on this question perhaps

6452
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,080

instead we're going to get it fixed
 

6563
01:58:55,920 --> 01:58:58,310
instead we're going to get it fixed
beforehand so that we can walk through a

6564
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:58,320
beforehand so that we can walk through a
 

6565
01:58:58,320 --> 01:58:59,990
beforehand so that we can walk through a
different line and have no one look at

6566
01:58:59,990 --> 01:59:00,000
different line and have no one look at
 

6567
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:02,070
different line and have no one look at

6571
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:06,229
that's a pretty good
trade-off in my mind

6572
01:59:06,229 --> 01:59:06,239
trade-off in my mind
 

6573
01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:07,589
trade-off in my mind

way to
 

6591
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:27,189
way to
lessen the probability of death

6592
01:59:27,189 --> 01:59:27,199

 

6593
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:28,629

i don't have a death wish i try to

6594
01:59:28,629 --> 01:59:28,639
i don't have a death wish i try to
 

6595
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:30,950
i don't have a death wish i try to
mitigate risk however i can however i

6596
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:30,960
mitigate risk however i can however i
 

6597
01:59:30,960 --> 01:59:31,830
mitigate risk however i can however i
can

6598
01:59:31,830 --> 01:59:31,840
can
 

6599
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:33,990
can
but one of the ways i can't do it in a

6600
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
but one of the ways i can't do it in a
 

6601
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,910
but one of the ways i can't do it in a
conflict zone is by having armed

6602
01:59:35,910 --> 01:59:35,920
conflict zone is by having armed
 

6603
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:37,430
conflict zone is by having armed
security with me

6604
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:37,440
security with me
 

6605
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,189
security with me
and the reason for that is because

6606
01:59:39,189 --> 01:59:39,199
and the reason for that is because
 

6607
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:41,669
and the reason for that is because
especially in a place like yemen right

6608
01:59:41,669 --> 01:59:41,679
especially in a place like yemen right
 

6609
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:43,109
especially in a place like yemen right
if you have armed security you become a

6610
01:59:43,109 --> 01:59:43,119
if you have armed security you become a
 

6611
01:59:43,119 --> 01:59:46,310
if you have armed security you become a
target in a way that if you're operating

6612
01:59:46,310 --> 01:59:46,320
target in a way that if you're operating

actually have more protection so i don't

6620
01:59:54,470 --> 01:59:54,480
actually have more protection so i don't
 

6621
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:57,030
actually have more protection so i don't
bring security if you're working in

so is fear is an indicator that you

6696
02:01:16,709 --> 02:01:16,719
so is fear is an indicator that you
 

6697
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:18,310
so is fear is an indicator that you
shouldn't do it or is it an indicator

6698
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:18,320
shouldn't do it or is it an indicator
 

6699
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:20,629
shouldn't do it or is it an indicator
you should do it it's probably in the

6700
02:01:20,629 --> 02:01:20,639
you should do it it's probably in the
 

6701
02:01:20,639 --> 02:01:23,270
you should do it it's probably in the
case you should do it right um and you

6702
02:01:23,270 --> 02:01:23,280
case you should do it right um and you
 

6703
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:24,470
case you should do it right um and you
know and

know and
 

6705
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,589
know and
strangely that i think that's why

6706
02:01:27,589 --> 02:01:27,599
strangely that i think that's why
 

6707
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:28,870
strangely that i think that's why
i think

6708
02:01:28,870 --> 02:01:28,880
i think
 

6709
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,470
i think
that's if there's something unusual

6710
02:01:30,470 --> 02:01:30,480
that's if there's something unusual
 

6711
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:32,390
that's if there's something unusual
about the work i do in some part it's

6712
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:32,400
about the work i do in some part it's

02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,629
about the work i do in some part it's
it's because of these types of stories

6714
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
it's because of these types of stories
 

6715
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,629
it's because of these types of stories
right they're hard to access

6716
02:01:36,629 --> 02:01:36,639
right they're hard to access
 

6717
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:40,310
right they're hard to access
but you also have to have a threshold

6718
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:40,320
but you also have to have a threshold
 

6719
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:42,070
but you also have to have a threshold
of willingness

6720
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:42,080
of willingness
 

6721
02:01:42,080 --> 02:01:42,870
of willingness
to

6722
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
to
 

6723
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,550

02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:51,199
physical safety right and maybe that's
 

6731
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:52,790
physical safety right and maybe that's
why you should do them

6732
02:01:52,790 --> 02:01:52,800
why you should do them
 

6733
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:54,629
why you should do them

as a creative mind do you feel the
constraints the financial constraints

7384

the monitor
right because real life

7532
02:16:21,669 --> 02:16:21,679
right because real life
 

7533
02:16:21,679 --> 02:16:23,189
right because real life
is not a screen

7534

right i believe that sort of
the foundational skills which are

um aren't necessarily those technical
skills

7546
02:16:34,709 --> 02:16:34,719
skills
 

7547
02:16:34,719 --> 02:16:36,549
skills
which we're going to l learn in trade

7548
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
which we're going to l learn in trade
 

7549
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:41,270
which we're going to l learn in trade
schools or or university i think the

7550
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:41,280
schools or or university i think the
 

7551
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,270
schools or or university i think the
they're more foundational than that

7552
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:43,280
they're more foundational than that
 

7553
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:46,709
they're more foundational than that
they're learning how to interact

7554
02:16:46,709 --> 02:16:46,719
they're learning how to interact
 

7555
02:16:46,719 --> 02:16:49,669
they're learning how to interact

how to step out of your door and if the
 

7567
02:17:00,800 --> 02:17:03,190
how to step out of your door and if the
electricity goes out right and you're

7568
02:17:03,190 --> 02:17:03,200
electricity goes out right and you're
 

7569
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:05,030
electricity goes out right and you're
five miles away from your house you

7570
02:17:05,030 --> 02:17:05,040
five miles away from your house you
 

7571

five miles away from your house you
don't need a smartphone to get home

7572
02:17:07,270 --> 02:17:07,280
don't need a smartphone to get home
 

7573
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:09,349
don't need a smartphone to get home
because you've set visual markers for

7574
02:17:09,349 --> 02:17:09,359
because you've set visual markers for
 

7575
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:11,349
because you've set visual markers for
yourself on how to get back to where you

7576
02:17:11,349 --> 02:17:11,359
yourself on how to get back to where you
 

7577
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:14,309
yourself on how to get back to where you
live right i think we're in danger right

7578
02:17:14,309 --> 02:17:14,319
live right i think we're in danger right
 

7579
02:17:14,319 --> 02:17:15,910
live right i think we're in danger right
now

7580
02:17:15,910 --> 02:17:15,920
now
 

7581
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:16,950
now
of

7582
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:16,960
of
 

7583
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:19,030
of
living in a world where if the

7584
02:17:19,030 --> 02:17:19,040
living in a world where if the
 

7585
02:17:19,040 --> 02:17:22,309
living in a world where if the
satellites stop functioning right um

7586
02:17:22,309 --> 02:17:22,319
satellites stop functioning right um
 

7587
02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:23,990
satellites stop functioning right um
then a whole lot of people become

7588
02:17:23,990 --> 02:17:24,000
then a whole lot of people become
 

7589
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,150
then a whole lot of people become
completely

7590
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,160
completely
 

7591
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,230
completely
dysfunctional right because we're so

7592
02:17:28,230 --> 02:17:28,240
dysfunctional right because we're so
 

7593
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:31,030
dysfunctional right because we're so
reliant upon the screens in our lives so

7594
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:31,040
reliant upon the screens in our lives so
 

7595
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,709
reliant upon the screens in our lives so
i think there's a lot of foundational

7596
02:17:32,709 --> 02:17:32,719
i think there's a lot of foundational
 

7597
02:17:32,719 --> 02:17:34,070
i think there's a lot of foundational
skills that have nothing to do with

7598
02:17:34,070 --> 02:17:34,080
skills that have nothing to do with
 

7599
02:17:34,080 --> 02:17:35,830
skills that have nothing to do with
technology that we need to learn that

7600
02:17:35,830 --> 02:17:35,840
technology that we need to learn that
 

7601
02:17:35,840 --> 02:17:37,990
technology that we need to learn that
that and everything rests upon those so

7602
02:17:37,990 --> 02:17:38,000
that and everything rests upon those so
 

7603
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,030
that and everything rests upon those so
i would say learn those foundations

7604
02:17:39,030 --> 02:17:39,040
i would say learn those foundations
 

7605
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,790
i would say learn those foundations
learn how to write well

7606
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:40,800
learn how to write well
 

7607
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:43,190
learn how to write well
read a lot right

7608
02:17:43,190 --> 02:17:43,200
read a lot right
 

7609
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:45,110
read a lot right
it's a different kind of knowledge and

7610
02:17:45,110 --> 02:17:45,120
it's a different kind of knowledge and
 

7611
02:17:45,120 --> 02:17:47,270
it's a different kind of knowledge and
wisdom that comes out of that

7612
02:17:47,270 --> 02:17:47,280
wisdom that comes out of that
 

7613
02:17:47,280 --> 02:17:48,950
wisdom that comes out of that
so reading is kind of the equivalent of

7614
02:17:48,950 --> 02:17:48,960
so reading is kind of the equivalent of
 

7615
02:17:48,960 --> 02:17:53,110
so reading is kind of the equivalent of
listening and observing and writing is

7616
02:17:53,110 --> 02:17:53,120

 

7617
02:17:53,120 --> 02:17:55,509

kind of

7618
02:17:55,509 --> 02:17:55,519
kind of
 

7619
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:57,349
kind of
integration of all of that that you've

7620
02:17:57,349 --> 02:17:57,359
integration of all of that that you've
 

7621
02:17:57,359 --> 02:17:58,870
integration of all of that that you've
observed and listened to and tried to

7622
02:17:58,870 --> 02:17:58,880
observed and listened to and tried to
 

7623
02:17:58,880 --> 02:18:00,709
observed and listened to and tried to
express something with that so i think

7624

8081
02:26:23,520 --> 02:26:25,670

now i would take away the perfect part

8082
02:26:25,670 --> 02:26:25,680
now i would take away the perfect part
 

8083
02:26:25,680 --> 02:26:26,469
now i would take away the perfect part
right

8084
02:26:26,469 --> 02:26:26,479
right
 

8085
02:26:26,479 --> 02:26:28,710
right
but i think i've remembered that quote

8086
02:26:28,710 --> 02:26:28,720
but i think i've remembered that quote
 

8087

for so many years
 

8089
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:32,830
for so many years
because i believe in the underlying

8090
02:26:32,830 --> 02:26:32,840
because i believe in the underlying
 

8091
02:26:32,840 --> 02:26:35,110
because i believe in the underlying
notion that

8092
02:26:35,110 --> 02:26:35,120
notion that
 

8093
02:26:35,120 --> 02:26:36,870
notion that
the blows of the chisel which are the

02:26:36,870 --> 02:26:36,880
the blows of the chisel which are the
 

8095
02:26:36,880 --> 02:26:39,910
the blows of the chisel which are the
experiences that we go through shape us

8096
02:26:39,910 --> 02:26:39,920
experiences that we go through shape us
 

8097
02:26:39,920 --> 02:26:43,590
experiences that we go through shape us
right necessarily so and hopefully shape
