i think you need to create a new one and
 

173
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,390
i think you need to create a new one and
so after much deliberation

174
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
so after much deliberation
 

175
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,670
so after much deliberation
we decided to do it and i think

176
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
we decided to do it and i think
 

177
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,509
we decided to do it and i think
uh it's a hugely

178
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
uh it's a hugely
 

179
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,830
uh it's a hugely
timely opportunity

180
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
timely opportunity
 

181
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,550
timely opportunity
to do what people used to do in this

182
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:32,560
to do what people used to do in this
 

183
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,830
to do what people used to do in this
country which was to create new

184
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:33,840
country which was to create new
 

185
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,830

and i thought why why why are there no
 

193
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,630
and i thought why why why are there no
new universities or at least if there

194
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,640
new universities or at least if there
 

195
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,949

are why do they have so little impact

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,470
focus on the other crazy people on the
road so that's the dream that we can

504
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
road so that's the dream that we can
 

505
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,470
road so that's the dream that we can
create something which is you know

506
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:26,480
create something which is you know
 

507
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,030
create something which is you know
partly classical and partly 21st century

508
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:29,040
partly classical and partly 21st century
 

509
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,790
partly classical and partly 21st century
and we look around and we we don't see

510
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:30,800
and we look around and we we don't see
 

511
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,150
and we look around and we we don't see
it if you if you don't see an

512
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:32,160
it if you if you don't see an
 

513
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,990
it if you if you don't see an
institution that you really think should

514
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,000
institution that you really think should
 

515
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,670
institution that you really think should
exist i think you have a more

516
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
exist i think you have a more
 

517
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,990
exist i think you have a more
responsibility to create it

518
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
responsibility to create it
 

519
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,110
responsibility to create it
so you're thinking including

520
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
so you're thinking including
 

521
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,550
so you're thinking including
something bigger than just liberal

522
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:42,560
something bigger than just liberal
 

523
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,230
something bigger than just liberal
education also including science

524
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
education also including science
 

525
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,550
education also including science
engineering and technology i should also

526
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:46,560
engineering and technology i should also

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,670

that
you know i mostly stay out of politics

you know i mostly stay out of politics
 

533
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,070
you know i mostly stay out of politics
and out of some of these

534
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:54,080
and out of some of these
 

535
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,910
and out of some of these
aspects of liberal education that kind

536
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
aspects of liberal education that kind
 

537
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,430
aspects of liberal education that kind
of been the most controversial and

538
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
of been the most controversial and
 

539
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,509
of been the most controversial and
difficult within the university

540
00:09:59,509 --> 00:09:59,519
difficult within the university
 

541
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,030
difficult within the university
but there is

542
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
but there is
 

543
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,790
but there is
a kind of ripple effect of fear within

00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
a kind of ripple effect of fear within
 

545
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,710
a kind of ripple effect of fear within
that space

546

that space
 

547
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,949
that space
into science and engineering and

it's

it's
 

577
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,310
it's
it is controversial in that space to say

that
 

581
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,630
that
anything against machine learning saying

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:44,640
anything against machine learning saying
 

583
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,550
anything against machine learning saying
sort of exploring ideas that saying this

sort of exploring ideas that saying this
 

585
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,750
sort of exploring ideas that saying this
is going to

586
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:47,760
is going to
 

587
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,670
is going to
lead to a dead end

588
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
lead to a dead end

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,790
lead to a dead end
um now

590
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:50,800
um now
 

591
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,110
um now
that that takes some guts to do as a

595
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,750
young 20 year old within uh within a
classroom to think like that to raise

that question in a machine learning

that question in a machine learning
course it sounds ridiculous because it's

course it sounds ridiculous because it's
 

601
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,630
course it sounds ridiculous because it's
like who's going to

00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:02,640
like who's going to
 

603
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,350
like who's going to
uh complain about this but the the fear

604

computer science and there's a lot you
 

625
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,630
computer science and there's a lot you
know there's like linear algebra that's

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:24,640
know there's like linear algebra that's
 

627
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,069
know there's like linear algebra that's
not going to change

not going to change
 

629
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,630
not going to change
but then there's like applied linear

630
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:28,640
but then there's like applied linear
 

631
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,230
but then there's like applied linear
algebra which is machine learning and

algebra which is machine learning and
 

633

that's when you have to ask yourself
these difficult questions about

something it's impossible to compete
 

1285
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,230
something it's impossible to compete
with initially because they have

we've kind of killed all that we've
 

2315

killed all that in the us because nobody
 

2317
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:12,309

newspaper so that that's what we need to
 

2327
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,870
newspaper so that that's what we need to
kind of restore the

2328

kind of restore the
 

2329
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,829
kind of restore the
the social life of academia so there's

00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:25,839
the social life of academia so there's
 

2331
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,750
the social life of academia so there's
magic we didn't really address it sort

2332
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
magic we didn't really address it sort
 

2333
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,349
magic we didn't really address it sort
of explicitly

2334
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
of explicitly
 

2335
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:31,910
of explicitly
but there's magic to the interaction

2336
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:31,920
but there's magic to the interaction
 

2337
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,550
but there's magic to the interaction
between students there's magic

2338
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
between students there's magic
 

2339
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,710
between students there's magic
in the interaction between

2340
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:36,720
in the interaction between
 

2341
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,309
in the interaction between
faculty the people that teach and

2342
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:38,319
faculty the people that teach and
 

2343
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:39,829
faculty the people that teach and
there's the magic and the interaction

2344
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:39,839
there's the magic and the interaction
 

2345
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,670
there's the magic and the interaction
between the students and the faculty and

2346
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:41,680
between the students and the faculty and
 

2347
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,910
between the students and the faculty and
it's it's an iterative process that

2348
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:43,920
it's it's an iterative process that
 

2349
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,910
it's it's an iterative process that
changes everybody involved

2350
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:45,920
changes everybody involved
 

2351
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,430
changes everybody involved
so it's like world experts in a

2352
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:47,440
so it's like world experts in a
 

2353
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,230
so it's like world experts in a
particular discipline are changed

2354
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
particular discipline are changed
 

2355
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,589
particular discipline are changed
as much as the students as the 20 year

2356
00:42:53,589 --> 00:42:53,599
as much as the students as the 20 year
 

2357
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:54,870
as much as the students as the 20 year
olds with the

2358
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:54,880
olds with the
 

2359
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,950
olds with the
with the wild ideas

2360
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:56,960
with the wild ideas
 

2361
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,950
with the wild ideas
each are changed and that's the magic of

2362
00:42:58,950 --> 00:42:58,960
each are changed and that's the magic of
 

2363
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,030
each are changed and that's the magic of
it that applies in liberal education

2364
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
it that applies in liberal education
 

2365
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,430
it that applies in liberal education
that applies in this in the sciences too

2366
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:03,440
that applies in this in the sciences too
 

2367
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,190
that applies in this in the sciences too
that's probably maybe you can speak to

2368
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
that's probably maybe you can speak to
 

2369
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,510
that's probably maybe you can speak to
this why so much

2370
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:07,520
this why so much
 

2371
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,430
this why so much
scientific innovation has happened in

2372
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:09,440
scientific innovation has happened in
 

2373
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,910
scientific innovation has happened in
universities there's something about the

2374
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:11,920
universities there's something about the
 

2375
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,510
universities there's something about the
youthful energy

2376
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:13,520
youthful energy
 

2377
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,510
youthful energy
of like young minds

2378
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:15,520
of like young minds
 

2379
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,430
of like young minds
graduate students undergraduate students

2380
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,440
graduate students undergraduate students
 

2381
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,430
graduate students undergraduate students
that inspire some of the world experts

2382
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:19,440
that inspire some of the world experts
 

2383
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:20,950
that inspire some of the world experts
to do some of the best work of their

2384

to do some of the best work of their
 

2385
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,430
to do some of the best work of their
lives yeah well the human brain we know

2386
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
lives yeah well the human brain we know
 

2387
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,430
lives yeah well the human brain we know
is at its most dynamic uh when people

2388
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
is at its most dynamic uh when people
 

2389
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,190
is at its most dynamic uh when people
are pretty young

2390
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
are pretty young
 

2391
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,790
are pretty young
you know this with your background in

2392
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:28,800
you know this with your background in
 

2393
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,030
you know this with your background in
math people don't get better at math

2394
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,040
math people don't get better at math
 

2395
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,870
math people don't get better at math
after the age of 30.

2396
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
after the age of 30.
 

2397
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,990
after the age of 30.
and

2398
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,000
and
 

2399
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,710
and
this is important when you think about

2400
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
this is important when you think about
 

2401
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,390
this is important when you think about
the intergenerational character of

2402
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:38,400
the intergenerational character of
 

2403
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,270
the intergenerational character of
university the older

2404
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:41,280
university the older
 

2405
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,630
university the older
people the professors have the

2406
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:42,640
people the professors have the
 

2407
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,069
people the professors have the
experience

2408
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:44,079
experience
 

2409
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,190
experience
but they're fading intellectually from

2410
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
but they're fading intellectually from
 

2411
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,870
but they're fading intellectually from
much earlier than anybody really wants

2412
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:48,880
much earlier than anybody really wants
 

2413
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,150
much earlier than anybody really wants
to admit

2414
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
to admit
 

2415
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,670
to admit
and so you get

2416
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:51,680
and so you get
 

2417
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,750
and so you get
this intellectual

2418
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
this intellectual
 

2419
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,670
this intellectual
shot in the arm

2420
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
shot in the arm
 

2421
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,750
shot in the arm
from hanging out with people who are

2422
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
from hanging out with people who are
 

2423
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,270
from hanging out with people who are
circa 20

2424
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
circa 20
 

2425
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,230
circa 20
don't know [\h__\h] but the brains are kind

2426
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
don't know [\h__\h] but the brains are kind
 

2427
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,150
don't know [\h__\h] but the brains are kind
of like cooking yeah

2428
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
of like cooking yeah
 

2429
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,750

2443
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,349
institutions
because

2444
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:21,359
because
 

2445
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,390
because
they would

and for me it's always been about
 

2455
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,829
and for me it's always been about
encouraging

encouraging
 

2457
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,030
encouraging
some active intellectual rebellion

so there is definitely as you said a
 

2471
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,870
so there is definitely as you said a
magic in that interaction across the

2475
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,349

some of it is in the bottom quintile of
 

3107

the income distribution
 

3109
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,510
the income distribution
and that makes it hard to get to elite

3110
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:13,520
and that makes it hard to get to elite

01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,069
and the verification comes in the form
of signatures and you you need

and that's actually how world trade

3680

and that's actually how world trade
 

3681
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,190
and that's actually how world trade
grows because you just couldn't settle

all those

so bills of exchange are an exciting uh

so bills of exchange are an exciting uh
part of the story and they illustrate

now there are three

3722
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
now there are three
 

3723
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,470
now there are three
or four things that are worth saying

3724
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:52,480
or four things that are worth saying
 

3725
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,789
or four things that are worth saying
about this and i'll just say two one

3726
01:06:54,789 --> 01:06:54,799
about this and i'll just say two one
 

3727
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:56,470
about this and i'll just say two one
it may be that those three things are a

3728
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:56,480
it may be that those three things are a
 

3729
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,150
it may be that those three things are a
trilemma and it's very difficult for

3730
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:58,160
trilemma and it's very difficult for
 

3731
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,829
trilemma and it's very difficult for
anything to be all of them this point

3732

anything to be all of them this point

he would write this up as a paper

3738

he would write this up as a paper
 

3739
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,589
he would write this up as a paper
because it's a great insight

3740
01:07:07,589 --> 01:07:07,599
because it's a great insight
 

3741
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:08,870
because it's a great insight
the second thing that's really

3742
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:08,880
the second thing that's really
 

3743
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,789
the second thing that's really
interesting to me is that

3744
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:10,799
interesting to me is that
 

3745
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:12,789
interesting to me is that
payments don't need to be money

payments don't need to be money
 

3747

payments don't need to be money
and if we go around as economists love

about crypto that is isn't money doesn't

3762
01:07:28,309 --> 01:07:28,319
about crypto that is isn't money doesn't
 

3763
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,069
about crypto that is isn't money doesn't
need to be money it's like bills of

3764
01:07:30,069 --> 01:07:30,079
need to be money it's like bills of
 

3765
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,510
need to be money it's like bills of

when it hit me the other day that we

3772
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:39,520
when it hit me the other day that we
 

3773
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,510
when it hit me the other day that we
actually had this precedent for crypto i

3774
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
actually had this precedent for crypto i
 

3775
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,349
actually had this precedent for crypto i
got quite excited and thought

3776
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:43,359
got quite excited and thought
 

3777
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,029
got quite excited and thought
i wish i had written that in the ascent

3778
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
i wish i had written that in the ascent
 

3779
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:46,470
i wish i had written that in the ascent
of money

3780
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:46,480

3781
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,630

can you sort of from a first principles

3782
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:48,640
can you sort of from a first principles
 

3783
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,910
can you sort of from a first principles
like almost like a physics perspective

3784
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
like almost like a physics perspective
 

3785
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,829
like almost like a physics perspective
or maybe a human perspective

or maybe a human perspective
 

3787
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:57,190

uh describe where does the value of

3788
01:07:57,190 --> 01:07:57,200
uh describe where does the value of
 

3789
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,510
uh describe where does the value of
money come from like where is it

3790
01:07:59,510 --> 01:07:59,520
money come from like where is it
 

3791
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,789
money come from like where is it
actually

3792
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:00,799
actually
 

3793
01:08:00,799 --> 01:08:03,109
actually
where is it so it's a sheet of paper or

3794
01:08:03,109 --> 01:08:03,119
where is it so it's a sheet of paper or
 

3795
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:04,789
where is it so it's a sheet of paper or
it's coins

3796
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:04,799
it's coins
 

3797
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:05,750
it's coins
but

3798
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
but
 

3799
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,990
but
it feels like in a platonic sense

01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:08,000
it feels like in a platonic sense
 

3801
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,430
it feels like in a platonic sense
there's some kind of thing that's

there's some kind of thing that's
 

3803
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,829
there's some kind of thing that's
actually storing the value as us a bunch

3804
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
actually storing the value as us a bunch

01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,709
it's a banknote or a coin or whatever
it does depend on

01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:14,719
it does depend on
 

3863
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:19,110
it does depend on
us both trusting it

and then
 

4237
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,990
and then
we invented equity finance

we invented equity finance
 

4239
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,709
we invented equity finance

throw a lot of sand into the machine

4602
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:33,360
throw a lot of sand into the machine

that's generally what happens

5027
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:11,590

5035
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,510
government miscalculates
and they unleash lethal lethal force on

and they unleash lethal lethal force on
 

5037
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,910
and they unleash lethal lethal force on

rothschilds could stop world war one
 

5047
01:30:29,199 --> 01:30:30,709
rothschilds could stop world war one
and they were then the biggest bank in

and they were then the biggest bank in
 

5049

so let's accept that war is

01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:37,840
so let's accept that war is
 

5055
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,110
so let's accept that war is
is in a different domain

so the conflict that i could foresee in

5074
01:30:58,870 --> 01:30:58,880
so the conflict that i could foresee in
 

5075
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,470
so the conflict that i could foresee in
the future is one that's highly

01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,480
the future is one that's highly

the future is one that's highly
financially disruptive

financially disruptive
 

5079
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,189
financially disruptive
where does crypto fit in

5080
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:05,199
where does crypto fit in
 

5081
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:07,430
where does crypto fit in
crypto's obvious

5082
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
crypto's obvious
 

5083
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:09,750
crypto's obvious
utility in the short run

5084
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
utility in the short run
 

5085
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,510
utility in the short run
is as a store of

5086
01:31:11,510 --> 01:31:11,520
is as a store of
 

5087
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,070
is as a store of
wealth of transferable wealth for people

5088
01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:14,080
wealth of transferable wealth for people
 

5089
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:15,270
wealth of transferable wealth for people
who live

5090
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:15,280
who live
 

5091
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:16,950
who live
in dangerous places

5092
01:31:16,950 --> 01:31:16,960
in dangerous places
 

5093
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:17,830
in dangerous places
with

5094
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:17,840
with
 

5095
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:19,750
with
failing not just failing money but

5096
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:19,760
failing not just failing money but
 

5097
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:21,270
failing not just failing money but
failing rule of law

5098
01:31:21,270 --> 01:31:21,280
failing rule of law
 

5099
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,030
failing rule of law
that's why in latin america there's so

5100
01:31:23,030 --> 01:31:23,040
that's why in latin america there's so
 

5101
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:24,870
that's why in latin america there's so
much interest in crypto because latin

5102
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:24,880
much interest in crypto because latin
 

5103
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:26,470
much interest in crypto because latin
americans have a lot of monetary history

5104
01:31:26,470 --> 01:31:26,480
americans have a lot of monetary history
 

5105
01:31:26,480 --> 01:31:29,830
americans have a lot of monetary history
to look back on and not much of it is

5106
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
to look back on and not much of it is
 

5107
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,550
to look back on and not much of it is
so i think that the short run

5108
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:32,560
so i think that the short run
 

5109
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:34,950
so i think that the short run
problem that crypto solves

5110
01:31:34,950 --> 01:31:34,960
problem that crypto solves
 

5111
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:37,590
problem that crypto solves
is and this goes back to the the digital

5112
01:31:37,590 --> 01:31:37,600
is and this goes back to the the digital
 

5113
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,030
is and this goes back to the the digital
gold point

5114
01:31:39,030 --> 01:31:39,040
gold point
 

5115
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,070
gold point
if you are in a dangerous place with

if you are in a dangerous place with
 

5117
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:43,590
if you are in a dangerous place with
weak rule of law and weak property

here's a new and better way

5122
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:47,600
here's a new and better way
 

5123
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,110
here's a new and better way
to have portable wealth

5124
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:51,120

 

5125
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:53,510

i think the next

5126
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:53,520
i think the next
 

5127
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:55,990
i think the next
question to ask is

5128
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:56,000
question to ask is
 

5129
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,709
question to ask is
would you want to be long crypto

5130
01:31:58,709 --> 01:31:58,719
would you want to be long crypto
 

5131
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,990
would you want to be long crypto
in the event of world war three

5132
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,000
in the event of world war three
 

5133
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,430
in the event of world war three
what's interesting about that question

5134
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:03,440
what's interesting about that question
 

5135
01:32:03,440 --> 01:32:04,870
what's interesting about that question
is that world war three would likely

5136
01:32:04,870 --> 01:32:04,880
is that world war three would likely
 

5137
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:08,229
is that world war three would likely
have a significant cyber dimension to it

5138
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
have a significant cyber dimension to it
 

5139
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:09,990
have a significant cyber dimension to it
and i don't want to be a hundred percent

5140
01:32:09,990 --> 01:32:10,000
and i don't want to be a hundred percent
 

5141
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,590
and i don't want to be a hundred percent
in crypto if

5142
01:32:11,590 --> 01:32:11,600
in crypto if
 

5143
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,910
in crypto if
they crash the internet

5144
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:13,920
they crash the internet
 

5145
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,149
they crash the internet
which between them china and russia

5146
01:32:16,149 --> 01:32:16,159
which between them china and russia
 

5147
01:32:16,159 --> 01:32:18,229
which between them china and russia
might be able to do

5148
01:32:18,229 --> 01:32:18,239
might be able to do
 

5149
01:32:18,239 --> 01:32:20,070
might be able to do
that's a fascinating question whether

5150
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
that's a fascinating question whether
 

5151
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:21,590
that's a fascinating question whether
you want to be holding

5152
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:21,600
you want to be holding
 

5153
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:24,229
you want to be holding
physical gold or digital gold in the

5154
01:32:24,229 --> 01:32:24,239
physical gold or digital gold in the
 

5155
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:26,790
physical gold or digital gold in the
event of world war iii the smart person

5156
01:32:26,790 --> 01:32:26,800
event of world war iii the smart person
 

5157
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,709
event of world war iii the smart person
who studied history definitely wants

5158
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:28,719
who studied history definitely wants
 

5159
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,310
who studied history definitely wants
better both

5160
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
better both
 

5161
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,990
better both
and

5162
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,000
and
 

5163
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,310
and
so let's imagine world war iii has a

5164
01:32:34,310 --> 01:32:34,320
so let's imagine world war iii has a
 

5165
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,709
so let's imagine world war iii has a
very very severe cyber component to it

5166
01:32:36,709 --> 01:32:36,719
very very severe cyber component to it
 

5167
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,189
very very severe cyber component to it
with high levels of disruption

5168
01:32:39,189 --> 01:32:39,199
with high levels of disruption
 

5169
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,350
with high levels of disruption
yeah you'd be glad of the old the old

5170
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:41,360
yeah you'd be glad of the old the old
 

5171
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:43,990
yeah you'd be glad of the old the old
shiny stuff at that point

5172
01:32:43,990 --> 01:32:44,000
shiny stuff at that point
 

5173
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,590
shiny stuff at that point
so

5174
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:45,600
so
 

5175
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,590
so
diversification still seems like the

5176
01:32:47,590 --> 01:32:47,600
diversification still seems like the
 

5177
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:51,270
diversification still seems like the
most important truth of a financial

5178
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:51,280
most important truth of a financial
 

5179
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:54,149
most important truth of a financial
history yeah and and what is crypto it's

5180
01:32:54,149 --> 01:32:54,159
history yeah and and what is crypto it's
 

5181
01:32:54,159 --> 01:32:55,590
history yeah and and what is crypto it's
just this wonderful new source of

5182
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:55,600
just this wonderful new source of
 

5183
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,149
just this wonderful new source of
diversification but you'd be nuts to be

5184
01:32:58,149 --> 01:32:58,159
diversification but you'd be nuts to be
 

5185
01:32:58,159 --> 01:33:01,189
diversification but you'd be nuts to be
a hundred percent in bitcoin i mean i i

01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
i have some friends who are probably
 

5189
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,310
i have some friends who are probably
quite close to that close to 100

5190

i
 

5193
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,750
i
i'd marr the i'd mar the bowls of steel

i'd marr the i'd mar the bowls of steel
yeah

5196
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:12,560
yeah
 

5197
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,350
yeah
uh in whatever way that balls of steel

5198
01:33:15,350 --> 01:33:15,360
uh in whatever way that balls of steel
 

5199

takes uh to takes form
 

5201
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:20,070
takes uh to takes form
uh you mentioned smart contracts what

5202
01:33:20,070 --> 01:33:20,080
uh you mentioned smart contracts what
 

5203
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:21,669
uh you mentioned smart contracts what
are your thoughts about

5204
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
are your thoughts about
 

5205
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,510
are your thoughts about

about ethereum about smart contracts

5208
01:33:25,510 --> 01:33:25,520
about ethereum about smart contracts
 

5209
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,510
about ethereum about smart contracts
about kind of

more systematic at scale formalization

5214
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:31,520
more systematic at scale formalization
 

5215
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,790
more systematic at scale formalization
of agreements between humans

5216

of agreements between humans
 

5217
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,669
of agreements between humans
i think

5218
01:33:37,669 --> 01:33:37,679
i think
 

5219
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,470
i think
it must be the case

5220
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
it must be the case
 

5221
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,510
it must be the case
that a lot of the complexity in a

5225
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:46,709
mortgage
is

5226
01:33:46,709 --> 01:33:46,719
is
 

5227
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:49,030
is
redundant

5507
01:38:48,159 --> 01:38:50,070

we're gonna solve that problem

5508
01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:50,080
we're gonna solve that problem
 

5509
01:38:50,080 --> 01:38:51,590
we're gonna solve that problem
so ten years from now the transaction

5510
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
so ten years from now the transaction
 

5511
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,910
so ten years from now the transaction
cost will just be negligible and the

5512
01:38:53,910 --> 01:38:53,920
cost will just be negligible and the
 

5513
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:55,430
cost will just be negligible and the
money will go to the people who need it

5514
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:55,440
money will go to the people who need it
 

5515
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,430
money will go to the people who need it
rather than to rent seeking financial

5516

rather than to rent seeking financial
 

5517
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:58,790
rather than to rent seeking financial
institutions so i'm on the side of the

5518
01:38:58,790 --> 01:38:58,800
institutions so i'm on the side of the
 

5519
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,109
institutions so i'm on the side of the
revolution with this because i think the

5520
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:01,119
revolution with this because i think the
 

5521
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,629

middle class and lower class families
 

5529

middle class and lower class families
lose out and

lose out and
 

5531
01:39:11,040 --> 01:39:13,030
lose out and
thankfully technology technology allows

01:39:13,030 --> 01:39:13,040
thankfully technology technology allows
 

5533
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,709
thankfully technology technology allows
us to fix this yeah so fintech can

5534
01:39:14,709 --> 01:39:14,719
us to fix this yeah so fintech can
 

5535
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:16,310
us to fix this yeah so fintech can
remove a lot of inefficiencies in the

remove a lot of inefficiencies in the
 

5537
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:19,189
remove a lot of inefficiencies in the
system i'm super excited myself maybe as

5538
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:19,199
system i'm super excited myself maybe as
 

5539
01:39:19,199 --> 01:39:21,189

a machine learning person in the data
 

5541
01:39:21,199 --> 01:39:22,709
a machine learning person in the data
oracles so

5542
01:39:22,709 --> 01:39:22,719
oracles so
 

5543
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:24,950
oracles so
converting a lot of our physical world

5544
01:39:24,950 --> 01:39:24,960
converting a lot of our physical world
 

5545
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:27,189
converting a lot of our physical world
into data so

5546
01:39:27,189 --> 01:39:27,199
into data so
 

5547
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:29,109
into data so
and have smart contracts on top of that

5548
01:39:29,109 --> 01:39:29,119
and have smart contracts on top of that
 

5549
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:29,830
and have smart contracts on top of that
so

5550
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
so
 

5551
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,550
so
that no longer is there's this fuzziness

5552
01:39:32,550 --> 01:39:32,560
that no longer is there's this fuzziness

of europe in 1918 so that's one can we
 

5929
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:31,430
of europe in 1918 so that's one can we
linger on that one

5930
01:46:31,430 --> 01:46:31,440
linger on that one
 

5931
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:33,830
linger on that one
that one

5932
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
that one
 

5933
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,390
that one
uh a lot of people push back on you on

5934
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:36,400
uh a lot of people push back on you on
 

5935

uh a lot of people push back on you on
in the

5936
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:37,760
in the
 

5937
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:38,830
in the
because it's so

5938
01:46:38,830 --> 01:46:38,840
because it's so
 

5939
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:40,390
because it's so
difficult

5940
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,400
difficult
 

5941
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,870
difficult
so the idea is if i could try to

5942
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:42,880
so the idea is if i could try to
 

5943
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,390
so the idea is if i could try to
summarize and

5944
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
summarize and
 

5945
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,070
summarize and
you're the first person that made me

you're the first person that made me
 

5947
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:49,270
you're the first person that made me
think about this very uncomfortable

5951
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,070
thought
which is uh

5952
01:46:52,070 --> 01:46:52,080
which is uh
 

5953
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:54,790
which is uh

01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:57,350
deterred the germans
so the liberal government

so the liberal government
 

6071
01:48:57,360 --> 01:48:59,350

the first world war
but by 1916 i don't see how uh

01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:51,040
but by 1916 i don't see how uh

and i think the war would have been over
 

6127
01:49:56,159 --> 01:49:59,109
and i think the war would have been over
perhaps at some point in 1916.

perhaps at some point in 1916.

they'd have had to keep britain out and
the way to keep britain out was

so the great mistake of the strategy of
 

6547
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:32,870
so the great mistake of the strategy of
appeasement was to play for time i mean

playing for time not realizing that
 

6553
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:39,030
playing for time not realizing that
hitler got the time too

6554
01:57:39,030 --> 01:57:39,040
hitler got the time too
 

6555
01:57:39,040 --> 01:57:41,910
hitler got the time too
and after he partitioned czechoslovakia

6556
01:57:41,910 --> 01:57:41,920
and after he partitioned czechoslovakia
 

6557
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,830
and after he partitioned czechoslovakia
he was in a much stronger position not

6558
01:57:43,830 --> 01:57:43,840
he was in a much stronger position not
 

6559
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:45,990
he was in a much stronger position not
least because of all the resources that

uh from czechoslovakia
 

6565
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:52,709
uh from czechoslovakia
so that was the conceptual mistake

6566
01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
so that was the conceptual mistake
 

6567
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,070

01:58:05,510 --> 01:58:05,520
what does it take
 

6579
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,589
what does it take
it takes a distinct courage

6580
01:58:09,589 --> 01:58:09,599
it takes a distinct courage
 

6581

sees the historical problem much more
 

6605
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:41,109
sees the historical problem much more
clearly than than chamberlain so i think

forgiven for much else and that was the
 

7397
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:23,350

one thing the trump administration got

7398
02:12:23,350 --> 02:12:23,360
one thing the trump administration got
 

7399
02:12:23,360 --> 02:12:25,030
one thing the trump administration got
right because

02:12:25,030 --> 02:12:25,040
right because
 

7401
02:12:25,040 --> 02:12:27,589
right because
uh they went around the bureaucracy with

02:12:27,589 --> 02:12:27,599
uh they went around the bureaucracy with
 

7403
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:30,149
uh they went around the bureaucracy with
operation warp speed and achieved a

7404
02:12:30,149 --> 02:12:30,159
operation warp speed and achieved a
 

7405
02:12:30,159 --> 02:12:33,189
operation warp speed and achieved a
really major success

7406
02:12:33,189 --> 02:12:33,199
really major success
 

7407
02:12:33,199 --> 02:12:36,790
really major success
so i think the paradox of of

02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,669

the 2020
 

7413
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:41,669
the 2020
story in the united states is that the

7414
02:12:41,669 --> 02:12:41,679
story in the united states is that the
 

7415

7416

administration got right

7418

administration got right
 

7419
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:47,830
administration got right
and it got so much else wrong that was

7420
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:47,840
and it got so much else wrong that was
 

7421
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:49,750
and it got so much else wrong that was
sort of marginal that we were left with

7422
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
sort of marginal that we were left with
 

7423
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:52,149

the impression that trump had
 

7425
02:12:52,159 --> 02:12:53,750
the impression that trump had
been to blame for the whole disaster

7426
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
been to blame for the whole disaster
 

7427
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:56,310

which wasn't really quite right

sure it would have been great if we did

but ultimately vaccines are more

7434
02:13:01,430 --> 02:13:01,440
but ultimately vaccines are more
 

7435
02:13:01,440 --> 02:13:04,790
but ultimately vaccines are more
important than tests and

7436

important than tests and
 

7437
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:07,030

this brings me to the question that that

02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:16,960
you don't need to be in epidemiology you
 

7503
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:18,390
you don't need to be in epidemiology you
don't need to be a medical scientist to

7504
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:18,400
don't need to be a medical scientist to
 

7505
02:14:18,400 --> 02:14:20,470
don't need to be a medical scientist to
know that the virus is about two orders

7506
02:14:20,470 --> 02:14:20,480
know that the virus is about two orders
 

7507
02:14:20,480 --> 02:14:23,830
know that the virus is about two orders
of magnitude riskier than the vaccine

7508
02:14:23,830 --> 02:14:23,840
of magnitude riskier than the vaccine
 

7509
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:25,350
of magnitude riskier than the vaccine
so again

7510
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:25,360
so again
 

7511
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,109
so again
leadership

7512
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119

7513
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:29,830
leadership
could definitely have been better

7514
02:14:29,830 --> 02:14:29,840
could definitely have been better
 

7515
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:33,430
could definitely have been better
but the politicization of everything

7516
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:33,440
but the politicization of everything
 

7517
02:14:33,440 --> 02:14:36,229
but the politicization of everything
was not trump's doing alone it

now a common place

allowing this uh
 

7541
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:02,390

kind of thing to happen it's now a very

high human cost

the bad parts of human nature i do hope

02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
the bad parts of human nature i do hope
 

7571
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:36,390
the bad parts of human nature i do hope
that there's kinds of networks that

that there's kinds of networks that

between the business model of a company
like facebook

7590
02:15:54,069 --> 02:15:54,079
like facebook
 

7591
02:15:54,079 --> 02:15:56,149
like facebook
and the public good

yes that's

7600
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:01,840
yes that's
 

7601
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:03,669
yes that's
the case but it's not

7602
02:16:03,669 --> 02:16:03,679
the case but it's not
 

7603
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:05,910
the case but it's not
from a technology perspective

7604
02:16:05,910 --> 02:16:05,920
from a technology perspective
 

7605
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:07,750
from a technology perspective
like absolutely true of any kind of

7606
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760
like absolutely true of any kind of
 

7607
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:09,270
like absolutely true of any kind of
social network i think it's possible to

7608
02:16:09,270 --> 02:16:09,280
social network i think it's possible to
 

7609
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:11,430
social network i think it's possible to
build actually i think it's not just

7610
02:16:11,430 --> 02:16:11,440
build actually i think it's not just
 

7611
02:16:11,440 --> 02:16:13,830
build actually i think it's not just
possible i think it's pretty easy if you

7612
02:16:13,830 --> 02:16:13,840
possible i think it's pretty easy if you
 

7613
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:15,669
possible i think it's pretty easy if you
set that as the goal to build social

7614
02:16:15,669 --> 02:16:15,679
set that as the goal to build social
 

7615
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:16,790
set that as the goal to build social
networks

7616
02:16:16,790 --> 02:16:16,800
networks
 

7617
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:17,589
networks
that

7618
02:16:17,589 --> 02:16:17,599
that
 

7619
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:20,550
that
don't have these negative effects

7620
02:16:20,550 --> 02:16:20,560
don't have these negative effects
 

7621
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:21,510
don't have these negative effects
right

7622
02:16:21,510 --> 02:16:21,520
right
 

7623
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:25,990
right
but if the business model is we sell ads

7624
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:26,000
but if the business model is we sell ads
 

7625
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,709
but if the business model is we sell ads
and the way you sell ads is to maximize

7626
02:16:28,709 --> 02:16:28,719
and the way you sell ads is to maximize
 

7627
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:31,189
and the way you sell ads is to maximize
user engagement then the algorithm is

7628
02:16:31,189 --> 02:16:31,199
user engagement then the algorithm is
 

7629
02:16:31,199 --> 02:16:32,950
user engagement then the algorithm is
biased in favor of fake news and extreme

7630
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
biased in favor of fake news and extreme
 

7631
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,469
biased in favor of fake news and extreme
views but it's not it's so it's not the

7632
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:34,479
views but it's not it's so it's not the
 

7633
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:37,190
views but it's not it's so it's not the
ads a lot of people blame the ads

7634
02:16:37,190 --> 02:16:37,200
ads a lot of people blame the ads
 

7635
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,629
ads a lot of people blame the ads
uh the

7636
02:16:38,629 --> 02:16:38,639
uh the
 

7637
02:16:38,639 --> 02:16:40,230
uh the
the problem i think is the engagement

7638
02:16:40,230 --> 02:16:40,240
the problem i think is the engagement
 

7639
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:41,830
the problem i think is the engagement
and the engagement is just the easiest

7640
02:16:41,830 --> 02:16:41,840
and the engagement is just the easiest
 

7641
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:43,990
and the engagement is just the easiest
the dumbest way to solve the ads i think

7642
02:16:43,990 --> 02:16:44,000
the dumbest way to solve the ads i think
 

7643
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,150
the dumbest way to solve the ads i think
there's much different metrics that

7644
02:16:46,150 --> 02:16:46,160
there's much different metrics that
 

7645
02:16:46,160 --> 02:16:48,629
there's much different metrics that
could be used to make a lot more money

7646
02:16:48,629 --> 02:16:48,639
could be used to make a lot more money
 

7647
02:16:48,639 --> 02:16:51,110
could be used to make a lot more money
than the engagement in the long term it

7648
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:51,120
than the engagement in the long term it
 

7649
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:52,629
than the engagement in the long term it
has more to do with planning for the

7650
02:16:52,629 --> 02:16:52,639
has more to do with planning for the
 

7651
02:16:52,639 --> 02:16:54,549
has more to do with planning for the
long term so

7652
02:16:54,549 --> 02:16:54,559
long term so
 

7653
02:16:54,559 --> 02:16:57,429
long term so
optimizing the selling of ads

7654
02:16:57,429 --> 02:16:57,439
optimizing the selling of ads
 

7655
02:16:57,439 --> 02:17:01,030
optimizing the selling of ads
to make people happy with themselves in

7656
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:01,040
to make people happy with themselves in
 

7657
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:02,389
to make people happy with themselves in
the long term

7658
02:17:02,389 --> 02:17:02,399
the long term
 

7659
02:17:02,399 --> 02:17:05,669
the long term
as opposed to some kind of addicted like

7660
02:17:05,669 --> 02:17:05,679
as opposed to some kind of addicted like
 

7661
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:08,629
as opposed to some kind of addicted like
dopamine feeling and so that's to me

7662
02:17:08,629 --> 02:17:08,639
dopamine feeling and so that's to me
 

7663
02:17:08,639 --> 02:17:10,070
dopamine feeling and so that's to me

a novel design to prevent the republic
 

7723
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:10,870
a novel design to prevent the republic
going the way of all republics because

7724
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:10,880
going the way of all republics because
 

7725

going the way of all republics because
republics tend to end up as tyrannies

republics tend to end up as tyrannies
 

7727
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,790
republics tend to end up as tyrannies
for reasons that were well established

by the time of the renaissance
 

7731
02:18:16,800 --> 02:18:18,629
by the time of the renaissance
and it gives me hope that this design

7732
02:18:18,629 --> 02:18:18,639
and it gives me hope that this design
 

7733
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,549
and it gives me hope that this design
has worked very well

7734
02:18:20,549 --> 02:18:20,559
has worked very well
 

7735
02:18:20,559 --> 02:18:22,790
has worked very well

02:19:20,709 --> 02:19:20,719
then it should out innovate the

every time
 

7791
02:19:24,240 --> 02:19:25,830
every time
so that's

7792
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:25,840
so that's
 

7793
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:27,669
so that's
that's one reason

another reason and it's quite a
 

7799
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,990
another reason and it's quite a

from me
 

7803
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,750
from me
another reason that i'm

another reason that i'm
 

7805
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:40,469
another reason that i'm
optimistic is

7806
02:19:40,469 --> 02:19:40,479
optimistic is
 

7807
02:19:40,479 --> 02:19:43,270
optimistic is
that my kids
