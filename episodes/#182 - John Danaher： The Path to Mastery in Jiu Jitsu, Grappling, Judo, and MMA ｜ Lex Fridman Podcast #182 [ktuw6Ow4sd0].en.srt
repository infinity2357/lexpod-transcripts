00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,470
starts from that point of view you have
to understand that

170
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
to understand that
 

171
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,630
to understand that
everyone has two deaths

172
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:04,640
everyone has two deaths
 

173
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,470
everyone has two deaths
we always talk about our death as though

174
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
we always talk about our death as though
 

175
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,990
we always talk about our death as though
there was only one

176
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,000
there was only one
 

177
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,149
there was only one
but we all have two deaths there was a

178
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
but we all have two deaths there was a
 

179
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,830
but we all have two deaths there was a
time before you were born

180
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:11,840
time before you were born
 

181
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,229
time before you were born
when you were dead

182
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
when you were dead
 

183
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,390
when you were dead
you weren't afraid of that period of

184
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:20,400
you weren't afraid of that period of
 

185
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,550
you weren't afraid of that period of
non-existence

186
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
non-existence
 

187
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,470
non-existence
you don't even think about it so why

188
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
you don't even think about it so why
 

189
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,670
you don't even think about it so why
would you be afraid

190
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:25,680
would you be afraid
 

191
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,309
would you be afraid
of your second period of non-existence

192
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
of your second period of non-existence
 

193
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,910
of your second period of non-existence
you came from non-existence

194
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:29,920
you came from non-existence
 

195
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,589
you came from non-existence
you're going to go back into it you

196
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
you're going to go back into it you
 

197
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,190
you're going to go back into it you
weren't afraid of the first

198
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:33,200
weren't afraid of the first
 

199
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,589
weren't afraid of the first
why are you somehow afraid of the second

200
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:35,599
why are you somehow afraid of the second
 

201
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,830
why are you somehow afraid of the second
so it doesn't really make sense to me

202
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
so it doesn't really make sense to me
 

203
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,229
so it doesn't really make sense to me
as to why people would be afraid of

204
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:40,239
as to why people would be afraid of
 

205
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:41,830
as to why people would be afraid of
non-existence you dealt with it fine the

206
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:41,840
non-existence you dealt with it fine the
 

207
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,789
non-existence you dealt with it fine the
first time

208
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:42,799
first time
 

209
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,949
first time
um deal with it the second time but your

210
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
um deal with it the second time but your
 

211
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,550
um deal with it the second time but your
mind didn't exist

212
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:46,560
mind didn't exist
 

213
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,390
mind didn't exist
for the first death and it won't exist

214
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:48,400
for the first death and it won't exist
 

215
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,390
for the first death and it won't exist
after you die either

216
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:50,400
after you die either
 

217
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,309
after you die either
but it does exist now enough to

218
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:52,319
but it does exist now enough to
 

219
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,470
but it does exist now enough to
comprehend that there's this

220
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:54,480
comprehend that there's this
 

221
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,390

thing that you know nothing about that's
coming which is non-existent actually

00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:58,480
coming which is non-existent actually
 

225
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,830
coming which is non-existent actually
you do know about it because you know

226
00:03:59,830 --> 00:03:59,840
you do know about it because you know
 

227
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,350
you do know about it because you know
what it was like before you were born

228
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
what it was like before you were born
 

229
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,030

is a whole step from that
 

257
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,230
is a whole step from that
to the idea of fearing it i'm fully

258
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:30,240
to the idea of fearing it i'm fully
 

259

to the idea of fearing it i'm fully
aware that there's going to be a

you don't have it when you sleep um
going from

272
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
going from
 

273
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,950
going from
the fact that you know you won't wake up

274
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:42,960
the fact that you know you won't wake up
 

275

the fact that you know you won't wake up
to terror is

two different things that's an extra

two different things that's an extra
 

279
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,909
two different things that's an extra
step and at that point you're making a

280
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
step and at that point you're making a
 

281
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,950
step and at that point you're making a
choice at that

282
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:48,960
choice at that
 

283
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,909
choice at that
at that point what about what some

284
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:51,919
at that point what about what some
 

285
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:52,710
at that point what about what some
people

286

people
 

287
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,550
people
in our in this context we might call

in our in this context we might call
 

289
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,990
in our in this context we might call
like the third death which

290
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
like the third death which
 

291
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,189
like the third death which
is when um

00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
is when um
 

293
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,830
is when um
everybody forgets the entirety of

everybody forgets the entirety of
 

295
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,430
everybody forgets the entirety of

ever existed so it's almost like a
 

303
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,310

game and
 

319
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,110
game and
inevitably we're all going to go at some

320
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:27,120
inevitably we're all going to go at some
 

321
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,710
inevitably we're all going to go at some
point

322
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:28,720
point
 

323
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,990

be arrogance to say
um i'm disappointed in the idea that i

332
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:39,840
um i'm disappointed in the idea that i
 

333
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,350
um i'm disappointed in the idea that i
will disappear but there's this far

334
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
will disappear but there's this far
 

335
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,629
will disappear but there's this far
greater things than me that will

336
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
greater things than me that will
 

337
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,390
greater things than me that will
disappear i mean it

338
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,400
disappear i mean it
 

339
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,430
disappear i mean it
it's crushing to think that

340
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:47,440
it's crushing to think that
 

341
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,870
it's crushing to think that
there's going to come a time when no one

342
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:48,880
there's going to come a time when no one
 

343
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,830
there's going to come a time when no one
will ever hear beethoven's symphonies

344
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:50,840
will ever hear beethoven's symphonies
 

345
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,629
will ever hear beethoven's symphonies
again that

346
00:05:52,629 --> 00:05:52,639
again that
 

347
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,469
again that
the mysteries of the pharaohs will be

348
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
the mysteries of the pharaohs will be
 

349
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,150
the mysteries of the pharaohs will be
lost and no one will even comprehend

350
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
lost and no one will even comprehend
 

351
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,909
lost and no one will even comprehend
they once existed like

352
00:05:57,909 --> 00:05:57,919
they once existed like
 

353
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,070
they once existed like
humanity has come up with so many

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
humanity has come up with so many
 

355
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,749
humanity has come up with so many
amazing things over

00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:01,759
amazing things over
 

357
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,950
amazing things over
its existence and to think that one day

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
its existence and to think that one day
 

359
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,270
its existence and to think that one day
this is just all happening on a tiny

this is just all happening on a tiny
 

361
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,110
this is just all happening on a tiny

this is all for nothing okay i can

this is all for nothing okay i can
 

371
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,870
this is all for nothing okay i can
understand there's a kind of dread that

372
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:16,880
understand there's a kind of dread that
 

373
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,150
understand there's a kind of dread that
comes with this

374
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
comes with this
 

375
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,670
comes with this
um uh but there's also a sense in which

376
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:21,680
um uh but there's also a sense in which
 

377
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,189
um uh but there's also a sense in which
the moment you're born and the moment

378
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:23,199
the moment you're born and the moment
 

379
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,550
the moment you're born and the moment
you can think about these things you

380
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
you can think about these things you
 

381
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,670
you can think about these things you
know this is your

382
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:25,680
know this is your
 

383
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,150
know this is your
inevitable fate is it so inevitable so

384
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
inevitable fate is it so inevitable so
 

385
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,710
inevitable fate is it so inevitable so
if we

386
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:28,720
if we
 

387
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,550
if we
look at we're in austin and there's a

388
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:30,560
look at we're in austin and there's a
 

389
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,469
look at we're in austin and there's a
guy named elon musk

390
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
guy named elon musk
 

391
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,629
guy named elon musk
and he's hoping in fact that is the

392
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:34,639
and he's hoping in fact that is the
 

393
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,790
and he's hoping in fact that is the
drive behind many of his passions

394
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:36,800
drive behind many of his passions
 

395
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,110
drive behind many of his passions
is the human beings becoming

396
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
is the human beings becoming
 

397
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,629
is the human beings becoming
multi-planetary species

398
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:40,639
multi-planetary species
 

399
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,950
multi-planetary species
and expanding out exploring and

400
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
and expanding out exploring and
 

401
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,150
and expanding out exploring and
colonizing

402
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
colonizing
 

403
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,029
colonizing
the solar system the galaxy and maybe

404
00:06:47,029 --> 00:06:47,039
the solar system the galaxy and maybe
 

405
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,790
the solar system the galaxy and maybe
the rest of the universe

406
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:48,800
the rest of the universe
 

407
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,710
the rest of the universe
is that something that fills you with

408
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
is that something that fills you with
 

409
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,070
is that something that fills you with
excitement uh it's

410
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
excitement uh it's
 

411
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,909
excitement uh it's
as a project it's very exciting i um

412
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
as a project it's very exciting i um
 

413
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,950
as a project it's very exciting i um
the whole i mean we all grew up with

414
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:58,960
the whole i mean we all grew up with
 

415
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,550
the whole i mean we all grew up with
science fiction the idea of exploration

416
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
science fiction the idea of exploration
 

417
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,589
science fiction the idea of exploration
the same way

418
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:03,599
the same way
 

419
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,390
the same way
uh human beings in earlier centuries

420
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
uh human beings in earlier centuries
 

421
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,510
uh human beings in earlier centuries
were thrilled with the idea of

422
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:07,520
were thrilled with the idea of
 

423
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,430
were thrilled with the idea of
discovering a new world you know america

424
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:09,440
discovering a new world you know america
 

425
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:09,830
discovering a new world you know america
or

426
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:09,840
or
 

427
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,150
or
some other part of the world that they

428
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,160
some other part of the world that they
 

429
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,430
some other part of the world that they
sailed to and come back

430
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:13,440
sailed to and come back
 

431
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,350
sailed to and come back
but now instead of sailing oceans you're

432
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
but now instead of sailing oceans you're
 

433
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,270
but now instead of sailing oceans you're
sailing solar systems and

434
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,280
sailing solar systems and
 

435
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,790
sailing solar systems and
ultimately even further um so of course

436
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:20,800
ultimately even further um so of course
 

437
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,830
ultimately even further um so of course
that's exciting

438
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:21,840
that's exciting
 

439
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,150
that's exciting
but as far as relieving us from

440
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
but as far as relieving us from
 

441
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,510
but as far as relieving us from
non-existence it's just

442
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
non-existence it's just
 

443
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,390
non-existence it's just
plain a delaying game because ultimately

444
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:28,400
plain a delaying game because ultimately
 

445
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,029
plain a delaying game because ultimately
even

446
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
even
 

447
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,550
even
the universe itself if the laws of

448
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:30,560
the universe itself if the laws of
 

449
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,309
the universe itself if the laws of
thermodynamics are correct will

450
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
thermodynamics are correct will
 

451
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,589
thermodynamics are correct will
ultimately die of course we might not

452
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:35,599
ultimately die of course we might not
 

453
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,350
ultimately die of course we might not
understand

454
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
understand
 

455
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,870
understand
most of the physics and how

456
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:40,880
most of the physics and how
 

457
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,189
most of the physics and how
the universe functions you said laws of

458
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:43,199
the universe functions you said laws of
 

459
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,869
the universe functions you said laws of
thermodynamics but maybe that's just a

460
00:07:44,869 --> 00:07:44,879
thermodynamics but maybe that's just a
 

461
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,230
thermodynamics but maybe that's just a
tiny little

462
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,240
tiny little
 

463
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,710
tiny little
fraction of what the universe actually

464
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:48,720
fraction of what the universe actually
 

465
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,230
fraction of what the universe actually
is maybe there's multiple dimensions

466
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:50,240
is maybe there's multiple dimensions
 

467
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:50,869
is maybe there's multiple dimensions
maybe

468
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:50,879
maybe
 

469
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,110
maybe
maybe there's multiple universes maybe

470
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,120
maybe there's multiple universes maybe
 

471
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,350
maybe there's multiple universes maybe
the entirety of this experience

472
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
the entirety of this experience
 

473
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,710
the entirety of this experience
you know there's guys like donald

474
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:56,720
you know there's guys like donald
 

475
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,629
you know there's guys like donald
hoffman i think that all of this is just

476
00:07:58,629 --> 00:07:58,639
hoffman i think that all of this is just
 

477
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,150
hoffman i think that all of this is just
an illusion that we don't

478
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
an illusion that we don't
 

479
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,589
an illusion that we don't
like human cognition and perception

480
00:08:03,589 --> 00:08:03,599
like human cognition and perception
 

481
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,189
like human cognition and perception
constructs a whole it's like a video

482
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
constructs a whole it's like a video
 

483
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,550
constructs a whole it's like a video
game it would construct that's very

484
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:06,560
game it would construct that's very
 

485
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,469
game it would construct that's very
distant from the actual reality

486
00:08:08,469 --> 00:08:08,479
distant from the actual reality
 

487
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,990
distant from the actual reality
and maybe one day we'll understand that

488
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,000
and maybe one day we'll understand that
 

489
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,909
and maybe one day we'll understand that
reality maybe it'll be like the matrix

490
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
reality maybe it'll be like the matrix
 

491
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,629
reality maybe it'll be like the matrix
kind of thing

492
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:12,639
kind of thing
 

493
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,990
kind of thing
so there's a lot of different

494
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:14,000
so there's a lot of different
 

495
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,749
so there's a lot of different
possibilities here and there's also

496
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
possibilities here and there's also

that's that's an extra step on his part
 

561
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,150
that's that's an extra step on his part
um and not everyone's going to follow

00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
um and not everyone's going to follow

i do believe that death is

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:31,200
i do believe that death is

i do believe that death is
the single most important element in

the single most important element in

life
 

571
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,670
life
that gives value to our days if you

572
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:37,680
that gives value to our days if you
 

573
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,750
that gives value to our days if you
think for example of a situation where

574
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
think for example of a situation where
 

575
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,269
think for example of a situation where
a god came to you and gave you

576
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:43,279
a god came to you and gave you
 

577
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,310
a god came to you and gave you
immortality

578
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:46,320

 

579
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,910

life would be very very different for

580
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:47,920
life would be very very different for
 

581
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,350
life would be very very different for
you uh

582
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
you uh
 

583
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,150
you uh
you're a talented research scientist

584
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,160
you're a talented research scientist
 

585
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,190
you're a talented research scientist
you work to a schedule why because

586
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:57,200
you work to a schedule why because
 

587
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,190
you work to a schedule why because
ultimately you know your life is finite

588
00:09:59,190 --> 00:09:59,200
ultimately you know your life is finite
 

589
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,470
ultimately you know your life is finite
and actually very finite

590
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
and actually very finite
 

591
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,350
and actually very finite
and could be even more so if fate plays

592
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:05,360
and could be even more so if fate plays
 

593
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,430
and could be even more so if fate plays
its hand and you

594
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:07,440
its hand and you
 

595
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,949
its hand and you
die an early death or what have you we

596
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:08,959
die an early death or what have you we
 

597
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:09,990
die an early death or what have you we
never know what's going to happen

598
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,000
never know what's going to happen

601
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,030

as such we get work done

602
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040

 

603
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,430

as soon as we can the moment you gain

604
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:19,440
as soon as we can the moment you gain
 

605
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,190
as soon as we can the moment you gain
immortality

you can always put every project off you

608
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
you can always put every project off you
 

609
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,870
you can always put every project off you
can always say

can always say
 

611
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,030
can always say
i don't need to do this today because i

612
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:27,040
i don't need to do this today because i
 

613
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,310
i don't need to do this today because i
can do it

614
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
can do it
 

615
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,710
can do it
four centuries from now and as you

00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:30,720
four centuries from now and as you

artificially a human life the motivation

fades away because you can always come
 

627
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,590
fades away because you can always come
back to the idea that you can do this in

628
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
back to the idea that you can do this in
 

629
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,030
back to the idea that you can do this in
the future

630
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:45,040
the future
 

631
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,230
the future
and so what gives value to our days is

632
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
and so what gives value to our days is
 

633
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,389
and so what gives value to our days is
ultimately death and value

634
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
ultimately death and value
 

635
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,790
ultimately death and value
it's not the only form of the reason

636
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:54,800
it's not the only form of the reason
 

637
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,269
it's not the only form of the reason
behind value but a huge part of what we

638
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,279
behind value but a huge part of what we
 

639
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:59,910
behind value but a huge part of what we
consider value is scarcity and death

640
00:10:59,910 --> 00:10:59,920
consider value is scarcity and death
 

641
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,990
consider value is scarcity and death
gives us scarcity of days

642
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
gives us scarcity of days
 

643
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,990
gives us scarcity of days
and is probably the single greatest

644
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:04,000
and is probably the single greatest
 

645
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,110
and is probably the single greatest
motivator for

646
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
motivator for
 

647
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,389
motivator for
almost every action we partake in it's

648
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:08,399
almost every action we partake in it's
 

649
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,670
almost every action we partake in it's
kind of tragic and

650
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,680
kind of tragic and
 

651
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,949
kind of tragic and
beautiful that what

652
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
beautiful that what
 

653
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,829
beautiful that what
what makes things amazing is that they

654
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
what makes things amazing is that they
 

655
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,949
what makes things amazing is that they
end

656
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:18,959

 

657
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,670

yeah i think it would actually be a

658
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,680
yeah i think it would actually be a
 

659
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,790
yeah i think it would actually be a
terrible burden to be

660
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
terrible burden to be
 

661
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,190
terrible burden to be
immortal you would um

662
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:27,200

 

663
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,030

life would be in many ways very hollow

664
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,040
life would be in many ways very hollow
 

665
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,710
life would be in many ways very hollow
and meaningless i think

666
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
and meaningless i think
 

667
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,190
and meaningless i think
people talk about death taking away the

668
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200

meaning of life
but i think immortality would have a

672
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
but i think immortality would have a
 

673
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,829
but i think immortality would have a
very similar effect in a different

674
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:40,839

 

675
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,069

direction

676
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:42,079
direction
 

677
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,870
direction
so given this short life

678
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
so given this short life
 

679
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,550
so given this short life

but then pointed towards two options

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,389
but then pointed towards two options
one of longevity versus are there a

728
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:42,399
one of longevity versus are there a
 

729
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,990
one of longevity versus are there a
degree of difficulty there's got to be a

degree of difficulty there's got to be a
 

731
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,750
degree of difficulty there's got to be a
lot more than that shortly

732
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:47,760

 

733
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,030

i mean think about um first of all

734
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
i mean think about um first of all
 

735
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,389
i mean think about um first of all
we have to understand from the start

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:52,399
we have to understand from the start
 

737
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,150
we have to understand from the start
there's never going to be an agreed-upon

738
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
there's never going to be an agreed-upon
 

739
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,949
there's never going to be an agreed-upon
set of criteria for this is a great life

740
00:12:56,949 --> 00:12:56,959
set of criteria for this is a great life

from all perspective
 

743
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,550
from all perspective
uh if you look from the perspective of

744
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
uh if you look from the perspective of
 

745
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,670
uh if you look from the perspective of
say machiavelli

746
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:01,680
say machiavelli
 

747
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,509
say machiavelli
then stalin lived a great life he was

748
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
then stalin lived a great life he was
 

749
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,110
then stalin lived a great life he was
highly successful at what he did he

750
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,120
highly successful at what he did he
 

751
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,790
highly successful at what he did he
started from nothing so

752
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:08,800
started from nothing so
 

753
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,389
started from nothing so
the degree of difficulty and what he did

754
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:10,399
the degree of difficulty and what he did
 

755
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,310
the degree of difficulty and what he did
was extraordinarily high

756
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
was extraordinarily high
 

757
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,750
was extraordinarily high
he had massive impact upon world history

758
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:15,760
he had massive impact upon world history
 

759
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,710
he had massive impact upon world history
he oversaw the defeat of almost all of

760
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
he oversaw the defeat of almost all of
 

761
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,150
he oversaw the defeat of almost all of
his major enemies

762
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
his major enemies
 

763
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,790
his major enemies
he lived to old age and died of natural

764
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
he lived to old age and died of natural
 

765
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,509
he lived to old age and died of natural
causes

766
00:13:23,509 --> 00:13:23,519
causes
 

767
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,430
causes
so from machiavelli's point of view he

768
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:25,440
so from machiavelli's point of view he
 

769
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,790
so from machiavelli's point of view he
had a great life

770
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:26,800
had a great life
 

771
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,110
had a great life
if you ask the ukrainian farmer in the

772
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:29,120
if you ask the ukrainian farmer in the
 

773
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,030
if you ask the ukrainian farmer in the
1930s whether he lived a great life you

774
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,040
1930s whether he lived a great life you
 

775
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,430
1930s whether he lived a great life you
get a very different answer

776
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
get a very different answer
 

777
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,509
get a very different answer
so everything's going to come from what

778
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
so everything's going to come from what
 

779
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:36,710
so everything's going to come from what
perspective you

780
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
perspective you
 

781
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,389
perspective you
you begin with this you're going to look

782
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:38,399
you begin with this you're going to look
 

783
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,670
you begin with this you're going to look
out at the world with a given point of

784
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
out at the world with a given point of
 

785
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,629
out at the world with a given point of
view and you're going to make your

786
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
view and you're going to make your
 

787
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,470
view and you're going to make your
judgments was this a great life or was

788
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
judgments was this a great life or was
 

789
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,230
judgments was this a great life or was
this a terrible life

790
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:44,240
this a terrible life
 

791
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,509
this a terrible life
um going back to your point you were

792
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
um going back to your point you were
 

793
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,310
um going back to your point you were
actually

794
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:48,320
actually
 

795
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,750
actually
i think focusing the question on on more

796
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,760
i think focusing the question on on more
 

797
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,509
i think focusing the question on on more
in terms of uh great single performances

798
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:55,519
in terms of uh great single performances
 

799
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,310
in terms of uh great single performances
versus longevity performances yes

800
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:58,320
versus longevity performances yes
 

801
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,310
versus longevity performances yes
presumably this isn't really a question

802
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
presumably this isn't really a question
 

803
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,670
presumably this isn't really a question
about uh

804
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
about uh
 

805
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,430
about uh
what makes a great life then because

806
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
what makes a great life then because
 

807
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,590
what makes a great life then because
there's so much more than

808
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:05,600
there's so much more than
 

809
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,670
there's so much more than
that to a great life i don't know i'm

810
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:07,680
that to a great life i don't know i'm
 

811
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,030
that to a great life i don't know i'm
going to push back on that so

812
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
going to push back on that so
 

813
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,949
going to push back on that so
i think their parallels are very much

814
00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
i think their parallels are very much
 

815
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,949
i think their parallels are very much
closer than you're making them seem

816
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:12,959
closer than you're making them seem
 

817
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,350
closer than you're making them seem
i think let's compare stalin stalin is

818
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:15,360
i think let's compare stalin stalin is
 

819
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,470
i think let's compare stalin stalin is
an example

820
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:16,480
an example
 

821
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,790
an example
of somebody who held power considered by

822
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:18,800
of somebody who held power considered by
 

823
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,870
of somebody who held power considered by
many to be one of the most powerful men

824
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
many to be one of the most powerful men
 

825
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,910
many to be one of the most powerful men
ever he held power for 30 years

826
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
ever he held power for 30 years
 

827
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,110
ever he held power for 30 years
so that's what i'm referring to

828
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
so that's what i'm referring to
 

829
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,670
so that's what i'm referring to
longevity and then there's a few people

830
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:27,680

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:37,600
standing variation because of the
 

1339
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,590
standing variation because of the
amplitude

1340
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:39,600
amplitude
 

1341
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,350
amplitude
you get a more powerful yeah power

1342
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:43,360

what they do

1422
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
what they do
 

1423
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,470
what they do
particularly under the stress of high

1424
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
particularly under the stress of high
 

1425
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,830
particularly under the stress of high
level competition because that's when

1426
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:17,840
level competition because that's when
 

1427
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,510
level competition because that's when
you see their real game

1428
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:19,520
you see their real game
 

1429
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,390
you see their real game
what they really do under pressure okay

1430
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
what they really do under pressure okay
 

1431
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,990
what they really do under pressure okay
and if you can emulate that

1432
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,000
and if you can emulate that
 

1433
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,070
and if you can emulate that
you're going to be very successful i

1434
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
you're going to be very successful i
 

1435
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,390
you're going to be very successful i
guess what i was frustrated with

1436
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:28,400
guess what i was frustrated with
 

1437
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,909
guess what i was frustrated with
to your point is that the argument

1438
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
to your point is that the argument
 

1439
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,510
to your point is that the argument
against koga is

1440
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
against koga is
 

1441
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,950
against koga is
what he has a very specific body type

1442
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
what he has a very specific body type
 

1443
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,630
what he has a very specific body type
and he figured out something that worked

1444
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
and he figured out something that worked
 

1445
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,230
and he figured out something that worked
for him

1446
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:40,240
for him
 

1447
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,590
for him
thus the statement is that might not be

1448
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:43,600
thus the statement is that might not be
 

1449
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,110
thus the statement is that might not be
applicable to you or to the general

that by the way at the shallow level

1456
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
that by the way at the shallow level
 

1457
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,549
that by the way at the shallow level
might be true might be true the point is

1458
00:25:58,549 --> 00:25:58,559
might be true might be true the point is
 

1459
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,149
might be true might be true the point is
there might be a body of knowledge

1460
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:00,159
there might be a body of knowledge
 

1461
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,950
there might be a body of knowledge
that's yet to be discovered and explored

1462
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
that's yet to be discovered and explored
 

1463
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,230

that koga opened up that i wanted to

1464
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:06,240
that koga opened up that i wanted to
 

1465
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:06,870
that koga opened up that i wanted to
understand

1466
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:06,880
understand
 

1467
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,149
understand
why his technique worked

1468
00:26:10,149 --> 00:26:10,159
why his technique worked
 

1469
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:11,990
why his technique worked
it made no sense to me that with a

1470
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
it made no sense to me that with a
 

1471
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,669
it made no sense to me that with a
single foot like the way you turn the

1472
00:26:13,669 --> 00:26:13,679
single foot like the way you turn the
 

1473
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,310
single foot like the way you turn the
hip

1474
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
hip
 

1475
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,710
hip
the single foot that steps in why does

1476
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:16,720
the single foot that steps in why does
 

1477
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,590
the single foot that steps in why does
that work

1478
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:17,600
that work
 

1479
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,029

so most combat sports have this sense
 

1807
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,310
so most combat sports have this sense
which they

1808
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
which they
 

1809
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,070
which they
have the features of both an art and a

have the features of both an art and a
science and

1812
00:31:53,909 --> 00:31:53,919
science and
 

1813
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,269
science and
um it's not just about

1814
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
um it's not just about
 

1815
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,909
um it's not just about
high percentage in in your case i mean

1816
00:31:59,909 --> 00:31:59,919
high percentage in in your case i mean
 

1817
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,590
high percentage in in your case i mean
me personally i'm obsessed with

1818
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:01,600
me personally i'm obsessed with
 

1819
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,350
me personally i'm obsessed with
percentages what what are the ways to

1820
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
percentages what what are the ways to
 

1821
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,029
percentages what what are the ways to
make signs yeah

1822
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
make signs yeah
 

1823
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,070
make signs yeah
but that's also choices involved yeah

1824
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
but that's also choices involved yeah
 

1825
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,110
but that's also choices involved yeah
but um but there is an

1826
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,120
but um but there is an
 

1827
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,549
but um but there is an
undeniably aesthetic element

1828
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:14,559
undeniably aesthetic element

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,109
as with all development it comes from
trial and error

2294
00:40:37,109 --> 00:40:37,119
trial and error
 

2295
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,309
trial and error
you will often see people teach the

2296
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
you will often see people teach the
 

2297
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,069
you will often see people teach the
technique to a certain level and

2298
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:42,079
technique to a certain level and
 

2299
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,230
technique to a certain level and
you see the teaching you know there's a

2300
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:44,240
you see the teaching you know there's a
 

2301
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,589
you see the teaching you know there's a
lot of inadequacies there

2302
00:40:45,589 --> 00:40:45,599
lot of inadequacies there
 

2303
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,349
lot of inadequacies there
and that doesn't cover a lot of the

2304
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
and that doesn't cover a lot of the
 

2305
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:48,950
and that doesn't cover a lot of the
problems that we're encountering

2306
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
problems that we're encountering
 

2307
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,190
problems that we're encountering
and so trial and error is the single

2308
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:51,200
and so trial and error is the single
 

2309
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,829
and so trial and error is the single
most important part of the development

2310
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:53,839
most important part of the development
 

2311
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,109
most important part of the development
trial and error in um in the training

2312
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
trial and error in um in the training
 

2313
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,550
trial and error in um in the training
room amongst ourselves

2314
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:58,560
room amongst ourselves
 

2315
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,910
room amongst ourselves
in in hard training or no it never

00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:01,920
in in hard training or no it never
 

2317
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,109
in in hard training or no it never
begins with hard training

begins with hard training
 

2319
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,470
begins with hard training
or everything techniques are born the

2320
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:06,480
or everything techniques are born the
 

2321
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,990
or everything techniques are born the
same way we're born

2322
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:08,000
same way we're born
 

2323
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,309
same way we're born
weak and in need of nutrition

2324
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:12,319

 

2325
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,030

uh you have to like this build them up

2326
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
uh you have to like this build them up
 

2327
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,790
uh you have to like this build them up
organically like children

2328
00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:16,800
organically like children
 

2329
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,630
organically like children
and you start with minimal resistance

2330
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:18,640
and you start with minimal resistance
 

2331
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,390
and you start with minimal resistance
and you make progress over time

2332
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
and you make progress over time
 

2333
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,990
and you make progress over time
when you first go to the gym do you put

2334
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
when you first go to the gym do you put
 

2335
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,990
when you first go to the gym do you put
500 pounds on the bench press and try to

2336
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:24,000
500 pounds on the bench press and try to
 

2337
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,910
500 pounds on the bench press and try to
bench press it no you'll be killed

2338
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:25,920
bench press it no you'll be killed
 

2339
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,390
bench press it no you'll be killed
you start off with the bar you build

2340
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
you start off with the bar you build
 

2341
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,750
you start off with the bar you build
over time and then one day

2342
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:29,760
over time and then one day
 

2343
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,349
over time and then one day
five years from now perhaps you really

2344
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
five years from now perhaps you really
 

2345
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,030
five years from now perhaps you really
are lifting 500 pounds

2346
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
are lifting 500 pounds
 

2347
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,790
are lifting 500 pounds
but only a four would attempt that on

2348
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:34,800
but only a four would attempt that on
 

2349
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,069
but only a four would attempt that on
their first attempt

2350
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:38,079

 

2351
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,950

and they're born like children in your

2352
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:40,960
and they're born like children in your
 

2353
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,150
and they're born like children in your
mind first like

mind first like
 

2355
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,270
mind first like
uh there's a spark of another one it's

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:45,280
uh there's a spark of another one it's
 

2357
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,030
uh there's a spark of another one it's
like scientific development

2358
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,040
like scientific development
 

2359
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,270
like scientific development
on a subject matter which is

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:49,280
on a subject matter which is
 

2361
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,270
on a subject matter which is

may not work well at advanced levels of
 

2371
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,990
may not work well at advanced levels of

00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
science but they work damn well in the
 

2373
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,349

00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:14,240
and as a result
 

2381
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,990
and as a result
there'll be a spark you'll see something

00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
there'll be a spark you'll see something
 

2383
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,670
there'll be a spark you'll see something
right and there's possibilities there

2384
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:17,680
right and there's possibilities there
 

2385
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,069
right and there's possibilities there
okay

2386
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:18,079
okay
 

2387
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,309
okay
let's let's puzzle this out let's work

2388
00:42:20,309 --> 00:42:20,319
let's let's puzzle this out let's work
 

2389
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,349
let's let's puzzle this out let's work
with this

2390
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
with this
 

2391
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,910
with this
and uh you run into a lot of failures

2392
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:23,920
and uh you run into a lot of failures
 

2393
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,470
and uh you run into a lot of failures
this

2394
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
this
 

2395
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,150
this
you know you've suddenly been oh man if

2396
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
you know you've suddenly been oh man if
 

2397
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,750
you know you've suddenly been oh man if
i put my hip this way this works really

2398
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:27,760
i put my hip this way this works really
 

2399
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,430
i put my hip this way this works really
well then suddenly you try and spare and

2400
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:29,440
well then suddenly you try and spare and
 

2401
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,109
well then suddenly you try and spare and
you get caught in a simple alma plata

2402
00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:31,119
you get caught in a simple alma plata
 

2403
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,309
you get caught in a simple alma plata
and you know okay that didn't work as

2404
00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:32,319
and you know okay that didn't work as
 

2405
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,349
and you know okay that didn't work as
well as i thought

2406
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
well as i thought
 

2407
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,069
well as i thought
and then you look to rectify things if

2408
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
and then you look to rectify things if
 

2409
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,430
and then you look to rectify things if
things go on promising research

2410
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:37,440
things go on promising research
 

2411
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,790
things go on promising research
directions you keep them

2412
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:38,800
directions you keep them
 

2413
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,270
directions you keep them
if not you discard them well it's funny

2414
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:41,280
if not you discard them well it's funny
 

2415
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,390
if not you discard them well it's funny
you say science

2416
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
you say science
 

2417
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,230
you say science
it feels like more like art there's

2418
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:44,240
it feels like more like art there's
 

2419
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,390
it feels like more like art there's
somebody i really admire

2420
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:46,400
somebody i really admire
 

2421
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,390
somebody i really admire
that talks about this kind of ideas

2422
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,400
that talks about this kind of ideas

he's the lead designer he recently left
but he was the designer

2428

but he was the designer
 

2429
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,990
but he was the designer
behind most of the products we know and

and when you say designer be more
 

2435
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,030
and when you say designer be more
precise what exactly was he

2436
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:01,040
precise what exactly was he

00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:28,319
the manufacturer right yeah of course
 

2461
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:29,750
the manufacturer right yeah of course
but there's the

but there's the
 

2463
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,190

uh he's somebody that's very hands-on
 

2465
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,550
uh he's somebody that's very hands-on
and it's it's like okay so he worked

2466
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:36,560
and it's it's like okay so he worked
 

2467
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,870

steve jobs has this idea

2470
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:40,960
steve jobs has this idea

we should have a computer that's as thin

2472

as a sheet of paper
 

2475
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,309
as a sheet of paper
and then you start to play with ideas of

2476
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
and then you start to play with ideas of
 

2477
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,230
and then you start to play with ideas of
like what does that actually look like

2478
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
like what does that actually look like

the reason i bring it up is because he

2480
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
the reason i bring it up is because he
 

2481
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:51,670
the reason i bring it up is because he
talked about

2482

talked about
 

2483
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,150

he had these ideas that he would not

tell steve
 

2487
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,510
tell steve
because he he talked about in the same

you're saying is there's like like a

you're saying is there's like like a
 

2493
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,910
you're saying is there's like like a
little baby

that it's very fragile
it it needs time to grow absolutely and

it it needs time to grow absolutely and

it it needs time to grow absolutely and
then steve jobs would

uh but you needed time to develop you

is a very very difficult thing when you

is a very very difficult thing when you
 

2555
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,589
is a very very difficult thing when you
look at the

look at the
 

2557
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,430
look at the
history of science you will see that

history of science you will see that

you you can't be too forgiving you have
to test hypotheses

2670
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
to test hypotheses
 

2671
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,030

where do you place most of the credit

4070
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:58,239
where do you place most of the credit
 

4071
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:00,870
where do you place most of the credit
for it for a journey that does achieve

4072
01:13:00,870 --> 01:13:00,880
for it for a journey that does achieve
 

4073
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:01,510
for it for a journey that does achieve
mastery

4074
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
mastery
 

4075
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,510
mastery
is it the set of ideas they have in

4076
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:03,520
is it the set of ideas they have in
 

4077
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,709
is it the set of ideas they have in
their mind

4078
01:13:04,709 --> 01:13:04,719
their mind
 

4079
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,910
their mind
is it the the set of drills or the way

4080
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:07,920
is it the the set of drills or the way
 

4081
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,270
is it the the set of drills or the way
they practice

4082
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
they practice
 

4083
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:13,350
they practice
is it genetics and luck

4084
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360

 

4085
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,270

those are all good in science all of

4086
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:15,280
those are all good in science all of
 

4087
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:16,630
those are all good in science all of
those factors you've mentioned

4088
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:16,640
those factors you've mentioned
 

4089
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,550
those factors you've mentioned
play a definite role let's start with

4090
01:13:18,550 --> 01:13:18,560
play a definite role let's start with
 

4091
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,430
play a definite role let's start with
luck okay

4092
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,440

 

4093
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,790

we are all subject to fortune

4094
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:24,800
we are all subject to fortune
 

4095
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,030
we are all subject to fortune
and fortune can be good and fortune can

4096
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:27,040
and fortune can be good and fortune can
 

4097
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,229
and fortune can be good and fortune can
be bad

4098
01:13:28,229 --> 01:13:28,239
be bad
 

4099
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:30,550
be bad
uh life is in many ways beautiful but

4100
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:30,560
uh life is in many ways beautiful but
 

4101
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,070
uh life is in many ways beautiful but
life is also tragic

4102
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:32,080
life is also tragic
 

4103
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,110
life is also tragic
and i've had students who showed

4104
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,120
and i've had students who showed
 

4105
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,510
and i've had students who showed
enormous promise and just tragic events

4106
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:37,520
enormous promise and just tragic events
 

4107
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:41,110
enormous promise and just tragic events
occurred in their lives

4108

4109
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,709

the vicitudes of fortune can be

4110
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:44,719
the vicitudes of fortune can be
 

4111
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:46,229
the vicitudes of fortune can be
a wonderful thing in your life and they

01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:52,310
can be a a terrible tragedy
um i've had students who who died uh

4116
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:52,320
um i've had students who who died uh
 

4117
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,709
um i've had students who who died uh
for various reasons who could have gone

4118
01:13:54,709 --> 01:13:54,719
for various reasons who could have gone
 

4119
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:56,310
for various reasons who could have gone
on to become world champions

on to become world champions
 

4121
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,709
on to become world champions
i've had students who uh on a much

4122
01:13:58,709 --> 01:13:58,719
i've had students who uh on a much
 

4123
01:13:58,719 --> 01:13:59,590
i've had students who uh on a much
lighter note just

4124
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
lighter note just
 

4125
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,790
lighter note just
fell in love and just wanted to have

4126
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
fell in love and just wanted to have
 

4127
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,470
fell in love and just wanted to have
kids and move away and

4128
01:14:04,470 --> 01:14:04,480
kids and move away and
 

4129
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,630
kids and move away and
that's that's a that's a wonderful thing

4130
01:14:06,630 --> 01:14:06,640
that's that's a that's a wonderful thing
 

4131
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:08,390
that's that's a that's a wonderful thing
but different direction

4132
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:08,400
but different direction
 

4133
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:12,070
but different direction
um you just never know so luck does

4134
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:12,080
um you just never know so luck does
 

4135
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:14,550
um you just never know so luck does
play some role um even things like where

4136
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
play some role um even things like where
 

4137
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:15,590
play some role um even things like where
you're born

4138
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:15,600
you're born
 

4139
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,590
you're born
uh the location of your physical

4140
01:14:19,590 --> 01:14:19,600
uh the location of your physical
 

4141
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,430
uh the location of your physical
location in the world or even the

4142
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
location in the world or even the
 

4143
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,430
location in the world or even the
socio-economic location can

4144
01:14:23,430 --> 01:14:23,440
socio-economic location can
 

4145
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:24,630
socio-economic location can
can play a role which could be

4146
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:24,640
can play a role which could be
 

4147
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:26,709
can play a role which could be
detrimental or favorable

4148
01:14:26,709 --> 01:14:26,719
detrimental or favorable
 

4149
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:28,709
detrimental or favorable
so yeah luck does play some role

4150
01:14:28,709 --> 01:14:28,719
so yeah luck does play some role
 

4151
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:30,229
so yeah luck does play some role

play a powerful powerful role for
 

4177
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,750
play a powerful powerful role for

01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,990
ability to take physical damage then
there are genetic elements which

4184
01:15:09,990 --> 01:15:10,000
there are genetic elements which
 

4185
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,270
there are genetic elements which
will help okay for example i

4186
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:13,280
will help okay for example i
 

4187
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,830
will help okay for example i
couldn't imagine a world in which even

4188
01:15:15,830 --> 01:15:15,840
couldn't imagine a world in which even

01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,669
couldn't imagine a world in which even
if i i have a crippled leg so

01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:20,550
if i i have a crippled leg so
even if i uh grew up in a world where my

01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,110
was normal and i had normal legs and
everything was fine with my body

4198
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
everything was fine with my body
 

4199
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,229
everything was fine with my body
i don't believe that

4200
01:15:28,229 --> 01:15:28,239
i don't believe that
 

4201
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:30,390
i don't believe that
i could win the olympic gold medal in

4202
01:15:30,390 --> 01:15:30,400
i could win the olympic gold medal in
 

4203
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,310
i could win the olympic gold medal in
100 meter sprinting for example okay i

4204
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:32,320
100 meter sprinting for example okay i
 

4205
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,270
100 meter sprinting for example okay i
just don't have enough

4206
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
just don't have enough
 

4207
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:36,950
just don't have enough
fast twitch muscle fibers but the more

4208
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:36,960
fast twitch muscle fibers but the more

a sport involves skill and tactics

4210
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:40,880
a sport involves skill and tactics
 

4211
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,149
a sport involves skill and tactics
the less you will see genetics playing a

4212
01:15:44,149 --> 01:15:44,159
the less you will see genetics playing a
 

4213
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:44,790
the less you will see genetics playing a
role

4214
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
role
 

4215
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:47,669
role
if you look at the middle podiums in

4216
01:15:47,669 --> 01:15:47,679
if you look at the middle podiums in
 

4217
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:49,189
if you look at the middle podiums in
jiu-jitsu for example

4218
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:49,199
jiu-jitsu for example
 

4219
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:52,310
jiu-jitsu for example
you will see that no one body type

4220
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:52,320
you will see that no one body type
 

4221
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:54,870
you will see that no one body type
is definitively superior to another you

4222
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:54,880
is definitively superior to another you
 

4223
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:55,350
is definitively superior to another you
will see

4224
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:55,360
will see
 

4225
01:15:55,360 --> 01:15:57,750
will see
every variation of body type and the

4226
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:57,760
every variation of body type and the
 

4227
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:00,950
every variation of body type and the
metal platforms and jujitsu

4228
01:16:00,950 --> 01:16:00,960
metal platforms and jujitsu
 

4229
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,189
metal platforms and jujitsu
as skill and tactics become more and

4230
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,199
as skill and tactics become more and
 

4231
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,870
as skill and tactics become more and
more important and things like just

4232
01:16:04,870 --> 01:16:04,880

difference i've dedicated my life to
that obviously i'm biased

that obviously i'm biased
 

4269
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:46,149
that obviously i'm biased
in this regard um i do believe that all

4270
01:16:46,149 --> 01:16:46,159
in this regard um i do believe that all
 

4271
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:47,590
in this regard um i do believe that all
of the students that i taught

who became world champions would have

who became world champions would have
 

4275
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,790
who became world champions would have
been great athletes whether or not they

had met me or not
 

4279
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,350
had met me or not
i believe that but i do also believe it

4280
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:55,360
i believe that but i do also believe it
 

4281
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:56,870
i believe that but i do also believe it
would have taken them a lot longer

4282
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:56,880
would have taken them a lot longer
 

4283
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,390
would have taken them a lot longer
and they may not have gotten to the

4284
01:16:58,390 --> 01:16:58,400
and they may not have gotten to the
 

4285
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,910
and they may not have gotten to the
level that they did they

4286
01:16:59,910 --> 01:16:59,920
level that they did they
 

4287
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,750
level that they did they
i'm sure they would have been impressive

4288
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:01,760
i'm sure they would have been impressive
 

4289
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,149
i'm sure they would have been impressive
but i do believe

4290
01:17:04,149 --> 01:17:04,159
but i do believe
 

4291
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:05,990
but i do believe
that the nature of a training program

4292
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
that the nature of a training program
 

4293
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,149
that the nature of a training program
plays an enormous difference

4294
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:08,159
plays an enormous difference
 

4295
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:10,630
plays an enormous difference
i don't mean to say this in an arrogant

4296
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:10,640
i don't mean to say this in an arrogant
 

4297
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,390
i don't mean to say this in an arrogant
way i believe that

4298
01:17:12,390 --> 01:17:12,400
way i believe that
 

4299
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,630
way i believe that
there's again a mountain of evidence to

4300
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:14,640
there's again a mountain of evidence to
 

4301
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:16,229
there's again a mountain of evidence to
suggest this is true because you see it

4302
01:17:16,229 --> 01:17:16,239
suggest this is true because you see it
 

4303
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:17,830
suggest this is true because you see it
in many different sports

4304
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
in many different sports
 

4305
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,229
in many different sports
let's talk for example about your

01:17:20,229 --> 01:17:20,239
let's talk for example about your
 

4307
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,030
let's talk for example about your

4309
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:25,750

russia and its wrestling program

4310

4311
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:28,870

russia is an enormous country but the

01:17:28,870 --> 01:17:28,880
russia is an enormous country but the

where russia's wrestling program comes
from is actually very small

4318
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
from is actually very small
 

4319
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,910

and the population is actually very

01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,510
and the population is actually very

small i can't
 

4323
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,990
small i can't
verify this but i was told once i can't

4324
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,000
verify this but i was told once i can't
 

4325
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,830
verify this but i was told once i can't
verify this but the number of people who

4326
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:41,840
verify this but the number of people who
 

4327
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,189
verify this but the number of people who
wrestle in russia is actually

01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
wrestle in russia is actually
 

4329
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:43,990
wrestle in russia is actually
significantly

01:17:43,990 --> 01:17:44,000
significantly
 

4331
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,830
significantly
smaller than the number of people who

01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:45,840
smaller than the number of people who
 

4333
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,669
smaller than the number of people who
wrestle in the united states

wrestle in the united states
 

4335
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,709
wrestle in the united states
it's also not part of the school uh uh

4336
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
it's also not part of the school uh uh
 

4337
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,790
it's also not part of the school uh uh
athletics and it is in the united states

athletics and it is in the united states
 

4339
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,870
athletics and it is in the united states
yes that's a different point we'll come

4340
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:54,880
yes that's a different point we'll come
 

4341
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,070
yes that's a different point we'll come
back to right to that because that's

4342
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:56,080
back to right to that because that's
 

4343
01:17:56,080 --> 01:17:57,669
back to right to that because that's
also an important point

4344
01:17:57,669 --> 01:17:57,679
also an important point
 

4345
01:17:57,679 --> 01:17:59,669
also an important point
but if you look at the actual numbers of

4346
01:17:59,669 --> 01:17:59,679
but if you look at the actual numbers of
 

4347
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,950
but if you look at the actual numbers of
people there they're actually pretty

4348
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
people there they're actually pretty
 

4349
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,990
people there they're actually pretty
small

4350
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000
small
 

4351
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,990
small
so ostensibly if it comes down to a

4352
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
so ostensibly if it comes down to a
 

4353
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,750
so ostensibly if it comes down to a
numbers game america should dominate at

4354
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
numbers game america should dominate at
 

4355
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,750
numbers game america should dominate at
the olympics if we have more wrestlers

4356
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
the olympics if we have more wrestlers
 

4357
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,750
the olympics if we have more wrestlers
now this the story gets more complicated

4358
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:09,760
now this the story gets more complicated
 

4359
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:11,270
now this the story gets more complicated
because america has a different

4360
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
because america has a different
 

4361
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,030
because america has a different
style of wrestling the collegiate style

4362
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
style of wrestling the collegiate style
 

4363
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,870
style of wrestling the collegiate style
than the international freestyle that

4364
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
than the international freestyle that
 

4365
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,630
than the international freestyle that
is a complicating factor

4366
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:18,640

 

4367
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,750

but nonetheless uh what you see there

4368
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:21,760
but nonetheless uh what you see there
 

4369
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:25,590
but nonetheless uh what you see there
is that numbers on everything rather

4370
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
is that numbers on everything rather
 

4371
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,590
is that numbers on everything rather
the manner in which people are trained

the manner in which people are trained
 

4373
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,430
the manner in which people are trained
clearly has an impact

4374
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:29,440
clearly has an impact
 

4375
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:33,030
clearly has an impact
and we know very little about the this

4376
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,040
and we know very little about the this
 

4377
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:34,630
and we know very little about the this
very little reliable information about

very little reliable information about
 

4379
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,310
very little reliable information about
the training program for wrestling

the training program for wrestling

the training program for wrestling
in uh in the russian states

in uh in the russian states
 

4383
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,070

but one thing is incontestable is the

but one thing is incontestable is the
 

4385

but one thing is incontestable is the

um you can talk about
 

4401
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:01,510
um you can talk about
performance-enhancing drugs but those

now the training program is one thing i
 

4505
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,910
now the training program is one thing i
do believe that's the single most

4506
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:53,920
do believe that's the single most
 

4507

do believe that's the single most
important but

um in my own experience uh people
talk about athletes that i've trained

4725
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:30,229
and um i've for most of my life
saw good training sessions where my body

4726
01:24:30,229 --> 01:24:30,239
saw good training sessions where my body
 

4727
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:31,270
saw good training sessions where my body
was exhausted

4728
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
was exhausted
 

4729
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,990
was exhausted
yes i believe that's the case with most

4730
01:24:33,990 --> 01:24:34,000
yes i believe that's the case with most
 

4731
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,629
yes i believe that's the case with most
people

4732
01:24:34,629 --> 01:24:34,639
people
 

4733
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,709
people
yeah you should come out of the training

4734
01:24:36,709 --> 01:24:36,719
yeah you should come out of the training
 

4735
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:37,990
yeah you should come out of the training
session with your mind

4736
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,000
session with your mind
 

4737
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,149
session with your mind
buzzing with ideas like possibilities

4738
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:40,159
buzzing with ideas like possibilities
 

4739
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,430
buzzing with ideas like possibilities
for tomorrow

4740
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
for tomorrow
 

4741
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,189
for tomorrow
and by the way on that note i would go

4742
01:24:43,189 --> 01:24:43,199
and by the way on that note i would go
 

4743
01:24:43,199 --> 01:24:44,470
and by the way on that note i would go
further and say that

4744
01:24:44,470 --> 01:24:44,480
further and say that
 

4745
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,790
further and say that
the training session doesn't finish when

4746
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:46,800
the training session doesn't finish when
 

4747
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,550
the training session doesn't finish when
your body stops moving

4748
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:48,560
your body stops moving
 

4749
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,030
your body stops moving
it finishes when your mind stops moving

4750
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,040
it finishes when your mind stops moving
 

4751
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:53,030
it finishes when your mind stops moving
and your mind shouldn't stop moving

4752
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
and your mind shouldn't stop moving
 

4753
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,390
and your mind shouldn't stop moving
after that session there should be

4754
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:54,400
after that session there should be
 

4755
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,229
after that session there should be
analysis what did i do well what did i

4756
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:56,239
analysis what did i do well what did i
 

4757

analysis what did i do well what did i
do badly

4758

how could i do better with the things

4760
01:24:58,709 --> 01:24:58,719
how could i do better with the things
 

4761
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:00,870
how could i do better with the things
that i did well i can ask about

4762
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:00,880
that i did well i can ask about
 

4763
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,550
that i did well i can ask about
something that

4769
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,830
powerful but most people don't seem to
believe in that but

the idea
maybe even outside of jiu jitsu of doing

4778
01:25:17,189 --> 01:25:17,199
maybe even outside of jiu jitsu of doing
 

4779
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:19,350
maybe even outside of jiu jitsu of doing
the same thing over and over

4780
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
the same thing over and over
 

4781
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:23,270
the same thing over and over
it's like jiro dreams of sushi i love

4807
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,830

i think i could achieve it by drilling

4808
01:25:55,830 --> 01:25:55,840
i think i could achieve it by drilling
 

4809
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:59,030
i think i could achieve it by drilling
hmm that's i had this belief untested

4822
01:26:13,910 --> 01:26:13,920
start to understand what are we talking
 

4823
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,750
start to understand what are we talking
about when we talk about drilling it's a

about when we talk about drilling it's a
 

4825
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,470
about when we talk about drilling it's a
very vague term

4826
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,480
very vague term
 

4827
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,830
very vague term
okay if you're at this moment many of

4828
01:26:21,830 --> 01:26:21,840
okay if you're at this moment many of
 

4829
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:23,510
okay if you're at this moment many of
your listeners are probably seen

4830
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
your listeners are probably seen
 

4831
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:25,270
your listeners are probably seen
having the same thought process which is

having the same thought process which is
 

4833
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,750
having the same thought process which is
a drilling yeah i know what that is

4834

we go into the gym and we pick a move

4836
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:30,480
we go into the gym and we pick a move
 

4837
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:31,990
we go into the gym and we pick a move
and we practice it for a certain number

4838
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:32,000
and we practice it for a certain number
 

4839
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,310
and we practice it for a certain number
of repetitions

4840
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:34,320
of repetitions
 

4841
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,350
of repetitions
and if i do that i'm gonna get better at

4842
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:37,360
and if i do that i'm gonna get better at
 

4843
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,030
and if i do that i'm gonna get better at
the technique

4844
01:26:39,030 --> 01:26:39,040
the technique
 

4845
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:43,830
the technique
okay um

4846
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:43,840

 

4847
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:47,030

they're wrong

4848
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,040

 

4849
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,709

we've got to have a much more

4850
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
we've got to have a much more
 

4851
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:54,070
we've got to have a much more
in-depth understanding

4852
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
in-depth understanding
 

4853
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,510
in-depth understanding
of what the hell we're talking about

4854
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:55,520
of what the hell we're talking about
 

4855
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:58,390
of what the hell we're talking about
when we talk about drilling

4856
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
when we talk about drilling
 

4857
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,310
when we talk about drilling
ultimately any movement

4858
01:27:02,310 --> 01:27:02,320
ultimately any movement
 

4859
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,470
ultimately any movement
in the gym that doesn't

4860
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:06,480
in the gym that doesn't
 

4861
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:08,870
in the gym that doesn't
improve the skills you already have or

4862
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:08,880
improve the skills you already have or
 

4863
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,629
improve the skills you already have or
build new skills

4864
01:27:10,629 --> 01:27:10,639
build new skills
 

4865
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,390
build new skills
is a waste of time a waste of resources

4866
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
is a waste of time a waste of resources
 

4867
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,550
is a waste of time a waste of resources
everything you do should be done with

4868
01:27:16,550 --> 01:27:16,560
everything you do should be done with
 

4869
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:17,430
everything you do should be done with
the aim

4870
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:17,440
the aim
 

4871
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,110
the aim
and the understanding that this is going

4872
01:27:19,110 --> 01:27:19,120
and the understanding that this is going
 

4873
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,950
and the understanding that this is going
to make me better at the sport i

4874
01:27:20,950 --> 01:27:20,960
to make me better at the sport i
 

4875
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:21,830
to make me better at the sport i
practice

4876
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
practice
 

4877
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,510
practice
if it's not it shouldn't be there

4878
01:27:25,510 --> 01:27:25,520

 

4879
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,550

the majority of what passes for drilling

4880
01:27:28,550 --> 01:27:28,560
the majority of what passes for drilling
 

4881
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,870
the majority of what passes for drilling
in most training halls will not make you

4882
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:30,880
in most training halls will not make you
 

4883
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,550
in most training halls will not make you

hibero and
 

5217
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:53,590
hibero and
sean jihabero that have this i guess the

but putting pressure as you pass guard
 

5227
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:02,830
but putting pressure as you pass guard
uh like medium passing distance kind of

01:34:08,159 --> 01:34:11,110
that to understand
what what putting pressure with my hips

what what putting pressure with my hips
 

5237
01:34:11,120 --> 01:34:12,229
what what putting pressure with my hips
feels like

feels like
 

5239
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,310
feels like
to truly understand that movement i felt

to truly understand that movement i felt
 

5241
01:34:14,320 --> 01:34:15,830
to truly understand that movement i felt
like i was getting

like i was getting
 

5243
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,550
like i was getting
much better it's it's like it's hard to

5244
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:18,560
much better it's it's like it's hard to
 

5245
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:20,070
much better it's it's like it's hard to
put into words but that skill

first thing that journey is a wonderful
thing and if that technique

thing and if that technique
 

5311
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,870
thing and if that technique
is a a crucial part of what you do

then it's time well invested but always
 

5315
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:25,990
then it's time well invested but always
understand that it comes at an

opportunity cost
 

5319
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:29,590

that by spending that amount of time on

that by spending that amount of time on
 

5321

that by spending that amount of time on
that one technique you've sacrificed

other things that you could have

01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:34,950
other things that you could have
learned that could have won your matches

learned that could have won your matches
 

5327
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,070
learned that could have won your matches
so understand that every

focus upon one element of the game comes
 

5331
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:41,669
focus upon one element of the game comes
at the opportunity cost of other

um now as long as you're playing a part

5336
01:35:45,990 --> 01:35:46,000
um now as long as you're playing a part
 

5337
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:46,790
um now as long as you're playing a part
of the game where

01:35:46,790 --> 01:35:46,800
of the game where
 

5339

of the game where
okay this is central to what i do yes

5340
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
okay this is central to what i do yes
 

5341
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,709
okay this is central to what i do yes
okay that's fine

5342
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:50,719
okay that's fine
 

5343
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,709
okay that's fine
but um just be aware of the danger of

5344
01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:52,719
but um just be aware of the danger of
 

5345
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:54,229
but um just be aware of the danger of
opportunity cost that's something no one

5346
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
opportunity cost that's something no one
 

5347
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,750
opportunity cost that's something no one
talks about in the training room but

5348
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:55,760
talks about in the training room but
 

5349
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,990
talks about in the training room but
it becomes very important secondly the

5350
01:35:57,990 --> 01:35:58,000
it becomes very important secondly the
 

5351
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,270
it becomes very important secondly the
other question you have to start asking

5352
01:35:59,270 --> 01:35:59,280
other question you have to start asking
 

5353
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,550
other question you have to start asking
yourself is

5354
01:36:00,550 --> 01:36:00,560
yourself is
 

5355
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,830
yourself is
okay that training clearly had benefits

5356
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
okay that training clearly had benefits
 

5357
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,310
okay that training clearly had benefits
for you

5358
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:04,320
for you
 

5359
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:07,030
for you
early on but when the point of

01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,040
early on but when the point of
 

5361
01:36:07,040 --> 01:36:08,790
early on but when the point of
diminishing returns starts coming and if

5362
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:08,800
diminishing returns starts coming and if
 

5363
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:09,990
diminishing returns starts coming and if
you feel you're just doing

you feel you're just doing
 

5365
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,229
you feel you're just doing
the same thing then it's time to switch

5366
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
the same thing then it's time to switch
 

5367
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:13,910
the same thing then it's time to switch
now if you feel you're still getting

5368
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:13,920
now if you feel you're still getting
 

5369
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:15,270
now if you feel you're still getting

they feel like they get more out of the
 

5693
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:49,750
they feel like they get more out of the
workout and that's

5694
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:49,760
workout and that's
 

5695
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:51,990
workout and that's
that's if anything an indictment upon

5696
01:41:51,990 --> 01:41:52,000
that's if anything an indictment upon
 

5697
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,510
that's if anything an indictment upon
most of the training programs around the

most of the training programs around the
 

5699

would you say that drilling if you were

5702
01:41:57,189 --> 01:41:57,199
would you say that drilling if you were
 

5703
01:41:57,199 --> 01:41:58,790
would you say that drilling if you were
to build

5704
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
to build
 

5705
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,669
to build
a black belt world champion would

5706
01:42:01,669 --> 01:42:01,679
a black belt world champion would
 

5707
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:03,189
a black belt world champion would
drilling be

5708
01:42:03,189 --> 01:42:03,199
drilling be

what percent of their training in the

01:42:05,990 --> 01:42:06,000
what percent of their training in the
 

5711
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,430
what percent of their training in the
entirety of their career would be

5712
01:42:07,430 --> 01:42:07,440
entirety of their career would be
 

5713
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:07,910

good great question um let's first put a

5716
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:11,040
good great question um let's first put a
 

5717
01:42:11,040 --> 01:42:12,229
good great question um let's first put a
proviso on it that i

5718
01:42:12,229 --> 01:42:12,239
proviso on it that i
 

5719
01:42:12,239 --> 01:42:14,070
proviso on it that i
don't do the same thing for all athletes

5720
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:14,080
don't do the same thing for all athletes
 

5721
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:16,149
don't do the same thing for all athletes
everyone's got a different personality

5722
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
everyone's got a different personality
 

5723
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:19,030
everyone's got a different personality
and like nikki rod i can only hold his

um five minutes uh gordon ryan
 

5731
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,790
um five minutes uh gordon ryan
five hours like uh george saint pierre

five hours
travis stevens five hours they are just

5736
01:42:34,629 --> 01:42:34,639
travis stevens five hours they are just
 

5737

travis stevens five hours they are just
laser focused so everyone's different

laser focused so everyone's different
 

5739
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:38,950
laser focused so everyone's different
let's put that down as our first proviso

5740
01:42:38,950 --> 01:42:38,960
let's put that down as our first proviso
 

5741
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:41,750
let's put that down as our first proviso
um uh you probably knew those answers

5742
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:41,760
um uh you probably knew those answers
 

5743
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,149
um uh you probably knew those answers
already

5744
01:42:42,149 --> 01:42:42,159
already
 

5745
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:45,750
already
yeah um that's hilarious but

5746
01:42:45,750 --> 01:42:45,760
yeah um that's hilarious but
 

5747
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,790
yeah um that's hilarious but
uh as a general rule

5748
01:42:48,790 --> 01:42:48,800
uh as a general rule
 

5749
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,390
uh as a general rule
uh if i run a two and a half hour class

5750
01:42:52,390 --> 01:42:52,400
uh if i run a two and a half hour class
 

5751
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:55,270
uh if i run a two and a half hour class
uh you can expect an hour and a half of

5752
01:42:55,270 --> 01:42:55,280
uh you can expect an hour and a half of
 

5753
01:42:55,280 --> 01:42:57,510
uh you can expect an hour and a half of
it to be

5754
01:42:57,510 --> 01:42:57,520
it to be
 

5755
01:42:57,520 --> 01:42:59,189
it to be
i'm going to use the word drilling but

5756
01:42:59,189 --> 01:42:59,199
i'm going to use the word drilling but
 

5757
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:00,550
i'm going to use the word drilling but
i'm also going to say that

5758
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:00,560
i'm also going to say that
 

5759
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:03,109
i'm also going to say that
this is too complex of a story to give

5760
01:43:03,109 --> 01:43:03,119
this is too complex of a story to give
 

5761
01:43:03,119 --> 01:43:04,229
this is too complex of a story to give
now with words i would need to

5762
01:43:04,229 --> 01:43:04,239
now with words i would need to
 

5763
01:43:04,239 --> 01:43:05,189
now with words i would need to
demonstrate it

5764
01:43:05,189 --> 01:43:05,199
demonstrate it
 

5765
01:43:05,199 --> 01:43:06,790
demonstrate it
but the way in which we drill is not

5766
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:06,800
but the way in which we drill is not
 

5767
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,470
but the way in which we drill is not
your standard method of drilling

5768
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:08,480
your standard method of drilling
 

5769
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,590
your standard method of drilling
and then it's into sparring

5770
01:43:11,590 --> 01:43:11,600
and then it's into sparring
 

5771
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:13,270
and then it's into sparring
but if you give me a choice between a

5772
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
but if you give me a choice between a
 

5773
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,149
but if you give me a choice between a
bad drilling partner and sparring

5774
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:16,159
bad drilling partner and sparring
 

5775
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,550
bad drilling partner and sparring
i could make the same choice that most

5776
01:43:18,550 --> 01:43:18,560
i could make the same choice that most
 

5777
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,990
i could make the same choice that most
black belts make without go with

5778
01:43:19,990 --> 01:43:20,000
black belts make without go with
 

5779
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,030
black belts make without go with
sparring

5780
01:43:21,030 --> 01:43:21,040
sparring
 

5781
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:26,390
sparring
because you can create drilling with it

5782
01:43:26,390 --> 01:43:26,400

 

5783
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,229

like good drilling is a wonderful thing

5784
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
like good drilling is a wonderful thing
 

5785
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,910
like good drilling is a wonderful thing
bad drilling is just a worthless waste

of one of the interesting systems you've
 

5803

we were also told that they were
tactically

5854
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:51,199
tactically
 

5855
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,149
tactically
unsound because if you ever attempted

5856
01:44:54,149 --> 01:44:54,159
unsound because if you ever attempted
 

5857
01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:54,870
unsound because if you ever attempted
them and you

5858
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:54,880
them and you
 

5859
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,070
them and you
lost control of the leg lock

5860
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:58,080
lost control of the leg lock
 

5861
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,590
lost control of the leg lock
your opponent would end up on top of you

5862
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
your opponent would end up on top of you
 

5863
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,350
your opponent would end up on top of you
or in some kind of good position and

5864
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
or in some kind of good position and
 

5865
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,390
or in some kind of good position and
you'd be in

5866
01:45:02,390 --> 01:45:02,400
you'd be in
 

5867
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:05,270
you'd be in
terrible trouble um and we're also told

5868
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
terrible trouble um and we're also told
 

5869
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:06,629
terrible trouble um and we're also told
that they were unsafe

5870
01:45:06,629 --> 01:45:06,639
that they were unsafe
 

5871
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,430
that they were unsafe
that uh if they were applied in the gym

5872
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:09,440
that uh if they were applied in the gym
 

5873
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:11,030
that uh if they were applied in the gym
there'd be far too many injuries and

5874
01:45:11,030 --> 01:45:11,040
there'd be far too many injuries and
 

5875
01:45:11,040 --> 01:45:14,149
there'd be far too many injuries and
people would be badly hurt and

5876
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:14,159
people would be badly hurt and
 

5877
01:45:14,159 --> 01:45:15,990
people would be badly hurt and
that was the received wisdom of that

5878
01:45:15,990 --> 01:45:16,000
that was the received wisdom of that
 

5879
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,430
that was the received wisdom of that
time and so i

5880
01:45:17,430 --> 01:45:17,440
time and so i
 

5881
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:20,390
time and so i
i didn't even would work with them at

5882
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:20,400
i didn't even would work with them at
 

5883
01:45:20,400 --> 01:45:21,109
i didn't even would work with them at
all

5884
01:45:21,109 --> 01:45:21,119
all
 

5885
01:45:21,119 --> 01:45:23,270
all
and uh they would be shown occasionally

5886
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:23,280
and uh they would be shown occasionally
 

5887
01:45:23,280 --> 01:45:24,310
and uh they would be shown occasionally
in the gym

5888
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:24,320
in the gym
 

5889
01:45:24,320 --> 01:45:27,990
in the gym
and you'd learn them you drilled them

5890
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:28,000
and you'd learn them you drilled them
 

5891
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,510
and you'd learn them you drilled them
and but inspiring i showed no interest

and but inspiring i showed no interest
 

5893
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,189
and but inspiring i showed no interest
um you probably know that change when i

uh well he asked this first principles
 

5927
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:10,550
uh well he asked this first principles
question is why would you only use half

the number of specialized leg lockers
 

5943
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,189
the number of specialized leg lockers
was very small and most of them

5944
01:46:29,189 --> 01:46:29,199
was very small and most of them
 

5945
01:46:29,199 --> 01:46:32,870
was very small and most of them
were from outside of conventional

fairly soon certain truths started to

5970
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:02,159
fairly soon certain truths started to
 

5971
01:47:02,159 --> 01:47:02,709
fairly soon certain truths started to
become

01:47:02,709 --> 01:47:02,719
become
 

5973
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:06,070
become
evident and

evident and
 

5975
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:07,990
evident and
the most important of these can be

5976
01:47:07,990 --> 01:47:08,000
the most important of these can be
 

5977
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:09,910
the most important of these can be
understood very quickly and they were

5978
01:47:09,910 --> 01:47:09,920
understood very quickly and they were
 

5979
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:13,030
understood very quickly and they were
relatively easy to discover

5980
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:13,040
relatively easy to discover
 

5981
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:17,430
relatively easy to discover
the first was that most people

5982
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:17,440
the first was that most people
 

5983
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:21,030
the first was that most people
when they went to

5984
01:47:21,030 --> 01:47:21,040

 

5985
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:24,390

understand and study leg locking

5986
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:24,400
understand and study leg locking
 

5987
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:25,990
understand and study leg locking
and when i talk about leg locking i'm

5988
01:47:25,990 --> 01:47:26,000
and when i talk about leg locking i'm
 

5989
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,510
and when i talk about leg locking i'm
going to talk about one specific type

5990
01:47:27,510 --> 01:47:27,520
going to talk about one specific type
 

5991
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,669
going to talk about one specific type
which is the most high percentage type

5992
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
which is the most high percentage type
 

5993
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:31,750
which is the most high percentage type
this is leg locks which are performed

5994
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:31,760
this is leg locks which are performed
 

5995
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:33,830
this is leg locks which are performed
with entanglements of your opponent's

5996
01:47:33,830 --> 01:47:33,840
with entanglements of your opponent's
 

5997
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,350
with entanglements of your opponent's
legs with your legs there are other

5998
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:35,360
legs with your legs there are other
 

5999
01:47:35,360 --> 01:47:35,990
legs with your legs there are other
forms of leg

6000
01:47:35,990 --> 01:47:36,000
forms of leg
 

6001
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,270
forms of leg
log but these are relatively low

6002
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
log but these are relatively low
 

6003
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,189
log but these are relatively low
percentage and don't figure heavily in

6004
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:39,199
percentage and don't figure heavily in
 

6005
01:47:39,199 --> 01:47:40,310
percentage and don't figure heavily in
competition so i'll

6006
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:40,320
competition so i'll
 

6007
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,350
competition so i'll
i'll ignore them

6008
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:43,360

 

6009
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:46,229

most people made no distinction between

01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:48,629
most people made no distinction between
the mechanism of control

6012
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:48,639
the mechanism of control
 

6013
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:51,669
the mechanism of control

6349
01:53:41,360 --> 01:53:43,430
attack leg locks is not top position
it's bottom position you'll see that

underneath people not on top of people
 

6357
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:50,229
underneath people not on top of people
so there is no position or loss you're

6358
01:53:50,229 --> 01:53:50,239
so there is no position or loss you're
 

6359
01:53:50,239 --> 01:53:51,669
so there is no position or loss you're

6361
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,470

if a team can do it anyone can do it and

6516
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
if a team can do it anyone can do it and
 

6517
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:41,030
if a team can do it anyone can do it and
i think that's what really

convinced people that this was something

6520
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
convinced people that this was something
 

6521
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,790
convinced people that this was something
worth studying this is something that

worth studying this is something that
 

6523
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:47,030
worth studying this is something that
could be a big part of their lives but

could be a big part of their lives but
 

6525
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:47,990
could be a big part of their lives but
also convince you

also convince you
 

6527
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:49,510
also convince you
and convince convince each other in

01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:49,520
and convince convince each other in
 

6529
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:51,189
and convince convince each other in
those early days when you're developing

6530
01:56:51,189 --> 01:56:51,199
those early days when you're developing
 

6531
01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:52,390
those early days when you're developing
the science

the science
 

6533
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:53,830

knew for sure that there's a lot here to
 

6541
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:04,629
knew for sure that there's a lot here to
be discovered in terms of control

you perhaps hadn't just like you said an

6544
01:57:06,870 --> 01:57:06,880
you perhaps hadn't just like you said an
 

6545

initial intuition
 

6547
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:12,310
initial intuition
but you know you have to have enough um

initial idea to the entire system
 

6555
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:21,830
initial idea to the entire system
is there is there a sense you have about

you have a lot of powerful ideas in
 

6571
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:37,109
you have a lot of powerful ideas in

those kinds of things
 

6579
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:44,070
those kinds of things
and then you also mentioned kind of

this is how much do you understand about

6588
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:54,960
this is how much do you understand about
 

6589
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,109
this is how much do you understand about
this world this is a fascinating

6590
01:57:57,109 --> 01:57:57,119
this world this is a fascinating
 

6591
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:57,669
this world this is a fascinating
question

6592
01:57:57,669 --> 01:57:57,679
question
 

6593
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,350
question
um as a general rule

6594
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:01,360
um as a general rule
 

6595
01:58:01,360 --> 01:58:04,709
um as a general rule
the most

6596
01:58:04,709 --> 01:58:04,719

 

6597
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:07,750

the most powerful developments are

6598
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:07,760
the most powerful developments are
 

6599
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,830
the most powerful developments are
always at the onset of a project

6600
01:58:09,830 --> 01:58:09,840
always at the onset of a project
 

6601
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:13,510
always at the onset of a project
okay um let's give an example um

6602
01:58:13,510 --> 01:58:13,520
okay um let's give an example um
 

6603
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:17,510
okay um let's give an example um
the jet engine was uh

6604
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
the jet engine was uh
 

6605
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,990
the jet engine was uh
i believe first conceived in the late

6606
01:58:19,990 --> 01:58:20,000
i believe first conceived in the late
 

6607
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,189
i believe first conceived in the late
1930s

6608
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:21,199
1930s
 

6609
01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:23,109
1930s
just around the time of world war ii it

6610
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:23,119
just around the time of world war ii it
 

6611
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:25,189
just around the time of world war ii it
was developed

6612
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:25,199
was developed
 

6613
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:27,669
was developed
with great pace because of world war ii

6614
01:58:27,669 --> 01:58:27,679
with great pace because of world war ii
 

6615
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:29,910
with great pace because of world war ii
that obviously military research was a

6616
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:29,920
that obviously military research was a
 

6617
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:33,189
that obviously military research was a
huge thing back then and first

6618
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:33,199
huge thing back then and first
 

6619
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:36,310
huge thing back then and first
fielded i believe by the germans uh

6620
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:36,320
fielded i believe by the germans uh
 

6621
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:40,709
fielded i believe by the germans uh
in around 1943. um

6622
01:58:40,709 --> 01:58:40,719
in around 1943. um
 

6623
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:43,270
in around 1943. um
jet aircraft didn't play a big role in

6624
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:43,280
jet aircraft didn't play a big role in
 

6625
01:58:43,280 --> 01:58:45,189
jet aircraft didn't play a big role in
world war ii they were there at the end

6626
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:45,199
world war ii they were there at the end
 

6627
01:58:45,199 --> 01:58:46,790
world war ii they were there at the end
and they did play

6628
01:58:46,790 --> 01:58:46,800
and they did play
 

6629
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,870
and they did play
a significant role but in terms of

6630
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:48,880
a significant role but in terms of
 

6631
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,149
a significant role but in terms of
numbers they just weren't there

6632
01:58:52,149 --> 01:58:52,159

 

6633
01:58:52,159 --> 01:58:55,589

so by around 1945 you had the onset

6634
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
so by around 1945 you had the onset
 

6635
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:58,790
so by around 1945 you had the onset
of the jet age and the jet engine began

6636
01:58:58,790 --> 01:58:58,800
of the jet age and the jet engine began
 

6637
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:00,709
of the jet age and the jet engine began
to replace the piston engine

6638
01:59:00,709 --> 01:59:00,719
to replace the piston engine
 

6639
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:02,950
to replace the piston engine
in most aircraft it was it was the new

6640
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:02,960
in most aircraft it was it was the new
 

6641
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,070
in most aircraft it was it was the new
way of of doing things

6642
01:59:06,070 --> 01:59:06,080
way of of doing things
 

6643
01:59:06,080 --> 01:59:10,310
way of of doing things
if you look at the pace of development

6644
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:10,320
if you look at the pace of development
 

6645
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:13,070
if you look at the pace of development
of jet engine aircraft technology from

6646
01:59:13,070 --> 01:59:13,080
of jet engine aircraft technology from
 

6647
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:15,510
of jet engine aircraft technology from
1945

6648
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:15,520
1945
 

6649
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:18,830
1945
to 1960 it is

6650
01:59:18,830 --> 01:59:18,840
to 1960 it is
 

6651
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,750
to 1960 it is
unbelievable there was a

6652
01:59:21,750 --> 01:59:21,760
unbelievable there was a
 

6653
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,950
unbelievable there was a
solid decade where they were gaining

6654
01:59:24,950 --> 01:59:24,960
solid decade where they were gaining
 

6655
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,990
solid decade where they were gaining
almost 100 miles an hour per year

6656
01:59:27,990 --> 01:59:28,000
almost 100 miles an hour per year
 

6657
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:31,030
almost 100 miles an hour per year
for a decade that's a form of growth

6658
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040
for a decade that's a form of growth
 

6659
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:34,870
for a decade that's a form of growth
that i mean in the world of engineering

6660
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:34,880
that i mean in the world of engineering
 

6661
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:35,750
that i mean in the world of engineering
that's

6662
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:35,760
that's
 

6663
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:37,830
that's
that's the only time you see growth like

6664
01:59:37,830 --> 01:59:37,840
that's the only time you see growth like
 

6665
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:39,430
that's the only time you see growth like
that is on things like bitcoin

6666
01:59:39,430 --> 01:59:39,440
that is on things like bitcoin
 

6667
01:59:39,440 --> 01:59:43,830
that is on things like bitcoin
and that's about it okay um uh

6669
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,950

let's put things in perspective okay um

let's put things in perspective okay um

the amount of progress between 1973

6732
02:01:05,830 --> 02:01:05,840
the amount of progress between 1973
 

6733
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:10,310
the amount of progress between 1973
and 2020 isn't very impressive

6734
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:10,320
and 2020 isn't very impressive
 

6735
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:13,510
and 2020 isn't very impressive
but the amount of progress from 1945

6736
02:01:13,510 --> 02:01:13,520
but the amount of progress from 1945
 

6737
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:16,470
but the amount of progress from 1945

and so the initial progress tends to be
 

6743
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:24,470
and so the initial progress tends to be
meteoric but after that it tends to be

meteoric but after that it tends to be

why we don't make it much cheaper why we

why we don't make it much cheaper why we

it feels like it's not just a single

um what i do believe is that you will

um what i do believe is that you will
 

6809
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:41,510
um what i do believe is that you will
start to see new directions

6810
02:02:41,510 --> 02:02:41,520
start to see new directions
 

6811
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:43,270
start to see new directions
start to emerge where you start to see

6812
02:02:43,270 --> 02:02:43,280
start to emerge where you start to see
 

6813
02:02:43,280 --> 02:02:44,950
start to emerge where you start to see
the interface between leg locking and

02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
back attacks and that will provide
 

6821
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,870
back attacks and that will provide
new avenues of direction which will

but in terms of uh breaking people's
 

6829
02:03:00,400 --> 02:03:02,149
but in terms of uh breaking people's
legs this the simple act of breaking

6830
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:02,159
legs this the simple act of breaking
 

6831
02:03:02,159 --> 02:03:02,950

i believe we're in the incremental phase

6834
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
i believe we're in the incremental phase
 

6835
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:06,709
i believe we're in the incremental phase
now rather than the meteoric phase

6836
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
now rather than the meteoric phase

let me ask you a ridiculous question how
 

6839
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:10,950
let me ask you a ridiculous question how
hard is it to actually break a leg this

6840

hard is it to actually break a leg this
 

6841
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:12,709
hard is it to actually break a leg this
is something you think about i remember

is something you think about i remember
 

6843

wasn't breaking
 

6891
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:08,629
wasn't breaking
it was it was just bending and bending

6892
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
it was it was just bending and bending
 

6893
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:10,870
it was it was just bending and bending
and bending and there's damage to it

6894
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:10,880
and bending and there's damage to it
 

6895
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:14,229
and bending and there's damage to it
of some kind but i wanted to like

6896
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:14,239
of some kind but i wanted to like
 

6897
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:16,149
of some kind but i wanted to like
you know i wanted to see first of all

6898
02:04:16,149 --> 02:04:16,159
you know i wanted to see first of all
 

6899
02:04:16,159 --> 02:04:17,910
you know i wanted to see first of all
it's very difficult psychologically

6900
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:17,920
it's very difficult psychologically
 

6901
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:18,870
it's very difficult psychologically
because it's like

6902
02:04:18,870 --> 02:04:18,880
because it's like
 

6903
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:21,189
because it's like
can i be violent here that wasn't a

6904
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
can i be violent here that wasn't a
 

6905
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:22,069
can i be violent here that wasn't a
whole nother

6906
02:04:22,069 --> 02:04:22,079
whole nother
 

6907
02:04:22,079 --> 02:04:23,990
whole nother
thing with adrenaline you can't really

6908
02:04:23,990 --> 02:04:24,000
thing with adrenaline you can't really
 

6909
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,149
thing with adrenaline you can't really
think that fast but i also thought like

6910
02:04:26,149 --> 02:04:26,159
think that fast but i also thought like
 

6911
02:04:26,159 --> 02:04:26,470
think that fast but i also thought like
where

6912
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
where
 

6913
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,550
where
where else is there to go like is it the

6914
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:28,560
where else is there to go like is it the
 

6915
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,149
where else is there to go like is it the
shin going to break what is supposed to

6916
02:04:30,149 --> 02:04:30,159
shin going to break what is supposed to
 

6917
02:04:30,159 --> 02:04:30,950
shin going to break what is supposed to
break

6918
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:30,960
break
 

6919
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:32,790
break
so i wonder yeah in the case of the

6920
02:04:32,790 --> 02:04:32,800
so i wonder yeah in the case of the
 

6921
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:33,910
so i wonder yeah in the case of the
achilles log it's going to be the

6922
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:33,920
achilles log it's going to be the
 

6923
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,510
achilles log it's going to be the
anterior tibialis tendon

6924
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:35,520
anterior tibialis tendon
 

6925
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:37,750
anterior tibialis tendon
and what's that uh let's see it runs

6926
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:37,760
and what's that uh let's see it runs
 

6927
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:38,790
and what's that uh let's see it runs
down there's two of them

6928
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:38,800
down there's two of them
 

6929
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:40,310
down there's two of them
uh it'll be the minor one that runs on

6930
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,320
uh it'll be the minor one that runs on
 

6931
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:42,310
uh it'll be the minor one that runs on
the outside of the front of the ankle

6932
02:04:42,310 --> 02:04:42,320
the outside of the front of the ankle
 

6933
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:43,910
the outside of the front of the ankle
um it's not going to be the achilles

6934
02:04:43,910 --> 02:04:43,920
um it's not going to be the achilles
 

6935
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:45,669
um it's not going to be the achilles
tendon a lot of people

6936
02:04:45,669 --> 02:04:45,679
tendon a lot of people
 

6937
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:47,990
tendon a lot of people
promulgate this uh this absurdity the

6938
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:48,000
promulgate this uh this absurdity the
 

6939
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,870
promulgate this uh this absurdity the
achilles tendon

6940
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:48,880
achilles tendon
 

6941
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,350
achilles tendon
can rupture but not from pressure it's

6942
02:04:51,350 --> 02:04:51,360
can rupture but not from pressure it's
 

6943
02:04:51,360 --> 02:04:52,790
can rupture but not from pressure it's
rather tender not the bone

6944
02:04:52,790 --> 02:04:52,800
rather tender not the bone
 

6945
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:55,990
rather tender not the bone
it's going to break the bone won't break

6946
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,000
it's going to break the bone won't break
 

6947
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,709
it's going to break the bone won't break
i have seen on one occasion a shin bone

6948
02:04:58,709 --> 02:04:58,719
i have seen on one occasion a shin bone
 

6949
02:04:58,719 --> 02:04:59,270
i have seen on one occasion a shin bone
break

6950
02:04:59,270 --> 02:04:59,280
break
 

6951
02:04:59,280 --> 02:05:01,669
break
from an achilles log but there was a

6952
02:05:01,669 --> 02:05:01,679
from an achilles log but there was a
 

6953
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:02,550
from an achilles log but there was a
enormous

6954
02:05:02,550 --> 02:05:02,560
enormous
 

6955
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:05,510
enormous
size and strength disparity and there

6956
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:05,520
size and strength disparity and there
 

6957
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,109
size and strength disparity and there
may have been other complicating factors

6958
02:05:07,109 --> 02:05:07,119
may have been other complicating factors
 

6959
02:05:07,119 --> 02:05:07,830
may have been other complicating factors
too

6960
02:05:07,830 --> 02:05:07,840
too
 

6961
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:11,350
too
um but in the vast majority of cases

6962
02:05:11,350 --> 02:05:11,360
um but in the vast majority of cases
 

6963
02:05:11,360 --> 02:05:13,990
um but in the vast majority of cases
the achilles lock doesn't really do

6964
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000
the achilles lock doesn't really do
 

6965
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:15,750
the achilles lock doesn't really do
tremendous damage it can

6966
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:15,760
tremendous damage it can
 

6967
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:17,350
tremendous damage it can
do significant damage you'll definitely

6968
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
do significant damage you'll definitely
 

6969
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:19,109
do significant damage you'll definitely
feel it the next day but it's

6970
02:05:19,109 --> 02:05:19,119
feel it the next day but it's
 

6971
02:05:19,119 --> 02:05:21,589
feel it the next day but it's
of all the major logs it's the one where

6972
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:21,599
of all the major logs it's the one where
 

6973
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:23,270
of all the major logs it's the one where
it is most likely

6974
02:05:23,270 --> 02:05:23,280
it is most likely
 

6975
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:25,189
it is most likely
a psychologically strong opponent will

6976
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
a psychologically strong opponent will
 

6977
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:26,870
a psychologically strong opponent will
be able to absorb damage and go on to

6978
02:05:26,870 --> 02:05:26,880
be able to absorb damage and go on to
 

6979
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:27,990
be able to absorb damage and go on to
win a match

6980
02:05:27,990 --> 02:05:28,000
win a match
 

6981
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:30,550
win a match

question
 

8349
02:30:52,319 --> 02:30:54,950
question
but it's a fascinating one for me from

02:30:54,950 --> 02:30:54,960
but it's a fascinating one for me from
 

8351
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:56,389
but it's a fascinating one for me from
an engineering and a scientific

problem you can look at chess

8368
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
problem you can look at chess
 

8369
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:20,230
problem you can look at chess
you could look at soccer robocup

8370
02:31:20,230 --> 02:31:20,240

 

8371
02:31:20,240 --> 02:31:22,710

and then you could look at grappling

8372
02:31:22,710 --> 02:31:22,720
and then you could look at grappling
 

8373
02:31:22,720 --> 02:31:24,309
and then you could look at grappling
there's something about when you start

8374
02:31:24,309 --> 02:31:24,319
there's something about when you start
 

8375
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:25,590
there's something about when you start
to think

8376
02:31:25,590 --> 02:31:25,600
to think
 

8377
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:28,790
to think
how would i build an ai system a robot

8378
02:31:28,790 --> 02:31:28,800
how would i build an ai system a robot
 

8379

that defeats
somebody like gordon ryan where it

8382

somebody like gordon ryan where it
 

8383
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:34,309
somebody like gordon ryan where it
forces you to really think

8384
02:31:34,309 --> 02:31:34,319
forces you to really think
 

8385
02:31:34,319 --> 02:31:38,630
forces you to really think
about formalizing this art

8386
02:31:38,630 --> 02:31:38,640
about formalizing this art
 

8387
02:31:38,640 --> 02:31:41,750
about formalizing this art
as a as an engineering discipline in the

8388
02:31:41,750 --> 02:31:41,760
as a as an engineering discipline in the
 

8389
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:41,990
as a as an engineering discipline in the
same

8390
02:31:41,990 --> 02:31:42,000
same
 

8391
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,550
same
way you do but you you you still have

8392
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:44,560
way you do but you you you still have
 

8393
02:31:44,560 --> 02:31:46,469
way you do but you you you still have
some art injected in there

8394
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:46,479
some art injected in there
 

8395
02:31:46,479 --> 02:31:48,230
some art injected in there
there's no space for art when you

8396
02:31:48,230 --> 02:31:48,240
there's no space for art when you
 

8397
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,670
there's no space for art when you
actually have to build the system that's

8398
02:31:49,670 --> 02:31:49,680
actually have to build the system that's
 

8399
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:51,270
actually have to build the system that's
not a ridiculous question that's a

8400
02:31:51,270 --> 02:31:51,280
not a ridiculous question that's a
 

8401
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:52,710
not a ridiculous question that's a
damned interesting question

8402
02:31:52,710 --> 02:31:52,720
damned interesting question
 

8403
02:31:52,720 --> 02:31:55,190
damned interesting question
let's put aside the like like i

8404
02:31:55,190 --> 02:31:55,200
let's put aside the like like i
 

8405
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,190
let's put aside the like like i
mentioned with the boston dynamics spot

8406
02:31:57,190 --> 02:31:57,200
mentioned with the boston dynamics spot
 

8407
02:31:57,200 --> 02:31:57,910
mentioned with the boston dynamics spot
robots

8408
02:31:57,910 --> 02:31:57,920
robots
 

8409
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:00,389
robots
what people don't realize is the amount

8410
02:32:00,389 --> 02:32:00,399
what people don't realize is the amount
 

8411
02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:01,190
what people don't realize is the amount
of power

8412
02:32:01,190 --> 02:32:01,200
of power
 

8413
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:03,270
of power
they can deliver is huge so let's take

8414
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:03,280
they can deliver is huge so let's take
 

8415
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,870
they can deliver is huge so let's take
that weapon aside

8416
02:32:04,870 --> 02:32:04,880
that weapon aside
 

8417
02:32:04,880 --> 02:32:06,950
that weapon aside
just the amount of force you're able to

8418
02:32:06,950 --> 02:32:06,960
just the amount of force you're able to
 

8419
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:08,309
just the amount of force you're able to
deliver yeah yeah

8420
02:32:08,309 --> 02:32:08,319
deliver yeah yeah
 

8421
02:32:08,319 --> 02:32:11,349
deliver yeah yeah
i'm glad you're specifying that um uh

8422
02:32:11,349 --> 02:32:11,359
i'm glad you're specifying that um uh
 

8423
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:14,950
i'm glad you're specifying that um uh
so essentially your question is okay can

8424
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:14,960
so essentially your question is okay can
 

8425
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,870
so essentially your question is okay can
can a talented group of engineers create

8426
02:32:16,870 --> 02:32:16,880
can a talented group of engineers create
 

8427
02:32:16,880 --> 02:32:19,030
can a talented group of engineers create
a robot which could defeat gordon ryan

8428
02:32:19,030 --> 02:32:19,040
a robot which could defeat gordon ryan
 

8429
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:22,550
a robot which could defeat gordon ryan
on the face of it um as you just pointed

8430
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:22,560
on the face of it um as you just pointed
 

8431
02:32:22,560 --> 02:32:23,910
on the face of it um as you just pointed
out that's the easiest project in the

8432
02:32:23,910 --> 02:32:23,920
out that's the easiest project in the
 

8433
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:24,550
out that's the easiest project in the
world

8434
02:32:24,550 --> 02:32:24,560
world
 

8435
02:32:24,560 --> 02:32:26,070
world
just create a robot that carries a nine

8436
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,080
just create a robot that carries a nine
 

8437
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:27,670
just create a robot that carries a nine
millimeter automatic and shoot them five

8438
02:32:27,670 --> 02:32:27,680
millimeter automatic and shoot them five
 

8439
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:28,870
millimeter automatic and shoot them five
times in the chest okay that's that

8440
02:32:28,870 --> 02:32:28,880
times in the chest okay that's that
 

8441
02:32:28,880 --> 02:32:29,990
times in the chest okay that's that
gordon ryan's done

8442
02:32:29,990 --> 02:32:30,000
gordon ryan's done
 

8443
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,590
gordon ryan's done
um so that's not the interesting

8444
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:31,600
um so that's not the interesting
 

8445
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:33,670
um so that's not the interesting
question the interesting question

8446
02:32:33,670 --> 02:32:33,680

02:32:38,960 --> 02:32:42,870
if we had the ability
to create a robot whose physical powers

is you have a giant set of rules

8478
02:33:09,190 --> 02:33:09,200
is you have a giant set of rules
 

8479
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:11,830
is you have a giant set of rules
it's like this tree of rules where you

8480
02:33:11,830 --> 02:33:11,840
it's like this tree of rules where you
 

8481
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:13,270
it's like this tree of rules where you
apply a different condition when there's

8482
02:33:13,270 --> 02:33:13,280
apply a different condition when there's
 

8483
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:14,230
apply a different condition when there's
a pattern you see

8484
02:33:14,230 --> 02:33:14,240
a pattern you see
 

8485
02:33:14,240 --> 02:33:16,469
a pattern you see
you apply a rule and they're hard coded

8486
02:33:16,469 --> 02:33:16,479
you apply a rule and they're hard coded
 

8487
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:18,070
you apply a rule and they're hard coded
in you basically get

8488
02:33:18,070 --> 02:33:18,080
in you basically get
 

8489
02:33:18,080 --> 02:33:20,790

that fully
 

8503
02:33:32,399 --> 02:33:34,630

so you're going to be taking shortcuts

8504
02:33:34,630 --> 02:33:34,640
so you're going to be taking shortcuts

02:34:12,389 --> 02:34:12,399
and then just observe and see which
 

8535
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:13,830

first of all the way machine learning

8544
02:34:22,230 --> 02:34:22,240
first of all the way machine learning
 

8545
02:34:22,240 --> 02:34:23,670
first of all the way machine learning
works is you predict

8546
02:34:23,670 --> 02:34:23,680
works is you predict
 

8547
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:25,670
works is you predict
you see a position or you see a

8548
02:34:25,670 --> 02:34:25,680
you see a position or you see a
 

8549
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:26,710
you see a position or you see a
situation

8550

situation
 

8551
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:28,870
situation
and then you predict how good that is

8552
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:28,880
and then you predict how good that is
 

8553
02:34:28,880 --> 02:34:29,750
and then you predict how good that is
and then you watch

8554
02:34:29,750 --> 02:34:29,760
and then you watch
 

8555
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:32,630
and then you watch
how it actually turns out and if it's uh

8556
02:34:32,630 --> 02:34:32,640
how it actually turns out and if it's uh
 

8557
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,150
how it actually turns out and if it's uh
worse or better you adjust your

02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:39,910
describe gordon ryan to a machine how
many

8612
02:35:39,910 --> 02:35:39,920
many
 

8613
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:42,469
many
rules are in there do you think yeah um

8614
02:35:42,469 --> 02:35:42,479
rules are in there do you think yeah um
 

8615
02:35:42,479 --> 02:35:43,190
rules are in there do you think yeah um
first off

8616
02:35:43,190 --> 02:35:43,200
first off
 

8617
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:44,630
first off
let me tell you that's one of the most

8618
02:35:44,630 --> 02:35:44,640
let me tell you that's one of the most
 

8619
02:35:44,640 --> 02:35:45,990
let me tell you that's one of the most
fascinating questions i've ever been

8620
02:35:45,990 --> 02:35:46,000
fascinating questions i've ever been
 

8621
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:46,389
fascinating questions i've ever been
asked

8622
02:35:46,389 --> 02:35:46,399
asked
 

8623
02:35:46,399 --> 02:35:49,750
asked
and uh i'm tremendously happy to answer

8624
02:35:49,750 --> 02:35:49,760
and uh i'm tremendously happy to answer
 

8625
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:50,309
and uh i'm tremendously happy to answer
this

8626
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
this
 

8627
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:53,270
this
um how about what we do is this is a

8628
02:35:53,270 --> 02:35:53,280
um how about what we do is this is a
 

8629
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:55,270
um how about what we do is this is a
this is a massive question you've asked

8630
02:35:55,270 --> 02:35:55,280
this is a massive question you've asked
 

8631
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:55,830
this is a massive question you've asked
there's a

8632
02:35:55,830 --> 02:35:55,840
there's a
 

8633
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:57,670
there's a
huge amount of ways this could get very

8634
02:35:57,670 --> 02:35:57,680
huge amount of ways this could get very
 

8635
02:35:57,680 --> 02:35:59,429
huge amount of ways this could get very
interesting and very confusing

8636
02:35:59,429 --> 02:35:59,439
interesting and very confusing
 

8637
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:02,309
interesting and very confusing
let's set some ground rules for the

8638
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
let's set some ground rules for the
 

8639
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:03,030
let's set some ground rules for the
discussion

8640
02:36:03,030 --> 02:36:03,040
discussion
 

8641
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:06,870
discussion
um uh lex alluded to

8642
02:36:06,870 --> 02:36:06,880
um uh lex alluded to
 

8643
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:10,309
um uh lex alluded to
the idea of man versus machine and

8644
02:36:10,309 --> 02:36:10,319
the idea of man versus machine and
 

8645
02:36:10,319 --> 02:36:12,309
the idea of man versus machine and
chess okay and i think that's a really

8646
02:36:12,309 --> 02:36:12,319
chess okay and i think that's a really
 

8647
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:13,750
chess okay and i think that's a really
good place for us to start

8648
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:13,760
good place for us to start
 

8649
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:17,429
good place for us to start
the the discussion um i'm going to

8650
02:36:17,429 --> 02:36:17,439
the the discussion um i'm going to
 

8651
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:19,990
the the discussion um i'm going to
uh just tell people about a little bit

8652
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:20,000
uh just tell people about a little bit
 

8653
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:20,790
uh just tell people about a little bit
the history of

8654
02:36:20,790 --> 02:36:20,800
the history of
 

8655
02:36:20,800 --> 02:36:23,110
the history of
man versus chess to give you guys some

8656
02:36:23,110 --> 02:36:23,120
man versus chess to give you guys some
 

8657
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:23,910
man versus chess to give you guys some
uh

8658
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:23,920
uh
 

8659
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,469
uh
some background on this in 1968 there

8660
02:36:26,469 --> 02:36:26,479
some background on this in 1968 there
 

8661
02:36:26,479 --> 02:36:26,950
some background on this in 1968 there
was a

8662
02:36:26,950 --> 02:36:26,960
was a
 

8663
02:36:26,960 --> 02:36:29,750
was a
a party in which a highly ranked not not

8664
02:36:29,750 --> 02:36:29,760
a party in which a highly ranked not not
 

8665
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:31,110
a party in which a highly ranked not not
a world champion but a highly ranked

8666
02:36:31,110 --> 02:36:31,120
a world champion but a highly ranked
 

8667
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:33,190
a world champion but a highly ranked
chess player and his name was levy

8668
02:36:33,190 --> 02:36:33,200
chess player and his name was levy
 

8669
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,550
chess player and his name was levy
and he met a

8670
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:36,560
and he met a
 

8671
02:36:36,560 --> 02:36:40,230
and he met a
a computer engineer at a party

8672
02:36:40,230 --> 02:36:40,240
a computer engineer at a party
 

8673
02:36:40,240 --> 02:36:43,590
a computer engineer at a party
and they had a a

8674
02:36:43,590 --> 02:36:43,600

 

8675
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:46,870

a light-hearted bet that in a 10-year

8676
02:36:46,870 --> 02:36:46,880
a light-hearted bet that in a 10-year
 

8677
02:36:46,880 --> 02:36:48,309
a light-hearted bet that in a 10-year
time frame

8678
02:36:48,309 --> 02:36:48,319
time frame
 

8679
02:36:48,319 --> 02:36:51,750
time frame
a human chess player would be defeated

8680
02:36:51,750 --> 02:36:51,760
a human chess player would be defeated
 

8681
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:54,630
a human chess player would be defeated
by a computer now you gotta remember

8682
02:36:54,630 --> 02:36:54,640
by a computer now you gotta remember
 

8683
02:36:54,640 --> 02:36:56,710
by a computer now you gotta remember
1968 computing power was

8684
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:56,720
1968 computing power was
 

8685
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:58,870
1968 computing power was
very very low the computers that got

8686
02:36:58,870 --> 02:36:58,880
very very low the computers that got
 

8687
02:36:58,880 --> 02:37:01,349
very very low the computers that got
america to the moon were

8688
02:37:01,349 --> 02:37:01,359
america to the moon were
 

8689
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:02,950
america to the moon were
were actually pretty damn primitive your

8690
02:37:02,950 --> 02:37:02,960
were actually pretty damn primitive your
 

8691
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:06,070
were actually pretty damn primitive your
iphone would kick all of their asses

8692
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
iphone would kick all of their asses
 

8693
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:07,990
iphone would kick all of their asses
so computational power was very very low

8694
02:37:07,990 --> 02:37:08,000
so computational power was very very low
 

8695
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:09,349
so computational power was very very low
in those days

8696
02:37:09,349 --> 02:37:09,359
in those days
 

8697
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:12,230
in those days
so interestingly the chess player fully

8698
02:37:12,230 --> 02:37:12,240
so interestingly the chess player fully
 

8699
02:37:12,240 --> 02:37:13,750
so interestingly the chess player fully
believed that no computer could beat

8700
02:37:13,750 --> 02:37:13,760
believed that no computer could beat
 

8701
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:15,270
believed that no computer could beat
them in the 10-year time frame

8702
02:37:15,270 --> 02:37:15,280
them in the 10-year time frame
 

8703
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:17,750
them in the 10-year time frame
and the the computer engineer was very

8704
02:37:17,750 --> 02:37:17,760
and the the computer engineer was very
 

8705
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:19,830
and the the computer engineer was very
optimistic that he was wrong and

8706
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:19,840
optimistic that he was wrong and
 

8707
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:23,429
optimistic that he was wrong and
in fact 10 years uh the computer would

8708
02:37:23,429 --> 02:37:23,439
in fact 10 years uh the computer would
 

8709
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:24,150
in fact 10 years uh the computer would
win

8710
02:37:24,150 --> 02:37:24,160
win
 

8711
02:37:24,160 --> 02:37:26,070
win
10 years later they had a competition

8712
02:37:26,070 --> 02:37:26,080
10 years later they had a competition
 

8713
02:37:26,080 --> 02:37:27,750
10 years later they had a competition
and the human won

8714
02:37:27,750 --> 02:37:27,760
and the human won
 

8715
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:30,790
and the human won
uh decisively in fact so

8716
02:37:30,790 --> 02:37:30,800
uh decisively in fact so
 

8717
02:37:30,800 --> 02:37:33,670
uh decisively in fact so
computational power simply hadn't risen

8718
02:37:33,670 --> 02:37:33,680
computational power simply hadn't risen
 

8719
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:35,270
computational power simply hadn't risen
to that level yet

8720
02:37:35,270 --> 02:37:35,280
to that level yet
 

8721
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:37,750
to that level yet
through the 1980s computational power

8722
02:37:37,750 --> 02:37:37,760
through the 1980s computational power
 

8723
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:38,630
through the 1980s computational power
increased

8724
02:37:38,630 --> 02:37:38,640
increased
 

8725
02:37:38,640 --> 02:37:42,389
increased
but not sufficient to to to get to

8726
02:37:42,389 --> 02:37:42,399
but not sufficient to to to get to
 

8727
02:37:42,399 --> 02:37:43,750
but not sufficient to to to get to
championship level

8728
02:37:43,750 --> 02:37:43,760
championship level
 

8729
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:45,110
championship level
there were computer programs in the

8730
02:37:45,110 --> 02:37:45,120
there were computer programs in the
 

8731
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:48,309
there were computer programs in the
1980s which were competitive with

8732
02:37:48,309 --> 02:37:48,319
1980s which were competitive with
 

8733
02:37:48,319 --> 02:37:50,389
1980s which were competitive with
good solid chess players but not world

8734
02:37:50,389 --> 02:37:50,399
good solid chess players but not world
 

8735
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:54,630
good solid chess players but not world
beaters

8736
02:37:54,630 --> 02:37:54,640

 

8737
02:37:54,640 --> 02:37:57,910

understand right from the start that

8738
02:37:57,910 --> 02:37:57,920
understand right from the start that
 

8739
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:00,469
understand right from the start that
there's a fundamental problem here

8740
02:38:00,469 --> 02:38:00,479
there's a fundamental problem here
 

8741
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:04,150
there's a fundamental problem here
the number of options

8742
02:38:04,150 --> 02:38:04,160
the number of options
 

8743
02:38:04,160 --> 02:38:06,469
the number of options
that the two players in a chess board

8744
02:38:06,469 --> 02:38:06,479
that the two players in a chess board
 

8745
02:38:06,479 --> 02:38:08,389
that the two players in a chess board
can run through

8746
02:38:08,389 --> 02:38:08,399
can run through
 

8747
02:38:08,399 --> 02:38:12,230
can run through
is astronomically high there are 64

8748
02:38:12,230 --> 02:38:12,240
is astronomically high there are 64
 

8749
02:38:12,240 --> 02:38:14,309
is astronomically high there are 64
squares on a chess chessboard

8750
02:38:14,309 --> 02:38:14,319
squares on a chess chessboard
 

8751
02:38:14,319 --> 02:38:18,070
squares on a chess chessboard
the number of possible options that can

8752
02:38:18,070 --> 02:38:18,080
the number of possible options that can
 

8753
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:20,950
the number of possible options that can
could work or could play out on a

8754
02:38:20,950 --> 02:38:20,960
could work or could play out on a

chessboard
 

8757
02:38:22,240 --> 02:38:24,070
chessboard
and this is a truly shocking thing for

8758
02:38:24,070 --> 02:38:24,080
and this is a truly shocking thing for
 

8759
02:38:24,080 --> 02:38:25,830
and this is a truly shocking thing for
you to think about

8760
02:38:25,830 --> 02:38:25,840
you to think about
 

8761
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,270
you to think about
the number of possible options is higher

8762
02:38:29,270 --> 02:38:29,280
the number of possible options is higher
 

8763
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:33,030
the number of possible options is higher
than the number of atoms in the known

8764
02:38:33,030 --> 02:38:33,040
than the number of atoms in the known
 

8765
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:36,070
than the number of atoms in the known
universe think about that for a second

8766
02:38:36,070 --> 02:38:36,080
universe think about that for a second
 

8767
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:38,790
universe think about that for a second
in terms of complexity okay the number

8768
02:38:38,790 --> 02:38:38,800
in terms of complexity okay the number
 

8769
02:38:38,800 --> 02:38:39,990
in terms of complexity okay the number
of atoms on this

8770
02:38:39,990 --> 02:38:40,000
of atoms on this
 

8771
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:43,349
of atoms on this
table is massive

8772
02:38:43,349 --> 02:38:43,359
table is massive
 

8773
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:46,630
table is massive
okay that is an unbelievably large

8774
02:38:46,630 --> 02:38:46,640
okay that is an unbelievably large
 

8775
02:38:46,640 --> 02:38:48,309
okay that is an unbelievably large
number

8776
02:38:48,309 --> 02:38:48,319
number
 

8777
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:49,750
number
then we're talking about a situation

8778
02:38:49,750 --> 02:38:49,760
then we're talking about a situation
 

8779
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:51,910
then we're talking about a situation
where if a computer had to go through

8780
02:38:51,910 --> 02:38:51,920
where if a computer had to go through
 

8781
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:53,750
where if a computer had to go through
all the options at the onset of a match

8782
02:38:53,750 --> 02:38:53,760
all the options at the onset of a match
 

8783
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:55,270
all the options at the onset of a match
they would have to

8784
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:55,280
they would have to
 

8785
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,469
they would have to
run numbers greater than the number of

8786
02:38:58,469 --> 02:38:58,479
run numbers greater than the number of
 

8787
02:38:58,479 --> 02:39:00,710
run numbers greater than the number of
atoms in the known universe the number

8788
02:39:00,710 --> 02:39:00,720
atoms in the known universe the number
 

8789
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:03,190
atoms in the known universe the number
of galaxies and the number of

8790
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:03,200
of galaxies and the number of
 

8791
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:05,590
of galaxies and the number of
in our universe is vast okay it's

8792
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:05,600
in our universe is vast okay it's
 

8793
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,429
in our universe is vast okay it's
measured in the billions like the number

8794
02:39:07,429 --> 02:39:07,439
measured in the billions like the number
 

8795
02:39:07,439 --> 02:39:09,110
measured in the billions like the number
of atoms that's just

8796
02:39:09,110 --> 02:39:09,120
of atoms that's just
 

8797
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:11,030
of atoms that's just
a number so mind blown it's impossible

8798
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,040
a number so mind blown it's impossible
 

8799
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,990
a number so mind blown it's impossible
okay so

8800
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:14,000
okay so
 

8801
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:17,030
okay so
no computer is ever going to be able to

8802
02:39:17,030 --> 02:39:17,040
no computer is ever going to be able to
 

8803
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:18,630
no computer is ever going to be able to
work with those kinds of numbers

8804
02:39:18,630 --> 02:39:18,640
work with those kinds of numbers
 

8805
02:39:18,640 --> 02:39:20,790
work with those kinds of numbers
okay you that i don't even know if

8806
02:39:20,790 --> 02:39:20,800
okay you that i don't even know if
 

8807
02:39:20,800 --> 02:39:22,550
okay you that i don't even know if
future generations of quantum computers

8808
02:39:22,550 --> 02:39:22,560
future generations of quantum computers
 

8809
02:39:22,560 --> 02:39:24,070
future generations of quantum computers
could could work it with those kind of

8810
02:39:24,070 --> 02:39:24,080
could could work it with those kind of
 

8811
02:39:24,080 --> 02:39:25,429
could could work it with those kind of
numbers so that's the fundamental

8812
02:39:25,429 --> 02:39:25,439
numbers so that's the fundamental
 

8813
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:27,750
numbers so that's the fundamental
problem okay the number of options in a

8814
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:27,760
problem okay the number of options in a
 

8815
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,750
problem okay the number of options in a
in a chess match is just so

8816
02:39:29,750 --> 02:39:29,760
in a chess match is just so
 

8817
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:32,469
in a chess match is just so
astronomically large that no computer

8818
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
astronomically large that no computer
 

8819
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:33,670
astronomically large that no computer
could ever

8820
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:33,680
could ever
 

8821
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:36,150
could ever
figure out all the the available options

8822
02:39:36,150 --> 02:39:36,160
figure out all the the available options
 

8823
02:39:36,160 --> 02:39:37,830
figure out all the the available options
and make decisions in a given time frame

8824
02:39:37,830 --> 02:39:37,840
and make decisions in a given time frame
 

8825
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:38,389
and make decisions in a given time frame
so that's

8826
02:39:38,389 --> 02:39:38,399
so that's
 

8827
02:39:38,399 --> 02:39:41,510
so that's
the fundamental problem so as lex

8828
02:39:41,510 --> 02:39:41,520
the fundamental problem so as lex
 

8829
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:43,990
the fundamental problem so as lex
correctly pointed out the way you get

8830
02:39:43,990 --> 02:39:44,000
correctly pointed out the way you get
 

8831
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:44,710
correctly pointed out the way you get
around this

8832
02:39:44,710 --> 02:39:44,720
around this
 

8833
02:39:44,720 --> 02:39:47,190
around this
is by the use of heuristics these are

8834
02:39:47,190 --> 02:39:47,200
is by the use of heuristics these are
 

8835
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:48,870
is by the use of heuristics these are
rules of thumb

8836
02:39:48,870 --> 02:39:48,880
rules of thumb
 

8837
02:39:48,880 --> 02:39:51,590
rules of thumb
which give general guidelines to action

8838
02:39:51,590 --> 02:39:51,600
which give general guidelines to action
 

8839
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:53,349
which give general guidelines to action
so for example in jiu-jitsu i could give

8840
02:39:53,349 --> 02:39:53,359
so for example in jiu-jitsu i could give
 

8841
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:54,790
so for example in jiu-jitsu i could give
you a general rule of thumb

8842
02:39:54,790 --> 02:39:54,800
you a general rule of thumb
 

8843
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:57,590
you a general rule of thumb
uh don't turn your back on your opponent

8844
02:39:57,590 --> 02:39:57,600
uh don't turn your back on your opponent
 

8845
02:39:57,600 --> 02:39:59,190
uh don't turn your back on your opponent
okay that's a solid piece of advice

8846
02:39:59,190 --> 02:39:59,200
okay that's a solid piece of advice
 

8847
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:00,550
okay that's a solid piece of advice
there are obviously some exceptions to

8848
02:40:00,550 --> 02:40:00,560
there are obviously some exceptions to
 

8849
02:40:00,560 --> 02:40:01,190
there are obviously some exceptions to
that rule

8850
02:40:01,190 --> 02:40:01,200
that rule
 

8851
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:02,950
that rule
but it's a good solid piece of advice to

8852
02:40:02,950 --> 02:40:02,960
but it's a good solid piece of advice to
 

8853
02:40:02,960 --> 02:40:04,950
but it's a good solid piece of advice to
give a beginner the moment you give that

8854
02:40:04,950 --> 02:40:04,960
give a beginner the moment you give that
 

8855
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:06,389
give a beginner the moment you give that
heuristic rule

8856
02:40:06,389 --> 02:40:06,399
heuristic rule
 

8857
02:40:06,399 --> 02:40:09,190
heuristic rule
you rule out a lot of options okay

8858
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,200
you rule out a lot of options okay
 

8859
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:10,870
you rule out a lot of options okay
you've already told someone don't turn

8860
02:40:10,870 --> 02:40:10,880
you've already told someone don't turn
 

8861
02:40:10,880 --> 02:40:11,910
you've already told someone don't turn
your back don't turn your back on

8862
02:40:11,910 --> 02:40:11,920
your back don't turn your back on
 

8863
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:12,469
your back don't turn your back on
someone

8864
02:40:12,469 --> 02:40:12,479
someone
 

8865
02:40:12,479 --> 02:40:14,790
someone
so a lot of possibilities have just been

8866
02:40:14,790 --> 02:40:14,800
so a lot of possibilities have just been
 

8867
02:40:14,800 --> 02:40:16,150
so a lot of possibilities have just been
turned away right there

8868
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:16,160
turned away right there
 

8869
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:17,590
turned away right there
so you've cut the number of options in

8870
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
so you've cut the number of options in
 

8871
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,429
so you've cut the number of options in
half right there just by giving one

8872
02:40:19,429 --> 02:40:19,439
half right there just by giving one
 

8873
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:19,990
half right there just by giving one
heuristic

8874
02:40:19,990 --> 02:40:20,000
heuristic
 

8875
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:23,590
heuristic
rule okay if you

8876
02:40:23,590 --> 02:40:23,600
rule okay if you
 

8877
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:25,750
rule okay if you
were decent at j it's not great but

8878
02:40:25,750 --> 02:40:25,760
were decent at j it's not great but
 

8879
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:28,389
were decent at j it's not great but
decent and you knew enough to give say

8880
02:40:28,389 --> 02:40:28,399
decent and you knew enough to give say
 

8881
02:40:28,399 --> 02:40:31,510
decent and you knew enough to give say
10 heuristic rules you could chop

8882
02:40:31,510 --> 02:40:31,520
10 heuristic rules you could chop
 

8883
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:33,750
10 heuristic rules you could chop
that initially vast number of options

8884
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:33,760
that initially vast number of options
 

8885
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:34,710
that initially vast number of options
down

8886
02:40:34,710 --> 02:40:34,720
down
 

8887
02:40:34,720 --> 02:40:37,429
down
by a vast amount and now you're starting

8888
02:40:37,429 --> 02:40:37,439
by a vast amount and now you're starting
 

8889
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:38,950
by a vast amount and now you're starting
to get to a point where if the computer

8890
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:38,960
to get to a point where if the computer
 

8891
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:40,230
to get to a point where if the computer
had sufficient

8892
02:40:40,230 --> 02:40:40,240
had sufficient
 

8893
02:40:40,240 --> 02:40:42,389
had sufficient
computational power it could start

8894
02:40:42,389 --> 02:40:42,399
computational power it could start
 

8895
02:40:42,399 --> 02:40:43,429
computational power it could start
getting through

8896
02:40:43,429 --> 02:40:43,439
getting through
 

8897
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:45,990
getting through
the number of options in that acceptable

8898
02:40:45,990 --> 02:40:46,000
the number of options in that acceptable
 

8899
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,190
the number of options in that acceptable
time frame so that's

8900
02:40:47,190 --> 02:40:47,200
time frame so that's
 

8901
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:50,309
time frame so that's
the general pattern of the development

8902
02:40:50,309 --> 02:40:50,319
the general pattern of the development
 

8903
02:40:50,319 --> 02:40:51,510
the general pattern of the development
now things started getting very

now things started getting very
 

8905
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:54,309
now things started getting very

02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:27,830
deep blue lost the first confrontation i
believe in 1996 it was competitive but

8936
02:41:27,830 --> 02:41:27,840
believe in 1996 it was competitive but
 

8937
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:28,469
believe in 1996 it was competitive but
lost

8938
02:41:28,469 --> 02:41:28,479
lost
 

8939
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:32,230
lost
then in 1997 uh deep blue

8940
02:41:32,230 --> 02:41:32,240
then in 1997 uh deep blue
 

8941
02:41:32,240 --> 02:41:35,510
then in 1997 uh deep blue
won and it wasn't a complete walkover

8942
02:41:35,510 --> 02:41:35,520
won and it wasn't a complete walkover
 

8943
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:37,030
won and it wasn't a complete walkover
kasparov i believe won one of the

8944
02:41:37,030 --> 02:41:37,040
kasparov i believe won one of the
 

8945
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:38,870
kasparov i believe won one of the
matches but uh

8946
02:41:38,870 --> 02:41:38,880
matches but uh
 

8947
02:41:38,880 --> 02:41:41,990
matches but uh
they did unequiv er deeply unequivocally

8948
02:41:41,990 --> 02:41:42,000
they did unequiv er deeply unequivocally
 

8949
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:43,349
they did unequiv er deeply unequivocally
won the confrontation

8950
02:41:43,349 --> 02:41:43,359
won the confrontation
 

8951
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:45,110
won the confrontation
and it was seen as like this watershed

8952
02:41:45,110 --> 02:41:45,120
and it was seen as like this watershed
 

8953
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:46,950
and it was seen as like this watershed
moment where

8954
02:41:46,950 --> 02:41:46,960
moment where
 

8955
02:41:46,960 --> 02:41:49,510
moment where
a computer beat the best human chess

8956
02:41:49,510 --> 02:41:49,520
a computer beat the best human chess
 

8957
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:50,790
a computer beat the best human chess
player on the planet

8958
02:41:50,790 --> 02:41:50,800
player on the planet
 

8959
02:41:50,800 --> 02:41:52,550
player on the planet
and that was it there was there's no

8960
02:41:52,550 --> 02:41:52,560
and that was it there was there's no
 

8961
02:41:52,560 --> 02:41:54,389
and that was it there was there's no
coming back from that

8962
02:41:54,389 --> 02:41:54,399
coming back from that
 

8963
02:41:54,399 --> 02:41:56,550
coming back from that
i think it would be remembered as one of

8964
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:56,560
i think it would be remembered as one of
 

8965
02:41:56,560 --> 02:41:57,990
i think it would be remembered as one of
the biggest moments in computing

8966
02:41:57,990 --> 02:41:58,000
the biggest moments in computing
 

8967
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,710
the biggest moments in computing
history is is really when the first time

8968
02:42:00,710 --> 02:42:00,720
history is is really when the first time
 

8969
02:42:00,720 --> 02:42:02,550
history is is really when the first time
a machine beat a human at a thing that

8970
02:42:02,550 --> 02:42:02,560
a machine beat a human at a thing that
 

8971
02:42:02,560 --> 02:42:03,990
a machine beat a human at a thing that
humans really care about

8972
02:42:03,990 --> 02:42:04,000
humans really care about
 

8973
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:05,830
humans really care about
in the in the domain of intellectual

8974
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:05,840
in the in the domain of intellectual
 

8975
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:07,990
in the in the domain of intellectual
pursuits yeah it was it was a

8976
02:42:07,990 --> 02:42:08,000
pursuits yeah it was it was a
 

8977
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:11,670
pursuits yeah it was it was a
it was a powerful powerful moment now

8978
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
it was a powerful powerful moment now
 

8979
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,750
it was a powerful powerful moment now
not only was that a powerful moment but

8980
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:13,760
not only was that a powerful moment but
 

8981
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:15,590
not only was that a powerful moment but
things started getting truly interesting

8982
02:42:15,590 --> 02:42:15,600
things started getting truly interesting
 

8983
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:16,950
things started getting truly interesting
from that moment forward

8984
02:42:16,950 --> 02:42:16,960
from that moment forward
 

8985
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:17,990
from that moment forward
because then you started having

8986
02:42:17,990 --> 02:42:18,000
because then you started having
 

8987
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:25,670
because then you started having
different areas of development

8988
02:42:25,670 --> 02:42:25,680

 

8989
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:28,710

the general way in which

8990
02:42:28,710 --> 02:42:28,720
the general way in which
 

8991
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:31,349
the general way in which
the progress is made from those early

8992
02:42:31,349 --> 02:42:31,359
the progress is made from those early
 

8993
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:34,230
the progress is made from those early
starts in 1968

8994
02:42:34,230 --> 02:42:34,240
starts in 1968
 

8995
02:42:34,240 --> 02:42:35,750
starts in 1968
all the way through to deep blues

8996
02:42:35,750 --> 02:42:35,760
all the way through to deep blues
 

8997
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:37,349
all the way through to deep blues
victory was

8998
02:42:37,349 --> 02:42:37,359
victory was
 

8999
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:39,590
victory was
of the use of heuristic rules that

9000
02:42:39,590 --> 02:42:39,600
of the use of heuristic rules that
 

9001
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:40,790
of the use of heuristic rules that
brought down

9002
02:42:40,790 --> 02:42:40,800
brought down
 

9003
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:43,110
brought down
the number of potential options to a

9004
02:42:43,110 --> 02:42:43,120
the number of potential options to a
 

9005
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:44,230
the number of potential options to a
manageable level

9006
02:42:44,230 --> 02:42:44,240
manageable level
 

9007
02:42:44,240 --> 02:42:46,710
manageable level
as computer power increased then it

9008
02:42:46,710 --> 02:42:46,720
as computer power increased then it
 

9009
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:47,269
as computer power increased then it
could make

9010
02:42:47,269 --> 02:42:47,279
could make
 

9011
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:49,269
could make
faster and faster and wiser and wiser

9012
02:42:49,269 --> 02:42:49,279
faster and faster and wiser and wiser
 

9013
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:51,030
faster and faster and wiser and wiser
decisions and

9014
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,040
decisions and
 

9015
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,870
decisions and
make them at a rate which no human even

9016
02:42:52,870 --> 02:42:52,880
make them at a rate which no human even
 

9017
02:42:52,880 --> 02:42:54,550
make them at a rate which no human even
the best human could keep up with so

9018
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:54,560
the best human could keep up with so
 

9019
02:42:54,560 --> 02:42:55,990
the best human could keep up with so
that was the general

9020
02:42:55,990 --> 02:42:56,000
that was the general
 

9021
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:59,110
that was the general
way in which the the debate went

9022
02:42:59,110 --> 02:42:59,120
way in which the the debate went
 

9023
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:02,389
way in which the the debate went
um but things got more interesting

9024
02:43:02,389 --> 02:43:02,399
um but things got more interesting
 

9025
02:43:02,399 --> 02:43:06,469
um but things got more interesting
after this with the advent of

9026
02:43:06,469 --> 02:43:06,479
after this with the advent of
 

9027
02:43:06,479 --> 02:43:08,550
after this with the advent of
computers that as you pointed out make

02:43:08,550 --> 02:43:08,560
computers that as you pointed out make
 

9029
02:43:08,560 --> 02:43:12,870
computers that as you pointed out make
use of so-called machine learning

9031
02:43:12,880 --> 02:43:16,389

there were a company put out

02:43:16,389 --> 02:43:16,399
there were a company put out
 

9033
02:43:16,399 --> 02:43:20,230
there were a company put out
uh a program alpha zero

9034
02:43:20,230 --> 02:43:20,240
uh a program alpha zero
 

9035
02:43:20,240 --> 02:43:23,750
uh a program alpha zero
which can look at the basic rule

9036
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:23,760
which can look at the basic rule
 

9037

not only did uh
 

9055
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:46,790
not only did uh
this company create alpha zero and there

9056
02:43:46,790 --> 02:43:46,800
this company create alpha zero and there
 

9057
02:43:46,800 --> 02:43:48,070
this company create alpha zero and there
were some other ones too that they

were some other ones too that they
 

9059
02:43:48,080 --> 02:43:49,990
were some other ones too that they
fought not only in chess but in the much

could we take gordon ryan and put
 

9267
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:54,950
could we take gordon ryan and put
a chip inside his brain that created the

a chip inside his brain that created the
 

9269
02:47:54,960 --> 02:47:57,349
a chip inside his brain that created the
same cyborg effect as we saw in centaur

where suddenly his computational powers
were massively increased he still has

so one is there's the neural link way

9326
02:48:58,309 --> 02:48:58,319
so one is there's the neural link way
 

9327
02:48:58,319 --> 02:49:01,750
so one is there's the neural link way
which is basically

9328
02:49:01,750 --> 02:49:01,760
which is basically
 

9329
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,309
which is basically
say doing what you're suggesting which

9330
02:49:04,309 --> 02:49:04,319
say doing what you're suggesting which
 

9331
02:49:04,319 --> 02:49:04,790
say doing what you're suggesting which
is

9332
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:04,800
is
 

9333
02:49:04,800 --> 02:49:06,950
is
expanding the computational capabilities

9334
02:49:06,950 --> 02:49:06,960
expanding the computational capabilities
 

9335
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:09,910
expanding the computational capabilities
of gordon ryan's brain

9336
02:49:09,910 --> 02:49:09,920
of gordon ryan's brain
 

9337
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:11,670
of gordon ryan's brain
like directly being able to communicate

9338
02:49:11,670 --> 02:49:11,680
like directly being able to communicate
 

9339
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:13,590
like directly being able to communicate
between a computer and the brain

9340
02:49:13,590 --> 02:49:13,600
between a computer and the brain
 

9341
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:16,950
between a computer and the brain
so most of you preserve

9342
02:49:16,950 --> 02:49:16,960
so most of you preserve
 

9343
02:49:16,960 --> 02:49:19,830
so most of you preserve
uh most of what there is in the human

9344

just as um great chess players from the
 

9375
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:55,830
just as um great chess players from the
past used to go back into old

nowadays most people
 

9383
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:03,910
nowadays most people
when they want to study the most perfect

9384
02:50:03,910 --> 02:50:03,920
when they want to study the most perfect
 

9385
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:05,429
when they want to study the most perfect
games they actually study

9386
02:50:05,429 --> 02:50:05,439
games they actually study
 

9387
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:07,670
games they actually study
programs like alpha zero yeah and it's

9388
02:50:07,670 --> 02:50:07,680
programs like alpha zero yeah and it's
 

9389
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:09,750
programs like alpha zero yeah and it's
not just for inspiration it's education

9390
02:50:09,750 --> 02:50:09,760
not just for inspiration it's education
 

9391
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:10,550
not just for inspiration it's education
it's i mean it's

9392
02:50:10,550 --> 02:50:10,560
it's i mean it's
 

9393
02:50:10,560 --> 02:50:11,990
it's i mean it's
literally part of their training right

9394
02:50:11,990 --> 02:50:12,000
literally part of their training right
 

9395
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,150
literally part of their training right
yeah this isn't like a fun

9396
02:50:14,150 --> 02:50:14,160
yeah this isn't like a fun
 

9397
02:50:14,160 --> 02:50:16,630
yeah this isn't like a fun
side thing it's just the main way to get

9398
02:50:16,630 --> 02:50:16,640
side thing it's just the main way to get
 

9399
02:50:16,640 --> 02:50:18,150
side thing it's just the main way to get
better

9400
02:50:18,150 --> 02:50:18,160
better
 

9401
02:50:18,160 --> 02:50:21,269

02:50:46,160 --> 02:50:48,309
machines can learn how they grapple
there's there's quite a bit of

9428
02:50:48,309 --> 02:50:48,319
there's there's quite a bit of
 

9429
02:50:48,319 --> 02:50:51,510
there's there's quite a bit of
that already open ai has the system of

9430
02:50:51,510 --> 02:50:51,520
that already open ai has the system of
 

9431
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:51,830
that already open ai has the system of
uh

9432
02:50:51,830 --> 02:50:51,840
uh
 

9433
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:53,750
uh
there's like sumo wrestlers with some

9434
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:53,760
there's like sumo wrestlers with some
 

9435
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:56,070
there's like sumo wrestlers with some
basic goals of pushing each other off of

02:50:56,070 --> 02:50:56,080
basic goals of pushing each other off of

a
 

9439
02:50:56,399 --> 02:50:59,349
a
platform and you know nothing from the

9440
02:50:59,349 --> 02:50:59,359
platform and you know nothing from the
 

9441
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:00,870
platform and you know nothing from the
you don't even know

9442
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:00,880
you don't even know
 

9443
02:51:00,880 --> 02:51:03,830
you don't even know
so you have a basic model of a bipedal

9444
02:51:03,830 --> 02:51:03,840
so you have a basic model of a bipedal
 

9445
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:04,630
so you have a basic model of a bipedal
system

9446
02:51:04,630 --> 02:51:04,640
system
 

9447
02:51:04,640 --> 02:51:05,990
system
it doesn't even know in the beginning

9448
02:51:05,990 --> 02:51:06,000
it doesn't even know in the beginning

how to stand up it just falls

9450
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:08,240
how to stand up it just falls
 

9451
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:10,790
how to stand up it just falls
right so it has to learn how to get up

9452
02:51:10,790 --> 02:51:10,800
right so it has to learn how to get up
 

9453
02:51:10,800 --> 02:51:12,950
right so it has to learn how to get up
and they do that through self play

9454
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:12,960
and they do that through self play
 

9455
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:14,870
and they do that through self play
they they learn how to get up they learn

9456
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:14,880
they they learn how to get up they learn
 

9457
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:16,630
they they learn how to get up they learn
how to move enough to

9458
02:51:16,630 --> 02:51:16,640
how to move enough to
 

9459
02:51:16,640 --> 02:51:18,790
how to move enough to
achieve the final goal which is to push

9460
02:51:18,790 --> 02:51:18,800
achieve the final goal which is to push
 

9461
02:51:18,800 --> 02:51:20,309
achieve the final goal which is to push
your opponent off of the thing

9462
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:20,319
your opponent off of the thing
 

9463
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:23,030

grappling event in the physical space
 

9577
02:53:12,560 --> 02:53:14,469
grappling event in the physical space
i've been very surprised and a little

9578
02:53:14,469 --> 02:53:14,479
i've been very surprised and a little
 

9579
02:53:14,479 --> 02:53:16,870
i've been very surprised and a little
bit disappointed by how difficult

9580
02:53:16,870 --> 02:53:16,880
bit disappointed by how difficult
 

9581
02:53:16,880 --> 02:53:20,790
bit disappointed by how difficult
it's to build

9582
02:53:20,790 --> 02:53:20,800

 

9583
02:53:20,800 --> 02:53:24,790

a system that's able to

9584
02:53:24,790 --> 02:53:24,800
a system that's able to
 

9585
02:53:24,800 --> 02:53:26,870
a system that's able to
have the body of gordon ryan or a human

9586
02:53:26,870 --> 02:53:26,880
have the body of gordon ryan or a human
 

9587
02:53:26,880 --> 02:53:28,870
have the body of gordon ryan or a human
being actually

9588
02:53:28,870 --> 02:53:28,880
being actually
 

9589
02:53:28,880 --> 02:53:31,030

the process of picking up a cup
 

9621
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:04,630
the process of picking up a cup
is very similar to the process of

02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:24,870
going to be
very difficult to build a system that's

yeah if um if picking up a cup is
 

9651
02:54:34,319 --> 02:54:36,070
yeah if um if picking up a cup is
a seemingly insurmountable challenge

02:54:36,070 --> 02:54:36,080
a seemingly insurmountable challenge
 

9653
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:38,309
a seemingly insurmountable challenge

02:54:42,710 --> 02:54:42,720
that's going to be one hell of a project
 

9659
02:54:42,720 --> 02:54:44,950
that's going to be one hell of a project
exactly i mean there could be shortcuts

02:54:44,950 --> 02:54:44,960
exactly i mean there could be shortcuts
 

9661
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:46,830
exactly i mean there could be shortcuts
but i mean currently that's

9662
02:54:46,830 --> 02:54:46,840
but i mean currently that's
 

9663
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:49,990

02:54:49,990 --> 02:54:50,000
um that's that's the field called uh
 

9665
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,070
um that's that's the field called uh
robotic manipulation which is picking up

objects
 

9669
02:54:52,720 --> 02:54:54,150
objects
usually they have like a ball and a

02:54:54,150 --> 02:54:54,160
usually they have like a ball and a
 

9671
02:54:54,160 --> 02:54:56,550
usually they have like a ball and a
triangular object and your whole task is

9672
02:54:56,550 --> 02:54:56,560
triangular object and your whole task is
 

9673
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:58,309
triangular object and your whole task is
to like pick it up and

9674
02:54:58,309 --> 02:54:58,319
to like pick it up and
 

9675
02:54:58,319 --> 02:55:01,190
to like pick it up and
move it around generalizing that to the

9676
02:55:01,190 --> 02:55:01,200
move it around generalizing that to the
 

9677
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:02,469
move it around generalizing that to the
human body

9678
02:55:02,469 --> 02:55:02,479
human body
 

9679
02:55:02,479 --> 02:55:05,590
human body
is harder but

9680
02:55:05,590 --> 02:55:05,600
is harder but
 

9681
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:08,230
is harder but
perhaps not so so not as hard as we

9682
02:55:08,230 --> 02:55:08,240
perhaps not so so not as hard as we
 

9683
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:09,030
perhaps not so so not as hard as we
might think

9684
02:55:09,030 --> 02:55:09,040
might think
 

9685
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:10,710
might think
the question is how do you construct

9686
02:55:10,710 --> 02:55:10,720
the question is how do you construct
 

9687
02:55:10,720 --> 02:55:13,349
the question is how do you construct
experiments where you can do that safely

9688
02:55:13,349 --> 02:55:13,359
experiments where you can do that safely
 

9689
02:55:13,359 --> 02:55:16,469
experiments where you can do that safely
and chase that's very easy but here

9690
02:55:16,469 --> 02:55:16,479
and chase that's very easy but here
 

9691
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:22,309
and chase that's very easy but here
it's very very problematic um

9692
02:55:22,309 --> 02:55:22,319

 

9693
02:55:22,319 --> 02:55:23,910

i guess you could just have robot versus

9694
02:55:23,910 --> 02:55:23,920
i guess you could just have robot versus
 

9695
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:25,750
i guess you could just have robot versus

robot
 

9697
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:27,190
robot
teamed up with each other and then they

9698
02:55:27,190 --> 02:55:27,200
teamed up with each other and then they
 

9699
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:28,469
teamed up with each other and then they
learn and they're about to take on a

learn and they're about to take on a
 

9701
02:55:28,479 --> 02:55:29,349

human opponent
 

9703
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:31,910

yes exactly so you have two physical

9704
02:55:31,910 --> 02:55:31,920
yes exactly so you have two physical
 

9705
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:33,190
yes exactly so you have two physical
robots

9706

robots
 

9707
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:35,590
robots
that interact with each other everything

02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:35,600
that interact with each other everything
 

9709
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:37,750
that interact with each other everything
you've said so far suggests that

9710
02:55:37,750 --> 02:55:37,760
you've said so far suggests that
 

9711
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:39,590
you've said so far suggests that
many of the problems these tactical

9712
02:55:39,590 --> 02:55:39,600
many of the problems these tactical
 

9713
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:43,510
many of the problems these tactical
elements they're easy tasks for humans

9714
02:55:43,510 --> 02:55:43,520
elements they're easy tasks for humans
 

9715
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:45,510
elements they're easy tasks for humans
so which becomes more powerful more

9716
02:55:45,510 --> 02:55:45,520
so which becomes more powerful more
 

9717
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:47,110
so which becomes more powerful more
quickly

9718
02:55:47,110 --> 02:55:47,120

a cyborg gordon ryan or an artificial

9730
02:56:01,510 --> 02:56:01,520
a cyborg gordon ryan or an artificial
 

9731
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:04,550
a cyborg gordon ryan or an artificial
robot gordon ryan really really strong

9732

robot gordon ryan really really strong
 

9733
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:05,110
robot gordon ryan really really strong
question

9734
02:56:05,110 --> 02:56:05,120
question
 

9735
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:08,950
question
and i think i think by far the cyborg

9736
02:56:08,950 --> 02:56:08,960
and i think i think by far the cyborg
 

9737
02:56:08,960 --> 02:56:10,389
and i think i think by far the cyborg
gordon ryan yeah that's what i'm

9738
02:56:10,389 --> 02:56:10,399
gordon ryan yeah that's what i'm
 

9739
02:56:10,399 --> 02:56:11,190
gordon ryan yeah that's what i'm
thinking here

9740
02:56:11,190 --> 02:56:11,200
thinking here
 

9741
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:14,230
thinking here
the problems you're talking about uh

9742
02:56:14,230 --> 02:56:14,240
the problems you're talking about uh
 

9743
02:56:14,240 --> 02:56:15,510
the problems you're talking about uh
with regards to the robots those are

9744
02:56:15,510 --> 02:56:15,520
with regards to the robots those are
 

9745
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:17,269
with regards to the robots those are
those are deep problems like if

9746
02:56:17,269 --> 02:56:17,279
those are deep problems like if
 

9747
02:56:17,279 --> 02:56:20,150
those are deep problems like if
if picking up a cup is problematic it's

if picking up a cup is problematic it's
 

9749
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:20,710
if picking up a cup is problematic it's
gonna be

9750
02:56:20,710 --> 02:56:20,720
gonna be
 

9751
02:56:20,720 --> 02:56:23,030
gonna be
damn difficult to but to a human let's

9752

what humans don't have that machines

9780
02:56:47,590 --> 02:56:47,600
what humans don't have that machines
 

9781
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:49,990
what humans don't have that machines
have is

9782
02:56:49,990 --> 02:56:50,000
have is
 

9783
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:52,070
have is
incredible computational power and

9784
02:56:52,070 --> 02:56:52,080
incredible computational power and

9787
02:56:54,319 --> 02:56:56,309
access to infinite knowledge
computers can do that so if if you have

02:56:56,309 --> 02:56:56,319
computers can do that so if if you have
 

9789
02:56:56,319 --> 02:56:57,990
computers can do that so if if you have
a gordon rhine with the infinite

02:57:02,389 --> 02:57:02,399
that's just going to because we know how
 

9795
02:57:02,399 --> 02:57:03,590
that's just going to because we know how
to do that

9796
02:57:03,590 --> 02:57:03,600
to do that
 

9797
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:06,469
to do that
that that's going to blow out of the

9798
02:57:06,469 --> 02:57:06,479
that that's going to blow out of the
 

9799
02:57:06,479 --> 02:57:08,550
that that's going to blow out of the
water

9800

cyborg
 

9805
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:15,269
cyborg
or centaur chess there was some debate

9806
02:57:15,269 --> 02:57:15,279
or centaur chess there was some debate
 

9807
02:57:15,279 --> 02:57:16,870
or centaur chess there was some debate
as to whether or not

9808
02:57:16,870 --> 02:57:16,880
as to whether or not
 

9809
02:57:16,880 --> 02:57:20,630
as to whether or not
um cyborg chess teams

9810
02:57:20,630 --> 02:57:20,640
um cyborg chess teams
 

9811
02:57:20,640 --> 02:57:24,150
um cyborg chess teams
could stay competitive with the uh the

9812
02:57:24,150 --> 02:57:24,160
could stay competitive with the uh the
 

9813
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:24,790
could stay competitive with the uh the
latest

9814
02:57:24,790 --> 02:57:24,800
latest
 

9815
02:57:24,800 --> 02:57:26,550
latest
machine learning has there been any

9816
02:57:26,550 --> 02:57:26,560
machine learning has there been any
 

9817
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:28,309
machine learning has there been any
update on that yeah i believe at this

9818
02:57:28,309 --> 02:57:28,319
update on that yeah i believe at this
 

9819
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:28,790
update on that yeah i believe at this
point

9820
02:57:28,790 --> 02:57:28,800
point
 

9821
02:57:28,800 --> 02:57:32,469
point
machines dominate over the

9822
02:57:32,469 --> 02:57:32,479
machines dominate over the
 

9823
02:57:32,479 --> 02:57:35,990
machines dominate over the
machine human pairs with the human pairs

9824
02:57:35,990 --> 02:57:36,000
machine human pairs with the human pairs
 

9825
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,309
machine human pairs with the human pairs
when they first came out they were good

9826
02:57:38,309 --> 02:57:38,319
when they first came out they were good
 

9827
02:57:38,319 --> 02:57:39,510
when they first came out they were good
chess players

9828
02:57:39,510 --> 02:57:39,520
chess players
 

9829
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:42,150
chess players
but not great chess players does it make

9830
02:57:42,150 --> 02:57:42,160
but not great chess players does it make
 

9831
02:57:42,160 --> 02:57:43,830
but not great chess players does it make
any difference if you have say

9832
02:57:43,830 --> 02:57:43,840
any difference if you have say
 

9833
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:47,269
any difference if you have say
gary kasparov and uh

9834
02:57:47,269 --> 02:57:47,279
gary kasparov and uh
 

9835
02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:49,830
gary kasparov and uh
and a a computer work in unison buses

9836
02:57:49,830 --> 02:57:49,840
and a a computer work in unison buses
 

9837
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:50,309
and a a computer work in unison buses
yeah

9838
02:57:50,309 --> 02:57:50,319
yeah
 

9839
02:57:50,319 --> 02:57:53,429
yeah
joe blow from no no it does make a huge

9840
02:57:53,429 --> 02:57:53,439
joe blow from no no it does make a huge
 

9841
02:57:53,439 --> 02:57:54,710
joe blow from no no it does make a huge
difference but yeah both

9842
02:57:54,710 --> 02:57:54,720
difference but yeah both
 

9843
02:57:54,720 --> 02:57:56,070
difference but yeah both
are destroyed by machines that are

9844
02:57:56,070 --> 02:57:56,080
are destroyed by machines that are
 

9845
02:57:56,080 --> 02:57:57,190
are destroyed by machines that are
interesting and it's not even

9846
02:57:57,190 --> 02:57:57,200
interesting and it's not even
 

9847
02:57:57,200 --> 02:57:58,150
interesting and it's not even
competitive no

9848
02:57:58,150 --> 02:57:58,160
competitive no
 

9849
02:57:58,160 --> 02:58:00,150
competitive no
no it's not competitive but they also

9850
02:58:00,150 --> 02:58:00,160
no it's not competitive but they also
 

9851
02:58:00,160 --> 02:58:01,670
no it's not competitive but they also
lost interest in this kind of

9852
02:58:01,670 --> 02:58:01,680
lost interest in this kind of
 

9853
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:04,230
lost interest in this kind of
uh idea so i think there's still

9854
02:58:04,230 --> 02:58:04,240
uh idea so i think there's still
 

9855
02:58:04,240 --> 02:58:06,710
uh idea so i think there's still
competitions between

9856
02:58:06,710 --> 02:58:06,720
competitions between
 

9857
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,389
competitions between
human machine pairs versus human machine

9858
02:58:08,389 --> 02:58:08,399
human machine pairs versus human machine
 

9859
02:58:08,399 --> 02:58:10,710
human machine pairs versus human machine
pairs almost like uh

9860
02:58:10,710 --> 02:58:10,720
pairs almost like uh
 

9861
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:12,710
pairs almost like uh
to see how the two work together but in

9862
02:58:12,710 --> 02:58:12,720
to see how the two work together but in
 

9863
02:58:12,720 --> 02:58:14,469
to see how the two work together but in
terms of machine versus human machine

9864
02:58:14,469 --> 02:58:14,479
terms of machine versus human machine
 

9865
02:58:14,479 --> 02:58:14,870
terms of machine versus human machine
pair

9866
02:58:14,870 --> 02:58:14,880
pair
 

9867
02:58:14,880 --> 02:58:18,630
pair
machines still dominate interesting so

9868
02:58:18,630 --> 02:58:18,640
machines still dominate interesting so
 

9869
02:58:18,640 --> 02:58:20,630
machines still dominate interesting so
and and now we've retrieved back as

9870
02:58:20,630 --> 02:58:20,640
and and now we've retrieved back as
 

9871
02:58:20,640 --> 02:58:21,830
and and now we've retrieved back as
human beings

9872
02:58:21,830 --> 02:58:21,840
human beings
 

9873
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:23,670
human beings
caring mostly about human versus human

9874
02:58:23,670 --> 02:58:23,680
caring mostly about human versus human
 

9875
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:25,590
caring mostly about human versus human
competition which is probably what the

9876
02:58:25,590 --> 02:58:25,600
competition which is probably what the
 

9877
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:27,110
competition which is probably what the
future will look like

9878
02:58:27,110 --> 02:58:27,120
future will look like
 

9879
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,510
future will look like
it's very interesting to think but like

9880
02:58:29,510 --> 02:58:29,520
it's very interesting to think but like
 

9881
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:30,150
it's very interesting to think but like
that that

9882
02:58:30,150 --> 02:58:30,160
that that
 

9883
02:58:30,160 --> 02:58:32,309
that that
in chess happened really quickly it

9884
02:58:32,309 --> 02:58:32,319
in chess happened really quickly it
 

9885
02:58:32,319 --> 02:58:34,389
in chess happened really quickly it
won't happen

9886
02:58:34,389 --> 02:58:34,399
won't happen
 

9887
02:58:34,399 --> 02:58:36,230
won't happen
and it wasn't so painful in chess

9888
02:58:36,230 --> 02:58:36,240
and it wasn't so painful in chess
 

9889
02:58:36,240 --> 02:58:37,750
and it wasn't so painful in chess
because we care about chess but

9890
02:58:37,750 --> 02:58:37,760
because we care about chess but
 

9891
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:41,590
because we care about chess but
it's not so fundamental to human society

9892
02:58:41,590 --> 02:58:41,600
it's not so fundamental to human society
 

9893
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:44,950
it's not so fundamental to human society
in uh when you started talking about

02:58:44,950 --> 02:58:44,960
in uh when you started talking about

9917
02:59:10,319 --> 02:59:13,750
predict
and that very much has applications

9918
02:59:13,750 --> 02:59:13,760
and that very much has applications
 

9919
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:18,309
and that very much has applications
as both china and us now have legalized

9920
02:59:18,309 --> 02:59:18,319
as both china and us now have legalized
 

9921
02:59:18,319 --> 02:59:21,670
as both china and us now have legalized
is autonomous weapon systems so use of

9922
02:59:21,670 --> 02:59:21,680
is autonomous weapon systems so use of
 

9923
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:22,790
is autonomous weapon systems so use of
these kinds of systems

9924
02:59:22,790 --> 02:59:22,800
these kinds of systems
 

9925
02:59:22,800 --> 02:59:25,510
these kinds of systems
and military applications so it used to

9926
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:25,520
and military applications so it used to
 

9927
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:25,830
and military applications so it used to
be

9928
02:59:25,830 --> 02:59:25,840
be
 

9929
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:27,670
be
there'd been a big call in the ai

9930
02:59:27,670 --> 02:59:27,680
there'd been a big call in the ai
 

9931
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:29,670
there'd been a big call in the ai
community to ban autonomous weapons so

9932
02:59:29,670 --> 02:59:29,680
community to ban autonomous weapons so
 

9933
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:31,429
community to ban autonomous weapons so
the use of artificial intelligence

9934
02:59:31,429 --> 02:59:31,439
the use of artificial intelligence
 

9935
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:35,510
the use of artificial intelligence
in in war just like bio weapons are

9936
02:59:35,510 --> 02:59:35,520
in in war just like bio weapons are
 

9937
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:38,389
in in war just like bio weapons are
banned uh internationally so you're not

9938
02:59:38,389 --> 02:59:38,399
banned uh internationally so you're not
 

9939
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:40,230
banned uh internationally so you're not
allowed to use bioweapons in war

9940
02:59:40,230 --> 02:59:40,240
allowed to use bioweapons in war
 

9941
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:43,269
allowed to use bioweapons in war
and actually most people even terrorists

9942
02:59:43,269 --> 02:59:43,279
and actually most people even terrorists
 

9943
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:46,309
and actually most people even terrorists
have kind of agreed on this ban

9944
02:59:46,309 --> 02:59:46,319
have kind of agreed on this ban
 

9945
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:48,710
have kind of agreed on this ban
it's not like a there's been a quiet

9946
02:59:48,710 --> 02:59:48,720
it's not like a there's been a quiet
 

9947
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:50,389
it's not like a there's been a quiet
agreement like we're not going to be

9948
02:59:50,389 --> 02:59:50,399
agreement like we're not going to be
 

9949
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:51,830
agreement like we're not going to be
doing this because everybody's going to

9950
02:59:51,830 --> 02:59:51,840
doing this because everybody's going to
 

9951
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:54,150
doing this because everybody's going to
get really pissed off

9952
02:59:54,150 --> 02:59:54,160
get really pissed off
 

9953
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:57,030
get really pissed off
with autonomous weapon systems that's

9954
02:59:57,030 --> 02:59:57,040
with autonomous weapon systems that's
 

9955
02:59:57,040 --> 02:59:58,790
with autonomous weapon systems that's
not been the case

9956
02:59:58,790 --> 02:59:58,800
not been the case
 

9957
02:59:58,800 --> 03:00:00,870
not been the case
with china has said that they're going

9958
03:00:00,870 --> 03:00:00,880
with china has said that they're going
 

9959
03:00:00,880 --> 03:00:03,110
with china has said that they're going
to be using ai in their military

9960
03:00:03,110 --> 03:00:03,120
to be using ai in their military
 

9961
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:06,630
to be using ai in their military
and uh the us in 2021

9962
03:00:06,630 --> 03:00:06,640
and uh the us in 2021
 

9963
03:00:06,640 --> 03:00:08,870
and uh the us in 2021
just released a report saying that

9964
03:00:08,870 --> 03:00:08,880
just released a report saying that
 

9965
03:00:08,880 --> 03:00:11,510
just released a report saying that
they're going to um

9966
03:00:11,510 --> 03:00:11,520
they're going to um
 

9967
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:13,269
they're going to um
they're they're going to add increasing

9968
03:00:13,269 --> 03:00:13,279
they're they're going to add increasing
 

9969
03:00:13,279 --> 03:00:15,269
they're they're going to add increasing
amounts of artificial intelligence

9970
03:00:15,269 --> 03:00:15,279
amounts of artificial intelligence
 

9971
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:18,070
amounts of artificial intelligence
into our military systems into drones

9972
03:00:18,070 --> 03:00:18,080
into our military systems into drones
 

9973
03:00:18,080 --> 03:00:18,469
into our military systems into drones
into

9974
03:00:18,469 --> 03:00:18,479
into
 

9975
03:00:18,479 --> 03:00:20,230
into
just everything that's doing any kind of

9976
03:00:20,230 --> 03:00:20,240
just everything that's doing any kind of
 

9977
03:00:20,240 --> 03:00:21,910
just everything that's doing any kind of
both strategic

9978
03:00:21,910 --> 03:00:21,920
both strategic
 

9979
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:25,190
both strategic
and actual like bombing and

9980
03:00:25,190 --> 03:00:25,200
and actual like bombing and
 

9981
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:28,950
and actual like bombing and
uh defense systems i presume uh

9982
03:00:28,950 --> 03:00:28,960
uh defense systems i presume uh
 

9983
03:00:28,960 --> 03:00:31,750
uh defense systems i presume uh
a drone army would easily defeat a human

9984
03:00:31,750 --> 03:00:31,760
a drone army would easily defeat a human
 

9985
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:33,429
a drone army would easily defeat a human
army in the in the near future

9986
03:00:33,429 --> 03:00:33,439
army in the in the near future
 

9987
03:00:33,439 --> 03:00:37,269
army in the in the near future
like um i mean think about

9988
03:00:37,269 --> 03:00:37,279
like um i mean think about
 

9989
03:00:37,279 --> 03:00:38,710
like um i mean think about
just off the top of my head just think

9990
03:00:38,710 --> 03:00:38,720
just off the top of my head just think
 

9991
03:00:38,720 --> 03:00:40,870
just off the top of my head just think
about the implication of kamikaze drones

9992
03:00:40,870 --> 03:00:40,880
about the implication of kamikaze drones
 

9993
03:00:40,880 --> 03:00:44,230
about the implication of kamikaze drones
versus a naval fleet i mean kamikazes

9994
03:00:44,230 --> 03:00:44,240
versus a naval fleet i mean kamikazes
 

9995
03:00:44,240 --> 03:00:45,910
versus a naval fleet i mean kamikazes
was humans and world war ii did

9996
03:00:45,910 --> 03:00:45,920
was humans and world war ii did
 

9997
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:49,110
was humans and world war ii did
terrible damage to our navy imagine

9998
03:00:49,110 --> 03:00:49,120
terrible damage to our navy imagine
 

9999
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:53,190
terrible damage to our navy imagine
swarms of of uh mechanical kamikazes

10000
03:00:53,190 --> 03:00:53,200
swarms of of uh mechanical kamikazes
 

10001
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:55,910
swarms of of uh mechanical kamikazes
which have no fear no remorse i mean

10002
03:00:55,910 --> 03:00:55,920
which have no fear no remorse i mean
 

10003
03:00:55,920 --> 03:00:59,110
which have no fear no remorse i mean
but it's very uh inefficient kamikaze is

10004
03:00:59,110 --> 03:00:59,120
but it's very uh inefficient kamikaze is
 

10005
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:01,349
but it's very uh inefficient kamikaze is
very inefficient you want to be very

10006
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:01,359
very inefficient you want to be very
 

10007
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:05,030
very inefficient you want to be very
like war is it's the same discussion to

10008
03:01:05,030 --> 03:01:05,040
like war is it's the same discussion to
 

10009
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:05,990
like war is it's the same discussion to
jiu jitsu right

03:01:05,990 --> 03:01:06,000
jiu jitsu right
 

10011
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,349
jiu jitsu right
you want to be uh you want to create an

10012

you want to be uh you want to create an
 

10013
03:01:09,359 --> 03:01:11,190
you want to be uh you want to create an
asymmetry of power and you want to be

10014
03:01:11,190 --> 03:01:11,200
asymmetry of power and you want to be
 

10015
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:12,710
asymmetry of power and you want to be
efficient as in the way you deliver that

10016
03:01:12,710 --> 03:01:12,720
efficient as in the way you deliver that
 

10017
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:13,830
efficient as in the way you deliver that
power

10018
03:01:13,830 --> 03:01:13,840
power
 

10019
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:15,670
power
it's actually goes back to the picking

10020
03:01:15,670 --> 03:01:15,680
it's actually goes back to the picking
 

10021
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:17,110
it's actually goes back to the picking
up a cup

10022
03:01:17,110 --> 03:01:17,120
up a cup
 

10023
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:21,510
up a cup
currently a lot of things we do in war

10024
03:01:21,510 --> 03:01:21,520
currently a lot of things we do in war
 

10025
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:23,510
currently a lot of things we do in war
like so most of the drones that you hear

10026
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:23,520
like so most of the drones that you hear
 

10027
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:25,590
like so most of the drones that you hear
about they're not autonomous not most

10028
03:01:25,590 --> 03:01:25,600
about they're not autonomous not most
 

10029
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:27,429
about they're not autonomous not most
all they're usually piloted by they're

10030
03:01:27,429 --> 03:01:27,439
all they're usually piloted by they're
 

10031

10033
03:01:28,720 --> 03:01:31,830

03:01:33,510 --> 03:01:33,520
this kind of
 

10037
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:35,190
this kind of
what's necessary to deliver the most

10038
03:01:35,190 --> 03:01:35,200
what's necessary to deliver the most
 

10039
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:37,190
what's necessary to deliver the most
damage targeted damage

strategy have about bombing the area or

10044
03:01:40,790 --> 03:01:40,800

10045
03:01:40,800 --> 03:01:42,870

all that kind of stuff

10046
03:01:42,870 --> 03:01:42,880
all that kind of stuff
 

10047
03:01:42,880 --> 03:01:44,309
all that kind of stuff
i don't know how difficult that is to

10048
03:01:44,309 --> 03:01:44,319
i don't know how difficult that is to
 

10049
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:46,070
i don't know how difficult that is to
automate i think

10050
03:01:46,070 --> 03:01:46,080
automate i think
 

10051
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:48,550
automate i think
the biggest concern i actually have a

10052
03:01:48,550 --> 03:01:48,560
the biggest concern i actually have a
 

10053
03:01:48,560 --> 03:01:50,389
the biggest concern i actually have a
sense that's very difficult to

10054
03:01:50,389 --> 03:01:50,399
sense that's very difficult to
 

10055
03:01:50,399 --> 03:01:53,429
sense that's very difficult to
automate the biggest concern is almost

10056
03:01:53,429 --> 03:01:53,439
automate the biggest concern is almost
 

10057
03:01:53,439 --> 03:01:53,750
automate the biggest concern is almost
like

10058
03:01:53,750 --> 03:01:53,760
like
 

10059
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:56,950
like
an incompetent application of this

10060
03:01:56,950 --> 03:01:56,960
an incompetent application of this
 

10061
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:59,590
an incompetent application of this
and uh consequences that are not

10062
03:01:59,590 --> 03:01:59,600
and uh consequences that are not
 

10063
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:01,030
and uh consequences that are not
anticipated

10064
03:02:01,030 --> 03:02:01,040
anticipated
 

10065
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:04,950

so you have a drone army where you say

10066
03:02:04,950 --> 03:02:04,960
so you have a drone army where you say
 

10067
03:02:04,960 --> 03:02:07,510
so you have a drone army where you say
we want to target you give it power to

10068
03:02:07,510 --> 03:02:07,520
we want to target you give it power to
 

10069
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:09,670
we want to target you give it power to
target a particular terrorist

10070
03:02:09,670 --> 03:02:09,680
target a particular terrorist
 

10071
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:12,150
target a particular terrorist
and then there's some bug in the system

10072
03:02:12,150 --> 03:02:12,160
and then there's some bug in the system
 

10073
03:02:12,160 --> 03:02:14,309
and then there's some bug in the system
that

10074
03:02:14,309 --> 03:02:14,319

that's probably the best advice we give

10338
03:07:04,630 --> 03:07:04,640
that's probably the best advice we give
 

10339
03:07:04,640 --> 03:07:07,429
that's probably the best advice we give
um it goes back to what we said earlier

uh i always advocate start your training

10342
03:07:10,469 --> 03:07:10,479
uh i always advocate start your training
 

10343
03:07:10,479 --> 03:07:11,830
uh i always advocate start your training
from the ground up

10344
03:07:11,830 --> 03:07:11,840
from the ground up
 

10345
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:15,590
from the ground up
okay your first sessions in jiu-jitsu

10346
03:07:15,590 --> 03:07:15,600
okay your first sessions in jiu-jitsu
 

10347
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:16,710
okay your first sessions in jiu-jitsu
you're going to find

10348
03:07:16,710 --> 03:07:16,720
you're going to find
 

10349
03:07:16,720 --> 03:07:19,510
you're going to find
to your horror that everyone gets on top

10350
03:07:19,510 --> 03:07:19,520
to your horror that everyone gets on top
 

10351
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:21,269
to your horror that everyone gets on top
of you and you can't get out

10352
03:07:21,269 --> 03:07:21,279
of you and you can't get out
 

10353
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:24,230
of you and you can't get out
and it's a dispiriting crushing kind of

10354
03:07:24,230 --> 03:07:24,240
and it's a dispiriting crushing kind of
 

10355
03:07:24,240 --> 03:07:25,190
and it's a dispiriting crushing kind of
feeling that you

10356
03:07:25,190 --> 03:07:25,200
feeling that you
 

10357
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:26,870
feeling that you
just have no skills and you have no

10358
03:07:26,870 --> 03:07:26,880
just have no skills and you have no
 

10359
03:07:26,880 --> 03:07:28,630
just have no skills and you have no
prospects in the sport

10360
03:07:28,630 --> 03:07:28,640
prospects in the sport
 

10361
03:07:28,640 --> 03:07:30,630
prospects in the sport
so your first skill is the skill of

10362
03:07:30,630 --> 03:07:30,640
so your first skill is the skill of
 

10363
03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:32,309
so your first skill is the skill of
being able to free yourself

10364
03:07:32,309 --> 03:07:32,319
being able to free yourself
 

10365
03:07:32,319 --> 03:07:36,150
being able to free yourself
from positional pins most of the escapes

10366
03:07:36,150 --> 03:07:36,160
from positional pins most of the escapes
 

10367
03:07:36,160 --> 03:07:37,030
from positional pins most of the escapes
in jiu-jitsu

10368
03:07:37,030 --> 03:07:37,040
in jiu-jitsu
 

10369
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:40,550
in jiu-jitsu
go to guard position and so once you get

10370
03:07:40,550 --> 03:07:40,560
go to guard position and so once you get
 

10371
03:07:40,560 --> 03:07:41,510
go to guard position and so once you get
someone in your guard they're going to

10372
03:07:41,510 --> 03:07:41,520
someone in your guard they're going to
 

10373
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:42,950
someone in your guard they're going to
be looking to pass your guard

10374
03:07:42,950 --> 03:07:42,960
be looking to pass your guard
 

10375
03:07:42,960 --> 03:07:45,030
be looking to pass your guard
and get back into those positional pins

10376
03:07:45,030 --> 03:07:45,040
and get back into those positional pins
 

10377
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:47,110
and get back into those positional pins
that you just escaped from

10378
03:07:47,110 --> 03:07:47,120
that you just escaped from
 

10379
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:49,110
that you just escaped from
and that's just as crushing as getting

10380
03:07:49,110 --> 03:07:49,120
and that's just as crushing as getting
 

10381
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:50,469
and that's just as crushing as getting
pinned you feel like every time you try

10382
03:07:50,469 --> 03:07:50,479
pinned you feel like every time you try
 

10383
03:07:50,479 --> 03:07:51,670
pinned you feel like every time you try
to hold someone a guard they just

10384
03:07:51,670 --> 03:07:51,680
to hold someone a guard they just
 

10385
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:54,150
to hold someone a guard they just
efficiently pass you by

10386
03:07:54,150 --> 03:07:54,160
efficiently pass you by
 

10387
03:07:54,160 --> 03:07:56,469
efficiently pass you by
so your first two skills you gotta

10388
03:07:56,469 --> 03:07:56,479
so your first two skills you gotta
 

10389
03:07:56,479 --> 03:07:57,910
so your first two skills you gotta
better get out of any pin

10390
03:07:57,910 --> 03:07:57,920
better get out of any pin
 

10391
03:07:57,920 --> 03:07:59,110
better get out of any pin
and you gotta better hold someone in

10392
03:07:59,110 --> 03:07:59,120
and you gotta better hold someone in
 

10393
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:01,429
and you gotta better hold someone in
your guard so pin escapes and guard

10394
03:08:01,429 --> 03:08:01,439

they
they did it i don't know how they did it

they did it i don't know how they did it
 

11571
03:29:34,319 --> 03:29:35,590
they did it i don't know how they did it
but they did it they got through ice

droughts famines disease everything
 

11577
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:41,429
droughts famines disease everything
and they found a way to get to the top

11578
03:29:41,429 --> 03:29:41,439
and they found a way to get to the top
 

11579

and they found a way to get to the top
of the food chain

11581
03:29:44,239 --> 03:29:47,590

and that's where it all got interesting

11582
03:29:47,590 --> 03:29:47,600
and that's where it all got interesting
 

11583
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:49,910
and that's where it all got interesting
because an organism whose only interest

11584
03:29:49,910 --> 03:29:49,920
because an organism whose only interest
 

11585
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:51,110
because an organism whose only interest
was in survival

11586
03:29:51,110 --> 03:29:51,120
was in survival
 

11587
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:53,030
was in survival
yeah had for the first time in their

11588
03:29:53,030 --> 03:29:53,040
yeah had for the first time in their
 

11589
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:55,269
yeah had for the first time in their
history a more or less

11590
03:29:55,269 --> 03:29:55,279
history a more or less
 

11591
03:29:55,279 --> 03:29:59,269
history a more or less

11593
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:03,429

and so the big question now is now what

11594
03:30:03,429 --> 03:30:03,439
and so the big question now is now what
 

11595
03:30:03,439 --> 03:30:06,309
and so the big question now is now what
we survived there's no more danger the

11596
03:30:06,309 --> 03:30:06,319
we survived there's no more danger the
 

11597
03:30:06,319 --> 03:30:07,269
we survived there's no more danger the
average human being

average human being
 

11599
03:30:07,279 --> 03:30:09,590
average human being
finds himself in a world now where

11600
03:30:09,590 --> 03:30:09,600
finds himself in a world now where
 

11601
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:11,190
finds himself in a world now where
there's almost

11602

there's almost

where getting to and from work is not
 

11609
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:23,590
