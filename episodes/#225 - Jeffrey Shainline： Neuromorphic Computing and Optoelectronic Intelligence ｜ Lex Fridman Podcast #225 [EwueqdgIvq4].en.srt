optoelectronic intelligence
 

45
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,990
optoelectronic intelligence
so maybe we could start by talking about

46
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,000
so maybe we could start by talking about
 

47
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,470
so maybe we could start by talking about
this paper and start with the basic

48
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:56,480
this paper and start with the basic
 

49
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,950
this paper and start with the basic
questions what is optoelectronic

yeah so in that paper the the concept i

54
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,120
yeah so in that paper the the concept i
 

55
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,350
yeah so in that paper the the concept i
was trying to describe is

56
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:05,360
was trying to describe is
 

57
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,310
was trying to describe is
sort of an architecture for building

58
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,320
sort of an architecture for building
 

59
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,870
sort of an architecture for building
brain-inspired computing

60
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:10,880

that leverages light for communication

62
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,280
that leverages light for communication
 

63
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,870
that leverages light for communication
in conjunction with

64
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:14,880
in conjunction with
 

65
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,590
in conjunction with

electronic circuits for computation
 

67
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,270
electronic circuits for computation
in that particular paper a lot of the

68
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:19,280
in that particular paper a lot of the
 

69
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,030
in that particular paper a lot of the
work we're doing right now in our

70
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:21,040
work we're doing right now in our
 

71
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,830
work we're doing right now in our
project at nist is focused on

73
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,190
project at nist is focused on
superconducting electronics for

74
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
superconducting electronics for
 

75
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,789
superconducting electronics for
computation i'll go into

76
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:26,799
computation i'll go into
 

77
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,030
computation i'll go into
why that is but

78
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
why that is but
 

79
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,710
why that is but
that might make a little more sense in

80
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:30,720
that might make a little more sense in
 

81
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,710
that might make a little more sense in
context if we first

82
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:32,720
context if we first
 

83
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,350
context if we first
describe what that is in contrast to

84
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:35,360
describe what that is in contrast to
 

85
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,830
describe what that is in contrast to
which is semiconducting electronics

86
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:37,840
which is semiconducting electronics
 

87
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,590
which is semiconducting electronics
so is it worth taking a couple minutes

88
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:39,600
so is it worth taking a couple minutes
 

89
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,789
so is it worth taking a couple minutes
to describe

90
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:40,799
to describe
 

91
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,710
to describe
semiconducting electronics

92
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:42,720
semiconducting electronics
 

93
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,910
semiconducting electronics
it might even be worthwhile to step back

94
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:45,920
it might even be worthwhile to step back
 

95
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,030
it might even be worthwhile to step back
and uh talk about electricity and

96
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,040
and uh talk about electricity and
 

97
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,149
and uh talk about electricity and
circuits and how circuits work right

98
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:52,159
circuits and how circuits work right
 

99
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,710
circuits and how circuits work right
before we talk about super conductivity

100
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:54,720
before we talk about super conductivity
 

101
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,389
before we talk about super conductivity
right okay

102
00:01:56,389 --> 00:01:56,399
right okay
 

103
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,469
right okay
how does the computer work jeff well i

104
00:01:58,469 --> 00:01:58,479
how does the computer work jeff well i
 

105
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,149
how does the computer work jeff well i
won't go into everything that makes a

106
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
won't go into everything that makes a
 

107
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,149
won't go into everything that makes a
computer work but

108
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:02,159
computer work but
 

109
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,670
computer work but
let's talk about the

110
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:03,680
let's talk about the
 

111
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,870
let's talk about the
basic building blocks a transistor so

112
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:06,880
basic building blocks a transistor so
 

113
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,630
basic building blocks a transistor so
and even more basic than that a

114
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
and even more basic than that a
 

115
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,790
and even more basic than that a
semiconductor material silicon say so

116
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:12,800
semiconductor material silicon say so
 

117
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,350
semiconductor material silicon say so
uh in silicon silicon is a semiconductor

118
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
uh in silicon silicon is a semiconductor
 

119
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,430
uh in silicon silicon is a semiconductor
and what that means is at low

120
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
and what that means is at low
 

121
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,949
and what that means is at low
temperature there are no free charges no

122
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:20,959
temperature there are no free charges no
 

123
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:22,869
temperature there are no free charges no
free electrons that can move around so

124
00:02:22,869 --> 00:02:22,879
free electrons that can move around so
 

125
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,030
free electrons that can move around so
when you talk about electricity you're

126
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,040
when you talk about electricity you're
 

127
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,550
when you talk about electricity you're
talking about

128
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,560
talking about
 

129
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,270
talking about
predominantly electrons moving to

130
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,280
predominantly electrons moving to
 

131
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,110
predominantly electrons moving to
establish electrical currents and they

132
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,120
establish electrical currents and they
 

133
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,190
establish electrical currents and they
move under the influence of voltages so

134
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:33,200
move under the influence of voltages so
 

135
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,190
move under the influence of voltages so
you apply voltages

136
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,200
you apply voltages
 

137
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,030
you apply voltages
electrons move around those can be

138
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,040
electrons move around those can be
 

139
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,790
electrons move around those can be
measured as currents and you can

140
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:38,800
measured as currents and you can
 

141
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,110
measured as currents and you can
represent information in that way so

142
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,120
represent information in that way so
 

143
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,830
represent information in that way so
semiconductors are special

144
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:43,840
semiconductors are special
 

145
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,270
semiconductors are special
in the sense that

146
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,280
in the sense that
 

147
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,350
in the sense that
they are really malleable so if you have

148
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:47,360
they are really malleable so if you have
 

149
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,670
they are really malleable so if you have
a semiconductor material

150
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:49,680
a semiconductor material
 

151
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,910
a semiconductor material
it you can change the number of free

152
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:51,920
it you can change the number of free
 

153
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,750
it you can change the number of free
electrons that can move around by

154
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
electrons that can move around by
 

155
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,430
electrons that can move around by
putting different

156
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
putting different
 

157
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,910
putting different
elements different atoms in lattice

158
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:57,920
elements different atoms in lattice
 

159
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,110
elements different atoms in lattice
sites so

160
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,120
sites so
 

161
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,470
sites so
what is a lattice site well a

162
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:00,480
what is a lattice site well a
 

163
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,710
what is a lattice site well a
semiconductor is a crystal which means

164
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:02,720
semiconductor is a crystal which means
 

165
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,470
semiconductor is a crystal which means
all the atoms that comprise the material

166
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
all the atoms that comprise the material
 

167
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,430
all the atoms that comprise the material
are

168
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,440
are
 

169
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,589
are
at exact locations that are perfectly

170
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:09,599
at exact locations that are perfectly
 

171
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,589
at exact locations that are perfectly
periodic in space so if you start at any

172
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
periodic in space so if you start at any
 

173
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,509
periodic in space so if you start at any
one atom and you go along the what are

174
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
one atom and you go along the what are
 

175
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,030
one atom and you go along the what are
called the lattice vectors you get to

176
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
called the lattice vectors you get to
 

177
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,309
called the lattice vectors you get to
another atom and another atom and

178
00:03:16,309 --> 00:03:16,319
another atom and another atom and
 

179
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,790
another atom and another atom and
another atom and for high quality

180
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
another atom and for high quality
 

181
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,869
another atom and for high quality
devices it's important that it's a a

182
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:20,879
devices it's important that it's a a
 

183
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,670
devices it's important that it's a a
perfect crystal with very few defects

184
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
perfect crystal with very few defects
 

185
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,550
perfect crystal with very few defects
but you can intentionally replace a

186
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:26,560
but you can intentionally replace a
 

187
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,110
but you can intentionally replace a
silicon atom with say a phosphorus atom

188
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,120
silicon atom with say a phosphorus atom
 

189
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,789
silicon atom with say a phosphorus atom
and then you can you can change the

190
00:03:30,789 --> 00:03:30,799
and then you can you can change the
 

191
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,030
and then you can you can change the
number of free electrons that are in a

192
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
number of free electrons that are in a
 

193
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,430
number of free electrons that are in a
region of space that has that excess of

194
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
region of space that has that excess of
 

195
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,830
region of space that has that excess of
what are called dopants so picture a

196
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
what are called dopants so picture a
 

197
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,390
what are called dopants so picture a
device that has a left terminal and a

198
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:40,400
device that has a left terminal and a
 

199
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,910
device that has a left terminal and a
right terminal

200
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:41,920
right terminal
 

201
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,750
right terminal
and if you apply a voltage between those

202
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:43,760
and if you apply a voltage between those
 

203
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,229
and if you apply a voltage between those
two you can cause electrical current to

204
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
two you can cause electrical current to
 

205
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,750
two you can cause electrical current to
flow between them

206
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
flow between them
 

207
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,270
flow between them
now we

208
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,280
now we
 

209
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,149
now we
add a third terminal up on top there and

210
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
add a third terminal up on top there and
 

211
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,149
add a third terminal up on top there and
depending on the voltage between the

212
00:03:54,149 --> 00:03:54,159
depending on the voltage between the
 

213
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,309
depending on the voltage between the
left and right terminal and that third

214
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
left and right terminal and that third
 

215
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,309
left and right terminal and that third
voltage you can you can change that

216
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
voltage you can you can change that
 

217
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,630
voltage you can you can change that
current so what's commonly done in

218
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:00,640
current so what's commonly done in
 

219
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,509
current so what's commonly done in
digital electronic circuits is to

220
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
digital electronic circuits is to
 

221
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,470
digital electronic circuits is to
leave a fixed voltage from left to right

222
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
leave a fixed voltage from left to right
 

223
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,509
leave a fixed voltage from left to right
and then

224
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:07,519
and then
 

225
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,110
and then
change that voltage that's applied at

226
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,120
change that voltage that's applied at
 

227
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,550
change that voltage that's applied at
what's called the gate the gate of the

228
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:10,560
what's called the gate the gate of the
 

229
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,470
what's called the gate the gate of the
transistor so

230
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
transistor so
 

231
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,910
transistor so
what you do is you you make it to where

232
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:13,920
what you do is you you make it to where
 

233
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,270
what you do is you you make it to where
there's an excess of electrons on the

234
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,280
there's an excess of electrons on the
 

235
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,270
there's an excess of electrons on the
left excess of electrons on the right

236
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
left excess of electrons on the right
 

237
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,870
left excess of electrons on the right
and very few electrons in the middle and

238
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:18,880
and very few electrons in the middle and
 

239
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,550
and very few electrons in the middle and
you do this by changing the

240
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:20,560
you do this by changing the
 

241
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,550
you do this by changing the
concentration of different dopants in

242
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,560
concentration of different dopants in
 

243
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,710
concentration of different dopants in
the lattice spatially

244
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
the lattice spatially
 

245
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,030
the lattice spatially
and then when you apply a voltage to

246
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
and then when you apply a voltage to
 

247
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,189
and then when you apply a voltage to
that gate you can either cause current

248
00:04:29,189 --> 00:04:29,199
that gate you can either cause current
 

249
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,110
that gate you can either cause current
to flow or turn it off and so that's

250
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,120
to flow or turn it off and so that's
 

251
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,590
to flow or turn it off and so that's
sort of your zero and one you if you

252
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
sort of your zero and one you if you
 

253
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,510
sort of your zero and one you if you
apply voltage current can flow that

254
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
apply voltage current can flow that
 

255
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,310
apply voltage current can flow that
current is representing a digital one

256
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,320
current is representing a digital one
 

257
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,909
current is representing a digital one
and uh from that from that basic element

258
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:41,919
and uh from that from that basic element
 

259
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,270
and uh from that from that basic element
you can build up

260
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
you can build up
 

261
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,950
you can build up
all the complexity of digital electronic

262
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
all the complexity of digital electronic
 

263
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,710
all the complexity of digital electronic
circuits that

264
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
circuits that
 

265
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,510
circuits that
have

266
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:47,520
have
 

267
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,189
have
really had a profound influence on our

268
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
really had a profound influence on our
 

269
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,790
really had a profound influence on our
society now you're talking about

270
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
society now you're talking about
 

271
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,950
society now you're talking about
electrons can you give a sense of what

272
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:52,960
electrons can you give a sense of what
 

273
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,870
electrons can you give a sense of what
scale we're talking about when we're

274
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
scale we're talking about when we're
 

275
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,270
scale we're talking about when we're
talking about in silicon

276
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,280
talking about in silicon
 

277
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,350
talking about in silicon
uh being able to mass manufacture these

278
00:04:59,350 --> 00:04:59,360
uh being able to mass manufacture these
 

279
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,670
uh being able to mass manufacture these
kinds of uh gates

280
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:01,680
kinds of uh gates
 

281
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,909
kinds of uh gates
yeah so scale in a number of different

282
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:03,919
yeah so scale in a number of different
 

283
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,629
yeah so scale in a number of different
senses well at the scale of the silicon

284
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
senses well at the scale of the silicon
 

285
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,029
senses well at the scale of the silicon
lattice the distance between two atoms

286
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:09,039
lattice the distance between two atoms
 

287
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,749
lattice the distance between two atoms
there is half a nanometer so

288
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:11,759
there is half a nanometer so
 

289
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,629
there is half a nanometer so
um

290
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
um
 

291
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,070
um
people often like to compare these

292
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080
people often like to compare these
 

293
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,469
people often like to compare these
things to the the width of a human hair

294
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
things to the the width of a human hair
 

295
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,150
things to the the width of a human hair
i think it's some

296
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:18,160
i think it's some
 

297
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,150
i think it's some
six orders of magnitude smaller than the

298
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:20,160
six orders of magnitude smaller than the
 

299
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,749
six orders of magnitude smaller than the
width of a human hair

300
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:21,759
width of a human hair
 

301
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,390
width of a human hair
uh something on that order

302
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
uh something on that order
 

303
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,310
uh something on that order
so remarkably small we're talking about

304
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
so remarkably small we're talking about
 

305
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,310
so remarkably small we're talking about
individual atoms here and electrons are

306
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,320
individual atoms here and electrons are
 

307
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,909
individual atoms here and electrons are
of that length scale when they're in

308
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:29,919
of that length scale when they're in
 

309
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,430
of that length scale when they're in
that environment

310
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:31,440
that environment
 

311
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,950
that environment
but there's another sense that scale

312
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
but there's another sense that scale
 

313
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,790
but there's another sense that scale
matters in digital electronics this is

00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
matters in digital electronics this is
 

315
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,390
matters in digital electronics this is
perhaps the more important sense

316
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:36,400
perhaps the more important sense
 

317
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,390
perhaps the more important sense
although they're related scale refers to

318
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
although they're related scale refers to
 

319
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,629
although they're related scale refers to
a number of things it refers to

320
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:42,639
a number of things it refers to
 

321
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,350
a number of things it refers to
the size of that transistor so for

322
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
the size of that transistor so for
 

323
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,270
the size of that transistor so for
example i said you have a left contact a

324
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:47,280
example i said you have a left contact a
 

325
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,590
example i said you have a left contact a
right contact and some space between

right contact and some space between
 

327
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,710
right contact and some space between
them where the

328
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
them where the
 

329
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,029
them where the
the gate electrode sits that that's

330
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
the gate electrode sits that that's
 

331
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,189
the gate electrode sits that that's
called the the channel width uh or the

332
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:55,199
called the the channel width uh or the
 

333
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,270
called the the channel width uh or the
channel length and um

334
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,280
channel length and um
 

335
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,430
channel length and um

really remarkable pace i mean
 

351
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,150
really remarkable pace i mean
that that feature size has

352
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:18,160
that that feature size has
 

353
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,629
that that feature size has
decreased uh consistently every couple

354
00:06:20,629 --> 00:06:20,639
decreased uh consistently every couple
 

355
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,990
decreased uh consistently every couple

356
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
of years for
 

357
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,629
of years for
the since the 1960s and that was

358
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:24,639
the since the 1960s and that was
 

359
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,230
the since the 1960s and that was
that was what moore predicted in the

360
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,240
that was what moore predicted in the
 

361
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,150
that was what moore predicted in the
1960s he thought it would continue for

362
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,160
1960s he thought it would continue for
 

363
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,749
1960s he thought it would continue for
at least two more decades and it's been

364
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:29,759
at least two more decades and it's been
 

365
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,749
at least two more decades and it's been
much longer than that and so

366
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
much longer than that and so
 

367
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:32,790
much longer than that and so
um

368
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
um
 

369
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,950
um
that is why we've been able to fit ever

ion implantation so you have you start

482
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
ion implantation so you have you start
 

483
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,990
ion implantation so you have you start
with sort of a pristine silicon crystal

484
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,000
with sort of a pristine silicon crystal
 

485
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,469
with sort of a pristine silicon crystal
and then using photolithography which is

486
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:34,479
and then using photolithography which is
 

487
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,550
and then using photolithography which is
a technique where you can pattern

488
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:36,560
a technique where you can pattern
 

489
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,870

you're going to implant with different
 

495
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,990
you're going to implant with different
uh different species of ions that are

496
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
uh different species of ions that are
 

497
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,070
uh different species of ions that are
going to change the local electrical

ever-shrinking feature size and now the
 

535
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,870
ever-shrinking feature size and now the
question is can you make it smaller and

536

question is can you make it smaller and
 

537
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,030
question is can you make it smaller and
even if you do do you still continue to

00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,040
even if you do do you still continue to
 

539
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,030
even if you do do you still continue to
get performance improvements but that's

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,910
silicon has uh well when you make a
transistor you have this gate contact

664
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
transistor you have this gate contact
 

665
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,990
transistor you have this gate contact
that sits on top of the conduction

666
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:44,000
that sits on top of the conduction
 

667
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,310
that sits on top of the conduction
channel and depending on the voltage you

668
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
channel and depending on the voltage you
 

669
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,870
channel and depending on the voltage you
apply there you pull more carriers into

670
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
apply there you pull more carriers into
 

671
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,629
apply there you pull more carriers into
the conduction channel or push them away

672
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,639
the conduction channel or push them away
 

673
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,949
the conduction channel or push them away
so it becomes more or less conductive

674
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:52,959
so it becomes more or less conductive
 

675
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,030
so it becomes more or less conductive
in order to have that work without just

676
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
in order to have that work without just
 

677
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,470
in order to have that work without just
sucking those carriers right into that

678
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
sucking those carriers right into that
 

679
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,190
sucking those carriers right into that
contact you need a very thin insulator

680
00:11:59,190 --> 00:11:59,200
contact you need a very thin insulator
 

681
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,910
contact you need a very thin insulator
and and part of scaling has been to

682
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
and and part of scaling has been to
 

683
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,710
and and part of scaling has been to
gradually decrease the thickness of that

684
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:04,720
gradually decrease the thickness of that
 

685
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,190
gradually decrease the thickness of that
of that gate insulator so that you can

686
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
of that gate insulator so that you can
 

687
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,350
of that gate insulator so that you can
use a roughly similar voltage and still

688
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:09,360
use a roughly similar voltage and still
 

689
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,470
use a roughly similar voltage and still
have the same

690
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:10,480
have the same
 

691
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,790
have the same
current voltage characteristics so the

692
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
current voltage characteristics so the
 

693
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,790
current voltage characteristics so the
material that's used to do that or i

694
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
material that's used to do that or i
 

695
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,870
material that's used to do that or i
should say was initially used to do that

696
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:16,880
should say was initially used to do that
 

697
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,350
should say was initially used to do that
was a silicon dioxide which just

698
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:19,360
was a silicon dioxide which just
 

699
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,670
was a silicon dioxide which just
naturally grows on the silicon surface

700
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:21,680
naturally grows on the silicon surface
 

701
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,670
naturally grows on the silicon surface
so you expose silicon to

702
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:23,680
so you expose silicon to
 

703
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,990
so you expose silicon to
the atmosphere that we breathe and

704
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:26,000
the atmosphere that we breathe and
 

705
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,590
the atmosphere that we breathe and

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
devised
 

829
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,949
devised
and it works quite well

830
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:32,959
and it works quite well
 

831
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,550
and it works quite well
and amazingly like you said with a

832
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:34,560
and amazingly like you said with a
 

833
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,310
and amazingly like you said with a
wavelength at like 100 nanometers or

834
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,320
wavelength at like 100 nanometers or
 

835
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,069
wavelength at like 100 nanometers or
something like that you're still able to

836
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:38,079
something like that you're still able to
 

837
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,030
something like that you're still able to
achieve on this polymer precision of

838
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:41,040
achieve on this polymer precision of
 

839
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,629
achieve on this polymer precision of
whatever whatever we said seven

840
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
whatever whatever we said seven
 

841
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,790
whatever whatever we said seven
nanometers yeah i think i've heard like

842
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:44,800
nanometers yeah i think i've heard like
 

843
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,470
nanometers yeah i think i've heard like
four nanometers being talked about

844
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
four nanometers being talked about
 

845
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,829
four nanometers being talked about
something like that yes

846
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
something like that yes
 

847
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,829
something like that yes
i if we could just pause on this and

848
00:14:49,829 --> 00:14:49,839
i if we could just pause on this and
 

849
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,030
i if we could just pause on this and
we'll return to super connectivity but

850
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,040
we'll return to super connectivity but

history of
 

897
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,509
history of
silicon microelectronics is that

uh so when when quantum mechanics was

900
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:43,839
uh so when when quantum mechanics was
 

901
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,230
uh so when when quantum mechanics was
developed people quickly began applying

902
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:46,240
developed people quickly began applying
 

903
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,389
developed people quickly began applying
it to semiconductors and it was

904
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:48,399
it to semiconductors and it was
 

905
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,590
it to semiconductors and it was
broadly understood that these are

906
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
broadly understood that these are
 

907
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,269
broadly understood that these are
fascinating systems and people cared

908
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
fascinating systems and people cared
 

909
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,790
fascinating systems and people cared
about them for their basic physics but

910
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:52,800
about them for their basic physics but
 

911
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,590
about them for their basic physics but
also

912
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
also
 

913
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,910
also
their utility is devices and then the

914
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:55,920
their utility is devices and then the
 

915
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,189
their utility is devices and then the
transistor was invented in the late 40s

916
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
transistor was invented in the late 40s
 

917
00:15:59,199 --> 00:15:59,990
transistor was invented in the late 40s
in a

918
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
in a
 

919
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,910
in a
relatively crude experimental setup

920
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
relatively crude experimental setup
 

921
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,150
relatively crude experimental setup
where you just crammed a metal electrode

922
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,160
where you just crammed a metal electrode
 

923
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,870
where you just crammed a metal electrode
into the semiconductor and and that was

924
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
into the semiconductor and and that was
 

925
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,790
into the semiconductor and and that was
that was ingenious these people were

926
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
that was ingenious these people were
 

927
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,870
that was ingenious these people were
able to um

928
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:10,880
able to um
 

929
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,949
able to um
make it work you know uh

930
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
make it work you know uh
 

931
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,310
make it work you know uh
but so

932
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
but so
 

933
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,749
but so
what what i want to get to that that

934
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
what what i want to get to that that
 

935
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,230
what what i want to get to that that
really strikes me is that in those early

936
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
really strikes me is that in those early
 

937
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,509
really strikes me is that in those early
days

938
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
days
 

939
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,389
days
there were a number of different

940
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
there were a number of different
 

941
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,509
there were a number of different
semiconductors that were being

942
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:21,519
semiconductors that were being
 

943
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,110
semiconductors that were being
considered they had different properties

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,120
considered they had different properties
 

945
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,790
considered they had different properties
different strengths different weaknesses

00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:28,639
the way to go
 

951
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,749
the way to go
it it had some some nice properties uh

952
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
it it had some some nice properties uh
 

953
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,829
it it had some some nice properties uh
related to things

954
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:33,839
related to things
 

955
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,910
related to things
about how the electrons move inside the

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:35,920
about how the electrons move inside the

semiconductors with group 3 and group 5
 

963
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,509
semiconductors with group 3 and group 5
also had really really extraordinary um

964
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
also had really really extraordinary um
 

965
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,829
also had really really extraordinary um
properties that might be conducive to to

properties that might be conducive to to
 

967
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,550
properties that might be conducive to to
making the best devices so there were

968
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
making the best devices so there were
 

969
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,389
making the best devices so there were
different groups exploring each of these

different groups exploring each of these
 

971
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:53,910
different groups exploring each of these
and that's great that's how science

972
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:53,920
and that's great that's how science
 

973

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,870
works you have to cast a broad net but
then

976
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:56,880
then
 

977
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,749
then
what i what i find striking is why why

978

is it that silicon
 

981
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,670
is it that silicon
won because it's not that it's not that

there's there's an important parameter
 

1033
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,830
there's there's an important parameter
which is called the band gap which tells

which is called the band gap which tells
 

1035
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,909
which is called the band gap which tells
you uh if you they're they're sort of

electrons that fill up to one level in
 

1039
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,750
electrons that fill up to one level in
in the energy

1040
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:03,760
in the energy
 

1041
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,590
in the energy
diagram and then there's a gap where

1042
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
diagram and then there's a gap where
 

1043
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,029
diagram and then there's a gap where
electrons aren't allowed to have an

1044
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
electrons aren't allowed to have an
 

1045
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,310
electrons aren't allowed to have an
energy in a certain range and then

1046
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
energy in a certain range and then
 

1047
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,190
energy in a certain range and then
there's another energy level above that

1048
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:11,200
there's another energy level above that
 

1049
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,350
there's another energy level above that
and that that difference between the

1050
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
and that that difference between the
 

1051
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,270
and that that difference between the
lower sort of filled level and the

1052
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
lower sort of filled level and the
 

1053
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,070
lower sort of filled level and the
unoccupied level that tells you how much

1054
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
unoccupied level that tells you how much
 

1055
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,070
unoccupied level that tells you how much
voltage you have to apply in order to

1056
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:20,080
voltage you have to apply in order to
 

1057
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,070
voltage you have to apply in order to
induce a current to flow

1058
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,080
induce a current to flow
 

1059
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,990
induce a current to flow
so with germanium that's about 0.75

1060
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:26,000
so with germanium that's about 0.75
 

1061
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,669
so with germanium that's about 0.75
electron volts that means you have to

1062
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
electron volts that means you have to
 

1063
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,630
electron volts that means you have to
apply 0.75 volts to to get a current

1064
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
apply 0.75 volts to to get a current
 

1065
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,830
apply 0.75 volts to to get a current
moving

1066
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
moving
 

1067
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,350
moving
and it turns out that

1068
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:33,360
and it turns out that
 

1069
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,350
and it turns out that
if you compare that to the

1070
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:35,360
if you compare that to the
 

1071
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,390
if you compare that to the
the thermal excitations that are induced

1072
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:38,400
the thermal excitations that are induced
 

1073
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,590
the thermal excitations that are induced
just by the temperature of our

1074
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:39,600
just by the temperature of our
 

1075
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,669
just by the temperature of our
environment that gap's not quite big

1076
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
environment that gap's not quite big
 

1077
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,270

enough you start to

1078
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:43,280
enough you start to
 

1079
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,350
enough you start to
use it to perform computations it gets a

1080
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
use it to perform computations it gets a
 

1081
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,789
use it to perform computations it gets a
little hot and you get all these

1082
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:46,799
little hot and you get all these
 

1083
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,710
little hot and you get all these
accidental carriers that are excited

1084
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:48,720
accidental carriers that are excited
 

1085
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,029
accidental carriers that are excited
into the the conduction band and it

1086
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:51,039
into the the conduction band and it
 

1087
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,350
into the the conduction band and it
causes errors in your computation

1088
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:53,360
causes errors in your computation
 

1089
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,750
causes errors in your computation
silicon's band gap is just a little

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:55,760
silicon's band gap is just a little
 

1091
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,750
silicon's band gap is just a little
higher 1.1

1092
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
higher 1.1
 

1093
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,669
higher 1.1
electron volts but you have an

1094
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
electron volts but you have an
 

1095
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,470
electron volts but you have an
exponential dependence on the

1096
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
exponential dependence on the
 

1097
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,070
exponential dependence on the
the number of carriers that are present

1098
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
the number of carriers that are present
 

1099
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,230
the number of carriers that are present
that can induce those errors

1100
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
that can induce those errors
 

1101
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,909
that can induce those errors
uh it decays exponentially with that

1102
00:19:07,909 --> 00:19:07,919
uh it decays exponentially with that
 

1103
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,390
uh it decays exponentially with that
voltage so just that that slight extra

1104
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:10,400
voltage so just that that slight extra
 

1105
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,789
voltage so just that that slight extra
energy in that band gap

1106
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:12,799
energy in that band gap
 

1107
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,270
energy in that band gap
really puts it in an ideal position to

1108
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
really puts it in an ideal position to
 

1109
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,029
really puts it in an ideal position to
be operated

1110
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:17,039
be operated
 

1111
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,270
be operated
in the in the conditions of our of our

1112
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:19,280
in the in the conditions of our of our
 

1113
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,470
in the in the conditions of our of our
ambient environment it's kind of

1114
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:20,480
ambient environment it's kind of
 

1115
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,390
ambient environment it's kind of
fascinating that so like you mentioned

1116
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
fascinating that so like you mentioned
 

1117
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,909
fascinating that so like you mentioned
air is um decrease exponentially

1118
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
air is um decrease exponentially
 

1119
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,870
air is um decrease exponentially
uh with the voltage so

1120
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
uh with the voltage so
 

1121
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,710
uh with the voltage so
it's funny because this error thing

1122
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
it's funny because this error thing
 

1123
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,549
it's funny because this error thing
comes up you know when you start talking

1124
00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:32,559
comes up you know when you start talking
 

1125
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,549
comes up you know when you start talking
about quantum computing

1126
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
about quantum computing
 

1127
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:35,909
about quantum computing
it's kind of amazing that everything

1128
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:35,919
it's kind of amazing that everything
 

1129
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,990
it's kind of amazing that everything
we've been talking about the errors as

1130
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:38,000
we've been talking about the errors as
 

1131
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,430
we've been talking about the errors as
we scale down seems to be extremely low

1132
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:41,440
we scale down seems to be extremely low
 

1133
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,350
we scale down seems to be extremely low
yes and like all of our computation

1134
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,360
yes and like all of our computation
 

1135
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,789
yes and like all of our computation
is based on the assumption that it's

1136
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:46,799
is based on the assumption that it's
 

1137
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,870
is based on the assumption that it's
extremely low yes so it's not digital

1138
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:48,880
extremely low yes so it's not digital
 

1139
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,549
extremely low yes so it's not digital
computation digital sorry digital

1140
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:50,559
computation digital sorry digital
 

1141
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,789
computation digital sorry digital
computation so as opposed to our

1142
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
computation so as opposed to our
 

1143
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,590
computation so as opposed to our
biological computation our brain is like

1144
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
biological computation our brain is like
 

1145
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,230
biological computation our brain is like
the assumption is stuff is gonna fail

1146
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
the assumption is stuff is gonna fail
 

1147
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,909
the assumption is stuff is gonna fail
all over the place and we somehow have

1148
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
all over the place and we somehow have
 

1149
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,909
all over the place and we somehow have
to still be robust to that that's

1150
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
to still be robust to that that's
 

1151
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,470
to still be robust to that that's
exactly right so this also this is gonna

1152
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:04,480
exactly right so this also this is gonna
 

1153
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,909
exactly right so this also this is gonna
be the most controversial part of our

1154
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:05,919

some enemies so let me ask because we've

1158
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
some enemies so let me ask because we've
 

1159
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,630
some enemies so let me ask because we've
been talking about physics and

1160
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
been talking about physics and
 

1161
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,909
been talking about physics and
engineering

1162
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919

 

1163
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,750

a which group of people is smarter and

a which group of people is smarter and
 

1165
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,669
a which group of people is smarter and
more important for this one

1166
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
more important for this one
 

1167
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,549
more important for this one
let me ask the question in a better way

1168
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
let me ask the question in a better way
 

1169
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,110
let me ask the question in a better way

all that space so we argue about this
 

1189
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,630
all that space so we argue about this
all the time so what do you think who

1190
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:42,640
all the time so what do you think who
 

1191
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,029
all the time so what do you think who
gets more credit i'm genuinely not

1192
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
gets more credit i'm genuinely not

trying to just be politically correct
 

1195
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,029
trying to just be politically correct
here i don't see how you would have

1196
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:49,039
here i don't see how you would have
 

1197
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,390
here i don't see how you would have
any of the

1198
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400
any of the
 

1199
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,830
any of the
what we consider sort of the great

1200
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:51,840
what we consider sort of the great
 

1201

accomplishments of society without both
 

1203
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,430
accomplishments of society without both
and you absolutely need both of those

1204
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:55,440
and you absolutely need both of those
 

1205
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,149
and you absolutely need both of those
things physics tends to play a key role

1206
00:20:58,149 --> 00:20:58,159
things physics tends to play a key role

take over

1212
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
take over
 

1213
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,270
take over
and uh i mean

1214
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:07,280
and uh i mean
 

1215
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,590
and uh i mean
the invention of the transistor or

1216
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:09,600
the invention of the transistor or
 

1217
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,950
the invention of the transistor or
actually even before that the

1218
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:10,960
actually even before that the
 

1219
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,789
actually even before that the
understanding of semiconductor physics

1220
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
understanding of semiconductor physics
 

1221
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,070
understanding of semiconductor physics
that allowed the invention of the

1222
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:14,080
that allowed the invention of the
 

1223
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,750
that allowed the invention of the
transistor that's all physics so if you

1224
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:15,760
transistor that's all physics so if you
 

1225
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,510
transistor that's all physics so if you
didn't have that physics you don't even

1226
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
didn't have that physics you don't even
 

1227
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,310
didn't have that physics you don't even
get to get on the on the on the field

1228
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:20,320
get to get on the on the on the field
 

1229
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,110
get to get on the on the on the field
but

1230
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:21,120
but
 

1231
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,710
but
once you have

1232
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
once you have
 

1233
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,630
once you have
understood and demonstrated that this is

1234
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
understood and demonstrated that this is
 

1235
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,390
understood and demonstrated that this is
in principle possible

1236
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
in principle possible
 

1237
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,310
in principle possible
moore's law is engineering that

moore's law is engineering that
 

1239
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,630
moore's law is engineering that
why we have uh

1240
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:30,640
why we have uh
 

1241
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,950
why we have uh
computers more powerful than

computers more powerful than
 

1243
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,430
computers more powerful than
than old supercomputers in each of our

1244
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
than old supercomputers in each of our
 

1245
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,630
than old supercomputers in each of our
phones is that's all engineering and

1246
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
phones is that's all engineering and
 

1247
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,310
phones is that's all engineering and
i i think i would

1248
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,320
i i think i would
 

1249
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,549
i i think i would
be quite foolish to say that

1250
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:42,559
be quite foolish to say that
 

1251
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,350
be quite foolish to say that
that's

1252
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
that's
 

1253
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,110
that's
i mean that that's not valuable if it's

1254
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,120
i mean that that's not valuable if it's
 

1255
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,029
i mean that that's not valuable if it's
not a great contribution uh it's a

1256
00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:47,039
not a great contribution uh it's a
 

1257
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,549
not a great contribution uh it's a
beautiful dance would you put like

does that whole process work to
 

1269
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,190
does that whole process work to
understand that it has all these nice

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:32,480
integrated deeply okay so let's return
 

1305
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,070
integrated deeply okay so let's return
you mentioned this uh word

1306
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:34,080
you mentioned this uh word
 

1307
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,590
you mentioned this uh word

so what does that have to do

1310
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
so what does that have to do
 

1311
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,190
so what does that have to do
with what we're talking about right okay

1312
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
with what we're talking about right okay
 

1313
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,750
with what we're talking about right okay
so in a semiconductor as i

1314
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
so in a semiconductor as i
 

1315
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,230
so in a semiconductor as i

you can sort of uh

1318
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:47,039
you can sort of uh
 

1319
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,990
you can sort of uh
in induce currents by applying voltages

1320
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,000
in induce currents by applying voltages
 

1321
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,590
in induce currents by applying voltages
and those have sort of typical

00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:51,600
and those have sort of typical
 

1323
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,230
and those have sort of typical
properties that you would expect from

1324
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:54,240
properties that you would expect from
 

1325
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,950
properties that you would expect from
some kind of a conductor those electrons

1326
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:56,960
some kind of a conductor those electrons
 

1327
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,870
some kind of a conductor those electrons
they don't just flow

1328
00:22:58,870 --> 00:22:58,880
they don't just flow
 

1329
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,630
they don't just flow
perfectly without dissipation if an

00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:04,880
in the lattice or another electron it's
 

1335
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,990
in the lattice or another electron it's
going to slow down it's going to lose

1337
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,510
going to slow down it's going to lose
its momentum so you have to keep

1338
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:07,520
its momentum so you have to keep
 

1339
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,149
its momentum so you have to keep
applying that voltage in order to keep

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,549
the current flowing in a superconductor
something different happens if you get a

1344
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:14,559
something different happens if you get a
 

1345
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,710
something different happens if you get a
current to start flowing it will

1346
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
current to start flowing it will
 

1347
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,549
current to start flowing it will
continue to flow indefinitely there's

1348
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
continue to flow indefinitely there's
 

1349
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,710
continue to flow indefinitely there's
there's no dissipation so

1350
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:20,720
there's no dissipation so
 

1351
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,070
there's no dissipation so
that's crazy how does that happen well

1352
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,080
that's crazy how does that happen well
 

1353
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,149
that's crazy how does that happen well
it happens at low temperature and this

1354
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
it happens at low temperature and this
 

1355
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,029
it happens at low temperature and this
is crucial it has to it has to be a

1356
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:29,039
is crucial it has to it has to be a
 

1357
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,430
is crucial it has to it has to be a
quite low temperature and

quite low temperature and
 

1359
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,669
quite low temperature and
what what i'm talking about there i

1360
00:23:33,669 --> 00:23:33,679
what what i'm talking about there i
 

1361
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,669
what what i'm talking about there i
for essentially all of our conversation

1362
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
for essentially all of our conversation
 

1363
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,710
for essentially all of our conversation
i'm going to be talking about

00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:36,720
i'm going to be talking about
 

1365
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,750
i'm going to be talking about
conventional superconductors um

1366
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:39,760

1367
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,149
conventional superconductors um
sometimes called low tc superconductors

1368
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
sometimes called low tc superconductors
 

1369

low critical temperature superconductors
and so

1372
00:23:46,549 --> 00:23:46,559
and so
 

1373
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,630
and so
those materials have to be

1374
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:48,640
those materials have to be
 

1375
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,510

1379
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,110

1381
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,630
might be 10 kelvin something like that
but you want to operate them at around 4

1382
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:56,640
but you want to operate them at around 4
 

1383

kelvin 4 degrees above absolute zero and
 

1385
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,789
kelvin 4 degrees above absolute zero and
what happens at

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,909
it's part of a macroscopic quantum state
and the entire quantum state was not

1480
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:35,919
and the entire quantum state was not
 

1481
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,909
and the entire quantum state was not
scattered by that defect so you can get

1482
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
scattered by that defect so you can get
 

1483
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,630
scattered by that defect so you can get
a current that flows without dissipation

1484
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
a current that flows without dissipation
 

1485
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,029
a current that flows without dissipation
and that's called a supercurrent

1486
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:43,039
and that's called a supercurrent
 

1487
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,909
and that's called a supercurrent
that's

1488
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:43,919
that's
 

1489
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:44,710
that's
uh

1490
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
uh
 

1491
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,870
uh
sort of just very much scratching the

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:46,880
sort of just very much scratching the
 

1493
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,070
sort of just very much scratching the
surface of of superconductivity there's

1494
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
surface of of superconductivity there's
 

1495
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,149
surface of of superconductivity there's
very deep and rich physics there which

1496
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:52,159
very deep and rich physics there which
 

1497
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,590
very deep and rich physics there which

the main subject we need to go into
 

1501
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,430
the main subject we need to go into

things like make wires out of it so you

1508
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,000
things like make wires out of it so you
 

1509
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,669
things like make wires out of it so you
can get current to flow in a straight

let me just briefly say what a joseph's

1558
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:58,640
let me just briefly say what a joseph's
 

1559
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,310
let me just briefly say what a joseph's
injunction is and we can talk about

1560
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
injunction is and we can talk about
 

1561
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,149

different ways that they can be used
 

1563
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,310
different ways that they can be used
basically if you have a superconducting

1564
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:04,320
basically if you have a superconducting
 

1565
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,269
basically if you have a superconducting
wire and then a small

1566
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:07,279
wire and then a small
 

1567
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:08,789
wire and then a small
gap of

1568
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:08,799
gap of
 

1569
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,070

a different material that's not
 

1571
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,630
a different material that's not
superconducting an insulator or normal

1572
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:12,640
superconducting an insulator or normal
 

1573
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,710
superconducting an insulator or normal
metal and then another superconducting

1574
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:14,720
metal and then another superconducting
 

1575
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,470
metal and then another superconducting
wire on the other side that's a joseph's

1576
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:16,480
wire on the other side that's a joseph's
 

1577
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,470
wire on the other side that's a joseph's
injunction so it's sometimes referred to

1578
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:18,480
injunction so it's sometimes referred to
 

1579
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,549
injunction so it's sometimes referred to
as a superconducting weak link so you

1580
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:20,559
as a superconducting weak link so you
 

1581
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:21,830
as a superconducting weak link so you
have this

1582
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
have this
 

1583
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,310
have this
superconducting state on one side and on

1584
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:24,320
superconducting state on one side and on
 

1585
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,430
superconducting state on one side and on
the other side and that the

1586
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
the other side and that the
 

1587
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,510
the other side and that the
superconducting wave function

1588
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,520
superconducting wave function
 

1589
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,950
superconducting wave function
actually tunnels across that gap and

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:30,960
actually tunnels across that gap and
 

1591
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,630
actually tunnels across that gap and
when you when you create such a physical

1592
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:34,640
when you when you create such a physical
 

1593
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,750
when you when you create such a physical
entity it has very unusual

like like weird stuff through the entire
 

1603
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,549
like like weird stuff through the entire

1604
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
circuit so you can imagine suppose you
 

1605
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,789

had a loop set up that had one of those

1606
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
had a loop set up that had one of those
 

1607
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,110
had a loop set up that had one of those
weak links in in the loop

1608
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:51,120
weak links in in the loop
 

1609
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,190
weak links in in the loop
current would flow in that loop

1610
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,200
current would flow in that loop
 

1611
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,789
current would flow in that loop
independent even if you hadn't applied a

1613
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,070
independent even if you hadn't applied a
voltage to it and that's called the

1614
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
voltage to it and that's called the
 

1615
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,070
voltage to it and that's called the
josephson effect so the fact that

1616
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:58,080
josephson effect so the fact that
 

1617
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,590
josephson effect so the fact that
there's this

1618
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
there's this
 

1619
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,750
there's this
phase difference in the quantum wave

1620
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:01,760
phase difference in the quantum wave
 

1621

exactly so how do you change state now

1628
00:28:09,669 --> 00:28:09,679

00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,320
and now i make another wire that goes
 

1641
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,990
and now i make another wire that goes
around the joseph's injunction so i have

1642
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,000
around the joseph's injunction so i have
 

1643
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,549
around the joseph's injunction so i have
a loop here a superconducting loop

1644
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:24,559
a loop here a superconducting loop
 

1645
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,310
a loop here a superconducting loop
i can add

1646
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:26,320
i can add
 

1647
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,029
i can add
current to that loop by exceeding the

1648
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
current to that loop by exceeding the
 

1649
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:30,310
current to that loop by exceeding the
critical current of that joseph's

1650
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
critical current of that joseph's
 

1651
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,590
critical current of that joseph's
injunction so

1652
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
injunction so
 

1653
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,950
injunction so
like any superconducting material

1654
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
like any superconducting material
 

1655
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,110
like any superconducting material
it can carry this supercurrent that i've

1656
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,120
it can carry this supercurrent that i've
 

1657
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,870
it can carry this supercurrent that i've
described this current that can

1658
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:38,880
described this current that can
 

1659
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,870
described this current that can
propagate without dissipation up to a

1660
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:40,880
propagate without dissipation up to a
 

1661
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,789
propagate without dissipation up to a
certain level and if you try and pass

1662
00:28:42,789 --> 00:28:42,799
certain level and if you try and pass
 

1663
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,789
certain level and if you try and pass
more current than that through the

1664
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
more current than that through the
 

1665
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,230
more current than that through the
material it's going to become a

1666
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:48,240
material it's going to become a
 

1667
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,230
material it's going to become a
resistive material a normal normal

1668
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:50,240
resistive material a normal normal
 

1669
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,470
resistive material a normal normal
material so in the in the joseph's

1670
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:52,480
material so in the in the joseph's
 

1671
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,029
material so in the in the joseph's
injunction the same thing happens i can

1672
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
injunction the same thing happens i can
 

1673
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,269
injunction the same thing happens i can
bias it above its critical current and

1674
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:57,279
bias it above its critical current and
 

1675
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,269
bias it above its critical current and
then what it's going to do it's going to

1676
00:28:59,269 --> 00:28:59,279
then what it's going to do it's going to
 

1677
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,269
then what it's going to do it's going to
add a

1678
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
add a
 

1679
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,909
add a
quantized amount of current into that

1680
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
quantized amount of current into that
 

1681
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,230
quantized amount of current into that
loop and what i mean by quantized is

1682
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:06,240
loop and what i mean by quantized is
 

1683
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,870
loop and what i mean by quantized is
it's going to come in discrete packets

1684
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:08,880
it's going to come in discrete packets
 

1685
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,430
it's going to come in discrete packets
with a well-defined value of current so

1686
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:11,440
with a well-defined value of current so
 

1687
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,549
with a well-defined value of current so
in the

1688
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559

you would say

1694
00:29:18,149 --> 00:29:18,159
you would say
 

1695
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,470
you would say
you pop a flux on into the loop so a

1696
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:20,480
you pop a flux on into the loop so a
 

1697
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,669
you pop a flux on into the loop so a
flux on you pop a flux on into the loop

1698
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
flux on you pop a flux on into the loop
 

1699
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,350
flux on you pop a flux on into the loop
yeah so if that's a skateboarder

1700
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:27,360
yeah so if that's a skateboarder
 

1701
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,789
yeah so if that's a skateboarder
sorry go ahead

1702
00:29:28,789 --> 00:29:28,799
sorry go ahead
 

1703
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,590
sorry go ahead
a flux on is one of these quantized

1704
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:31,600
a flux on is one of these quantized
 

1705
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,230
a flux on is one of these quantized
uh sort of uh amounts of current that

1706
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
uh sort of uh amounts of current that
 

1707
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,750
uh sort of uh amounts of current that
you can add to a loop and this is a

1708
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
you can add to a loop and this is a
 

1709
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,110
you can add to a loop and this is a
cartoon picture but i think it's

1710
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:37,120
cartoon picture but i think it's
 

1711
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,269
cartoon picture but i think it's
sufficient for our purposes so which uh

1712
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
sufficient for our purposes so which uh
 

1713
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,669
sufficient for our purposes so which uh
maybe it's useful to say

1714
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
maybe it's useful to say
 

1715
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,909
maybe it's useful to say
what is the speed at which these

1716
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:43,919
what is the speed at which these
 

1717
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,870
what is the speed at which these
discrete packets of current travel

1718
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
discrete packets of current travel
 

1719
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,630
discrete packets of current travel
because we'll be talking about light a

1720
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:48,640
because we'll be talking about light a
 

1721
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,470
because we'll be talking about light a
little bit it seems like the speed is

1722
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:50,480
little bit it seems like the speed is
 

1723
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,990
little bit it seems like the speed is
important the speed is important that's

1724
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
important the speed is important that's
 

1725
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,430
important the speed is important that's
an excellent question

1726
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
an excellent question
 

1727
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,590
an excellent question
sometimes i wonder where you

1728
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:55,600
sometimes i wonder where you
 

1729
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,750
sometimes i wonder where you
how you became so astute

1730
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
how you became so astute
 

1731
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,070
how you became so astute
but um so

1732
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
but um so
 

1733
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,029
but um so
this uh matrix four is coming out so

1734
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:03,039
this uh matrix four is coming out so
 

1735
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,269
this uh matrix four is coming out so
maybe that's related i'm not sure i'm

1736
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
maybe that's related i'm not sure i'm
 

1737
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,870
maybe that's related i'm not sure i'm
dressed for the job

1738
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:06,880
dressed for the job
 

1739
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,710
dressed for the job
i was trying to get to become an extra

1740
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
i was trying to get to become an extra
 

1741
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,549
i was trying to get to become an extra
matrix for it didn't work out

1742
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
matrix for it didn't work out
 

1743
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,789
matrix for it didn't work out
anyway uh so what's the speed of these

1744
00:30:12,789 --> 00:30:12,799
anyway uh so what's the speed of these
 

1745
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,950
anyway uh so what's the speed of these
packets you'll have to find another gig

1746
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:14,960
packets you'll have to find another gig
 

1747
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,190
packets you'll have to find another gig
i know i'm sorry um so the speed of the

1748
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,200
i know i'm sorry um so the speed of the
 

1749
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,909
i know i'm sorry um so the speed of the
pack is actually these flux ons these

1750
00:30:19,909 --> 00:30:19,919
pack is actually these flux ons these
 

1751
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,750
pack is actually these flux ons these
these uh sort of pulses of of um

1752
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:23,760
these uh sort of pulses of of um
 

1753
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,510
these uh sort of pulses of of um
current that are generated by joseph's

1754
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:25,520
current that are generated by joseph's
 

1755
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,750
current that are generated by joseph's
injunctions they can actually propagate

1756
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:27,760
injunctions they can actually propagate
 

1757
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,590
injunctions they can actually propagate
very close to the speed of light uh

1758
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
very close to the speed of light uh
 

1759
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,950
very close to the speed of light uh
maybe something like a third of the

1760
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:30,960
maybe something like a third of the
 

1761
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,669
maybe something like a third of the
speed of light that's quite fast so

1762
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:33,679
speed of light that's quite fast so
 

1763
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,510
speed of light that's quite fast so
one of the reasons why joseph's

1764
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:35,520
one of the reasons why joseph's
 

1765
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,389
one of the reasons why joseph's
injunctions are appealing is because

1766
00:30:38,389 --> 00:30:38,399
injunctions are appealing is because
 

1767
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,549
injunctions are appealing is because
their signals can propagate quite fast

1768
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:40,559
their signals can propagate quite fast
 

1769
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,029
their signals can propagate quite fast
and they can they can also switch very

1770
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
and they can they can also switch very
 

1771
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,269
and they can they can also switch very
fast what i mean by switch is perform

1772
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
fast what i mean by switch is perform
 

1773
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,029
fast what i mean by switch is perform
that operation that i described where

that operation that i described where
 

1775
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,430
that operation that i described where
you add current to the loop

1776
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
you add current to the loop
 

1777
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,149
you add current to the loop
that can happen within um

1778
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:52,159
that can happen within um
 

1779
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,190
that can happen within um
a few tens of picoseconds so you can get

1780
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
a few tens of picoseconds so you can get
 

1781
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,029
a few tens of picoseconds so you can get
you can get devices that operate in the

00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
you can get devices that operate in the
 

1783
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,110
you can get devices that operate in the
hundreds of gigahertz range and by

2021
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,109
um there are there are a lot of reasons
for that but i think ultimately what it

2022
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:09,119
for that but i think ultimately what it
 

2023
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,270
for that but i think ultimately what it
comes down to is all things considered

went back and read the literature i was
 

2115
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,630
went back and read the literature i was
just like wow this is this is so awesome

2116
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:52,640
just like wow this is this is so awesome
 

2117
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,910
just like wow this is this is so awesome
uh and so it you might think well

2118
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:55,920
uh and so it you might think well
 

2119
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,750
uh and so it you might think well
the reason why it didn't displace

2120
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:57,760
the reason why it didn't displace
 

2121
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,270
the reason why it didn't displace
silicon is because silicon already had

2122
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
silicon is because silicon already had
 

2123
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,589
silicon is because silicon already had
so much momentum at that time

2124
00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:01,599
so much momentum at that time
 

2125
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,750
so much momentum at that time
but that was the 90s silicon kept that

2126
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:03,760
but that was the 90s silicon kept that
 

2127
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,990
but that was the 90s silicon kept that
momentum because it had the simple way

2128
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,000
momentum because it had the simple way
 

2129
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,349
momentum because it had the simple way
to keep getting better you just make

2130
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:07,359
to keep getting better you just make
 

2131
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,910
to keep getting better you just make
features smaller and smaller so

2132
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
features smaller and smaller so
 

2133
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,670
features smaller and smaller so
you know it would have to be

2134
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
you know it would have to be
 

2135
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,870
you know it would have to be
i don't think it would have to be that

2136
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:12,880
i don't think it would have to be that
 

2137
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,270
i don't think it would have to be that
much better than silicon to displace it

2138
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
much better than silicon to displace it
 

2139
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,870
much better than silicon to displace it
but the problem is it's just not better

2140
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:16,880
but the problem is it's just not better
 

2141
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,390
but the problem is it's just not better
than silicon it might be better than

2142
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:18,400
than silicon it might be better than
 

2143
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,390
than silicon it might be better than

2309
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,710
are highly serial
meaning that data streams they don't

00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:18,560
you have to pull some information over
 

2315
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,150
you have to pull some information over
there and access memory from here and

00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,750
there and access memory from here and
stuff like that but

2318
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:21,760
stuff like that but
 

2319
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,510
stuff like that but
by and large the the computation

2320
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
by and large the the computation
 

2321
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,230
by and large the the computation
proceeds in a serial manner

it's not that way in the brain in the

2324
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
it's not that way in the brain in the
 

2325
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:28,710
it's not that way in the brain in the

brain
 

2327
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,790
brain
you're always drawing information from

2328
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
you're always drawing information from
 

2329
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,150
you're always drawing information from
different places it's much more

2330
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:32,160
different places it's much more
 

2331
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,390
different places it's much more
network-based computing neurons don't

2332
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:34,400
network-based computing neurons don't
 

2333
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,150
network-based computing neurons don't
wait for their turn they fire when

2334
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:36,160
wait for their turn they fire when
 

2335
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,150
wait for their turn they fire when
they're ready to fire and so it's it's

2336
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:38,160
they're ready to fire and so it's it's
 

2337
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,309
they're ready to fire and so it's it's
asynchronous so one of the other things

2338
00:40:40,309 --> 00:40:40,319
asynchronous so one of the other things
 

2339
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,230
asynchronous so one of the other things
about a digital system is you're

2340
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:42,240
about a digital system is you're
 

2341
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,390
about a digital system is you're
performing these operations on a clock

2342
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,400
performing these operations on a clock
 

2343
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,470
performing these operations on a clock
and that's a that's a crucial aspect of

2344
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
and that's a that's a crucial aspect of
 

2345
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,990
and that's a that's a crucial aspect of
it get rid of a clock in a digital

2346
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,000
it get rid of a clock in a digital
 

2347
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,470
it get rid of a clock in a digital
system nothing makes sense anymore the

2348
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
system nothing makes sense anymore the
 

2349
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,790
system nothing makes sense anymore the
brain has no clock it builds its own

2350
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:52,800
brain has no clock it builds its own
 

2351
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,470
brain has no clock it builds its own
time scales based on its internal

2352
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
time scales based on its internal
 

2353
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,829
time scales based on its internal
activity

2354
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
activity
 

2355
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,910
activity
so so you can think of the brain as kind

2356
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:57,920
so so you can think of the brain as kind
 

2357
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,030
so so you can think of the brain as kind
of uh

2358
00:40:59,030 --> 00:40:59,040
of uh
 

2359
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,589
of uh
like this like network computation where

2360
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:01,599
like this like network computation where
 

2361
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,510
like this like network computation where
it's actually really trivial simple

2362
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
it's actually really trivial simple
 

2363
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,950
it's actually really trivial simple
computers

2364

computers
 

2365
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,510
computers
uh just a huge number of them and

2366
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
uh just a huge number of them and
 

2367
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,030
uh just a huge number of them and
they're networked

2368
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:09,040
they're networked
 

2369
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,910
they're networked
i would say it is complex sophisticated

2370
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:11,920
i would say it is complex sophisticated
 

2371
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,750
i would say it is complex sophisticated
little processors and there's a huge

2372
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:13,760
little processors and there's a huge
 

2373
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,670
little processors and there's a huge
number of things neurons are not no

2374
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
number of things neurons are not no
 

2375
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,510
number of things neurons are not no
offense i don't mean to offend sure no

2376
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
offense i don't mean to offend sure no

they're very complicated and beautiful

2378
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
they're very complicated and beautiful
 

2379
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,390
they're very complicated and beautiful
and yeah but

2380
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:20,400
and yeah but
 

2381
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,470
and yeah but
we often oversimplify them yes they're

2382
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:22,480
we often oversimplify them yes they're
 

2383
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,390
we often oversimplify them yes they're
actually like there's computation

2384
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:24,400
actually like there's computation
 

2385
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,390
actually like there's computation
happening within a neuron right so i i

2386
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
happening within a neuron right so i i
 

2387
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,829
happening within a neuron right so i i
would say

2388
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:27,839
would say
 

2389
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,670
would say
to think of a a transistor as the

2390
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
to think of a a transistor as the
 

2391
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,750
to think of a a transistor as the
building block of a digital computer is

2392
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760

2393
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,589
building block of a digital computer is
accurate you use a few transistors to

2394
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
accurate you use a few transistors to
 

2395
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,829
accurate you use a few transistors to
make your logic gates you build up more

2396
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
make your logic gates you build up more
 

2397
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,750
make your logic gates you build up more
you build up processors from logic gates

2398
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:37,760
you build up processors from logic gates
 

2399
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,829
you build up processors from logic gates
and things like that so you can think of

2400
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:39,839
and things like that so you can think of
 

2401
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:41,829
and things like that so you can think of
a transistor as a fundamental building

a transistor as a fundamental building
 

2403

00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,000
block or you can think of as we get into
 

2405
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,230

more highly parallelized architectures
 

2407
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,750
more highly parallelized architectures
you can think of a processor as a

you can think of a processor as a
 

2409
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,670
you can think of a processor as a
fundamental building block to make the

on many different spatial and temporal
scales and produce many different kinds

2438
00:42:20,069 --> 00:42:20,079
scales and produce many different kinds
 

2439
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,230
scales and produce many different kinds
of outputs so that they can perform

2440
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:22,240
of outputs so that they can perform
 

2441
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,230
of outputs so that they can perform
different computations in different

2442
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:24,240
different computations in different
 

2443
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,710
different computations in different
contexts so this is where it enters this

2444
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
contexts so this is where it enters this
 

2445
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,349
contexts so this is where it enters this
distinction between computation and

2446
00:42:29,349 --> 00:42:29,359
distinction between computation and
 

2447
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,550
distinction between computation and
communication

2448
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:30,560
communication
 

2449
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:32,710
communication
so you can think of neurons performing

2450
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
so you can think of neurons performing
 

2451
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,069
so you can think of neurons performing
computation

2452
00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:34,079

00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:37,920
networking the interconnectivity of
 

2457
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,790

and you see this with very large server

2460
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
and you see this with very large server

i've been talking to jim keller whose
dream is to build giant computers that

2466
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:48,880
dream is to build giant computers that
 

2467
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,230
dream is to build giant computers that
uh you know

2468
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:50,240
uh you know
 

2469
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,670
uh you know
the bottom like there's often the

2470
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:51,680
the bottom like there's often the
 

2471
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,270
the bottom like there's often the
communication between the different

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
communication between the different
 

2473
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,710

pieces of computing

2474
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
pieces of computing
 

2475
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,270
pieces of computing
so in this paper that we mentioned

2476
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:57,280
so in this paper that we mentioned
 

2477
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,510
so in this paper that we mentioned
optoelectronic intelligence

2478
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
optoelectronic intelligence
 

2479
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,190
optoelectronic intelligence
you say electrons excel at computation

2480
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:03,200
you say electrons excel at computation
 

2481
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,069
you say electrons excel at computation
while

2482
00:43:04,069 --> 00:43:04,079
while
 

2483
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:05,109
while
light

2484
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
light
 

2485
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,390
light
is excellent for communication

2486
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:08,400
is excellent for communication
 

2487
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,390
is excellent for communication
maybe you can linger and say in this

2488
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,400
maybe you can linger and say in this
 

2489
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,230
maybe you can linger and say in this
context what do you mean by computation

2490
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:12,240
context what do you mean by computation
 

2491
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,990
context what do you mean by computation
and communication

2492
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:14,000
and communication
 

2493
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,270
and communication
what what are electrons what is light

2494
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
what what are electrons what is light
 

2495
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,630
what what are electrons what is light
and why do they excel at those two tasks

2496
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,640
and why do they excel at those two tasks
 

2497
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,870
and why do they excel at those two tasks
yeah just to to first speak to

2498
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
yeah just to to first speak to
 

2499
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,510
yeah just to to first speak to
computation versus communication

2500
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
computation versus communication
 

2501
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,710
computation versus communication
i would say computation is essentially

2502
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
i would say computation is essentially
 

2503
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,309
i would say computation is essentially
taking in

2504
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
taking in
 

2505
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,390
taking in
some information

2506
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
some information
 

2507
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,069
some information
performing operations on that

2508
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
performing operations on that
 

2509
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,190
performing operations on that
information and producing new

2510
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
information and producing new
 

2511
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,430
information and producing new
hopefully more useful information so for

2512
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:39,440
hopefully more useful information so for
 

2513
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,710
hopefully more useful information so for
example

2514
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:40,720
example
 

2515
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,990
example
um

2516
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:42,000
um
 

2517
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,309
um
imagine you have a picture in front of

2518
00:43:44,309 --> 00:43:44,319
imagine you have a picture in front of
 

2519
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:45,030
imagine you have a picture in front of
you

2520
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
you
 

2521
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,309
you
and

2522
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
and
 

2523
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,309
and
there is a key in it and that's what

2524
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
there is a key in it and that's what
 

2525
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,510
there is a key in it and that's what
you're looking for for whatever reason

2526
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
you're looking for for whatever reason
 

2527
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,710
you're looking for for whatever reason
you want to you want to find the key we

2528
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:50,720
you want to you want to find the key we
 

2529
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,510
you want to you want to find the key we
all want to find the key so

2530
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
all want to find the key so
 

2531
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,390
all want to find the key so
the input is that that entire picture

2532
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
the input is that that entire picture
 

2533
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,150
the input is that that entire picture
and the output might be the coordinates

2534
00:43:58,150 --> 00:43:58,160
and the output might be the coordinates
 

2535
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,150
and the output might be the coordinates
where the key is so you've reduced the

2536
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:00,160
where the key is so you've reduced the
 

2537
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,510
where the key is so you've reduced the
total amount of information you have but

2538
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:01,520
total amount of information you have but
 

2539
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:03,349
total amount of information you have but
you found the useful information for you

2540
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
you found the useful information for you
 

2541
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,950
you found the useful information for you
in that present moment that's the useful

2542
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:04,960
in that present moment that's the useful
 

2543
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,150
in that present moment that's the useful

2567
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,109
um that's a very simplified example a

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,829
you're in the world and you're trying to
decide the best way to

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:36,309
decide the best way to
live your life you know that it might be

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,750
live your life you know that it might be
interactive it might be there might be

00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:37,760
interactive it might be there might be
 

2577
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,910
interactive it might be there might be
some recurrence or some weird

2578
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:39,920
some recurrence or some weird
 

2579
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,990
some recurrence or some weird
asynchrony i got it so but there's an

2580
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,000
asynchrony i got it so but there's an
 

2581
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,510
asynchrony i got it so but there's an
input and there's an output and you do

2582
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:43,520
input and there's an output and you do
 

2583
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,870
input and there's an output and you do
some stuff in the middle that yeah it

2584
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:44,880
some stuff in the middle that yeah it
 

2585
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,150
some stuff in the middle that yeah it
goes from the input to the app you've

2586
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
goes from the input to the app you've
 

2587
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,829
goes from the input to the app you've
taken in information and output

2588
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:47,839
taken in information and output
 

2589
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:50,550
taken in information and output
different information hopefully reducing

2590
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:50,560
different information hopefully reducing
 

2591
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,829
different information hopefully reducing
the total amount of information and

2592
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:51,839
the total amount of information and
 

2593
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,750
the total amount of information and
extracting what's useful yeah

2594
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:53,760
extracting what's useful yeah
 

2595
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,829
extracting what's useful yeah
communication is then

2596
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
communication is then
 

2597
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,990
communication is then
getting that information from the

2598
00:44:57,990 --> 00:44:58,000
getting that information from the
 

2599
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,829
getting that information from the
location in which it's stored because

2600
00:44:59,829 --> 00:44:59,839
location in which it's stored because

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,990
location in which it's stored because
information is physical as landauer

2602
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:02,000
information is physical as landauer
 

2603
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,309
information is physical as landauer
emphasized and so it is more in one

2604
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:04,319
emphasized and so it is more in one
 

2605
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:05,910
emphasized and so it is more in one
place and you need to get that

2606
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
place and you need to get that
 

2607
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,069
place and you need to get that
information to another place so that

2608
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:08,079
information to another place so that
 

2609
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,589
information to another place so that
something else can

2610
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
something else can
 

2611
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,430
something else can
use it for whatever computation it's

2612
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:11,440
use it for whatever computation it's
 

2613
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,950
use it for whatever computation it's
working on maybe it's part of the same

2614
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:12,960
working on maybe it's part of the same
 

2615
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,230
working on maybe it's part of the same
network and you're all trying to solve

2616
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
network and you're all trying to solve
 

2617
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,589
network and you're all trying to solve
the same problem but neuron a over here

2618
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
the same problem but neuron a over here
 

2619
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,430
the same problem but neuron a over here
just

2620
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
just
 

2621
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,589
just
deduced something based on its inputs

2622
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
deduced something based on its inputs
 

2623
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,069
deduced something based on its inputs
and it's now sending that information

2624
00:45:24,069 --> 00:45:24,079
and it's now sending that information
 

2625
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,390
and it's now sending that information
across the network to another location

2626
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
across the network to another location
 

2627
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,670
across the network to another location
so that would be the act of

2628
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:27,680
so that would be the act of
 

2629
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,750
so that would be the act of
communication can you linger on landau

2630
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
communication can you linger on landau
 

2631
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,150
communication can you linger on landau
and saying information is physical roth

2632
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:32,160
and saying information is physical roth
 

2633
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,150
and saying information is physical roth
landauer not to be confused with lev

2634
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
landauer not to be confused with lev

00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,710
landau
yeah and he he

2638
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
yeah and he he
 

2639
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,950
yeah and he he
made huge contributions to our our

2640
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:38,960
made huge contributions to our our
 

2641
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,950
made huge contributions to our our
understanding of

2642
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
understanding of
 

2643
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,270
understanding of
the reversibility of information in in

2644
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
the reversibility of information in in
 

2645
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,109
the reversibility of information in in
this concept that

2646
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:45,119
this concept that
 

2647
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,750
this concept that
energy has to be dissipated in computing

2648
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:47,760
energy has to be dissipated in computing
 

2649
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,150
energy has to be dissipated in computing
when the computation is irreversible but

2650
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
when the computation is irreversible but
 

2651
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,069
when the computation is irreversible but
if you can manage to make it reversible

2652
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
if you can manage to make it reversible
 

2653
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,950
if you can manage to make it reversible
then you you don't need to expend energy

2654
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:54,960
then you you don't need to expend energy
 

2655
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,150
then you you don't need to expend energy
but if you

2656
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,160
but if you
 

2657
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,030
but if you
um

2658
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
um
 

2659
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,030
um
if you do expend energy to perform a

2660
00:45:59,030 --> 00:45:59,040
if you do expend energy to perform a
 

2661
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,030
if you do expend energy to perform a
computation there's sort of a minimal

2662
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:01,040
computation there's sort of a minimal
 

2663
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,349
computation there's sort of a minimal
amount that you have to do and it's kt

2664
00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:03,359
amount that you have to do and it's kt
 

2665
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,069
amount that you have to do and it's kt
log2 and it's all somehow related to the

2666
00:46:06,069 --> 00:46:06,079
log2 and it's all somehow related to the
 

2667
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,829
log2 and it's all somehow related to the
second law of thermodynamics and that

2668
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
second law of thermodynamics and that
 

2669
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,589
second law of thermodynamics and that
the universe is an information process

2670
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:09,599
the universe is an information process
 

2671
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:11,430
the universe is an information process
and then we're living in a simulation

2672
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:11,440
and then we're living in a simulation
 

2673

00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:14,160
so okay sorry sorry for that tangent so
 

2675
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,150
so okay sorry sorry for that tangent so
information so that's the defining the

2676
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:16,160
information so that's the defining the
 

2677
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,069
information so that's the defining the
the distinction between computation and

2678
00:46:18,069 --> 00:46:18,079
the distinction between computation and
 

2679
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:19,589
the distinction between computation and

let me say one more thing just to

2682
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:21,119
let me say one more thing just to
 

2683
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,829
let me say one more thing just to
clarify communication

clarify communication
ideally does not change the information

2686
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:27,040
ideally does not change the information
 

2687
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,870

it moves it from one place to another

2688
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
it moves it from one place to another
 

2689
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,870
it moves it from one place to another
but it is preserved

2690
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:30,880
but it is preserved
 

2691
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,390
but it is preserved
got it okay

2692
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
got it okay
 

2693
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,630
got it okay
all right that's beautiful so

2694
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:34,640
all right that's beautiful so
 

2695
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,670
all right that's beautiful so
uh then the an electron versus light

2696
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:37,680
uh then the an electron versus light
 

2697
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,870
uh then the an electron versus light
distinction and why are electrons

2698
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:40,880
distinction and why are electrons
 

2699
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,589
distinction and why are electrons
uh good at computation and light good at

2700
00:46:43,589 --> 00:46:43,599
uh good at computation and light good at
 

2701
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,349
uh good at computation and light good at
communication yes

2702
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359
communication yes

this is um

2704
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119
this is um
 

2705
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,710
this is um
there's a lot that goes into it i guess

2706
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:48,720
there's a lot that goes into it i guess
 

2707
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,870
there's a lot that goes into it i guess
but just try to speak to the simplest

2708
00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:50,880
but just try to speak to the simplest
 

2709
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,990
but just try to speak to the simplest
part of it

2710
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000

 

2711
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,550

electrons interact strongly with one

another they're charged particles so if

2714
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
another they're charged particles so if

00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
they're feeling a certain amount of
 

2721
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,030
they're feeling a certain amount of

00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,470
somewhere else they're strongly
interactive you can also get them to sit

2726
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:08,480
interactive you can also get them to sit
 

2727
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,710
interactive you can also get them to sit
still you can an electron has a mass so

2728
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:10,720
still you can an electron has a mass so
 

2729
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,589
still you can an electron has a mass so
you can you can cause it to

2730
00:47:13,589 --> 00:47:13,599
you can you can cause it to
 

2731
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,550
you can you can cause it to
be spatially localized so for

2732
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:16,560
be spatially localized so for
 

2733
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,630
be spatially localized so for
computation that's useful because now i

2734
00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:18,640
computation that's useful because now i
 

2735
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,630
computation that's useful because now i
can make these little devices that put a

2736
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:20,640
can make these little devices that put a
 

2737
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,710
can make these little devices that put a
bunch of electrons over here and then i

2738
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:22,720
bunch of electrons over here and then i
 

2739
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:25,109
bunch of electrons over here and then i
change the the state of

2740
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
change the the state of
 

2741
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:26,710
change the the state of
a gate like i've been describing put a

2742
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
a gate like i've been describing put a
 

2743
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,790
a gate like i've been describing put a
different voltage on this gate and now i

2744
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:28,800
different voltage on this gate and now i
 

2745
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,230
different voltage on this gate and now i
move the electrons over here now they're

2746
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:30,240
move the electrons over here now they're
 

2747
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,230
move the electrons over here now they're
sitting somewhere else i have

2748
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
sitting somewhere else i have
 

2749
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,549
sitting somewhere else i have
a physical mechanism with which i can

2750
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:34,559
a physical mechanism with which i can
 

2751
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,630
a physical mechanism with which i can
represent information it's spatially

2752
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:36,640
represent information it's spatially
 

2753
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,470
represent information it's spatially
localized and have knobs that i can

2754
00:47:38,470 --> 00:47:38,480
localized and have knobs that i can
 

2755
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,950
localized and have knobs that i can
adjust to change where those electrons

2756
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:40,960
adjust to change where those electrons
 

2757
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,950
adjust to change where those electrons
are or what they're doing light by

uh which are the discrete packets of
 

2763
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,790
uh which are the discrete packets of
energy that were identified by einstein

2764
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:50,800
energy that were identified by einstein
 

2765
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,470
energy that were identified by einstein
they do not interact with each other um

2766
00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:54,480
they do not interact with each other um
 

2767
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,549
they do not interact with each other um
especially at low light levels if you're

2768
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
especially at low light levels if you're
 

2769
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,870
especially at low light levels if you're
in a medium and you have a high a bright

2770
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:58,880
in a medium and you have a high a bright
 

2771
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,390
in a medium and you have a high a bright
high light level

2772
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:00,400
high light level
 

2773
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,150
high light level
you you can get them to interact with

2774
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:02,160
you you can get them to interact with
 

2775
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,750
you you can get them to interact with
each other through the interaction with

2776
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:03,760
each other through the interaction with
 

2777
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,309
each other through the interaction with
that medium that they're in but that's

2778
00:48:06,309 --> 00:48:06,319
that medium that they're in but that's
 

2779
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:08,390
that medium that they're in but that's
that's a little bit more exotic and for

2780
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:08,400
that's a little bit more exotic and for
 

2781
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,630
that's a little bit more exotic and for
the purposes of this conversation we can

2782
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:10,640
the purposes of this conversation we can
 

2783
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,710
the purposes of this conversation we can
assume that photons don't interact with

2784
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:12,720
assume that photons don't interact with
 

2785
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,870
assume that photons don't interact with
each other so if you have a bunch of

2786
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:14,880
each other so if you have a bunch of
 

2787
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,069
each other so if you have a bunch of
them

2788
00:48:16,069 --> 00:48:16,079
them
 

2789
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,510
them
all propagating in the same direction

2790
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
all propagating in the same direction
 

2791
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,190
all propagating in the same direction
they don't interfere with each other if

2792
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,200
they don't interfere with each other if
 

2793
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,870
they don't interfere with each other if
i want to send

2794
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
i want to send
 

2795
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,870
i want to send
if i if i have a communication channel

2796
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:22,880
if i if i have a communication channel
 

2797
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,549
if i if i have a communication channel
and i put one more photon on it it

2798
00:48:24,549 --> 00:48:24,559
and i put one more photon on it it
 

2799
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:25,990
and i put one more photon on it it
doesn't screw up with those other one it

2800
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:26,000
doesn't screw up with those other one it
 

2801
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,270
doesn't screw up with those other one it
doesn't change what those other ones

2802
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
doesn't change what those other ones
 

2803
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,109
doesn't change what those other ones
were doing at all

2804
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:29,119
were doing at all
 

2805
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,549
were doing at all
so that's really useful for

2806
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
so that's really useful for
 

2807
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,069
so that's really useful for
communication because that means you can

2808
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:32,079
communication because that means you can
 

2809
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:33,270
communication because that means you can
sort of

2810
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:33,280
sort of
 

2811
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,910
sort of
allow a lot of these photons to flow

2812
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:35,920
allow a lot of these photons to flow
 

2813
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,710
allow a lot of these photons to flow
uh

2814
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
uh
 

2815
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,790
uh
with without disruption of each other

2816
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
with without disruption of each other
 

2817
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,150
with without disruption of each other
and they can they can branch really

2818
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:40,160
and they can they can branch really
 

2819
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,589
and they can they can branch really
easily and things like that but it's not

2820
00:48:41,589 --> 00:48:41,599
easily and things like that but it's not
 

2821
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:43,349
easily and things like that but it's not
good for computation because it's very

2822
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:43,359
good for computation because it's very
 

2823
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:44,230
good for computation because it's very
hard

2824
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
hard
 

2825
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,109
hard
for

2826
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
for
 

2827
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,430
for
this packet of light to change what this

2828
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
this packet of light to change what this
 

2829
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,349
this packet of light to change what this
packet of light is doing they they pass

2830
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
packet of light is doing they they pass
 

2831
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:51,030
packet of light is doing they they pass
right through each other so in

2832
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
right through each other so in
 

2833
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,630
right through each other so in
computation you want to change

2834
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
computation you want to change
 

2835
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,069
computation you want to change
information and if photons don't

2836
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:54,079
information and if photons don't
 

2837
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,230
information and if photons don't
interact with each other it's difficult

2838
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:56,240
interact with each other it's difficult
 

2839
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:57,990
interact with each other it's difficult
to get them to change the information

2840
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:58,000
to get them to change the information
 

2841
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,910
to get them to change the information
represented by the others so that that's

2842
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
represented by the others so that that's
 

2843
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,069
represented by the others so that that's
the fundamental difference is is there

2844
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:02,079
the fundamental difference is is there
 

2845
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,589
the fundamental difference is is there
also something about

2846
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:03,599
also something about
 

2847
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,270
also something about
the way they travel through different

2848
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
the way they travel through different
 

2849
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,430
the way they travel through different
materials

2850
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:07,440
materials
 

2851
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,630
materials
or is that just a particular engineering

2852
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:10,640
or is that just a particular engineering
 

2853
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,549
or is that just a particular engineering
no it's not that's deep physics i think

2854
00:49:12,549 --> 00:49:12,559
no it's not that's deep physics i think
 

2855
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,750
no it's not that's deep physics i think
so

2856
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:13,760
so
 

2857
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,829
so
this gets back to electrons interact

2858
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:15,839
this gets back to electrons interact
 

2859
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:18,870
this gets back to electrons interact
with each other and photons don't so say

2860
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
with each other and photons don't so say
 

2861
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,790
with each other and photons don't so say
say i'm trying to get a

2862
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:20,800
say i'm trying to get a
 

2863
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,390
say i'm trying to get a
packet of information

2864
00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:22,400
packet of information
 

2865
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,910
packet of information
from me to you

2866
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:23,920
from me to you
 

2867
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,910
from me to you
and we have a wire going between us in

2868
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:25,920
and we have a wire going between us in
 

2869
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,069
and we have a wire going between us in
order for me to send electrons across

2870
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
order for me to send electrons across
 

2871
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,470
order for me to send electrons across
that wire i first have to raise the

2872
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:30,480
that wire i first have to raise the
 

2873
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:32,470
that wire i first have to raise the
voltage on my end of the wire and that

2874
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:32,480
voltage on my end of the wire and that
 

2875
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,549
voltage on my end of the wire and that
means putting a bunch of charges on it

2876
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:34,559
means putting a bunch of charges on it
 

2877
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,190
means putting a bunch of charges on it
and then that that charge packet has to

2878
00:49:37,190 --> 00:49:37,200
and then that that charge packet has to
 

2879
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:39,589
and then that that charge packet has to
propagate along the wire and it has to

2880
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:39,599
propagate along the wire and it has to
 

2881
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,510
propagate along the wire and it has to
get all the way over to you there's that

2882
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:41,520
get all the way over to you there's that
 

2883
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,870
get all the way over to you there's that
wire is going to have something that's

2884
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:42,880
wire is going to have something that's
 

2885
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,190
wire is going to have something that's
called capacitance which basically tells

2886
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
called capacitance which basically tells
 

2887
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,510
called capacitance which basically tells
you how much charge you need to put on

2888
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:47,520
you how much charge you need to put on
 

2889
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,510
you how much charge you need to put on
the wire in order to raise the voltage

2890
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
the wire in order to raise the voltage
 

2891
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,829
the wire in order to raise the voltage
on it and the capacitance is going to be

2892
00:49:51,829 --> 00:49:51,839
on it and the capacitance is going to be
 

2893
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,990
on it and the capacitance is going to be
proportional to the length of the wire

2894
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,000
proportional to the length of the wire
 

2895
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,630
proportional to the length of the wire
so the longer the the length of the wire

2896
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:56,640
so the longer the the length of the wire
 

2897
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:59,030
so the longer the the length of the wire
is the more charge i have to put on it

2898
00:49:59,030 --> 00:49:59,040
is the more charge i have to put on it
 

2899
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,990
is the more charge i have to put on it
and

2900
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
and
 

2901
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,710
and
the energy required to charge up that

2902
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
the energy required to charge up that
 

2903
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,109
the energy required to charge up that
line and move those electrons to you is

2904
00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:05,119
line and move those electrons to you is
 

2905
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,870
line and move those electrons to you is
also proportional to the capacitance and

2906
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:06,880
also proportional to the capacitance and
 

2907
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,270
also proportional to the capacitance and
goes as the voltage squared so you get

2908
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
goes as the voltage squared so you get
 

2909
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,910
goes as the voltage squared so you get
this huge penalty if you if you want to

2910
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:11,920
this huge penalty if you if you want to
 

2911
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,790
this huge penalty if you if you want to
send

2912
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:12,800
send
 

2913
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,750
send
electrons across a wire over appreciable

2914
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:15,760
electrons across a wire over appreciable
 

2915
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,309
electrons across a wire over appreciable
distances so distance is an important

2916
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
distances so distance is an important
 

2917
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:19,910
distances so distance is an important
thing here when you're doing

2918
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
thing here when you're doing
 

2919
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,670
thing here when you're doing
communication distance is an important

2920
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:21,680
communication distance is an important
 

2921
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,150
communication distance is an important
thing so is the number of connections

2922

then then all of those wires are adding

2932
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
then then all of those wires are adding
 

2933
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,309
then then all of those wires are adding
tons of extra capacitance now not only

2934
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:36,319
tons of extra capacitance now not only
 

2935
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,710
tons of extra capacitance now not only
does it take forever to put the charge

2936
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:38,720
does it take forever to put the charge
 

2937
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,710
does it take forever to put the charge
on that wire and raise the voltage on

2938
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
on that wire and raise the voltage on
 

2939
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,630
on that wire and raise the voltage on
all those lines but it takes a ton of

2940
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
all those lines but it takes a ton of
 

2941
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,510
all those lines but it takes a ton of
power

2942
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:43,520
power
 

2943
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:44,630

the number 10000 is not randomly chosen

2946
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:46,880
the number 10000 is not randomly chosen
 

2947
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,270
the number 10000 is not randomly chosen
that's roughly how many connections each

i add additional connections i need to
 

3005
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,910
i add additional connections i need to
add more light to the waveguide because

these are called wiring parasitics there
 

3017
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:03,430
these are called wiring parasitics there
are no parasitics associated with light

3018
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:03,440
are no parasitics associated with light
 

3019
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,109
are no parasitics associated with light
in that same sense so

3020
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:05,119
in that same sense so
 

3021
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,430
in that same sense so
well just this might be a dumb question

but
 

3025
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,549
but
how do i catch a photon on the other end

3079
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,230
straight down like this and on on your
loop branch you have a little ammeter

3080
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:04,240
loop branch you have a little ammeter
 

3081
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,910
loop branch you have a little ammeter
something that measures current there's

3082
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:05,920
something that measures current there's
 

3083
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,910
something that measures current there's
a resistor up there too

3084
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:07,920
a resistor up there too
 

3085
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,870

go with me here so um

3086
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
go with me here so um
 

3087
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,230
go with me here so um
your current biasing this so there's

3088
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:12,240
your current biasing this so there's
 

3089
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,270
your current biasing this so there's
current flowing through that

3090
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:13,280
current flowing through that
 

3091
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,790
current flowing through that
superconducting branch since there's a

3092
00:53:14,790 --> 00:53:14,800
superconducting branch since there's a
 

3093
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,470
superconducting branch since there's a
resistor over here

3094
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:16,480
resistor over here
 

3095
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:17,510
resistor over here
all the current goes through the

3096
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:17,520
all the current goes through the
 

3097
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:19,589
all the current goes through the
superconducting branch now a photon

3098
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
superconducting branch now a photon
 

3099
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,230

00:53:27,910 --> 00:53:27,920
to be destroyed by the energy of that
 

3107
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:30,549
to be destroyed by the energy of that
photon so now that branch of the circuit

3108
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
photon so now that branch of the circuit
 

3109
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,990

is resistive too

i mean so what happens when you just
barrage it with photons if you put a

adrian alita in our group does a lot of
work on that and

3256
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
work on that and
 

3257
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,910
work on that and
that can tell you based on the amplitude

3258
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:53,920
that can tell you based on the amplitude
 

3259
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,230
that can tell you based on the amplitude
of the current pulse you divert exactly

3260
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:56,240
of the current pulse you divert exactly
 

3261
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,230
of the current pulse you divert exactly
how many photons

3262
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:58,240
how many photons
 

3263
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,230
how many photons
were in that pulse

3264
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:00,240
were in that pulse
 

3265
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,789
were in that pulse
so what's that useful for just one way

3266
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:02,799
so what's that useful for just one way
 

3267
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,710
so what's that useful for just one way
that you can encode information in

3271
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,390
quantum states of light is in the number
of photons you can have what are called

3272
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:08,400
of photons you can have what are called
 

3273
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,710
of photons you can have what are called
number states and a number state will

3274
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:10,720
number states and a number state will
 

3275
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,950
number states and a number state will
have a well-defined number of photons

3276
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:12,960
have a well-defined number of photons
 

3277
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,109
have a well-defined number of photons
and maybe the output of your quantum

3278
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
and maybe the output of your quantum
 

3279
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,910
and maybe the output of your quantum
computation encodes

3280
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:17,920
computation encodes
 

3281
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,670
computation encodes
its information in the number of photons

3282
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
its information in the number of photons
 

3283
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,789
its information in the number of photons
that are generated so if you have a

3284
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
that are generated so if you have a
 

3285
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,109
that are generated so if you have a
detector that is sensitive to that it's

3286
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:23,119
detector that is sensitive to that it's
 

3287
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,150
detector that is sensitive to that it's
extremely useful can you achieve

00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:30,240
with photons or is that not important is
 

3293
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,190
with photons or is that not important is
there a synchronicity here

do they need to do clock distribution or
 

3325
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,549
do they need to do clock distribution or
are they

3326

are they
 

3327
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:13,270
are they
doing more ad hoc

3328
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280

let's zoom in at this very particular

3338
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
let's zoom in at this very particular
 

3339
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,190
let's zoom in at this very particular
question of

3340
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
question of
 

3341
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,789
question of
computation

3342
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:26,799

between processors
so

3348
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:33,040
so
 

3349
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,390
so
what does this

3350
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:34,400
what does this
 

3351
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,309
what does this

kind of architectures and stuff and so
there's this continuum of

3414
00:58:36,549 --> 00:58:36,559
there's this continuum of
 

3415
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,470
there's this continuum of
neuromorphic from

00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
neuromorphic from
 

3417
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,910
neuromorphic from
things that are

3418
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:39,920
things that are
 

3419
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,750
things that are
pretty similar to digital computers but

3420
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:43,760
pretty similar to digital computers but
 

3421
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:46,789
pretty similar to digital computers but
maybe there are more cores and the way

3422
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:46,799
maybe there are more cores and the way
 

3423
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:49,109
maybe there are more cores and the way
they send messages is a little bit more

3424
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:49,119
they send messages is a little bit more
 

3425
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,870
they send messages is a little bit more
like the way brain

3426
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
like the way brain
 

3427
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,430
like the way brain
neurons send spikes but for the most

3428
00:58:53,430 --> 00:58:53,440
neurons send spikes but for the most
 

3429
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,990
neurons send spikes but for the most
part it's still digital electronics

3430
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:56,000
part it's still digital electronics
 

3431
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,069
part it's still digital electronics
and then you know you have some things

3432
00:58:58,069 --> 00:58:58,079
and then you know you have some things
 

3433
00:58:58,079 --> 00:58:59,589
and then you know you have some things
in between where maybe you're you're

3434
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
in between where maybe you're you're
 

3435
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:01,109
in between where maybe you're you're
using

3436
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:01,119
using
 

3437
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,789
using
transistors but now you're starting to

3438
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:02,799
transistors but now you're starting to
 

3439
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:04,630
transistors but now you're starting to
use them instead of in a digital way in

3440
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,640
use them instead of in a digital way in
 

3441
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,030
use them instead of in a digital way in
an analog way and so you're trying to

3442
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:07,040
an analog way and so you're trying to
 

3443
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:09,270
an analog way and so you're trying to
get those circuits to behave more like

3444
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:09,280
get those circuits to behave more like
 

3445
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,990
get those circuits to behave more like
neurons and then that's a little bit

3446
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
neurons and then that's a little bit
 

3447
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,670
neurons and then that's a little bit
quite quite a bit more on the

3448
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
quite quite a bit more on the
 

3449
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,030
quite quite a bit more on the
neuromorphic side of things you're

3450
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:15,040
neuromorphic side of things you're
 

3451
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:17,349
neuromorphic side of things you're
trying to get your circuits although

3452
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:17,359
trying to get your circuits although
 

3453
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:19,190
trying to get your circuits although
they're still based on silicon you're

3454
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:19,200
they're still based on silicon you're
 

3455
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:21,030
they're still based on silicon you're
trying to get them to

3456
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:21,040
trying to get them to
 

3457
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:22,870
trying to get them to
perform operations that are highly

3458
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:22,880
perform operations that are highly
 

3459
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,470
perform operations that are highly
analogous to the operations in the brain

3460
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
analogous to the operations in the brain
 

3461
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,470
analogous to the operations in the brain
and that's where a great deal of work is

3462
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:26,480
and that's where a great deal of work is
 

3463
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,910
and that's where a great deal of work is

right yeah this is this is so important

3520
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:32,480
right yeah this is this is so important
 

3521
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,390
right yeah this is this is so important
and i'm glad we booked 14 hours for this

3522
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
and i'm glad we booked 14 hours for this
 

3523
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,309
and i'm glad we booked 14 hours for this
because uh i only have 13 i'm sorry

01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:38,319
because uh i only have 13 i'm sorry

01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,630
because uh i only have 13 i'm sorry
okay so the brain is notoriously

3526
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:40,640
okay so the brain is notoriously
 

3527
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,109
okay so the brain is notoriously
complicated and i think that's a

3528
01:00:43,109 --> 01:00:43,119
complicated and i think that's a
 

3529
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:45,109
complicated and i think that's a
an important part of why it

3530
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:45,119
an important part of why it
 

3531
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:46,870
an important part of why it
why it can do what it does but okay let

3532
01:00:46,870 --> 01:00:46,880
why it can do what it does but okay let
 

3533
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,109
why it can do what it does but okay let
me let me try to break it down

3534
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:49,119
me let me try to break it down

01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:02,950
they can um
change their state based on the activity

3546
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:02,960
change their state based on the activity
 

3547
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,030
change their state based on the activity
so they they adapt over time that's

01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
so they they adapt over time that's
 

3549
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,109
so they they adapt over time that's
crucial to the way the brain works they

crucial to the way the brain works they
don't just adapt on one time scale they

01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:21,750
neurons all the way to the age of the
organism

3564
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:21,760
organism
 

3565
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,030
organism
um

3566
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:23,040
um
 

3567
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:26,230
um
also relevant perhaps

3568
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
also relevant perhaps
 

3569
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,230
also relevant perhaps
i think the most important thing that's

3570
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240
i think the most important thing that's
 

3571
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,549
i think the most important thing that's
guided my thinking is the the network

3572
01:01:30,549 --> 01:01:30,559
guided my thinking is the the network
 

3573
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,230
guided my thinking is the the network
structure

3574
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
structure
 

3575
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:34,710
structure
of the brain so which can also be

3576
01:01:34,710 --> 01:01:34,720
of the brain so which can also be
 

3577
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,549
of the brain so which can also be
adjusted yeah in different scales

3578
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:36,559
adjusted yeah in different scales
 

3579
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:38,470
adjusted yeah in different scales
absolutely yes so so you're you're

3580
01:01:38,470 --> 01:01:38,480
absolutely yes so so you're you're
 

3581
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,069
absolutely yes so so you're you're
making new con you're changing the

3582
01:01:40,069 --> 01:01:40,079
making new con you're changing the
 

3583
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,549
making new con you're changing the
strength of contacts you're changing the

3584
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
strength of contacts you're changing the
 

3585
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:44,069
strength of contacts you're changing the
the spatial distribution of them

3586
01:01:44,069 --> 01:01:44,079
the spatial distribution of them
 

3587
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,589
the spatial distribution of them
although spatial distribution doesn't

3588
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:45,599
although spatial distribution doesn't
 

3589
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,789
although spatial distribution doesn't
change that much once you're a mature

3590
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
change that much once you're a mature
 

3591
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,349
change that much once you're a mature
organism but that network structure is

3592
01:01:51,349 --> 01:01:51,359
organism but that network structure is
 

3593
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:52,870
organism but that network structure is
is really crucial

3594
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:52,880
is really crucial
 

3595
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,750
is really crucial
so let me dwell on that for a second

3596
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
so let me dwell on that for a second
 

3597
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,029
so let me dwell on that for a second
um

3598
01:01:57,029 --> 01:01:57,039
um
 

3599
01:01:57,039 --> 01:01:58,390
um
you can't talk about the brain without

3600
01:01:58,390 --> 01:01:58,400
you can't talk about the brain without
 

3601
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,029
you can't talk about the brain without
emphasizing that most of the neurons in

3602
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
emphasizing that most of the neurons in
 

3603
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:03,510
emphasizing that most of the neurons in
the the neocortex or the prefrontal

3604
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
the the neocortex or the prefrontal
 

3605
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,950
the the neocortex or the prefrontal
cortex the part of the brain that we

3606
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:04,960
cortex the part of the brain that we
 

3607
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,950
cortex the part of the brain that we
think is most responsible for

3608
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
think is most responsible for
 

3609
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,470
think is most responsible for
high-level reasoning and things like

3610
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:08,480
high-level reasoning and things like
 

3611
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,710
high-level reasoning and things like
that those neurons make thousands of

3612
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:10,720
that those neurons make thousands of
 

3613
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,630
that those neurons make thousands of
connections so you have this network

3614
01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:12,640
connections so you have this network
 

3615
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,510
connections so you have this network
that is highly interconnected

3616
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:15,520
that is highly interconnected
 

3617
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:16,870
that is highly interconnected
and

3618
01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:16,880
and
 

3619
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,789
and
i think it's safe to say that one of the

3620
01:02:18,789 --> 01:02:18,799
i think it's safe to say that one of the
 

3621
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:21,190
i think it's safe to say that one of the
primary reasons that they make so many

3622
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:21,200
primary reasons that they make so many
 

3623
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:24,470
primary reasons that they make so many
different connections is that allows

3624
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
different connections is that allows
 

3625
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,230
different connections is that allows
information to be communicated very

3626
01:02:26,230 --> 01:02:26,240
information to be communicated very
 

3627
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,470
information to be communicated very
rapidly from any spot in the network to

3628
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:28,480
rapidly from any spot in the network to
 

3629
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,190
rapidly from any spot in the network to
any other spot in the network so that's

3630
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
any other spot in the network so that's
 

3631
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,829
any other spot in the network so that's
a that's a sort of spatial aspect of it

3632
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:33,839
a that's a sort of spatial aspect of it
 

3633
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:37,829
a that's a sort of spatial aspect of it
you can quantify this in terms of

3634
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
you can quantify this in terms of
 

3635
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,829
you can quantify this in terms of
concepts that are related to fractals

3636
01:02:39,829 --> 01:02:39,839
concepts that are related to fractals
 

3637
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,910
concepts that are related to fractals
and scale invariants which i think is is

3638
01:02:41,910 --> 01:02:41,920
and scale invariants which i think is is
 

3639
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,230
and scale invariants which i think is is
a very beautiful concept so

3640
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:44,240
a very beautiful concept so
 

3641
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,710
a very beautiful concept so
what i mean by that is kind of no matter

3642
01:02:46,710 --> 01:02:46,720
what i mean by that is kind of no matter
 

3643
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,109
what i mean by that is kind of no matter
what spatial scale you're looking at in

3644
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
what spatial scale you're looking at in
 

3645
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,630
what spatial scale you're looking at in
the brain

3646
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:50,640
the brain
 

3647
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:53,510
the brain
within certain bounds you see the same

3648
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:53,520
within certain bounds you see the same
 

3649
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,069
within certain bounds you see the same
general statistical pattern so if i draw

3650
01:02:56,069 --> 01:02:56,079
general statistical pattern so if i draw
 

3651
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,589
general statistical pattern so if i draw
a box around some region of my cortex

3652
01:02:59,589 --> 01:02:59,599
a box around some region of my cortex
 

3653
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,270
a box around some region of my cortex
most of the connections

3654
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:01,280
most of the connections
 

3655
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,190
most of the connections
that those neurons within that box make

3656
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
that those neurons within that box make
 

3657
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,789
that those neurons within that box make
are going to be within the box to each

3658
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:04,799
are going to be within the box to each
 

3659
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:06,230
are going to be within the box to each
other in their local neighborhood and

3660
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:06,240
other in their local neighborhood and
 

3661
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,390
other in their local neighborhood and
that's sort of called clustering loosely

3662
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:08,400
that's sort of called clustering loosely
 

3663
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:10,789
that's sort of called clustering loosely
speaking but a non-negligible fraction

3664
01:03:10,789 --> 01:03:10,799
speaking but a non-negligible fraction
 

3665
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:12,630
speaking but a non-negligible fraction
is going to go outside of that box and

3666
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:12,640
is going to go outside of that box and
 

3667
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,470
is going to go outside of that box and
then if i draw a bigger box the pattern

3668
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:14,480
then if i draw a bigger box the pattern
 

3669
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,630
then if i draw a bigger box the pattern
is going to be exactly the same so you

3670
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
is going to be exactly the same so you
 

3671
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,349
is going to be exactly the same so you
have the scale and variance and you also

3672
01:03:19,349 --> 01:03:19,359
have the scale and variance and you also
 

3673
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,750
have the scale and variance and you also
have a a non-vanishing

3674
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:21,760
have a a non-vanishing
 

3675
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,990
have a a non-vanishing
probability of a neuron making

3676
01:03:23,990 --> 01:03:24,000
probability of a neuron making
 

3677
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,470
probability of a neuron making
connection very far away so

3678
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
connection very far away so
 

3679
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:27,910
connection very far away so
suppose you you want to plot the

3680
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:27,920
suppose you you want to plot the
 

3681
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,990
suppose you you want to plot the
probability of a neuron making a

3682
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
probability of a neuron making a
 

3683
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,470
probability of a neuron making a
connection as a function of distance if

3684
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
connection as a function of distance if
 

3685
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,150
connection as a function of distance if
that were an exponential function it

3686
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
that were an exponential function it
 

3687
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,990
that were an exponential function it
would go e to the minus

3688
01:03:35,990 --> 01:03:36,000
would go e to the minus
 

3689
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,549
would go e to the minus
radius over some characteristic radius

3690
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
radius over some characteristic radius
 

3691
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,470
radius over some characteristic radius
and it would it would drop off

3692
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:40,480
and it would it would drop off
 

3693
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:41,829
and it would it would drop off
up to some certain radius the

3694
01:03:41,829 --> 01:03:41,839
up to some certain radius the
 

3695
01:03:41,839 --> 01:03:43,270
up to some certain radius the
probability would be

3696
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
probability would be
 

3697
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:45,510
probability would be
reasonable close to one and then a

3698
01:03:45,510 --> 01:03:45,520
reasonable close to one and then a
 

3699
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:49,029
reasonable close to one and then a
beyond that characteristic length r0

3700
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:49,039
beyond that characteristic length r0
 

3701
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:51,270
beyond that characteristic length r0
it would it would drop off sharply and

3702
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:51,280
it would it would drop off sharply and
 

3703
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,109
it would it would drop off sharply and
so that would mean that the neurons in

3704
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:53,119
so that would mean that the neurons in
 

3705
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,430
so that would mean that the neurons in
your brain are really

3706
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:55,440
your brain are really
 

3707
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,349
your brain are really
localized and

3708
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
localized and
 

3709
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,029
localized and
that's not what we observe in instead

3710
01:03:59,029 --> 01:03:59,039
that's not what we observe in instead
 

3711
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,710
that's not what we observe in instead
what you see is that the probability of

3712
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:00,720
what you see is that the probability of
 

3713
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,710
what you see is that the probability of
making a longer distance connection it

3714
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:02,720
making a longer distance connection it
 

3715
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,029
making a longer distance connection it
does drop off but it drops off as a

3716
01:04:05,029 --> 01:04:05,039
does drop off but it drops off as a
 

3717
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,870
does drop off but it drops off as a
power law so the probability that you're

3718
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:06,880
power law so the probability that you're
 

3719
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,710
power law so the probability that you're
going to have a connection at some

3720
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
going to have a connection at some
 

3721
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,390
going to have a connection at some
radius r goes as r to the minus some

3722
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:12,400

there's a like a fractal dynamics to the
 

3737

that
if you zoom out you draw the box and you

3742
01:04:31,829 --> 01:04:31,839
if you zoom out you draw the box and you
 

3743
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:34,870
if you zoom out you draw the box and you
increase that box by certain step sizes

3744
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:34,880
increase that box by certain step sizes
 

3745
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,710
increase that box by certain step sizes
you're gonna see the same statistics i

3746
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
you're gonna see the same statistics i
 

3747
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,029
you're gonna see the same statistics i
think that's probably

think that's probably
 

3749
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,630
think that's probably
very important to the way the brain

01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,829
occurring that are greater and greater
sophisticated thoughts there's a

3884
01:06:51,829 --> 01:06:51,839
sophisticated thoughts there's a
 

3885
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,589
sophisticated thoughts there's a
different spatial and temporal skill

3886
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:53,599
different spatial and temporal skill
 

3887
01:06:53,599 --> 01:06:54,630
different spatial and temporal skill
there

3888
01:06:54,630 --> 01:06:54,640
there
 

3889
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,430
there
this is getting very suspicious

3890
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
this is getting very suspicious
 

3891
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,950
this is getting very suspicious
hold on though before we're done i just

3892
01:06:58,950 --> 01:06:58,960
hold on though before we're done i just
 

3893
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:01,510
hold on though before we're done i just
want to just tie the bow yes and say

3894
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:01,520
want to just tie the bow yes and say
 

3895
01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:02,470
want to just tie the bow yes and say
that the

3896
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:02,480
that the
 

3897
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,549
that the
the spatial and temporal aspects are

3898
01:07:04,549 --> 01:07:04,559
the spatial and temporal aspects are
 

3899
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,390
the spatial and temporal aspects are
intimately interrelated with each other

3900
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:06,400
intimately interrelated with each other
 

3901
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,270
intimately interrelated with each other
so activity between neurons that are

3902
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:09,280
so activity between neurons that are
 

3903
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,029
so activity between neurons that are
very close to each other is more likely

3904
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
very close to each other is more likely
 

3905
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:13,510
very close to each other is more likely
to happen on this this faster time scale

3906
01:07:13,510 --> 01:07:13,520
to happen on this this faster time scale
 

3907
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,270
to happen on this this faster time scale
and information is going to propagate

3908
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:15,280
and information is going to propagate
 

3909
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,829
and information is going to propagate
and encompass more of the brain more of

3910
01:07:17,829 --> 01:07:17,839
and encompass more of the brain more of
 

3911
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:19,910
and encompass more of the brain more of
your cortices different modules in the

3912
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:19,920
your cortices different modules in the
 

3913
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,230
your cortices different modules in the
brain are going to be engaged in

3914
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:22,240
brain are going to be engaged in
 

3915
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,870
brain are going to be engaged in
information processing on longer time

3916
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
information processing on longer time
 

3917
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,470
information processing on longer time
scales so there's this concept of

3918
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
scales so there's this concept of
 

3919
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,789
scales so there's this concept of
information integration where

3920
01:07:28,789 --> 01:07:28,799
information integration where
 

3921
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,910
information integration where
most neurons are neurons are specialized

3922
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920
most neurons are neurons are specialized
 

3923
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,430
most neurons are neurons are specialized
any given neuron or any cluster of

3924
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:33,440
any given neuron or any cluster of
 

3925
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,829
any given neuron or any cluster of
neuron has its specific purpose but

3926
01:07:35,829 --> 01:07:35,839
neuron has its specific purpose but
 

3927
01:07:35,839 --> 01:07:37,589
neuron has its specific purpose but
they're also

3928
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:37,599
they're also
 

3929
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,789
they're also
they're also

3930
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:38,799
they're also
 

3931
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,630
they're also
very much integrated so you you have

3932
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
very much integrated so you you have
 

3933
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,549
very much integrated so you you have
neurons that specialize but share their

3934
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:42,559
neurons that specialize but share their
 

3935
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:45,029
neurons that specialize but share their
information and so that happens through

3936
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:45,039
information and so that happens through
 

3937
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:47,589
information and so that happens through
these fractal nested oscillations that

3938
01:07:47,589 --> 01:07:47,599
these fractal nested oscillations that
 

3939
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,430
these fractal nested oscillations that
occur across spatial and temporal scales

3940
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
occur across spatial and temporal scales
 

3941
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,309
occur across spatial and temporal scales
i think capturing those dynamics in

3942
01:07:52,309 --> 01:07:52,319
i think capturing those dynamics in
 

3943
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:53,589
i think capturing those dynamics in
hardware

3944
01:07:53,589 --> 01:07:53,599
hardware
 

3945
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,150
hardware
to me that's the goal of of neuromorphic

3946
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:56,160
to me that's the goal of of neuromorphic
 

3947
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,789
to me that's the goal of of neuromorphic
computing so does it need to look so

3948
01:07:58,789 --> 01:07:58,799
computing so does it need to look so
 

3949
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:00,950
computing so does it need to look so
first of all that's fascinating we

3950
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
first of all that's fascinating we
 

3951
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,910
first of all that's fascinating we
stated some clear principles here

3952
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:03,920
stated some clear principles here
 

3953
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,789
stated some clear principles here
now does it have to

3954
01:08:06,789 --> 01:08:06,799
now does it have to
 

3955
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,789
now does it have to
look like the brain outside of those

3956
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:08,799
look like the brain outside of those
 

3957
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:10,390
look like the brain outside of those
principles as well like what other

3958
01:08:10,390 --> 01:08:10,400
principles as well like what other
 

3959
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,069
principles as well like what other
characteristics have to look like the

3960
01:08:12,069 --> 01:08:12,079
characteristics have to look like the
 

3961
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,029
characteristics have to look like the
human brain or can it be something very

3962
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:15,039
human brain or can it be something very
 

3963
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,789
human brain or can it be something very
different well it depends on what you're

3964
01:08:16,789 --> 01:08:16,799
different well it depends on what you're
 

3965
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:19,510
different well it depends on what you're
trying to use it for and so i i think a

3966
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
trying to use it for and so i i think a
 

3967
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,669
trying to use it for and so i i think a
lot of the community

3968
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
lot of the community
 

3969
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,269
lot of the community
asks that question a lot what are you

3970
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
asks that question a lot what are you
 

3971
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:25,349
asks that question a lot what are you
going to do with it and

3972
01:08:25,349 --> 01:08:25,359
going to do with it and
 

3973
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,030
going to do with it and
i i completely get it i think that's a

3974
01:08:27,030 --> 01:08:27,040
i i completely get it i think that's a
 

3975
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:28,870
i i completely get it i think that's a
very important question and it's also

3976
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:28,880
very important question and it's also
 

3977
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,829
very important question and it's also
sometimes not the most helpful question

3978
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
sometimes not the most helpful question
 

3979
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,269
sometimes not the most helpful question
what if what you want to do with it is

3980
01:08:33,269 --> 01:08:33,279
what if what you want to do with it is
 

3981
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:35,110
what if what you want to do with it is
study it what if you just want to see

3982
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
study it what if you just want to see
 

3983
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:36,709
study it what if you just want to see
um

3984
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
um
 

3985
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,390
um
what does it what do you have to build

3986
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:38,400
what does it what do you have to build
 

3987
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:40,229
what does it what do you have to build
into your hardware in order to observe

3988
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
into your hardware in order to observe
 

3989
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,229
into your hardware in order to observe
these dynamical principles

3990
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:42,239
these dynamical principles
 

3991
01:08:42,239 --> 01:08:43,110
these dynamical principles
so

3992
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
so
 

3993
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,229
so
and also

3994
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:44,239
and also
 

3995
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:46,390
and also
i ask sometimes i ask myself that

3996
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,400
i ask sometimes i ask myself that
 

3997
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,390
i ask sometimes i ask myself that
question every day and i'm not sure i'm

3998
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:48,400
question every day and i'm not sure i'm
 

3999
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,309
question every day and i'm not sure i'm
able to answer that it's like what are

4000
01:08:50,309 --> 01:08:50,319
able to answer that it's like what are
 

4001
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,510
able to answer that it's like what are
you what are you gonna do with this

4002
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
you what are you gonna do with this
 

4003
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,590
you what are you gonna do with this
particular neuromorphic machine so

4004
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:53,600
particular neuromorphic machine so
 

4005
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,269
particular neuromorphic machine so
suppose what we're trying to do with it

4006
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:55,279
suppose what we're trying to do with it
 

4007
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:57,110
suppose what we're trying to do with it
is build something that thinks we're not

4008
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:57,120
is build something that thinks we're not
 

4009
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,430
is build something that thinks we're not
trying to get it to make us any money or

4010
01:08:59,430 --> 01:08:59,440
trying to get it to make us any money or
 

4011
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,269
trying to get it to make us any money or
drive a car maybe we'll be able to do

4012
01:09:01,269 --> 01:09:01,279
drive a car maybe we'll be able to do
 

4013
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:03,189
drive a car maybe we'll be able to do
that but that's not our goal our goal is

4014
01:09:03,189 --> 01:09:03,199
that but that's not our goal our goal is
 

4015
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:03,990
that but that's not our goal our goal is
to

4016
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:04,000
to
 

4017
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,709
to
see if we can get the same types of

4018
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:06,719
see if we can get the same types of
 

4019
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:08,550
see if we can get the same types of
behaviors that we observe in our own

4020
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
behaviors that we observe in our own
 

4021
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,390
behaviors that we observe in our own
brain and by behaviors in this sense

4022
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,400
brain and by behaviors in this sense
 

4023
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:11,510
brain and by behaviors in this sense
what i mean

4024
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
what i mean
 

4025
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,590
what i mean
the behaviors of the

4026
01:09:13,590 --> 01:09:13,600
the behaviors of the
 

4027
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:15,349
the behaviors of the
components the neurons the network that

4028
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:15,359
components the neurons the network that
 

4029
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,870
components the neurons the network that
kind of stuff i think there's another

4030
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
kind of stuff i think there's another
 

4031
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,430
kind of stuff i think there's another
element that i didn't really hit on that

4032
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
element that i didn't really hit on that
 

4033
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,030
element that i didn't really hit on that
that you also have to build into this

4034
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
that you also have to build into this
 

4035
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,789
that you also have to build into this
and those are architectural principles

4036
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
and those are architectural principles
 

4037
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,229
and those are architectural principles
they have to do with the

4038
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:24,239
they have to do with the
 

4039
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:26,870
they have to do with the
hierarchical modular construction of the

4040
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:26,880
hierarchical modular construction of the
 

4041
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,110
hierarchical modular construction of the
network and without getting too lost in

4042
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:29,120
network and without getting too lost in

01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,149
network and without getting too lost in
jargon

4044
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:30,159
jargon
 

4045
01:09:30,159 --> 01:09:32,870
jargon
the the main point that i think is

4046
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
the the main point that i think is
 

4047
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,550
the the main point that i think is
relevant there let me try and illustrate

4048
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
relevant there let me try and illustrate
 

4049
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:36,870
relevant there let me try and illustrate
it with a cartoon picture of

4050
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
it with a cartoon picture of
 

4051
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:38,550
it with a cartoon picture of
the architecture of the brain so in the

4052
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:38,560
the architecture of the brain so in the
 

4053
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:40,229
the architecture of the brain so in the
brain you have the

4054
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239
brain you have the
 

4055
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:42,870
brain you have the
the cortex which is sort of this outer

4056
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:42,880
the cortex which is sort of this outer
 

4057
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,910
the cortex which is sort of this outer
sheet um it's actually a you can it's a

4058
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
sheet um it's actually a you can it's a
 

4059
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:47,510
sheet um it's actually a you can it's a
layered structure you can if you could

4060
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
layered structure you can if you could
 

4061
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,110
layered structure you can if you could
take it out of your brain you could

4062
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
take it out of your brain you could
 

4063
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,110
take it out of your brain you could
unroll it on the table and it would be

4064
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:51,120
unroll it on the table and it would be
 

4065
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,030
unroll it on the table and it would be
about the size of a of a pizza sitting

4066
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:53,040
about the size of a of a pizza sitting
 

4067
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,470
about the size of a of a pizza sitting
there

4068
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:54,480
there
 

4069
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:56,229
there
and um

4070
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
and um
 

4071
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,229
and um
that's a module it it does certain

4072
01:09:58,229 --> 01:09:58,239
that's a module it it does certain
 

4073
01:09:58,239 --> 01:10:01,350
that's a module it it does certain
things it it processes as yorgi buzaki

4074
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:01,360
things it it processes as yorgi buzaki
 

4075
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,189
things it it processes as yorgi buzaki
would say it processes the what of of

4076
01:10:03,189 --> 01:10:03,199
would say it processes the what of of
 

4077
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,709
would say it processes the what of of
what's going on around you but you have

4078
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:04,719
what's going on around you but you have
 

4079
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:07,189
what's going on around you but you have
another really crucial module that's

4080
01:10:07,189 --> 01:10:07,199
another really crucial module that's
 

4081
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,870
another really crucial module that's
called the hippocampus

4082
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:08,880
called the hippocampus
 

4083
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:10,630
called the hippocampus
and that that network is structured

4084
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
and that that network is structured
 

4085
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:11,990
and that that network is structured
entirely differently first of all this

4086
01:10:11,990 --> 01:10:12,000
entirely differently first of all this
 

4087
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,990
entirely differently first of all this
this cortex that had described 10

4088
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:14,000
this cortex that had described 10
 

4089
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,229
this cortex that had described 10
billion neurons in there so numbers

4090
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
billion neurons in there so numbers
 

4091
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:17,830
billion neurons in there so numbers
matter here

4092
01:10:17,830 --> 01:10:17,840
matter here
 

4093
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,510
matter here
and they're they're organized in that

4094
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:19,520
and they're they're organized in that
 

4095
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,510
and they're they're organized in that
sort of power law distribution where the

4096
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
sort of power law distribution where the
 

4097
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,430
sort of power law distribution where the
probability of making a connection drops

4098
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:23,440
probability of making a connection drops
 

4099
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:25,189
probability of making a connection drops
off as a power law in space the

01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
hippocampus is another module that's
 

4103
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,630
hippocampus is another module that's
important for

4104
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:28,640
important for

01:10:28,640 --> 01:10:30,390
important for
understanding how

01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:33,990
where you are
when you are um

4110
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
when you are um
 

4111
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,870
when you are um
keeping track of of your your position

4112
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
keeping track of of your your position
 

4113
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,870
keeping track of of your your position
in space and time and that network is

4114
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:38,880
in space and time and that network is
 

4115
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,790
in space and time and that network is
very much random so the probability of

4116
01:10:40,790 --> 01:10:40,800
very much random so the probability of
 

4117
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,630

making a connection
 

4119
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,550
making a connection
it it almost doesn't even drop off as a

4127
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:52,550
over there but there are only about 100
million neurons there so you can have

4128
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
million neurons there so you can have
 

4129
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,030
million neurons there so you can have
that huge densely connected module

that huge densely connected module
 

4131
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:55,830
that huge densely connected module
because

4132
01:10:55,830 --> 01:10:55,840
because
 

4133
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,669
because
it's not so big

4134
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679
it's not so big
 

4135
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,350
it's not so big
and the neocortex or the cortex and the

4136
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:01,360
and the neocortex or the cortex and the
 

4137
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,910
and the neocortex or the cortex and the

4139
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,270
hippocampus they talk to each other
constantly

01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
constantly
 

4141
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:07,590
constantly
and that communication is largely

4142
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600
and that communication is largely
 

4143
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,350
and that communication is largely
facilitated by what's called the

4144

i'm trying to do my best to recite this

4148
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:13,360
i'm trying to do my best to recite this
 

4149
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,110
i'm trying to do my best to recite this
cartoon picture of the brain i gotcha

4150
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
cartoon picture of the brain i gotcha
 

4151
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,229
cartoon picture of the brain i gotcha
yeah something like that so this

4152
01:11:16,229 --> 01:11:16,239
yeah something like that so this
 

4153
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:19,030
yeah something like that so this
thalamus is is coordinating the activity

4154
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:19,040
thalamus is is coordinating the activity
 

4155
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,310
thalamus is is coordinating the activity
between the neocortex and the

4156
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:20,320
between the neocortex and the
 

4157
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,950
between the neocortex and the
hippocampus and making sure that they

4158
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:22,960
hippocampus and making sure that they
 

4159
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,390
hippocampus and making sure that they
they talk to each other at the right

4160
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:24,400
they talk to each other at the right
 

4161
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:25,910
they talk to each other at the right
time and send messages that would be

4162
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:25,920
time and send messages that would be
 

4163
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,229
time and send messages that would be
useful to one another so this all taken

4164
01:11:28,229 --> 01:11:28,239
useful to one another so this all taken
 

4165
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,709
useful to one another so this all taken
together is called the thalamocortical

4166
01:11:30,709 --> 01:11:30,719
together is called the thalamocortical
 

4167
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:31,990
together is called the thalamocortical
complex

4168
01:11:31,990 --> 01:11:32,000
complex
 

4169
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,550
complex
and it seems like building something

4170
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:34,560
and it seems like building something
 

4171
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,030
and it seems like building something
like that is going to be crucial to

4172
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:37,040
like that is going to be crucial to
 

4173
01:11:37,040 --> 01:11:38,709
like that is going to be crucial to
capturing the

4174
01:11:38,709 --> 01:11:38,719
capturing the
 

4175
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,470

01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:40,480
types of activity we're looking for
 

4177
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:41,910
types of activity we're looking for

01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:11,270
created these incredible visual
illustrations of like

4206
01:12:11,270 --> 01:12:11,280
illustrations of like
 

4207
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,070
illustrations of like
visual stimulation from the eye or

4208
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:14,080
visual stimulation from the eye or
 

4209
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,990
visual stimulation from the eye or
something like that it this in this

4210
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
something like that it this in this
 

4211
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,870
something like that it this in this
image like flowing through the brain wow

4212
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:18,880
image like flowing through the brain wow
 

4213
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,630
image like flowing through the brain wow
i haven't seen that i gotta check that

4214
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
i haven't seen that i gotta check that
 

4215
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,470
i haven't seen that i gotta check that
out so it's one of those things you you

4216
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:22,480
out so it's one of those things you you
 

4217
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:24,149
out so it's one of those things you you
find this stuff in the world

4218
01:12:24,149 --> 01:12:24,159
find this stuff in the world
 

4219
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:25,830
find this stuff in the world
and you see like on youtube it has like

4220
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:25,840
and you see like on youtube it has like
 

4221
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,310
and you see like on youtube it has like
1000 views these like

4222
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
1000 views these like
 

4223
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,709
1000 views these like
these visualizations of the human brain

4224
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:30,719
these visualizations of the human brain
 

4225
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,430
these visualizations of the human brain
processing information and like

4226
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:33,440
processing information and like
 

4227
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,270
processing information and like
because there's uh there's chemistry

4228
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
because there's uh there's chemistry
 

4229
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,590
because there's uh there's chemistry
there like because this is act from

4230
01:12:37,590 --> 01:12:37,600
there like because this is act from
 

4231
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,270
there like because this is act from
actual human brains i don't know how

4232
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:39,280
actual human brains i don't know how
 

4233
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,030
actual human brains i don't know how
they're doing the coloring but they're

4234
01:12:41,030 --> 01:12:41,040
they're doing the coloring but they're
 

4235
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,790
they're doing the coloring but they're
able to actually trace

4236
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:42,800
able to actually trace
 

4237
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,430
able to actually trace
the uh like different the the chemical

4238
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:45,440
the uh like different the the chemical
 

4239
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,870
the uh like different the the chemical
and the electrical signals throughout

4240
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
and the electrical signals throughout
 

4241
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,669
and the electrical signals throughout
the brain and the visual thing it's like

4242
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:49,679
the brain and the visual thing it's like
 

4243
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,350
the brain and the visual thing it's like
whoa because it looks kind of like the

4244
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
whoa because it looks kind of like the
 

4245
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,350
whoa because it looks kind of like the
universe i mean the whole thing is just

4246
01:12:53,350 --> 01:12:53,360
universe i mean the whole thing is just
 

4247
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,350
universe i mean the whole thing is just
incred i recommend it highly i'll

4248
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
incred i recommend it highly i'll
 

4249
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:56,870
incred i recommend it highly i'll
probably post a link to it but you can

4250
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:56,880
probably post a link to it but you can
 

4251
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,630
probably post a link to it but you can
just look for uh

4252
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:58,640
just look for uh
 

4253
01:12:58,640 --> 01:12:59,669
just look for uh
um

4254
01:12:59,669 --> 01:12:59,679
um
 

4255
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:01,510
um
one of the things they simulate is the

4256
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:01,520
one of the things they simulate is the
 

4257
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:02,390
one of the things they simulate is the
uh

4258
01:13:02,390 --> 01:13:02,400
uh
 

4259
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,030
uh
thelma cortical uh complex and just

4260
01:13:05,030 --> 01:13:05,040
thelma cortical uh complex and just
 

4261
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:06,870
thelma cortical uh complex and just
visualization you can find that yourself

4262
01:13:06,870 --> 01:13:06,880
visualization you can find that yourself
 

4263
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,430
visualization you can find that yourself
on youtube but it's it's beautiful um

4264
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:09,440
on youtube but it's it's beautiful um
 

4265
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:12,630
on youtube but it's it's beautiful um
the other question i have for you is um

4266
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:12,640
the other question i have for you is um
 

4267
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:14,390
the other question i have for you is um
how does memory play into all of this

4268
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:14,400
how does memory play into all of this
 

4269
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,310
how does memory play into all of this
because all the signals sending back and

4270
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:16,320
because all the signals sending back and
 

4271
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,149
because all the signals sending back and
forth that's kind of like uh that's

4272
01:13:18,149 --> 01:13:18,159
forth that's kind of like uh that's
 

4273
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:19,590
forth that's kind of like uh that's
computation

4274
01:13:19,590 --> 01:13:19,600
computation
 

4275
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,430
computation
and communication but that's kind of

4276
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:21,440
and communication but that's kind of
 

4277
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,390
and communication but that's kind of
like

4278
01:13:22,390 --> 01:13:22,400
like
 

4279
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,470
like
uh you know processing of

4280
01:13:24,470 --> 01:13:24,480
uh you know processing of
 

4281
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,950
uh you know processing of
inputs and outputs uh to produce outputs

4282
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:26,960
inputs and outputs uh to produce outputs
 

4283
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,390
inputs and outputs uh to produce outputs
in the system that's kind of like maybe

4284
01:13:28,390 --> 01:13:28,400
in the system that's kind of like maybe
 

4285
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:29,750
in the system that's kind of like maybe
reasoning maybe there's some kind of

4286
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:29,760
reasoning maybe there's some kind of
 

4287
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,870
reasoning maybe there's some kind of
recurrence

4288
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:30,880
recurrence
 

4289
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,030
recurrence
but like is there a storage mechanism

4290
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
but like is there a storage mechanism
 

4291
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:34,550
but like is there a storage mechanism
that you think about in the context of

4292
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:34,560
that you think about in the context of
 

4293
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,550
that you think about in the context of
neuromorphic computing yeah absolutely

4294
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:36,560
neuromorphic computing yeah absolutely
 

4295
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,149
neuromorphic computing yeah absolutely
so that's got to be central you have to

4296
01:13:38,149 --> 01:13:38,159
so that's got to be central you have to
 

4297
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,229
so that's got to be central you have to
have a way that you can

4298
01:13:40,229 --> 01:13:40,239
have a way that you can
 

4299
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:42,229
have a way that you can
store memories and

4300
01:13:42,229 --> 01:13:42,239
store memories and
 

4301
01:13:42,239 --> 01:13:44,070
store memories and
there are a lot of different kinds of

4302
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:44,080
there are a lot of different kinds of
 

4303
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,630
there are a lot of different kinds of
memory in the brain that's

4304
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:46,640
memory in the brain that's
 

4305
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,229
memory in the brain that's
yet another example of how it's it's not

4306
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:48,239
yet another example of how it's it's not
 

4307
01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:50,630
yet another example of how it's it's not
a simple system so

4308
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:50,640
a simple system so
 

4309
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,430
a simple system so
there's one kind of memory one way of

4310
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
there's one kind of memory one way of
 

4311
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,350
there's one kind of memory one way of
talking about memory

4312
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
talking about memory
 

4313
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:57,990
talking about memory
uh usually starts in the context of

4314
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,000
uh usually starts in the context of
 

4315
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,229
uh usually starts in the context of
hopfield networks you were lucky to talk

4316
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
hopfield networks you were lucky to talk
 

4317
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,030
hopfield networks you were lucky to talk
to john hopfield on this program but the

4318
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
to john hopfield on this program but the
 

4319
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:05,350
to john hopfield on this program but the
the basic idea there is uh working

4320
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:05,360
the basic idea there is uh working
 

4321
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:07,189
the basic idea there is uh working
memory is stored in the dynamical

4322
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
memory is stored in the dynamical
 

4323
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:11,110
memory is stored in the dynamical
patterns of activity between neurons and

4324
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
patterns of activity between neurons and
 

4325
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,510
patterns of activity between neurons and
you can you can think of a certain

4326
01:14:13,510 --> 01:14:13,520
you can you can think of a certain
 

4327
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,990
you can you can think of a certain
pattern of activity as an attractor

4328
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:16,000
pattern of activity as an attractor
 

4329
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,070
pattern of activity as an attractor
meaning if you put in

4330
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:18,080
meaning if you put in
 

4331
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,030
meaning if you put in
some

4332
01:14:19,030 --> 01:14:19,040
some
 

4333
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,390
some
signal that's similar enough to other

4334
01:14:22,390 --> 01:14:22,400
signal that's similar enough to other
 

4335
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:25,830
signal that's similar enough to other
previously experienced signals

4336
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
previously experienced signals
 

4337
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,590
previously experienced signals
like that then you're going to converge

4338
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
like that then you're going to converge
 

4339
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,750
like that then you're going to converge
to the same network dynamics and you

4340
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:29,760
to the same network dynamics and you
 

4341
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:30,709
to the same network dynamics and you
will see

4342
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:30,719
will see
 

4343
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,910
will see
these neurons

4344
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:33,920

 

4345
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:35,590

participate in the same network patterns

4346
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
participate in the same network patterns
 

4347
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,510
participate in the same network patterns
of activity that they have in the past

4348
01:14:37,510 --> 01:14:37,520
of activity that they have in the past
 

4349
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,669
of activity that they have in the past
so you can talk about the probability

4350
01:14:39,669 --> 01:14:39,679
so you can talk about the probability
 

4351
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:40,390
so you can talk about the probability
that

4352
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
that
 

4353
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,910
that
different inputs will allow you to

4354
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:41,920
different inputs will allow you to
 

4355
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,510
different inputs will allow you to
converge to different basins of

4356
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
converge to different basins of
 

4357
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,750
converge to different basins of
attraction and you might think of that

4358
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:45,760
attraction and you might think of that
 

4359
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,950
attraction and you might think of that
as oh i saw this face and then i excited

4360
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:48,960
as oh i saw this face and then i excited
 

4361
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,430
as oh i saw this face and then i excited
this network pattern of activity because

4362
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:51,440
this network pattern of activity because
 

4363
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,910
this network pattern of activity because
last time i saw that face i was at you

4364
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:53,920
last time i saw that face i was at you
 

4365
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,310
last time i saw that face i was at you
know what some movie and that that's a

4366
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
know what some movie and that that's a
 

4367
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,669
know what some movie and that that's a
famous person on the screen or something

4368
01:14:57,669 --> 01:14:57,679
famous person on the screen or something
 

4369
01:14:57,679 --> 01:14:59,590
famous person on the screen or something
like that so so that's one memory

4370
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600
like that so so that's one memory
 

4371
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,229
like that so so that's one memory
storage mechanism but crucial to

4372
01:15:02,229 --> 01:15:02,239
storage mechanism but crucial to
 

4373
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,470
storage mechanism but crucial to
the ability to imprint those memories in

4374
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:04,480
the ability to imprint those memories in
 

4375
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:08,070
the ability to imprint those memories in
your brain is the ability to change the

4376
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
your brain is the ability to change the
 

4377
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,390
your brain is the ability to change the
strength of connection between one

4378
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
strength of connection between one
 

4379
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,149
strength of connection between one
neuron and another that synaptic

4380
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:12,159
neuron and another that synaptic
 

4381
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:14,229
neuron and another that synaptic
connection between them so synaptic

4382
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:14,239
connection between them so synaptic
 

4383
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:17,270
connection between them so synaptic
weight update is a massive field of

4384
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:17,280
weight update is a massive field of
 

4385
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,030
weight update is a massive field of
neuroscience and neuromorphic computing

4386
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,040
neuroscience and neuromorphic computing
 

4387
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,870
neuroscience and neuromorphic computing
as well so

4388
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:20,880
as well so
 

4389
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:21,990
as well so
there are

4390
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,000
there are
 

4391
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,030
there are
two

4392
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,040
two
 

4393
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,950
two
poles to that

4394
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:24,960
poles to that
 

4395
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:27,510
poles to that
on that spectrum one in okay so in more

4396
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
on that spectrum one in okay so in more
 

4397
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:28,950
on that spectrum one in okay so in more
in the language of machine learning we

4398
01:15:28,950 --> 01:15:28,960
in the language of machine learning we
 

4399
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,310
in the language of machine learning we
would talk about supervised and

4400
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
would talk about supervised and
 

4401
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:31,910
would talk about supervised and
unsupervised learning

4402
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:31,920
unsupervised learning
 

4403
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,990
unsupervised learning
in when i'm trying to tie that down to

4404
01:15:33,990 --> 01:15:34,000
in when i'm trying to tie that down to
 

4405
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,310
in when i'm trying to tie that down to
neuromorphic computing i will use a

4406
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:36,320
neuromorphic computing i will use a
 

4407
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:38,630
neuromorphic computing i will use a
definition of supervised learning which

4408
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:38,640
definition of supervised learning which
 

4409
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:40,709
definition of supervised learning which
basically means

4473
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,669
activity so there's memory encoded in
the weights uh the synaptic weights yeah

4474
01:16:49,669 --> 01:16:49,679
the weights uh the synaptic weights yeah

4481
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:57,750

again not not a neuroscientist here but

4484
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:00,480
again not not a neuroscientist here but
 

4485
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,070
again not not a neuroscientist here but
my reading of the literature is that

4486
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:02,080
my reading of the literature is that
 

4487
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:04,470
my reading of the literature is that
that's particularly crucial in early

4488
01:17:04,470 --> 01:17:04,480
that's particularly crucial in early
 

4489
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,709
that's particularly crucial in early
stages of brain development where a

4490
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:06,719
stages of brain development where a
 

4491
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,630
stages of brain development where a
newborn is uh

4492
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
newborn is uh
 

4493
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,030
newborn is uh
born with tons of extra synaptic

4494
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,040
born with tons of extra synaptic
 

4495
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,270
born with tons of extra synaptic
connections and it's actually pruned

4496
01:17:13,270 --> 01:17:13,280
connections and it's actually pruned
 

4497
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:15,830
connections and it's actually pruned
over time so the number of synapses

4498
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:15,840
over time so the number of synapses
 

4499
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,310
over time so the number of synapses
decreases as opposed to growing new

4500
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:18,320
decreases as opposed to growing new
 

4501
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,550
decreases as opposed to growing new
long-distance connections it is possible

4502
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:20,560
long-distance connections it is possible
 

4503
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:23,110
long-distance connections it is possible
in the brain to grow new neurons and

4504
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:23,120
in the brain to grow new neurons and
 

4505
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:23,990
in the brain to grow new neurons and
um

4506
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
um
 

4507
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,310
um
assign new synaptic connections

4508
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:26,320
assign new synaptic connections
 

4509
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:28,470
assign new synaptic connections
but it doesn't seem to be the primary

4510
01:17:28,470 --> 01:17:28,480
but it doesn't seem to be the primary
 

4511
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,750
but it doesn't seem to be the primary
mechanism by which the brain is learning

4512
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:31,760
mechanism by which the brain is learning
 

4513
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,229
mechanism by which the brain is learning
so for example like right now

4514
01:17:34,229 --> 01:17:34,239
so for example like right now
 

4515
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:36,149
so for example like right now
sitting here talking to you you say lots

4516
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
sitting here talking to you you say lots
 

4517
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:38,070
sitting here talking to you you say lots
of interesting things and i learn what i

4518
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:38,080
of interesting things and i learn what i
 

4519
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,390
of interesting things and i learn what i
learn from you and i can remember things

4520
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:40,400
learn from you and i can remember things
 

4521
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,030
learn from you and i can remember things
that you just said and i didn't grow new

4522
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:43,040
that you just said and i didn't grow new
 

4523
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:45,830
that you just said and i didn't grow new
axonal connections down to new synapses

4524
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:45,840

4525
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,709
axonal connections down to new synapses
to to enable those it's

4526
01:17:48,709 --> 01:17:48,719

01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
that enable me to
 

4533
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,950
that enable me to
learn on that time scale so at the very

4534
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:56,960
learn on that time scale so at the very
 

4535
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,550
learn on that time scale so at the very
least that you can sufficiently

approximate that with just weight

01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,390
although it plays a key role there but
also in just keeping the activity in a

occur in a sequence so that's what's
 

4611

a way that you change not the weights
 

4633
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,110
a way that you change not the weights

01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:37,760
so that it's it stays in a useful
 

4689
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,669
so that it's it stays in a useful
dynamical range and we see that that's

4690
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:39,679
dynamical range and we see that that's
 

4691
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:41,189
dynamical range and we see that that's
that's captured in in deep neural

4692
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
that's captured in in deep neural
 

4693
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:42,550
that's captured in in deep neural
networks where you don't just change the

4694
01:20:42,550 --> 01:20:42,560
networks where you don't just change the
 

4695
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,070
networks where you don't just change the
synaptic weights but you can also move

4696
01:20:44,070 --> 01:20:44,080
synaptic weights but you can also move
 

4697
01:20:44,080 --> 01:20:46,629
synaptic weights but you can also move
the thresholds of simple neurons in

4698
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
the thresholds of simple neurons in
 

4699
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,189
the thresholds of simple neurons in
those models and so to uh

4700
01:20:49,189 --> 01:20:49,199
those models and so to uh
 

4701
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:50,390
those models and so to uh
to achieve

4702
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:50,400
to achieve
 

4703
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,189
to achieve
this

4704
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
this
 

4705
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:53,669
this
spiking neural networks

4706
01:20:53,669 --> 01:20:53,679
spiking neural networks
 

4707
01:20:53,679 --> 01:20:55,910
spiking neural networks
you want to use

4708
01:20:55,910 --> 01:20:55,920
you want to use
 

4709
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,310
you want to use
like

4710
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320

 

4711
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,550

you want to implement the first

4712
01:21:00,550 --> 01:21:00,560
you want to implement the first
 

4713
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:02,709
you want to implement the first
principles that you mentioned of the

4714
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
principles that you mentioned of the
 

4715
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:05,030
principles that you mentioned of the
temporal and the spatial

4716
01:21:05,030 --> 01:21:05,040
temporal and the spatial
 

4717
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,910
temporal and the spatial
fractal dynamics here so you can you can

4718
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:07,920
fractal dynamics here so you can you can
 

4719
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,510
fractal dynamics here so you can you can
communicate locally you can communicate

4720
01:21:11,510 --> 01:21:11,520
communicate locally you can communicate
 

4721
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:13,910
communicate locally you can communicate
across much greater distances and do the

4722
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:13,920
across much greater distances and do the
 

4723
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:15,189
across much greater distances and do the
same thing

4724
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
same thing
 

4725
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,990
same thing
in space and do the same thing in time

4726
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
in space and do the same thing in time
 

4727
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:18,790
in space and do the same thing in time
now

4728
01:21:18,790 --> 01:21:18,800
now
 

4729
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,950
now
you have like a chapter called

4730
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
you have like a chapter called
 

4731
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:22,550
you have like a chapter called
superconducting hardware for

4732
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
superconducting hardware for
 

4733
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:25,110
superconducting hardware for
neuromorphic computing so what are some

4734
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:25,120
neuromorphic computing so what are some
 

4735
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:26,950
neuromorphic computing so what are some
ideas

4736
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
ideas
 

4737
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:28,229
ideas
that integrates some of the things we've

4738
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
that integrates some of the things we've
 

4739
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,750
that integrates some of the things we've
been talking about in terms of the first

4740
01:21:29,750 --> 01:21:29,760
been talking about in terms of the first
 

4741
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,070
been talking about in terms of the first
principles of neuromorphic computing

4742
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
principles of neuromorphic computing
 

4743
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,910
principles of neuromorphic computing
and the ideas that you outline in uh

4744
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:35,920
and the ideas that you outline in uh
 

4745
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,990
and the ideas that you outline in uh
optoelectronic intelligence

4746
01:21:37,990 --> 01:21:38,000
optoelectronic intelligence
 

4747
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,950
optoelectronic intelligence
yeah

4748
01:21:38,950 --> 01:21:38,960
yeah
 

4749
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,110
yeah
so let me start i guess on the

4750
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,120
so let me start i guess on the
 

4751
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,629
so let me start i guess on the
communication side of things because

4752
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
communication side of things because
 

4753
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,149
communication side of things because
that's

4754
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
that's
 

4755
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:46,629
that's
what led us down this track in the first

4756
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
what led us down this track in the first
 

4757
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,870
what led us down this track in the first
place by us i'm talking about

4758
01:21:48,870 --> 01:21:48,880

people have done
 

4831
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,149
people have done
a lot of amazing things but in terms of

4832
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:08,159
a lot of amazing things but in terms of
 

4833
01:23:08,159 --> 01:23:10,550
a lot of amazing things but in terms of
the people in your team

4834
01:23:10,550 --> 01:23:10,560
the people in your team
 

4835
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,790
the people in your team
in this team of people involved in the

4836
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:12,800
in this team of people involved in the
 

4837
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,870
in this team of people involved in the
concept we're talking about now i'm just

4838
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
concept we're talking about now i'm just
 

4839
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,550
concept we're talking about now i'm just
curious what kind of disciplines are we

4840
01:23:16,550 --> 01:23:16,560
curious what kind of disciplines are we
 

4841
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:18,310
curious what kind of disciplines are we
talking about what is it mostly

4842
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:18,320
talking about what is it mostly
 

4843
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,390
talking about what is it mostly
physicists and electrical engineers some

4844
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:20,400
physicists and electrical engineers some
 

4845
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:22,950
physicists and electrical engineers some
material scientists

4846
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:22,960
material scientists
 

4847
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,709
material scientists
but i would say

4848
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:24,719
but i would say
 

4849
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:26,629
but i would say
yeah i think physicists and electrical

4850
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:26,639
yeah i think physicists and electrical
 

4851
01:23:26,639 --> 01:23:29,350
yeah i think physicists and electrical
engineers my background is in photonics

4852
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:29,360
engineers my background is in photonics
 

4853
01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,470
engineers my background is in photonics
the use of light for technology so

4854
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:32,480
the use of light for technology so
 

4855
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:35,110
the use of light for technology so
coming from there i i tend to

4856
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
coming from there i i tend to
 

4857
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,430
coming from there i i tend to
have found colleagues that are more from

4858
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:37,440
have found colleagues that are more from
 

4859
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,110
have found colleagues that are more from
that background although

4860
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,120
that background although
 

4861
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,189
that background although
uh adam akan more of a superconducting

4862
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
uh adam akan more of a superconducting
 

4863
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:43,189
uh adam akan more of a superconducting
electronics background we need a

4864
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:43,199
electronics background we need a
 

4865
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,350
electronics background we need a
diversity of folks this project is sort

4866
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:45,360
diversity of folks this project is sort
 

4867
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:47,590
diversity of folks this project is sort
of cross-disciplinary i would love to be

4868
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:47,600
of cross-disciplinary i would love to be
 

4869
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,750
of cross-disciplinary i would love to be
working more with neuroscientists and

4870
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:49,760
working more with neuroscientists and
 

4871
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,830
working more with neuroscientists and
things um but

4872
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
things um but
 

4873
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,590
things um but
we haven't we haven't reached that scale

4874
01:23:53,590 --> 01:23:53,600
we haven't we haven't reached that scale
 

4875
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:54,870
we haven't we haven't reached that scale
yet but yeah

4876
01:23:54,870 --> 01:23:54,880
yet but yeah
 

4877
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:56,310
yet but yeah
you're focused on the hardware side

4878
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:56,320
you're focused on the hardware side
 

4879
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,229
you're focused on the hardware side
which requires all the disciplines that

4880
01:23:58,229 --> 01:23:58,239
which requires all the disciplines that
 

4881
01:23:58,239 --> 01:23:59,669
which requires all the disciplines that
you mentioned yes and then of course

4882
01:23:59,669 --> 01:23:59,679
you mentioned yes and then of course
 

4883
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:01,189
you mentioned yes and then of course
neuroscience may be a source of

4884
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:01,199
neuroscience may be a source of
 

4885
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,430
neuroscience may be a source of
inspiration for some of the the the

4886
01:24:03,430 --> 01:24:03,440
inspiration for some of the the the
 

4887
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:04,870
inspiration for some of the the the
long-term vision i would actually call

4888
01:24:04,870 --> 01:24:04,880
long-term vision i would actually call
 

4889
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:07,110
long-term vision i would actually call
it more than inspiration i would call it

4890
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:07,120
it more than inspiration i would call it
 

4891
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,590
it more than inspiration i would call it
sort of um

4892
01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:09,600
sort of um
 

4893
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,270
sort of um
a road map you know

4894
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:11,280
a road map you know
 

4895
01:24:11,280 --> 01:24:14,310
a road map you know
we're not trying to to build exactly the

4896
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:14,320
we're not trying to to build exactly the
 

4897
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,709
we're not trying to to build exactly the
brain but i don't think it's enough to

4898
01:24:16,709 --> 01:24:16,719
brain but i don't think it's enough to
 

4899
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:18,870
brain but i don't think it's enough to
just say oh neurons kind of work like

4900
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:18,880
just say oh neurons kind of work like
 

4901
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:21,030
just say oh neurons kind of work like
that let's kind of do that thing i mean

4902
01:24:21,030 --> 01:24:21,040
that let's kind of do that thing i mean
 

4903
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:22,870
that let's kind of do that thing i mean
we're

4904
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:22,880
we're
 

4905
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,350
we're
very much following the concepts that

4906
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:25,360
very much following the concepts that
 

4907
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,189
very much following the concepts that
the cognitive sciences have laid out for

4908
01:24:27,189 --> 01:24:27,199
the cognitive sciences have laid out for
 

4909
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:29,350
the cognitive sciences have laid out for
us which i believe is is a

4910
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:29,360
us which i believe is is a
 

4911
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:31,189
us which i believe is is a
really robust road map i mean just on a

4912
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
really robust road map i mean just on a
 

4913
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:33,830
really robust road map i mean just on a
little bit of a tangent it's often

4914
01:24:33,830 --> 01:24:33,840
little bit of a tangent it's often
 

4915
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:35,669
little bit of a tangent it's often
stated that we just don't understand the

4916
01:24:35,669 --> 01:24:35,679
stated that we just don't understand the
 

4917
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:37,030
stated that we just don't understand the
brain and so it's really hard to

4918
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
brain and so it's really hard to
 

4919
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,270
brain and so it's really hard to
replicate it because we just don't know

4920
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:39,280
replicate it because we just don't know
 

4921
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,310
replicate it because we just don't know
what's going on

4922
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:40,320
what's going on
 

4923
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,310
what's going on
and i maybe

4924
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:42,320
and i maybe
 

4925
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,229
and i maybe
five or seven years ago i would have

4926
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:44,239
five or seven years ago i would have
 

4927
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:45,510
five or seven years ago i would have
said that but

4928
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:45,520
said that but
 

4929
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,830
said that but
as i got more interested in the subject

4930
01:24:47,830 --> 01:24:47,840
as i got more interested in the subject
 

4931
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:49,990
as i got more interested in the subject
i had read more of the neuroscience

4932
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:50,000
i had read more of the neuroscience
 

4933
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,149
i had read more of the neuroscience
literature and i was just taken by the

4934
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
literature and i was just taken by the
 

4935
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,470
literature and i was just taken by the
exact opposite sense i can't believe how

4936
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
exact opposite sense i can't believe how
 

4937
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,070
exact opposite sense i can't believe how
much they know about this i can't

4938
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
much they know about this i can't
 

4939
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,510
much they know about this i can't
believe how

4940
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:57,520
believe how
 

4941
01:24:57,520 --> 01:25:01,270
believe how
mathematically rigorous and um sort of

4942
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
mathematically rigorous and um sort of
 

4943
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,510
mathematically rigorous and um sort of
theoretically complete a lot of the

4944
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
theoretically complete a lot of the
 

4945
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,430
theoretically complete a lot of the
concepts are that's not to say we

4946
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:05,440
concepts are that's not to say we
 

4947
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:06,790
concepts are that's not to say we
understand consciousness or we

4948
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
understand consciousness or we
 

4949
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,229
understand consciousness or we
understand the self or anything like

4950
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:08,239
understand the self or anything like
 

4951
01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:10,390
understand the self or anything like
that but why is the brain what is the

4952
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:10,400
that but why is the brain what is the
 

4953
01:25:10,400 --> 01:25:12,229
that but why is the brain what is the
brain doing and why is it doing those

4954
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:12,239
brain doing and why is it doing those
 

4955
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:14,470
brain doing and why is it doing those
things we have a neuroscientists have a

4956
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
things we have a neuroscientists have a
 

4957
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:15,990
things we have a neuroscientists have a
lot of answers to those questions so

4958
01:25:15,990 --> 01:25:16,000
lot of answers to those questions so
 

4959
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,350
lot of answers to those questions so
there's a lot if you're a hardware

4960
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:17,360
there's a lot if you're a hardware
 

4961
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,430
there's a lot if you're a hardware
designer that just wants to get going

4962
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:19,440
designer that just wants to get going
 

4963
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:21,430
designer that just wants to get going
whoa it's pretty clear which direction

4964
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:21,440
whoa it's pretty clear which direction
 

4965
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:22,870
whoa it's pretty clear which direction
to go in i think

4966
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:22,880
to go in i think
 

4967
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,110
to go in i think
okay uh so

4968
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
okay uh so
 

4969
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,669
okay uh so
i love i love the the optimism behind

4970
01:25:27,669 --> 01:25:27,679
i love i love the the optimism behind
 

4971
01:25:27,679 --> 01:25:30,149
i love i love the the optimism behind
that but um in the implementation of

4972
01:25:30,149 --> 01:25:30,159
that but um in the implementation of
 

4973
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:32,629
that but um in the implementation of
these systems

4974
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
these systems
 

4975
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:35,189
these systems
that uh uses supercontext super

4976
01:25:35,189 --> 01:25:35,199
that uh uses supercontext super
 

4977
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:36,950
that uh uses supercontext super
connectivity

4978
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:36,960
connectivity
 

4979
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,350
connectivity
how do you make it happen

4980
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:39,360
how do you make it happen
 

4981
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:41,910
how do you make it happen
so to me it starts with thinking about

4982
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:41,920
so to me it starts with thinking about
 

4983
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,229
so to me it starts with thinking about
the communication network you know for

4984
01:25:44,229 --> 01:25:44,239
the communication network you know for
 

4985
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:45,910
the communication network you know for
sure that

4986
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:45,920
sure that
 

4987
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,590
sure that
the ability of each neuron to

4988
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:47,600
the ability of each neuron to
 

4989
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:49,990
the ability of each neuron to
communicate to many thousands of

4990
01:25:49,990 --> 01:25:50,000
communicate to many thousands of
 

4991
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,350
communicate to many thousands of
colleagues across the network is

4992
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
colleagues across the network is
 

4993
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,669
colleagues across the network is
indispensable i take that as a core

4994
01:25:53,669 --> 01:25:53,679
indispensable i take that as a core
 

4995
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:55,189
indispensable i take that as a core
principle of my

4996
01:25:55,189 --> 01:25:55,199
principle of my
 

4997
01:25:55,199 --> 01:25:56,870
principle of my
my architecture my thinking on the

4998
01:25:56,870 --> 01:25:56,880
my architecture my thinking on the
 

4999
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:58,390
my architecture my thinking on the
subject

5000
01:25:58,390 --> 01:25:58,400
subject
 

5001
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,830
subject
so coming from

5002
01:25:59,830 --> 01:25:59,840
so coming from
 

5003
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,310
so coming from
coming from a background in photonics it

5004
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
coming from a background in photonics it
 

5005
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,910
coming from a background in photonics it
was very natural to say okay we're going

5006
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:03,920
was very natural to say okay we're going
 

5007
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,830
was very natural to say okay we're going
to use light for communication just in

5008
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:05,840
to use light for communication just in
 

5009
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,709
to use light for communication just in
case listeners may not know

5010
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:08,719

helpful to me to say
in this hardware a neuron is that entity

5080
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:24,480
in this hardware a neuron is that entity
 

5081
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,270
in this hardware a neuron is that entity
which has a light source that

and i i can and then there was light

5084
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:29,199
and i i can and then there was light
 

5085
01:27:29,199 --> 01:27:30,629
and i i can and then there was light
yeah i mean i can explain more about

5086
01:27:30,629 --> 01:27:30,639
yeah i mean i can explain more about
 

5087
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,590
yeah i mean i can explain more about
that but um somehow this like rhymes

5088
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:33,600
that but um somehow this like rhymes
 

5089
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:35,910
that but um somehow this like rhymes

01:27:37,350 --> 01:27:37,360
people will often say the light of
 

5093
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,830
people will often say the light of
consciousness so that consciousness is

5094
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
consciousness so that consciousness is
 

5095
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:43,510
consciousness so that consciousness is
that which is conscious i got it

5096
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:43,520
that which is conscious i got it
 

5097
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,590
that which is conscious i got it
that's not my quote that's me that's my

uh you see that quote comes from my
 

5103
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:51,910

01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,790

so go ahead

5108
01:27:56,790 --> 01:27:56,800
so go ahead
 

5109
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:58,709
so go ahead
so what the point i was making there is

5110
01:27:58,709 --> 01:27:58,719
so what the point i was making there is
 

5111
01:27:58,719 --> 01:27:59,510
so what the point i was making there is
that

5112
01:27:59,510 --> 01:27:59,520
that
 

5113
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,390
that
if it was easy to manufacture light

5114
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:02,400
if it was easy to manufacture light
 

5115
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,470
if it was easy to manufacture light

yeah and it's not easy it's there people

5120
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:08,960
yeah and it's not easy it's there people
 

5121
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,310
yeah and it's not easy it's there people
have been trying for decades and it's

5122
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
have been trying for decades and it's
 

5123
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,390
have been trying for decades and it's
actually extremely difficult i think an

there so is it physics or engineering
 

5131
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,550
there so is it physics or engineering
so okay so it's it's physics i think so

5132
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:22,560
so okay so it's it's physics i think so
 

5133
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:24,470
so okay so it's it's physics i think so
and what i mean by that is

and what i mean by that is
 

5135
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,950
and what i mean by that is
as as we discussed

notoriously bad at emitting light and
 

5147
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,110
notoriously bad at emitting light and
that has to do with

01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
that has to do with
 

5149
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,750
that has to do with

to make silicon efficient as a light

5156
01:28:50,950 --> 01:28:50,960
to make silicon efficient as a light

01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,430
to make silicon efficient as a light

drives the the light source chip and
 

5333
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,750
drives the the light source chip and
modulates the intensity of the light so

5334
01:31:49,750 --> 01:31:49,760
modulates the intensity of the light so
 

5335
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:51,430
modulates the intensity of the light so
you can get data out of the package on

5336
01:31:51,430 --> 01:31:51,440
you can get data out of the package on
 

5337
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:53,270
you can get data out of the package on
an optical fiber and that still gives

5338
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
an optical fiber and that still gives
 

5339
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,470
an optical fiber and that still gives
you tremendous advantages in bandwidth

5340
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:56,480
you tremendous advantages in bandwidth
 

5341
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,709
you tremendous advantages in bandwidth
as opposed to sending those signals out

5342
01:31:58,709 --> 01:31:58,719
as opposed to sending those signals out
 

5343
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:00,870
as opposed to sending those signals out
over electrical lines

over electrical lines
 

5345
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:02,229
over electrical lines
but

5346
01:32:02,229 --> 01:32:02,239
but
 

5347
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:03,189
but
it is

5348
01:32:03,189 --> 01:32:03,199
it is
 

5349
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:05,910
it is
somewhat peculiar to my eye that

5350
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:05,920
somewhat peculiar to my eye that
 

5351
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,189
somewhat peculiar to my eye that
they have to be integrated at this

5352
01:32:07,189 --> 01:32:07,199
they have to be integrated at this
 

5353
01:32:07,199 --> 01:32:08,709
they have to be integrated at this
package level and those those people i

5354
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
package level and those those people i
 

5355
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:10,709
package level and those those people i
mean they're so smart those are my

5356
01:32:10,709 --> 01:32:10,719
mean they're so smart those are my
 

5357
01:32:10,719 --> 01:32:12,550
mean they're so smart those are my
my colleagues that i respect a great

5358
01:32:12,550 --> 01:32:12,560
my colleagues that i respect a great
 

5359
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:14,550
my colleagues that i respect a great
deal so it's it's very clear that it's

5360
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
deal so it's it's very clear that it's
 

5361
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,790
deal so it's it's very clear that it's
not just

5362
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:16,800
not just
 

5363
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,189
not just
they're making a bad choice this is what

5364
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:19,199
they're making a bad choice this is what
 

5365
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:21,270
they're making a bad choice this is what
physics is telling us it just wouldn't

5366
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280
physics is telling us it just wouldn't
 

5367
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:23,430
physics is telling us it just wouldn't
make any sense to to try to stick them

5368
01:32:23,430 --> 01:32:23,440
make any sense to to try to stick them
 

5369
01:32:23,440 --> 01:32:25,510
make any sense to to try to stick them
together yeah so there even if it's

5370
01:32:25,510 --> 01:32:25,520
together yeah so there even if it's
 

5371
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:26,950
together yeah so there even if it's
difficult

5372
01:32:26,950 --> 01:32:26,960
difficult
 

5373
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:28,149
difficult
um

5374
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:28,159
um
 

5375
01:32:28,159 --> 01:32:30,310
um
it's uh easier than the alternative

5376
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
it's uh easier than the alternative
 

5377
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,470
it's uh easier than the alternative
unfortunately i think so yes and i again

01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,480
unfortunately i think so yes and i again
 

5379
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,990
unfortunately i think so yes and i again
i need to go back and and make sure that

5380
01:32:33,990 --> 01:32:34,000
i need to go back and and make sure that
 

5381
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,510
i need to go back and and make sure that
i'm not taking the wrong way i'm not

you don't need good light sources you
can have the world's worst light sources

5654
01:37:08,709 --> 01:37:08,719
can have the world's worst light sources
 

5655
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:10,790
can have the world's worst light sources
as long as they spit out maybe a few

5656
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
as long as they spit out maybe a few
 

5657
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:12,629
as long as they spit out maybe a few
thousand photons every time a neuron

and i hope
 

5685
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:39,030
and i hope
that when we move to the superconducting

5686
01:37:39,030 --> 01:37:39,040
that when we move to the superconducting
 

5687
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:39,990
that when we move to the superconducting
domain

that is neuromorphic instead of digital
 

5693
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:47,669
that is neuromorphic instead of digital
and use superconducting detectors

5694
01:37:47,669 --> 01:37:47,679
and use superconducting detectors
 

5695
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:49,510
and use superconducting detectors
maybe optoelectronic integration comes

5696
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:49,520
maybe optoelectronic integration comes
 

5697
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:51,109
maybe optoelectronic integration comes
to us okay so there's a bunch of

5698
01:37:51,109 --> 01:37:51,119
to us okay so there's a bunch of
 

5699
01:37:51,119 --> 01:37:53,669
to us okay so there's a bunch of
questions so one is temperature

5700
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
questions so one is temperature
 

5701
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,790
questions so one is temperature
so in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous

5702
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
so in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous
 

5703
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,229
so in these kind of hybrid heterogeneous
systems

01:38:00,070 --> 01:38:00,080
what's the temperature what are some of
 

5707
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:01,669
what's the temperature what are some of
the constraints of the operation here

does it all have to be a four kelvin as

5710
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:03,119
does it all have to be a four kelvin as
 

5711
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,030
does it all have to be a four kelvin as
well four kelvin everything has to be at

5712
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
well four kelvin everything has to be at
 

5713
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,790
well four kelvin everything has to be at
four kelvin

four kelvin
 

5715
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:08,870
four kelvin
okay so what are the other engineering

5716
01:38:08,870 --> 01:38:08,880
okay so what are the other engineering
 

5717
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,310
okay so what are the other engineering
challenges of making this kind of

5718
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:12,320
challenges of making this kind of
 

5719
01:38:12,320 --> 01:38:14,229

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:15,990
optoelectronic systems
let me just dwell on that four kelvin

5722
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
let me just dwell on that four kelvin
 

5723
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,350
let me just dwell on that four kelvin
for a second because some people hear

5724
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:17,360
for a second because some people hear
 

5725
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,870
for a second because some people hear
four kelvin and they just get up and

5726
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:18,880
four kelvin and they just get up and
 

5727
01:38:18,880 --> 01:38:20,470
four kelvin and they just get up and
leave they just say i don't i'm not

5728
01:38:20,470 --> 01:38:20,480
leave they just say i don't i'm not
 

5729
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:23,270
leave they just say i don't i'm not
doing it you know and to me that's very

5730
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,280
doing it you know and to me that's very
 

5731
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,070
doing it you know and to me that's very
earth-centric species-centric we live in

5732
01:38:26,070 --> 01:38:26,080
earth-centric species-centric we live in
 

5733
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:28,390
earth-centric species-centric we live in
300 kelvin so we want our technologies

5734
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
300 kelvin so we want our technologies
 

5735
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,990
300 kelvin so we want our technologies
to operate there too i totally get it

5736
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
to operate there too i totally get it
 

5737
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,790
to operate there too i totally get it
yeah what's zero celsius zero celsius is

5738
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:32,800
yeah what's zero celsius zero celsius is
 

5739
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:35,189
yeah what's zero celsius zero celsius is
273 kelvin so

5740
01:38:35,189 --> 01:38:35,199
273 kelvin so
 

5741
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:37,750
273 kelvin so
we're talking very very cold here this

5742
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:37,760
we're talking very very cold here this
 

5743
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:41,189
we're talking very very cold here this
is this is even boston cold

5744
01:38:41,189 --> 01:38:41,199
is this is even boston cold
 

5745
01:38:41,199 --> 01:38:44,470
is this is even boston cold
this is real cold yeah siberia no okay

5746
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480
this is real cold yeah siberia no okay
 

5747
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:45,990
this is real cold yeah siberia no okay
so just for reference the the

5748
01:38:45,990 --> 01:38:46,000
so just for reference the the
 

5749
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,430
so just for reference the the
temperature of the cosmic microwave

5750
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
temperature of the cosmic microwave
 

5751
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,750
temperature of the cosmic microwave
background is about 2.7 kelvin so we're

5752
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:49,760
background is about 2.7 kelvin so we're
 

5753
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,550
background is about 2.7 kelvin so we're
still

5754
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:50,560
still
 

5755
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,310
still
warmer than deep space

5756
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:52,320
warmer than deep space
 

5757
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:55,109
warmer than deep space
good so that when the universe

5758
01:38:55,109 --> 01:38:55,119
good so that when the universe
 

5759
01:38:55,119 --> 01:38:56,390
good so that when the universe
dies out

5760
01:38:56,390 --> 01:38:56,400
dies out
 

5761
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:58,390
dies out
it'll be colder than 4k it's already

5762
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
it'll be colder than 4k it's already
 

5763
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,270
it'll be colder than 4k it's already
colder than 4k in the in the expanses

5764
01:39:01,270 --> 01:39:01,280
colder than 4k in the in the expanses
 

5765
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,750
colder than 4k in the in the expanses
you know you don't have to get that far

5766
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:03,760
you know you don't have to get that far
 

5767
01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:06,550
you know you don't have to get that far
away from the earth in order to to drop

5768
01:39:06,550 --> 01:39:06,560
away from the earth in order to to drop
 

5769
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:08,550
away from the earth in order to to drop
down to not far from what you're saying

5770
01:39:08,550 --> 01:39:08,560
down to not far from what you're saying
 

5771
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:11,109
down to not far from what you're saying
is the aliens that live at the edge

5772
01:39:11,109 --> 01:39:11,119
is the aliens that live at the edge
 

5773
01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:13,270
is the aliens that live at the edge
of the observable universe

5774
01:39:13,270 --> 01:39:13,280
of the observable universe
 

5775
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,270
of the observable universe
are using superconductive material for

01:39:15,270 --> 01:39:15,280
are using superconductive material for
 

5777
01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:16,790
are using superconductive material for
their computation they don't have to

5778
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
their computation they don't have to
 

5779
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:17,910
their computation they don't have to
live at the edge of the universe the

5780
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
live at the edge of the universe the
 

5781
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,030
live at the edge of the universe the
aliens that are more advanced than us

5782
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:21,040
aliens that are more advanced than us
 

5783
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:23,189
aliens that are more advanced than us
in their solar system are

5784
01:39:23,189 --> 01:39:23,199
in their solar system are
 

5785
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,390
in their solar system are
doing this

5786
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,400
doing this
 

5787
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,390
doing this
in their asteroid belt

5788
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:26,400
in their asteroid belt
 

5789
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:28,390
in their asteroid belt
we can get to that oh

5790
01:39:28,390 --> 01:39:28,400
we can get to that oh
 

5791
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:30,470
we can get to that oh
because of the they can get that to that

5792
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
because of the they can get that to that
 

5793
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,310
because of the they can get that to that
temperature easier there sure yeah all

5794
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:32,320
temperature easier there sure yeah all
 

5795
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:33,750
temperature easier there sure yeah all
you have to do is reflect the sunlight

5796
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:33,760
you have to do is reflect the sunlight
 

5797
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,070
you have to do is reflect the sunlight
away and you have a huge head start oh

5798
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:36,080
away and you have a huge head start oh
 

5799
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:37,830
away and you have a huge head start oh
so the sun is the problem here yeah like

5800
01:39:37,830 --> 01:39:37,840
so the sun is the problem here yeah like
 

5801
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:40,229
so the sun is the problem here yeah like
it's warm here on earth yeah okay okay

5802
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:40,239
it's warm here on earth yeah okay okay
 

5803
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:42,870
it's warm here on earth yeah okay okay
so can you uh so how do we get to 4k

5804
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:42,880
so can you uh so how do we get to 4k
 

5805
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,189
so can you uh so how do we get to 4k
what's well okay so very different kind

5806
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:45,199
what's well okay so very different kind
 

5807
01:39:45,199 --> 01:39:46,229
what's well okay so very different kind
of 4k

5808
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
of 4k
 

5809
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:48,470
of 4k
temperature yeah what i want to say

5810
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
temperature yeah what i want to say
 

5811
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:50,629
temperature yeah what i want to say

01:42:27,030 --> 01:42:27,040
a technological
 

5973
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:31,109
a technological
domain or or realm that is

5974
01:42:31,109 --> 01:42:31,119
domain or or realm that is
 

5975
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:33,669
domain or or realm that is
achieving in most ways everything else

5976
01:42:33,669 --> 01:42:33,679
achieving in most ways everything else
 

5977
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:35,270
achieving in most ways everything else
that i that i'm looking for in my

5978
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
that i that i'm looking for in my
 

5979
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:37,510
that i that i'm looking for in my
hardware so that okay that's a big one

5980
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
hardware so that okay that's a big one
 

5981
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:39,109
hardware so that okay that's a big one
is there other kind of engineering

5982
01:42:39,109 --> 01:42:39,119
is there other kind of engineering
 

5983
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,030
is there other kind of engineering
challenges that you envision yeah yeah

5984
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:41,040
challenges that you envision yeah yeah
 

5985
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,030
challenges that you envision yeah yeah
yeah so let me take a moment here

5986
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:43,040
yeah so let me take a moment here
 

5987
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:45,109
yeah so let me take a moment here
because i haven't really described

5988
01:42:45,109 --> 01:42:45,119
because i haven't really described
 

5989
01:42:45,119 --> 01:42:47,189
because i haven't really described
what i mean by a neuron or a network in

5990
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:47,199
what i mean by a neuron or a network in
 

5991
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:49,350
what i mean by a neuron or a network in
this particular hardware yeah do you

want to talk about loop neurons and
there's so many fascinating but you just

5996
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:54,480
there's so many fascinating but you just
 

5997
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:56,149
there's so many fascinating but you just
have so many amazing papers that people

5998
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
have so many amazing papers that people
 

5999
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,310
have so many amazing papers that people
should definitely check out and uh the

6000
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,320
should definitely check out and uh the
 

6001
01:42:58,320 --> 01:43:00,550
should definitely check out and uh the
titles alone are just killers so anyway

6002
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:00,560
titles alone are just killers so anyway
 

6003
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,550
titles alone are just killers so anyway
go ahead right so let me say big picture

6004
01:43:04,550 --> 01:43:04,560
go ahead right so let me say big picture
 

6005
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:06,629
go ahead right so let me say big picture

a neuron in this in this hardware

6014
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:16,480
a neuron in this in this hardware
 

6015
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:19,430
a neuron in this in this hardware
platform can be thought of as circuits

6016
01:43:19,430 --> 01:43:19,440

that are based on joseph's injunctions

6018
01:43:20,950 --> 01:43:20,960
that are based on joseph's injunctions
 

6019
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:22,709
that are based on joseph's injunctions
like we talked about before

6020
01:43:22,709 --> 01:43:22,719
like we talked about before
 

6021
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,510
like we talked about before
where every time a photon comes in so

6022
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:25,520
where every time a photon comes in so
 

6023
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:27,109
where every time a photon comes in so
let's start by talking about a synapse a

6024
01:43:27,109 --> 01:43:27,119
let's start by talking about a synapse a
 

6025
01:43:27,119 --> 01:43:29,590
let's start by talking about a synapse a
synapse receives a photon one or more

6026
01:43:29,590 --> 01:43:29,600
synapse receives a photon one or more
 

6027
01:43:29,600 --> 01:43:31,750
synapse receives a photon one or more
from a from a different neuron and it

6028
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:31,760
from a from a different neuron and it
 

6029
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,830
from a from a different neuron and it
converts that optical signal to an

6030
01:43:33,830 --> 01:43:33,840
converts that optical signal to an
 

6031
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:35,270
converts that optical signal to an
electrical signal

6032
01:43:35,270 --> 01:43:35,280
electrical signal
 

6033
01:43:35,280 --> 01:43:38,070
electrical signal
the amount of current that that adds to

6034
01:43:38,070 --> 01:43:38,080
the amount of current that that adds to
 

6035
01:43:38,080 --> 01:43:40,470
the amount of current that that adds to
a loop is controlled by the synaptic

6036
01:43:40,470 --> 01:43:40,480
a loop is controlled by the synaptic
 

6037
01:43:40,480 --> 01:43:42,470
a loop is controlled by the synaptic
weight so as i said before you're

6038
01:43:42,470 --> 01:43:42,480
weight so as i said before you're
 

6039
01:43:42,480 --> 01:43:45,270
weight so as i said before you're
popping fluxons into a loop right so

6040
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:45,280
popping fluxons into a loop right so
 

6041
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,950
popping fluxons into a loop right so
a photon comes in it hits a

6042
01:43:46,950 --> 01:43:46,960
a photon comes in it hits a
 

6043
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:49,109
a photon comes in it hits a
superconducting single photon detector

6044
01:43:49,109 --> 01:43:49,119
superconducting single photon detector
 

6045
01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,590
superconducting single photon detector
one photon the the absolute physical

6046
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,600
one photon the the absolute physical
 

6047
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:53,030
one photon the the absolute physical
minimum that you can communicate from

6048
01:43:53,030 --> 01:43:53,040
minimum that you can communicate from
 

6049
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,709
minimum that you can communicate from
one place to another with light and that

6050
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:54,719
one place to another with light and that
 

6051
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:56,310
one place to another with light and that
detector then converts that to an

6052
01:43:56,310 --> 01:43:56,320
detector then converts that to an
 

6053
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,149
detector then converts that to an
electrical signal and the amount of

6054
01:43:58,149 --> 01:43:58,159
electrical signal and the amount of
 

6055
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:00,709
electrical signal and the amount of
signal is uh correlated with some kind

6056
01:44:00,709 --> 01:44:00,719
signal is uh correlated with some kind
 

6057
01:44:00,719 --> 01:44:02,390
signal is uh correlated with some kind
of weight yeah so the synaptic weight

6058
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
of weight yeah so the synaptic weight
 

6059
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,629
of weight yeah so the synaptic weight
will tell you how many fluxons you pop

6060
01:44:04,629 --> 01:44:04,639
will tell you how many fluxons you pop
 

6061
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,470
will tell you how many fluxons you pop
into the loop it's an analog number

6062
01:44:06,470 --> 01:44:06,480
into the loop it's an analog number
 

6063
01:44:06,480 --> 01:44:08,629
into the loop it's an analog number
we're doing analog computation now well

6064
01:44:08,629 --> 01:44:08,639
we're doing analog computation now well
 

6065
01:44:08,639 --> 01:44:09,910
we're doing analog computation now well
can you just linger on that what the

6066
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:09,920
can you just linger on that what the
 

6067
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,430
can you just linger on that what the
heck is the flux on are we supposed to

6068
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
heck is the flux on are we supposed to
 

6069
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,149
heck is the flux on are we supposed to
know this or is this is this a funny uh

6070
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
know this or is this is this a funny uh
 

6071
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:16,950
know this or is this is this a funny uh
it's like the big bang is this is this a

6072
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:16,960
it's like the big bang is this is this a
 

6073
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,310
it's like the big bang is this is this a
funny word for something deeply

6074
01:44:18,310 --> 01:44:18,320
funny word for something deeply
 

6075
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,070
funny word for something deeply
technical no let's let's try to avoid

6076
01:44:20,070 --> 01:44:20,080
technical no let's let's try to avoid
 

6077
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,350
technical no let's let's try to avoid
using the word flux line because it's

6078
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
using the word flux line because it's
 

6079
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:23,990
using the word flux line because it's
not actually necessary when a when a

6080
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
not actually necessary when a when a
 

6081
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:27,109
not actually necessary when a when a
photo is fun to say though so uh so

6082
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
photo is fun to say though so uh so
 

6083
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,350
photo is fun to say though so uh so
it's very necessary i would say when

6084
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,360
it's very necessary i would say when
 

6085
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:31,189
it's very necessary i would say when
when a photon hits that superconducting

6086
01:44:31,189 --> 01:44:31,199
when a photon hits that superconducting
 

6087
01:44:31,199 --> 01:44:32,950
when a photon hits that superconducting
single photon detector

6088
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:32,960

and the the amount of current that you

6094
01:44:38,470 --> 01:44:38,480
and the the amount of current that you
 

6095
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:40,870
and the the amount of current that you
add can is an analog value can have

6096
01:44:40,870 --> 01:44:40,880
add can is an analog value can have
 

6097
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:42,950
add can is an analog value can have
eight bit equivalent resolution

6098
01:44:42,950 --> 01:44:42,960
eight bit equivalent resolution
 

6099
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:44,229
eight bit equivalent resolution
something like that

6100
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:44,239
something like that
 

6101
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,870
something like that
10 bits maybe that's amazing by the way

6102
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
10 bits maybe that's amazing by the way
 

6103
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,070
10 bits maybe that's amazing by the way
this is starting to make a lot more

6104
01:44:48,070 --> 01:44:48,080
this is starting to make a lot more
 

6105
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:49,990
this is starting to make a lot more
sense when you're using superconductors

6106
01:44:49,990 --> 01:44:50,000
sense when you're using superconductors
 

6107
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,470
sense when you're using superconductors
for this the energy

6108
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,480
for this the energy
 

6109
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,830
for this the energy
of that circulating current is

6110
01:44:55,830 --> 01:44:55,840
of that circulating current is
 

6111
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:58,550
of that circulating current is
is less than the energy of that photon

6112
01:44:58,550 --> 01:44:58,560
is less than the energy of that photon
 

6113
01:44:58,560 --> 01:44:59,430
is less than the energy of that photon
so your

6114
01:44:59,430 --> 01:44:59,440
so your
 

6115
01:44:59,440 --> 01:45:01,830
so your
your energy budget is not destroyed by

6116
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,840
your energy budget is not destroyed by
 

6117
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,990
your energy budget is not destroyed by
doing this analog computation

6118
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,000
doing this analog computation
 

6119
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,149
doing this analog computation
so now in the language of a

6120
01:45:06,149 --> 01:45:06,159
so now in the language of a
 

6121
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,910
so now in the language of a
neuroscientist you would say that's your

6122
01:45:07,910 --> 01:45:07,920
neuroscientist you would say that's your
 

6123
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:09,830
neuroscientist you would say that's your
post-synaptic signal you have this

6124
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:09,840
post-synaptic signal you have this
 

6125
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:12,229
post-synaptic signal you have this
current being stored in a loop you can

6126
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
current being stored in a loop you can
 

6127
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,669
current being stored in a loop you can
decide what you want to do with it most

6128
01:45:13,669 --> 01:45:13,679
decide what you want to do with it most
 

6129
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:15,350
decide what you want to do with it most
likely you're going to have it decay

6130
01:45:15,350 --> 01:45:15,360
likely you're going to have it decay
 

6131
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:17,189
likely you're going to have it decay
exponentially so

6132
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
exponentially so
 

6133
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:18,950
exponentially so
every single synapse is going to have

6134
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
every single synapse is going to have
 

6135
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:20,950
every single synapse is going to have
some given time constant

6136
01:45:20,950 --> 01:45:20,960
some given time constant
 

6137
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,510
some given time constant
and that's determined by set by putting

6138
01:45:23,510 --> 01:45:23,520
and that's determined by set by putting
 

6139
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,709
and that's determined by set by putting
some

6140
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
some
 

6141
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,790
some
resistor in that in that superconducting

6142
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:26,800
resistor in that in that superconducting
 

6143
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,350
resistor in that in that superconducting
loop so a synapse a synapse event occurs

6144
01:45:29,350 --> 01:45:29,360
loop so a synapse a synapse event occurs
 

6145
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:31,350
loop so a synapse a synapse event occurs
when a photon strikes a detector adds

6146
01:45:31,350 --> 01:45:31,360
when a photon strikes a detector adds
 

6147
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:33,750
when a photon strikes a detector adds
current to that loop it decays over time

6148
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:33,760
current to that loop it decays over time
 

6149
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,070
current to that loop it decays over time
that's the postsynaptic signal then you

6150
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
that's the postsynaptic signal then you
 

6151
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,470
that's the postsynaptic signal then you
can process that in a dendritic tree

6152
01:45:38,470 --> 01:45:38,480
can process that in a dendritic tree
 

6153
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,950
can process that in a dendritic tree

01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,790
produce sufficient voltage to drive
current through that now semiconducting

6270
01:47:38,790 --> 01:47:38,800
current through that now semiconducting
 

6271
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:40,709
current through that now semiconducting
part so that light source is the

6272
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:40,719
part so that light source is the
 

6273
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:43,109
part so that light source is the
semiconducting part of a neuron

6274
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119
semiconducting part of a neuron
 

6275
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,030
semiconducting part of a neuron
and that so the neuron has reached

6276
01:47:45,030 --> 01:47:45,040
and that so the neuron has reached
 

6277
01:47:45,040 --> 01:47:47,590
and that so the neuron has reached
threshold it produces a pulse of light

6278
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,600
threshold it produces a pulse of light
 

6279
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:50,229
threshold it produces a pulse of light
that light then fans out across a

6280
01:47:50,229 --> 01:47:50,239
that light then fans out across a
 

6281
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:52,229
that light then fans out across a
network of wave guides to reach all the

that

6286
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
that
 

6287
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,229
that
do perform this process themselves so

6288
01:47:58,229 --> 01:47:58,239
do perform this process themselves so
 

6289
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:00,229
do perform this process themselves so
it's probably worth explaining what a

6290
01:48:00,229 --> 01:48:00,239
it's probably worth explaining what a
 

6291
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:02,629
it's probably worth explaining what a
network of wave guides is because a lot

6292
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:02,639
network of wave guides is because a lot
 

6293
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,709
network of wave guides is because a lot
of listeners aren't going to know that

look up the papers by jeff chiles on

6296
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:06,560
look up the papers by jeff chiles on
 

6297
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:08,470
look up the papers by jeff chiles on
this one but basically

6298
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:08,480
this one but basically
 

6299
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:11,430
this one but basically
light can be guided in a a simple

01:48:14,229 --> 01:48:14,239
basically wire of usually an insulating
 

6303
01:48:14,239 --> 01:48:15,590
basically wire of usually an insulating
material so

6304
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:15,600
material so
 

6305
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:18,790
material so
silicon silicon nitride different

6306
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:18,800
silicon silicon nitride different
 

6307
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:20,629
silicon silicon nitride different
different kinds of glass just like in a

6308
01:48:20,629 --> 01:48:20,639
different kinds of glass just like in a
 

6309
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,350
different kinds of glass just like in a
fiber optic it's glass silicon dioxide

6310
01:48:23,350 --> 01:48:23,360
fiber optic it's glass silicon dioxide
 

6311
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:24,950
fiber optic it's glass silicon dioxide
that makes it a little bit big we want

6312
01:48:24,950 --> 01:48:24,960
that makes it a little bit big we want
 

6313
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,629
that makes it a little bit big we want
to bring these down so we use different

6314
01:48:26,629 --> 01:48:26,639
to bring these down so we use different
 

6315
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:28,070
to bring these down so we use different
materials like silicon nitride but

6316
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
materials like silicon nitride but
 

6317
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:31,270
materials like silicon nitride but
basically just imagine a rectangle of

6318
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:31,280
basically just imagine a rectangle of
 

6319
01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:32,870
basically just imagine a rectangle of
some material

6320
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:32,880
some material
 

6321
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:37,030
some material
that just goes and branches

6322
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,040
that just goes and branches
 

6323
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,229
that just goes and branches
forms different

6324
01:48:38,229 --> 01:48:38,239
forms different
 

6325
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,470
forms different
different branch points that target

6326
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:40,480
different branch points that target
 

6327
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:43,109
different branch points that target
different sub-regions of the network you

6328
01:48:43,109 --> 01:48:43,119
different sub-regions of the network you
 

6329
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:44,790
different sub-regions of the network you
can transition between layers of these

6330
01:48:44,790 --> 01:48:44,800
can transition between layers of these
 

6331
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,310
can transition between layers of these
so now we're talking about building in

6332
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:46,320
so now we're talking about building in
 

6333
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,750
so now we're talking about building in
the third dimension which is absolutely

6334
01:48:47,750 --> 01:48:47,760
the third dimension which is absolutely
 

6335
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,310
the third dimension which is absolutely
crucial so that's what waveguides are

6336
01:48:50,310 --> 01:48:50,320
crucial so that's what waveguides are
 

6337
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:52,870
crucial so that's what waveguides are
so yeah that's great uh what why the

6338
01:48:52,870 --> 01:48:52,880
so yeah that's great uh what why the
 

6339
01:48:52,880 --> 01:48:54,629
so yeah that's great uh what why the
third dimension is crucial

6340
01:48:54,629 --> 01:48:54,639
third dimension is crucial
 

6341
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:56,629
third dimension is crucial
okay so yes you were talking about what

6342
01:48:56,629 --> 01:48:56,639
okay so yes you were talking about what
 

6343
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:59,669
okay so yes you were talking about what
are some of the technical limitations

6344
01:48:59,669 --> 01:48:59,679
are some of the technical limitations
 

6345
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,070
are some of the technical limitations
one of the things that

6346
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
one of the things that
 

6347
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,390
one of the things that
i believe we have to grapple with is

6348
01:49:04,390 --> 01:49:04,400
i believe we have to grapple with is
 

6349
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,270
i believe we have to grapple with is
that

6350
01:49:05,270 --> 01:49:05,280
that
 

6351
01:49:05,280 --> 01:49:08,790
that
our brains are miraculously compact for

our brains are miraculously compact for
the number of neurons that are in our

01:49:13,669 --> 01:49:13,679
it sure does fit in a small volume as it
 

6359
01:49:13,679 --> 01:49:14,870
it sure does fit in a small volume as it
would have to if we're going to be

6360
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:14,880
would have to if we're going to be
 

6361
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:17,270
would have to if we're going to be
biological organisms that are resource

01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,280
biological organisms that are resource
 

6363
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:19,189
biological organisms that are resource
limited and things like that

01:49:19,189 --> 01:49:19,199
limited and things like that
 

6365
01:49:19,199 --> 01:49:21,510

same is true for superconducting neurons
 

6397
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,629
same is true for superconducting neurons
and the same is true if we're trying to

01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
and the same is true if we're trying to
 

6399

might be angstroms but the size of a
 

6409
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,070

to communicate over long distances you

6416
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:12,320
to communicate over long distances you
 

6417
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,990
to communicate over long distances you
need your wires to be

6418
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:14,000
need your wires to be
 

6419
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,470
need your wires to be
microns wide and it's the same thing for

01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:16,480
microns wide and it's the same thing for
 

6421
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,470

limited by the wavelength of light and
 

6425
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,550
limited by the wavelength of light and
that's going to be about a micron so

6426
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:22,560
that's going to be about a micron so
 

6427
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,109
that's going to be about a micron so

is
10 nanometers in diameter something like

6434
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:30,560
10 nanometers in diameter something like
 

6435
01:50:30,560 --> 01:50:32,070
10 nanometers in diameter something like
that they

01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:32,080
that they
 

6437
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:33,109
that they
they're bigger when they need to

01:50:33,109 --> 01:50:33,119
they're bigger when they need to
 

6439
01:50:33,119 --> 01:50:35,430
they're bigger when they need to
communicate over long distances but

01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
communicate over long distances but
 

6441
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:37,109
communicate over long distances but
grappling with the size of these

grappling with the size of these
 

6443
01:50:37,119 --> 01:50:39,910
grappling with the size of these

6445
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:41,350

so

6446
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:41,360
so
 

6447
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,550
so
in order to make systems of comparable

01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:46,719
and i i don't think that's specific to
 

6515
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:48,390
and i i don't think that's specific to

01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:48,400
the optoelectronic approach that we're
 

6517
01:51:48,400 --> 01:51:50,709
the optoelectronic approach that we're
taking i think that applies to any

taking i think that applies to any
 

6519
01:51:50,719 --> 01:51:52,470
taking i think that applies to any

01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:56,800
human brain so you need that fractal
 

6525
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:59,510
human brain so you need that fractal
stacking so stacking on the wafer and

6526
01:51:59,510 --> 01:51:59,520
stacking so stacking on the wafer and
 

6527
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,070
stacking so stacking on the wafer and
stacking of the wafers and then whatever

6528
01:52:02,070 --> 01:52:02,080
stacking of the wafers and then whatever
 

6529
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:04,550

the system that combined this stacking

6530
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:04,560
the system that combined this stacking
 

6531
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,629
the system that combined this stacking
of the tables with the wafers and it has

6532
01:52:06,629 --> 01:52:06,639
of the tables with the wafers and it has
 

6533
01:52:06,639 --> 01:52:08,229
of the tables with the wafers and it has
to be fractal all the way you're exactly

01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
to be fractal all the way you're exactly
 

6535
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,070
to be fractal all the way you're exactly
right because that's the only way that

6536
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:10,080
right because that's the only way that
 

6537
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:12,629
right because that's the only way that
you can efficiently get information from

01:52:12,629 --> 01:52:12,639
you can efficiently get information from
 

6539
01:52:12,639 --> 01:52:14,629
you can efficiently get information from
a small point to across that whole

6540
01:52:14,629 --> 01:52:14,639
a small point to across that whole
 

6541
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,030
a small point to across that whole
network it has to have the the power law

6542
01:52:17,030 --> 01:52:17,040

01:52:19,510 --> 01:52:19,520
connecting and photons are like uh
 

6545
01:52:19,520 --> 01:52:21,430

you're at this scale to me it's just

6548
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,040
you're at this scale to me it's just
 

6549
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,870
you're at this scale to me it's just
obvious of course you're using light for

01:52:24,870 --> 01:52:24,880
obvious of course you're using light for
 

6551
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:26,310
obvious of course you're using light for
communication you have

you know from nature so simple

6558
01:52:31,589 --> 01:52:31,599
you know from nature so simple
 

6559
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:33,830
you know from nature so simple
the the thought of even trying to this

6560
01:52:33,830 --> 01:52:33,840
the the thought of even trying to this
 

6561
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:35,669
the the thought of even trying to this
any kind of electrical communication

6562
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
any kind of electrical communication
 

6563
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,030
any kind of electrical communication
just doesn't

6564
01:52:37,030 --> 01:52:37,040
just doesn't
 

6565
01:52:37,040 --> 01:52:38,470
just doesn't
it doesn't make sense to me i'm not

6566
01:52:38,470 --> 01:52:38,480
it doesn't make sense to me i'm not
 

6567
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:40,310
it doesn't make sense to me i'm not
saying it's wrong i don't know but

6568
01:52:40,310 --> 01:52:40,320
saying it's wrong i don't know but
 

6569
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,070
saying it's wrong i don't know but
that's where i'm coming from so let's

6570
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
that's where i'm coming from so let's
 

6571
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:44,790
that's where i'm coming from so let's
return to loop neurons

6572
01:52:44,790 --> 01:52:44,800
return to loop neurons
 

6573
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,270
return to loop neurons
why are they called loop neurons

6574
01:52:47,270 --> 01:52:47,280
why are they called loop neurons
 

6575
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:49,189
why are they called loop neurons
yeah the term loop neurons comes from

6576
01:52:49,189 --> 01:52:49,199
yeah the term loop neurons comes from
 

6577
01:52:49,199 --> 01:52:50,709
yeah the term loop neurons comes from
the fact like we've been talking about

6578
01:52:50,709 --> 01:52:50,719
the fact like we've been talking about
 

6579
01:52:50,719 --> 01:52:52,390
the fact like we've been talking about
that they rely heavily on these

6580
01:52:52,390 --> 01:52:52,400
that they rely heavily on these
 

6581
01:52:52,400 --> 01:52:55,189
that they rely heavily on these
superconducting loops so

6582
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:55,199
superconducting loops so
 

6583
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:56,229
superconducting loops so
even in

6584
01:52:56,229 --> 01:52:56,239
even in
 

6585
01:52:56,239 --> 01:52:58,310
even in
a lot of forms of digital computing with

6586
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
a lot of forms of digital computing with
 

6587
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:02,229
a lot of forms of digital computing with
superconductors storing uh a signal in a

6588
01:53:02,229 --> 01:53:02,239
superconductors storing uh a signal in a
 

6589
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,709
superconductors storing uh a signal in a
superconducting loop is a a primary

6590
01:53:04,709 --> 01:53:04,719
superconducting loop is a a primary
 

6591
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:05,830
superconducting loop is a a primary
technique

6592
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
technique
 

6593
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,149
technique
in this particular case it's it's just

6594
01:53:08,149 --> 01:53:08,159
in this particular case it's it's just
 

6595
01:53:08,159 --> 01:53:10,709
in this particular case it's it's just
loops everywhere you look so the

6596
01:53:10,709 --> 01:53:10,719
loops everywhere you look so the
 

6597
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:12,470
loops everywhere you look so the
the strength of a synaptic weight is

6598
01:53:12,470 --> 01:53:12,480
the strength of a synaptic weight is
 

6599
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:14,870
the strength of a synaptic weight is
going to be set by the state the amount

6600
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
going to be set by the state the amount
 

6601
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,030
going to be set by the state the amount
of current circulating in a loop that is

6602
01:53:17,030 --> 01:53:17,040
of current circulating in a loop that is
 

6603
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,350
of current circulating in a loop that is
coupled to the synapse so

6604
01:53:19,350 --> 01:53:19,360
coupled to the synapse so
 

6605
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,189
coupled to the synapse so
memory is

6606
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
memory is
 

6607
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,350
memory is
implemented as current circulating in a

6608
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:23,360
implemented as current circulating in a
 

6609
01:53:23,360 --> 01:53:24,950
implemented as current circulating in a
superconducting loop

6610
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
superconducting loop
 

6611
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:27,189
superconducting loop
the the coupling between say a synapse

6612
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
the the coupling between say a synapse
 

6613
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,629
the the coupling between say a synapse
and a dendrite or a synapse in the

6614
01:53:28,629 --> 01:53:28,639
and a dendrite or a synapse in the
 

6615
01:53:28,639 --> 01:53:31,669
and a dendrite or a synapse in the
neuron cell body occurs through

6616
01:53:31,669 --> 01:53:31,679
neuron cell body occurs through
 

6617
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:33,750
neuron cell body occurs through
loop loop coupling through transformer

6618
01:53:33,750 --> 01:53:33,760
loop loop coupling through transformer
 

6619
01:53:33,760 --> 01:53:35,589
loop loop coupling through transformer
so current circulating in a synapse is

6620
01:53:35,589 --> 01:53:35,599
so current circulating in a synapse is
 

6621
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:37,589
so current circulating in a synapse is
going to induce current in a in a

6622
01:53:37,589 --> 01:53:37,599
going to induce current in a in a
 

6623
01:53:37,599 --> 01:53:39,669
going to induce current in a in a
different loop a receiving loop in the

6624
01:53:39,669 --> 01:53:39,679
different loop a receiving loop in the
 

6625
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:41,430
different loop a receiving loop in the
in the neuron cell body

6626
01:53:41,430 --> 01:53:41,440
in the neuron cell body
 

6627
01:53:41,440 --> 01:53:42,310
in the neuron cell body
so

6628
01:53:42,310 --> 01:53:42,320
so
 

6629
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:44,310
so
since all of the computation is

6630
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:44,320
since all of the computation is
 

6631
01:53:44,320 --> 01:53:47,270
since all of the computation is
happening in these flux storage loops

6632
01:53:47,270 --> 01:53:47,280
happening in these flux storage loops
 

6633
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:49,510
happening in these flux storage loops
and they play such a central role in in

6634
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
and they play such a central role in in
 

6635
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,030
and they play such a central role in in
how the information is processed how

6636
01:53:51,030 --> 01:53:51,040
how the information is processed how
 

6637
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,430
how the information is processed how
memories are formed all that stuff

6638
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
memories are formed all that stuff
 

6639
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,109
memories are formed all that stuff
i didn't think too much about it just

6640
01:53:55,109 --> 01:53:55,119
i didn't think too much about it just
 

6641
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,870
i didn't think too much about it just
call them loop neurons because it rolls

6642
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:56,880
call them loop neurons because it rolls
 

6643
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:58,790
call them loop neurons because it rolls
off the tongue a little bit better than

okay so uh how do you design circuits

6648
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:06,880
okay so uh how do you design circuits
 

6649
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,109
okay so uh how do you design circuits
for these loop neurons that's a great

6650
01:54:09,109 --> 01:54:09,119
for these loop neurons that's a great
 

6651
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,790
for these loop neurons that's a great
question there's a lot of different

6652
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
question there's a lot of different
 

6653
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,109
question there's a lot of different
scales of design so

6654
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
scales of design so
 

6655
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,629
scales of design so
at the level of just one synapse you can

6656
01:54:16,629 --> 01:54:16,639
at the level of just one synapse you can
 

6657
01:54:16,639 --> 01:54:19,189
at the level of just one synapse you can
use conventional methods

6658
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
use conventional methods
 

6659
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:21,030
use conventional methods
they don't they're not that complicated

6660
01:54:21,030 --> 01:54:21,040
they don't they're not that complicated
 

6661
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:22,870
they don't they're not that complicated
as as far as superconducting electronics

6662
01:54:22,870 --> 01:54:22,880
as as far as superconducting electronics
 

6663
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,149
as as far as superconducting electronics
goes it's just

01:54:24,149 --> 01:54:24,159
goes it's just
 

6665
01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:26,149
goes it's just
for joseph's injunctions or something

6666
01:54:26,149 --> 01:54:26,159
for joseph's injunctions or something
 

6667
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:27,910
for joseph's injunctions or something
like that depending on how much

6668
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:27,920
like that depending on how much
 

6669
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:29,830
like that depending on how much
complexity you want to add so you can

6670
01:54:29,830 --> 01:54:29,840
complexity you want to add so you can
 

6671
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:33,109

just directly simulate each component in

6672
01:54:33,109 --> 01:54:33,119
just directly simulate each component in
 

6673
01:54:33,119 --> 01:54:34,470
just directly simulate each component in
in spice

6674
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:34,480
in spice
 

6675
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:35,750
in spice
we've been what

6676
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:35,760
we've been what
 

6677
01:54:35,760 --> 01:54:38,070
we've been what
it's standard electrical simulation

6678
01:54:38,070 --> 01:54:38,080
it's standard electrical simulation
 

6679
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:39,669
it's standard electrical simulation
software okay basically so you're just

6680
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
software okay basically so you're just
 

6681
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:41,510
software okay basically so you're just
you're just explicitly solving the

6682
01:54:41,510 --> 01:54:41,520
you're just explicitly solving the
 

6683
01:54:41,520 --> 01:54:43,030
you're just explicitly solving the
differential equations that describe the

6684
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,040
differential equations that describe the
 

6685
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:45,109
differential equations that describe the
circuit elements and then you can stack

6686
01:54:45,109 --> 01:54:45,119
circuit elements and then you can stack
 

6687
01:54:45,119 --> 01:54:47,109
circuit elements and then you can stack
these things together in that simulation

6688
01:54:47,109 --> 01:54:47,119
these things together in that simulation
 

6689
01:54:47,119 --> 01:54:49,350
these things together in that simulation
software to then build circuits you can

6690
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
software to then build circuits you can
 

6691
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:50,870
software to then build circuits you can
but that becomes computationally

6692
01:54:50,870 --> 01:54:50,880
but that becomes computationally
 

6693
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:53,350
but that becomes computationally
expensive so one of the things when when

6694
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:53,360
expensive so one of the things when when
 

6695
01:54:53,360 --> 01:54:55,270
expensive so one of the things when when

was
computational modeling so

6706
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:03,440
computational modeling so
 

6707
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:06,070
computational modeling so
we started working on

6708
01:55:06,070 --> 01:55:06,080
we started working on
 

6709
01:55:06,080 --> 01:55:07,750
we started working on
adapting

6710
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:07,760
adapting

abstracting out the circuit performance

6712
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
abstracting out the circuit performance
 

6713
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:12,070
abstracting out the circuit performance
so that you don't have to explicitly

6714
01:55:12,070 --> 01:55:12,080
so that you don't have to explicitly
 

6715

so that you don't have to explicitly
solve the circuit equations which for

01:55:16,470 --> 01:55:16,480
joseph's injunctions usually needs to be
 

6719
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,470
joseph's injunctions usually needs to be
done on like a picosecond time scale and

6720
01:55:18,470 --> 01:55:18,480
done on like a picosecond time scale and
 

6721
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:19,430
done on like a picosecond time scale and
you have

6722
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:19,440
you have
 

6723
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:22,790
you have
a lot of nodes in your circuit so it

6724
01:55:22,790 --> 01:55:22,800
a lot of nodes in your circuit so it
 

6725
01:55:22,800 --> 01:55:24,310
a lot of nodes in your circuit so it
results in a lot of differential

6726
01:55:24,310 --> 01:55:24,320
results in a lot of differential
 

6727
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:25,430
results in a lot of differential
equations that need to be solved

6728
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440

simultaneously we were looking for a way

6730
01:55:27,189 --> 01:55:27,199
simultaneously we were looking for a way
 

6731
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:29,430
simultaneously we were looking for a way
to simulate these circuits

6732
01:55:29,430 --> 01:55:29,440
to simulate these circuits
 

6733
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:31,830
to simulate these circuits
that is scalable up to networks of

6734
01:55:31,830 --> 01:55:31,840
that is scalable up to networks of
 

6735
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:34,790
that is scalable up to networks of
millions or so neurons is sort of where

01:55:34,790 --> 01:55:34,800
millions or so neurons is sort of where
 

6737
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:36,550
millions or so neurons is sort of where
we're targeting right now

6738
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:36,560
we're targeting right now
 

6739
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:38,310
we're targeting right now
so we were able to

6740
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:38,320
so we were able to
 

6741
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:40,629
so we were able to
analyze the behavior of these circuits

6742
01:55:40,629 --> 01:55:40,639
analyze the behavior of these circuits
 

6743
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,229
analyze the behavior of these circuits
and as i said there it's based on these

6744
01:55:42,229 --> 01:55:42,239
and as i said there it's based on these
 

6745
01:55:42,239 --> 01:55:44,149
and as i said there it's based on these
simple building blocks so you really

6746
01:55:44,149 --> 01:55:44,159
simple building blocks so you really
 

6747
01:55:44,159 --> 01:55:45,589
simple building blocks so you really
only need to understand this one

6748
01:55:45,589 --> 01:55:45,599
only need to understand this one
 

6749
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:46,950
only need to understand this one
building block and if you get a good

6750
01:55:46,950 --> 01:55:46,960
building block and if you get a good
 

6751
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:49,589
building block and if you get a good
model of that boom it tiles and you you

6752
01:55:49,589 --> 01:55:49,599
model of that boom it tiles and you you
 

6753
01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:51,189
model of that boom it tiles and you you
can change the parameters in there to

6754
01:55:51,189 --> 01:55:51,199
can change the parameters in there to
 

6755
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:52,870
can change the parameters in there to
get different behaviors and stuff but

6756
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:52,880
get different behaviors and stuff but
 

6757
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,109
get different behaviors and stuff but
it's all based on now it's one

6758
01:55:55,109 --> 01:55:55,119
it's all based on now it's one
 

6759
01:55:55,119 --> 01:55:56,629
it's all based on now it's one

out there it's just a simple leaky

6770
01:56:06,629 --> 01:56:06,639
out there it's just a simple leaky
 

6771
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:08,390
out there it's just a simple leaky
integrated fire model

6772
01:56:08,390 --> 01:56:08,400
integrated fire model
 

6773
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,790

leaky integrator basically the synapse

6774
01:56:10,790 --> 01:56:10,800
leaky integrator basically the synapse
 

6775
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:12,390
leaky integrator basically the synapse
is a leaky integrator a dendrite is a

6776
01:56:12,390 --> 01:56:12,400
is a leaky integrator a dendrite is a
 

6777
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,229
is a leaky integrator a dendrite is a
leaky integrator so i'm really

6778
01:56:14,229 --> 01:56:14,239
leaky integrator so i'm really
 

6779
01:56:14,239 --> 01:56:15,990
leaky integrator so i'm really
fascinated by how

6780
01:56:15,990 --> 01:56:16,000
fascinated by how

this one simple component

6782
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:18,400
this one simple component
 

6783
01:56:18,400 --> 01:56:21,750
this one simple component
can be used to achieve lots of different

6784
01:56:21,750 --> 01:56:21,760
can be used to achieve lots of different
 

6785
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,390

01:56:24,390 --> 01:56:24,400
types of dynamical activity
 

6787
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:25,350
types of dynamical activity
and

6788
01:56:25,350 --> 01:56:25,360
and
 

6789
01:56:25,360 --> 01:56:26,950
and
to me that's where scalability comes

6790
01:56:26,950 --> 01:56:26,960
to me that's where scalability comes
 

6791
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:29,109
to me that's where scalability comes
from and also complexity as well

6792
01:56:29,109 --> 01:56:29,119
from and also complexity as well
 

6793
01:56:29,119 --> 01:56:32,149
from and also complexity as well
complexity is often characterized by

01:56:32,149 --> 01:56:32,159
complexity is often characterized by
 

6795
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:35,350
complexity is often characterized by
relatively simple building blocks

6796
01:56:35,350 --> 01:56:35,360
relatively simple building blocks

behavior that was hard to predict from

6804
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:42,080
behavior that was hard to predict from
 

6805
01:56:42,080 --> 01:56:42,870

01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:42,880
those
 

6807
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,030
those
simple simple elements and that's

6808
01:56:45,030 --> 01:56:45,040
simple simple elements and that's
 

6809
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:46,709
simple simple elements and that's
exactly what we're working with here so

6810
01:56:46,709 --> 01:56:46,719
exactly what we're working with here so
 

6811
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:48,950
exactly what we're working with here so
it's a very exciting platform

6812
01:56:48,950 --> 01:56:48,960
it's a very exciting platform
 

6813
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:50,470
it's a very exciting platform
both from a modeling perspective and

6814
01:56:50,470 --> 01:56:50,480
both from a modeling perspective and
 

6815
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,149
both from a modeling perspective and
from a hardware manifestation

6816
01:56:52,149 --> 01:56:52,159
from a hardware manifestation
 

6817
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:53,750
from a hardware manifestation
perspective where we can

01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:53,760
perspective where we can
 

6819
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:57,030
perspective where we can
hopefully start to to have this uh test

6820
01:56:57,030 --> 01:56:57,040
hopefully start to to have this uh test
 

6821
01:56:57,040 --> 01:56:59,430
hopefully start to to have this uh test
bed where we can explore things not just

6822
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
bed where we can explore things not just
 

6823
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:01,589
bed where we can explore things not just
related to neuroscience but also related

6824
01:57:01,589 --> 01:57:01,599
related to neuroscience but also related
 

6825
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:03,430
related to neuroscience but also related
to other things

6826
01:57:03,430 --> 01:57:03,440
to other things
 

6827
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:05,910
to other things
that connected to other physics like

6828
01:57:05,910 --> 01:57:05,920
that connected to other physics like
 

6829
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,070
that connected to other physics like
critical phenomenon icing models things

6830
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:08,080
critical phenomenon icing models things
 

6831
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:09,910
critical phenomenon icing models things
like that so

6832
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:09,920
like that so
 

6833
01:57:09,920 --> 01:57:11,510
like that so
you were asking how we simulate these

6834
01:57:11,510 --> 01:57:11,520
you were asking how we simulate these
 

6835
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:12,950
you were asking how we simulate these
circuits

6836
01:57:12,950 --> 01:57:12,960
circuits
 

6837
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,270
circuits
it's it's at different levels and we've

6838
01:57:15,270 --> 01:57:15,280
it's it's at different levels and we've
 

6839
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:17,750
it's it's at different levels and we've
got the simple spice circuit

6840
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:17,760
got the simple spice circuit
 

6841
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,229
got the simple spice circuit
stuff that's no problem and now we're

6842
01:57:20,229 --> 01:57:20,239
stuff that's no problem and now we're
 

6843
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:22,070
stuff that's no problem and now we're
building these network models based on

6844
01:57:22,070 --> 01:57:22,080
building these network models based on
 

6845
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:23,589
building these network models based on
this more efficient leaky integrator so

6846
01:57:23,589 --> 01:57:23,599
this more efficient leaky integrator so
 

6847
01:57:23,599 --> 01:57:24,790
this more efficient leaky integrator so
we can actually

6848
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:24,800
we can actually
 

6849
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,950
we can actually
reduce every element to one differential

6850
01:57:26,950 --> 01:57:26,960
reduce every element to one differential
 

6851
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:28,390
reduce every element to one differential
equation and then we can also step

6852
01:57:28,390 --> 01:57:28,400
equation and then we can also step
 

6853
01:57:28,400 --> 01:57:30,550
equation and then we can also step
through it on a much coarser time grid

6854
01:57:30,550 --> 01:57:30,560
through it on a much coarser time grid
 

6855
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:31,910
through it on a much coarser time grid
so it ends up being something like a

6856
01:57:31,910 --> 01:57:31,920
so it ends up being something like a
 

6857
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,229
so it ends up being something like a
factor of a thousand to ten thousand

6858
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:34,239
factor of a thousand to ten thousand
 

6859
01:57:34,239 --> 01:57:36,470
factor of a thousand to ten thousand
speed improvement which allows us to

01:57:36,470 --> 01:57:36,480
speed improvement which allows us to
 

6861
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:37,589
speed improvement which allows us to

6863
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,669

01:57:39,669 --> 01:57:39,679
but hopefully up to up to millions of
 

6865
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:40,790
but hopefully up to up to millions of

tens 100 something like that and just

6933
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:51,510
[Laughter]
it's a

6934
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
it's a
 

6935
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,750
it's a
look it up on the internet somebody

6936
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:53,760
look it up on the internet somebody
 

6937
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:55,109
look it up on the internet somebody
somebody told me about it i'm not sure

6938
01:58:55,109 --> 01:58:55,119
somebody told me about it i'm not sure
 

6939
01:58:55,119 --> 01:58:56,390
somebody told me about it i'm not sure
exactly what it is

6940
01:58:56,390 --> 01:58:56,400
exactly what it is
 

6941
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:59,350
exactly what it is
uh so but let me ask nevertheless about

6942
01:58:59,350 --> 01:58:59,360
uh so but let me ask nevertheless about
 

6943
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:03,510
uh so but let me ask nevertheless about
applications to machine learning okay so

6944
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:03,520
applications to machine learning okay so
 

6945
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,910
applications to machine learning okay so
what like if you look at the scale of 5

6946
01:59:05,910 --> 01:59:05,920
what like if you look at the scale of 5
 

6947
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,510
what like if you look at the scale of 5
10 20 years is the is it possible

6948
01:59:09,510 --> 01:59:09,520
10 20 years is the is it possible
 

6949
01:59:09,520 --> 01:59:12,070
10 20 years is the is it possible
to uh before we understand the nature of

6950
01:59:12,070 --> 01:59:12,080
to uh before we understand the nature of
 

6951
01:59:12,080 --> 01:59:13,589
to uh before we understand the nature of
human intelligence and general

6952
01:59:13,589 --> 01:59:13,599
human intelligence and general
 

6953
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:15,830
human intelligence and general
intelligence do you think we'll start

6954
01:59:15,830 --> 01:59:15,840
intelligence do you think we'll start
 

6955
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,189
intelligence do you think we'll start
falling out of this exploration

6956
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:19,199
falling out of this exploration
 

6957
01:59:19,199 --> 01:59:21,510

01:59:29,669 --> 01:59:29,679
i'm i'm really
 

6967
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:32,390
i'm i'm really
hesitant to over promise so

6968
01:59:32,390 --> 01:59:32,400
hesitant to over promise so
 

6969
01:59:32,400 --> 01:59:35,030
hesitant to over promise so
i i really don't know i also i i don't

6970
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,040
i i really don't know i also i i don't
 

6971
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,870
i i really don't know i also i i don't

01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,830
really understand machine learning in a
lot of senses i mean

6974
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:39,840
lot of senses i mean
 

6975
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,350
lot of senses i mean

01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:41,360
machine learning
 

6977
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:44,390
machine learning
from my perspective appears to require

6978
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:44,400
from my perspective appears to require
 

6979
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:45,750
from my perspective appears to require
that you

6980
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:45,760
that you
 

6981
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:46,790
that you
know

6982
01:59:46,790 --> 01:59:46,800
know
 

6983
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:49,109
know
precisely what your input is

6984
01:59:49,109 --> 01:59:49,119
precisely what your input is
 

6985
01:59:49,119 --> 01:59:51,990
precisely what your input is
and also what your goal is you usually

6986
01:59:51,990 --> 01:59:52,000
and also what your goal is you usually
 

6987
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:53,350
and also what your goal is you usually
have some objective function or

6988
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,360
have some objective function or
 

6989
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,669
have some objective function or
something like that and

6990
01:59:55,669 --> 01:59:55,679
something like that and
 

6991
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,589
something like that and
that's just that's very limiting i mean

6992
01:59:57,589 --> 01:59:57,599
that's just that's very limiting i mean
 

6993
01:59:57,599 --> 01:59:59,750
that's just that's very limiting i mean
of course a lot of times that that's the

6994
01:59:59,750 --> 01:59:59,760
of course a lot of times that that's the
 

6995
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,589
of course a lot of times that that's the
case you know there's a there's a

6996
02:00:01,589 --> 02:00:01,599
case you know there's a there's a
 

6997
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:03,350
case you know there's a there's a
picture and there's a horse in it so

6998
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360
picture and there's a horse in it so
 

6999
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:04,709
picture and there's a horse in it so
you're done but that's not a very

7000
02:00:04,709 --> 02:00:04,719
you're done but that's not a very
 

7001
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:06,470
you're done but that's not a very
interesting problem

7002
02:00:06,470 --> 02:00:06,480
interesting problem
 

7003
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:07,510
interesting problem
i think

7004
02:00:07,510 --> 02:00:07,520
i think
 

7005
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:09,430
i think
when i when i think about intelligence

7006
02:00:09,430 --> 02:00:09,440
when i when i think about intelligence
 

7007
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:10,550
when i when i think about intelligence
it's

7008
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:10,560
it's
 

7009
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:12,310
it's
it's almost defined by the ability to

7010
02:00:12,310 --> 02:00:12,320
it's almost defined by the ability to
 

7011
02:00:12,320 --> 02:00:14,470
it's almost defined by the ability to
handle problems where you don't know

7012
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:14,480
handle problems where you don't know
 

7013
02:00:14,480 --> 02:00:16,149
handle problems where you don't know
what your inputs are going to be and you

7014
02:00:16,149 --> 02:00:16,159
what your inputs are going to be and you
 

7015
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:17,510
what your inputs are going to be and you
don't even necessarily know what you're

7016
02:00:17,510 --> 02:00:17,520
don't even necessarily know what you're
 

7017
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:19,830
don't even necessarily know what you're
trying to accomplish i mean

7018
02:00:19,830 --> 02:00:19,840
trying to accomplish i mean
 

7019
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,030
trying to accomplish i mean
i'm not sure what i'm trying to

7020
02:00:21,030 --> 02:00:21,040
i'm not sure what i'm trying to
 

7021
02:00:21,040 --> 02:00:23,750
i'm not sure what i'm trying to
accomplish in this world but at all

7022
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:23,760
accomplish in this world but at all
 

7023
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:26,149
accomplish in this world but at all
scales yeah at all scales right i mean

7024
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
scales yeah at all scales right i mean
 

7025
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:27,510
scales yeah at all scales right i mean
so and sometimes

7026
02:00:27,510 --> 02:00:27,520
so and sometimes
 

7027
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:31,430
so and sometimes
so i i'm i'm more drawn to

7028
02:00:31,430 --> 02:00:31,440
so i i'm i'm more drawn to
 

7029
02:00:31,440 --> 02:00:35,189
so i i'm i'm more drawn to
the underlying phenomena the the

7030
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:35,199
the underlying phenomena the the
 

7031
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,189
the underlying phenomena the the
the critical dynamics of this of this

7032
02:00:37,189 --> 02:00:37,199
the critical dynamics of this of this
 

7033
02:00:37,199 --> 02:00:39,990
the critical dynamics of this of this
system trying to understand

7034
02:00:39,990 --> 02:00:40,000

result in

7042
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:45,280
result in
 

7043
02:00:45,280 --> 02:00:48,550
result in
emergent fascinating activity

7044
02:00:48,550 --> 02:00:48,560
emergent fascinating activity
 

7045
02:00:48,560 --> 02:00:51,030
emergent fascinating activity
that was very difficult to predict

7046
02:00:51,030 --> 02:00:51,040
that was very difficult to predict
 

7047
02:00:51,040 --> 02:00:52,950
that was very difficult to predict
things like that so but but but i got to

7048
02:00:52,950 --> 02:00:52,960
things like that so but but but i got to
 

7049
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:54,229
things like that so but but but i got to
be really careful because i think a lot

7050
02:00:54,229 --> 02:00:54,239
be really careful because i think a lot
 

7051
02:00:54,239 --> 02:00:56,149
be really careful because i think a lot
of other people who if they found

7052
02:00:56,149 --> 02:00:56,159
of other people who if they found
 

7053
02:00:56,159 --> 02:00:57,830
of other people who if they found
themselves working on this project in my

7054
02:00:57,830 --> 02:00:57,840
themselves working on this project in my
 

7055
02:00:57,840 --> 02:00:59,830
themselves working on this project in my
shoes they would say all right what are

7056
02:00:59,830 --> 02:00:59,840
shoes they would say all right what are
 

7057
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:01,109
shoes they would say all right what are
what are all the different ways we can

7058
02:01:01,109 --> 02:01:01,119
what are all the different ways we can
 

7059
02:01:01,119 --> 02:01:02,629
what are all the different ways we can
use this for machine learning actually

7060
02:01:02,629 --> 02:01:02,639
use this for machine learning actually
 

7061
02:01:02,639 --> 02:01:04,790
use this for machine learning actually
let me let me just definitely mention

7062
02:01:04,790 --> 02:01:04,800
let me let me just definitely mention

02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:23,040
for machine learning and
 

7081
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:25,430
for machine learning and
deep feed-forward neural networks there

02:01:25,430 --> 02:01:25,440
deep feed-forward neural networks there
 

7083
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,510
deep feed-forward neural networks there
the advantages are obvious it's

7084
02:01:27,510 --> 02:01:27,520
the advantages are obvious it's
 

7085
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,990
the advantages are obvious it's
extremely fast yeah so that's less on

7086
02:01:29,990 --> 02:01:30,000
extremely fast yeah so that's less on
 

7087
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,270
extremely fast yeah so that's less on
the nature of intelligences and more on

7088
02:01:33,270 --> 02:01:33,280
the nature of intelligences and more on

02:01:37,669 --> 02:01:37,679
right yes you can use for the basic
 

7093
02:01:37,679 --> 02:01:39,830
right yes you can use for the basic
computation as we know it today yeah and

7094
02:01:39,830 --> 02:01:39,840
computation as we know it today yeah and
 

7095
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:41,189
computation as we know it today yeah and
communication one of the things that

7096
02:01:41,189 --> 02:01:41,199
communication one of the things that
 

7097
02:01:41,199 --> 02:01:43,189
communication one of the things that
mike schneider's working on right now is

7098
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
mike schneider's working on right now is
 

7099
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:45,430
mike schneider's working on right now is
an image classifier at a relatively

7100
02:01:45,430 --> 02:01:45,440
an image classifier at a relatively
 

7101
02:01:45,440 --> 02:01:47,189
an image classifier at a relatively
small scale i think he's targeting that

7102
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
small scale i think he's targeting that
 

7103
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:48,709
small scale i think he's targeting that
nine pixel problem where you can have

7104
02:01:48,709 --> 02:01:48,719
nine pixel problem where you can have
 

7105
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:51,750
nine pixel problem where you can have
three different characters and um

7106
02:01:51,750 --> 02:01:51,760
three different characters and um
 

7107
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:54,070
three different characters and um
you just you put in a nine pixel image

7108
02:01:54,070 --> 02:01:54,080
you just you put in a nine pixel image
 

7109
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:55,350
you just you put in a nine pixel image
and you classify it as one of these

7110
02:01:55,350 --> 02:01:55,360
and you classify it as one of these
 

7111
02:01:55,360 --> 02:01:59,189
and you classify it as one of these
three three uh categories and that's

7112
02:01:59,189 --> 02:01:59,199
three three uh categories and that's
 

7113
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:00,310
three three uh categories and that's
going to be really interesting to see

7114
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:00,320
going to be really interesting to see
 

7115
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:02,709
going to be really interesting to see
what happens there because

7116
02:02:02,709 --> 02:02:02,719
what happens there because
 

7117
02:02:02,719 --> 02:02:05,589
what happens there because
if you can show that even at that scale

7118
02:02:05,589 --> 02:02:05,599
if you can show that even at that scale
 

7119
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,669
if you can show that even at that scale
you just put these images in and you get

7120
02:02:07,669 --> 02:02:07,679
you just put these images in and you get
 

7121
02:02:07,679 --> 02:02:09,270
you just put these images in and you get
it out and you can he thinks he can do

7122
02:02:09,270 --> 02:02:09,280
it out and you can he thinks he can do
 

7123
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:11,589
it out and you can he thinks he can do
it i forgot if it's a nanosecond or some

7124
02:02:11,589 --> 02:02:11,599
it i forgot if it's a nanosecond or some
 

7125
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:13,910
it i forgot if it's a nanosecond or some
extra extremely fast classification time

7126
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:13,920
extra extremely fast classification time
 

7127
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,669
extra extremely fast classification time
it's probably less it's probably 100

7128
02:02:15,669 --> 02:02:15,679
it's probably less it's probably 100
 

7129
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:17,350
it's probably less it's probably 100
picoseconds or something

7130
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
picoseconds or something
 

7131
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,830
picoseconds or something
there you have challenges though because

7132
02:02:19,830 --> 02:02:19,840
there you have challenges though because
 

7133
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:21,589
there you have challenges though because
the joseph's injunctions themselves the

7134
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599
the joseph's injunctions themselves the
 

7135
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,830
the joseph's injunctions themselves the
electronic circuit is extremely power

7136
02:02:23,830 --> 02:02:23,840
electronic circuit is extremely power
 

7137
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,149
electronic circuit is extremely power
efficient some orders of magnitude for

7138
02:02:26,149 --> 02:02:26,159
efficient some orders of magnitude for
 

7139
02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:28,149
efficient some orders of magnitude for
something more than a transistor doing

7140
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:28,159
something more than a transistor doing
 

7141
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:29,910
something more than a transistor doing
the same thing but when you have to cool

7142
02:02:29,910 --> 02:02:29,920
the same thing but when you have to cool
 

7143
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:32,149
the same thing but when you have to cool
it down to 4 kelvin you pay a huge

7144
02:02:32,149 --> 02:02:32,159
it down to 4 kelvin you pay a huge
 

7145
02:02:32,159 --> 02:02:33,910
it down to 4 kelvin you pay a huge
overhead just for keeping it cold even

7146
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:33,920
overhead just for keeping it cold even
 

7147
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,870
overhead just for keeping it cold even
if it's not doing anything so

7148
02:02:36,870 --> 02:02:36,880
if it's not doing anything so
 

7149
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:39,830
if it's not doing anything so
it's it you ha it has to work at big at

7150
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:39,840
it's it you ha it has to work at big at
 

7151
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:42,070
it's it you ha it has to work at big at
large scale in order to overcome that

7152
02:02:42,070 --> 02:02:42,080
large scale in order to overcome that
 

7153
02:02:42,080 --> 02:02:43,589
large scale in order to overcome that
power penalty

7154
02:02:43,589 --> 02:02:43,599
power penalty
 

7155
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,709
power penalty
but that's possible it's just it's gonna

7156
02:02:46,709 --> 02:02:46,719
but that's possible it's just it's gonna
 

7157
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:48,229
but that's possible it's just it's gonna
have to get that performance and this is

7158
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:48,239
have to get that performance and this is
 

7159
02:02:48,239 --> 02:02:49,270
have to get that performance and this is
sort of what you were asking about

7160
02:02:49,270 --> 02:02:49,280
sort of what you were asking about
 

7161
02:02:49,280 --> 02:02:50,870
sort of what you were asking about
before is like how much better than

7162
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:50,880
before is like how much better than
 

7163
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:52,629
before is like how much better than
silicon would it need to be

7164
02:02:52,629 --> 02:02:52,639
silicon would it need to be
 

7165
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,310
silicon would it need to be
and the answer is i don't know i think

7166
02:02:54,310 --> 02:02:54,320
and the answer is i don't know i think
 

7167
02:02:54,320 --> 02:02:56,629
and the answer is i don't know i think
if it's if it's just overall better than

7168
02:02:56,629 --> 02:02:56,639
if it's if it's just overall better than
 

7169
02:02:56,639 --> 02:02:59,109
if it's if it's just overall better than
silicon at a problem that a lot of

7170
02:02:59,109 --> 02:02:59,119
silicon at a problem that a lot of
 

7171
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:01,430
silicon at a problem that a lot of
people care about maybe it's

7172
02:03:01,430 --> 02:03:01,440
people care about maybe it's
 

7173
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:03,270
people care about maybe it's
image classification maybe it's face

7174
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:03,280
image classification maybe it's face
 

7175
02:03:03,280 --> 02:03:04,950
image classification maybe it's face
recognition maybe it's

7176
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:04,960
recognition maybe it's
 

7177
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:06,790
recognition maybe it's
monitoring credit transactions i don't

7178
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:06,800
monitoring credit transactions i don't
 

7179
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:08,950
monitoring credit transactions i don't
know then i think it will have a place

7180
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:08,960
know then i think it will have a place
 

7181
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,310
know then i think it will have a place
it's not going to be in your cell phone

7182
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:10,320
it's not going to be in your cell phone
 

7183
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:12,870
it's not going to be in your cell phone
but it could be in your data center

7184
02:03:12,870 --> 02:03:12,880
but it could be in your data center
 

7185
02:03:12,880 --> 02:03:14,629
but it could be in your data center
uh so what about

7186
02:03:14,629 --> 02:03:14,639
uh so what about
 

7187
02:03:14,639 --> 02:03:16,310
uh so what about
in terms of the data center i don't know

7188
02:03:16,310 --> 02:03:16,320
in terms of the data center i don't know
 

7189
02:03:16,320 --> 02:03:17,830
in terms of the data center i don't know
if you're paying attention to the

7190
02:03:17,830 --> 02:03:17,840
if you're paying attention to the
 

7191
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,109
if you're paying attention to the
various systems like um tesla recently

7192
02:03:21,109 --> 02:03:21,119
various systems like um tesla recently
 

7193
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:23,750

now announced uh dojo

7194
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:23,760
now announced uh dojo
 

7195
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:25,910
now announced uh dojo
which is a large scale machine learning

7196
02:03:25,910 --> 02:03:25,920
which is a large scale machine learning
 

7197
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,270
which is a large scale machine learning
training system

7198
02:03:27,270 --> 02:03:27,280
training system
 

7199
02:03:27,280 --> 02:03:29,030
training system
that again the bottom like there is

7200
02:03:29,030 --> 02:03:29,040
that again the bottom like there is
 

7201
02:03:29,040 --> 02:03:30,870
that again the bottom like there is
probably going to be communication

7202
02:03:30,870 --> 02:03:30,880
probably going to be communication
 

7203
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,390
probably going to be communication
between those systems

7204
02:03:32,390 --> 02:03:32,400
between those systems
 

7205
02:03:32,400 --> 02:03:35,030
between those systems
um is there something from your work on

7206
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:35,040
um is there something from your work on
 

7207
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,709
um is there something from your work on
um

7208
02:03:36,709 --> 02:03:36,719
um
 

7209
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:38,629
um
the everything we've been talking about

7210
02:03:38,629 --> 02:03:38,639
the everything we've been talking about
 

7211
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:41,589
the everything we've been talking about
in terms of superconductive hardware

7212
02:03:41,589 --> 02:03:41,599
in terms of superconductive hardware
 

7213
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,550
in terms of superconductive hardware
that could be useful there oh i mean i

7214
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:44,560
that could be useful there oh i mean i
 

7215
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:47,669
that could be useful there oh i mean i
okay tomorrow no in the long term it

7216
02:03:47,669 --> 02:03:47,679
okay tomorrow no in the long term it
 

7217
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:49,270
okay tomorrow no in the long term it
could be the whole thing it could be

7218
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
could be the whole thing it could be
 

7219
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:51,109
could be the whole thing it could be
nothing i i don't know but definitely

7220
02:03:51,109 --> 02:03:51,119
nothing i i don't know but definitely

um
when you look at the so i don't know

7226
02:03:55,669 --> 02:03:55,679
when you look at the so i don't know
 

7227
02:03:55,679 --> 02:03:57,430
when you look at the so i don't know
that much about dojo my understanding is

7228
02:03:57,430 --> 02:03:57,440
that much about dojo my understanding is
 

7229
02:03:57,440 --> 02:04:00,149
that much about dojo my understanding is
that that's new right that's just just

7230
02:04:00,149 --> 02:04:00,159
that that's new right that's just just
 

7231
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:02,069
that that's new right that's just just
coming online well

7232
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:02,079
coming online well
 

7233
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:04,310
coming online well
i don't i don't even know where

7234
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,320
i don't i don't even know where
 

7235
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,589
i don't i don't even know where
uh it's it hasn't come online and and

7236
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:07,599
uh it's it hasn't come online and and
 

7237
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,830
uh it's it hasn't come online and and
when you announce big sexy so let me

7238
02:04:09,830 --> 02:04:09,840
when you announce big sexy so let me
 

7239
02:04:09,840 --> 02:04:11,510
when you announce big sexy so let me
explain to you the way things work in

7240
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:11,520
explain to you the way things work in
 

7241
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,750
explain to you the way things work in
the in the world out there in the word

7242
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:13,760
the in the world out there in the word
 

7243
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:16,470
the in the world out there in the word
of business and marketing it's not

7244
02:04:16,470 --> 02:04:16,480
of business and marketing it's not
 

7245
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,950
of business and marketing it's not
always clear where you are on the coming

7246
02:04:18,950 --> 02:04:18,960
always clear where you are on the coming
 

7247
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,189
always clear where you are on the coming
online part of that so i don't know

7248
02:04:21,189 --> 02:04:21,199
online part of that so i don't know
 

7249
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:24,069
online part of that so i don't know
where they are exactly but the vision is

7250
02:04:24,069 --> 02:04:24,079
where they are exactly but the vision is
 

7251
02:04:24,079 --> 02:04:26,470
where they are exactly but the vision is
from ground up to build up you know a

7252
02:04:26,470 --> 02:04:26,480
from ground up to build up you know a
 

7253
02:04:26,480 --> 02:04:28,550
from ground up to build up you know a
very very large scale

7254
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:28,560
very very large scale
 

7255
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:31,350
very very large scale
modular machine learning asic basically

7256
02:04:31,350 --> 02:04:31,360
modular machine learning asic basically
 

7257
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:33,109
modular machine learning asic basically
hardware that's optimized for training

7258
02:04:33,109 --> 02:04:33,119
hardware that's optimized for training
 

7259
02:04:33,119 --> 02:04:34,709
hardware that's optimized for training
neural networks and of course there's a

7260
02:04:34,709 --> 02:04:34,719
neural networks and of course there's a
 

7261
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:37,510
neural networks and of course there's a
lot of companies that are small and big

7262
02:04:37,510 --> 02:04:37,520
lot of companies that are small and big
 

7263
02:04:37,520 --> 02:04:39,430
lot of companies that are small and big
working on this kind of problem the

7264
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:39,440
working on this kind of problem the
 

7265
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,270
working on this kind of problem the
question is how to do it

7266
02:04:41,270 --> 02:04:41,280
question is how to do it
 

7267
02:04:41,280 --> 02:04:44,229
question is how to do it
in a modular way that uh this has very

7268
02:04:44,229 --> 02:04:44,239
in a modular way that uh this has very
 

7269
02:04:44,239 --> 02:04:46,470
in a modular way that uh this has very
fast communication the interesting

7270
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:46,480
fast communication the interesting
 

7271
02:04:46,480 --> 02:04:49,430
fast communication the interesting
aspect of tesla is you have a company

7272
02:04:49,430 --> 02:04:49,440
aspect of tesla is you have a company
 

7273
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:51,510
aspect of tesla is you have a company
that at least at this time

7274
02:04:51,510 --> 02:04:51,520
that at least at this time
 

7275
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:53,270
that at least at this time
is so

7276
02:04:53,270 --> 02:04:53,280
is so
 

7277
02:04:53,280 --> 02:04:55,270
is so
singularly focused on solving a

7278
02:04:55,270 --> 02:04:55,280
singularly focused on solving a
 

7279
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,669
singularly focused on solving a
particular machine learning problem

7280
02:04:57,669 --> 02:04:57,679
particular machine learning problem
 

7281
02:04:57,679 --> 02:04:59,910
particular machine learning problem
and is making obviously a lot of money

7282
02:04:59,910 --> 02:04:59,920
and is making obviously a lot of money
 

7283
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:01,830
and is making obviously a lot of money
doing so because the machine learning

7284
02:05:01,830 --> 02:05:01,840
doing so because the machine learning
 

7285
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:03,669
doing so because the machine learning
problem happens to be involved with

7286
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
problem happens to be involved with
 

7287
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:06,069
problem happens to be involved with
autonomous driving so you have a system

7288
02:05:06,069 --> 02:05:06,079
autonomous driving so you have a system
 

7289
02:05:06,079 --> 02:05:07,510
autonomous driving so you have a system
that's um

7290
02:05:07,510 --> 02:05:07,520
that's um
 

7291
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:09,669
that's um
driven by an application

7292
02:05:09,669 --> 02:05:09,679
driven by an application
 

7293
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:11,750
driven by an application
and that's really interesting because

7294
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:11,760
and that's really interesting because
 

7295
02:05:11,760 --> 02:05:12,870
and that's really interesting because
you know

7296
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:12,880
you know
 

7297
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:13,830
you know
uh

7298
02:05:13,830 --> 02:05:13,840
uh
 

7299
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:16,069
uh
you have maybe google working on tpus

7300
02:05:16,069 --> 02:05:16,079
you have maybe google working on tpus
 

7301
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:17,589
you have maybe google working on tpus
and so on

7302
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:17,599
and so on
 

7303
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:19,589
and so on
you have all these other

7304
02:05:19,589 --> 02:05:19,599
you have all these other
 

7305
02:05:19,599 --> 02:05:21,430
you have all these other
companies with asics

7306
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:21,440
companies with asics
 

7307
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:23,990
companies with asics
they're usually more kind of always

7308
02:05:23,990 --> 02:05:24,000
they're usually more kind of always
 

7309
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,910
they're usually more kind of always

so i like it when it's driven by a

7312
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:27,840
so i like it when it's driven by a
 

7313
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:29,589
so i like it when it's driven by a
particular application because then you

7314
02:05:29,589 --> 02:05:29,599
particular application because then you
 

7315
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,069
particular application because then you
can really get to the

7316
02:05:32,069 --> 02:05:32,079
can really get to the
 

7317
02:05:32,079 --> 02:05:33,669
can really get to the
it's like

7318
02:05:33,669 --> 02:05:33,679
it's like
 

7319
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:36,149
it's like
it's somehow if you just talk broadly

7320
02:05:36,149 --> 02:05:36,159
it's somehow if you just talk broadly
 

7321
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:38,390
it's somehow if you just talk broadly
about intelligence you may not always

7322
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:38,400
about intelligence you may not always
 

7323
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:39,189
about intelligence you may not always
get

7324
02:05:39,189 --> 02:05:39,199
get
 

7325
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:40,629
get
to the right solutions it's nice to

7326
02:05:40,629 --> 02:05:40,639
to the right solutions it's nice to
 

7327
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:43,830
to the right solutions it's nice to
couple that sometimes a specific

02:05:46,149 --> 02:05:46,159
clear illustration of something that
 

7331
02:05:46,159 --> 02:05:47,910
clear illustration of something that
requires general intelligence which for

me driving is one such case i think

7334
02:05:50,149 --> 02:05:50,159
me driving is one such case i think
 

7335
02:05:50,159 --> 02:05:51,510
me driving is one such case i think
you're exactly right sometimes just

7336
02:05:51,510 --> 02:05:51,520
you're exactly right sometimes just
 

7337
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:54,310
you're exactly right sometimes just
having that focus on that application

7338
02:05:54,310 --> 02:05:54,320
having that focus on that application
 

7339
02:05:54,320 --> 02:05:56,069
having that focus on that application
brings a lot of people focuses their

7340
02:05:56,069 --> 02:05:56,079
brings a lot of people focuses their
 

7341
02:05:56,079 --> 02:05:59,030
brings a lot of people focuses their
energy and attention i think that so one

7342
02:05:59,030 --> 02:05:59,040
energy and attention i think that so one
 

7343
02:05:59,040 --> 02:06:00,229
energy and attention i think that so one
of the things that's appealing about

7344
02:06:00,229 --> 02:06:00,239
of the things that's appealing about
 

7345
02:06:00,239 --> 02:06:02,550
of the things that's appealing about
what you're saying is not just that the

7346
02:06:02,550 --> 02:06:02,560
what you're saying is not just that the
 

7347
02:06:02,560 --> 02:06:04,390
what you're saying is not just that the
application is specific but also that

7348
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:04,400
application is specific but also that
 

7349
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:06,950
application is specific but also that
the scale is big big and that the

7350
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:06,960
the scale is big big and that the
 

7351
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,709
the scale is big big and that the
benefit is

7352
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:08,719
benefit is
 

7353
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:11,589
benefit is
is also huge so financial and to

7354
02:06:11,589 --> 02:06:11,599
is also huge so financial and to
 

7355
02:06:11,599 --> 02:06:13,830
is also huge so financial and to
humanity right right right yeah so i

7356
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:13,840
humanity right right right yeah so i
 

7357
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:15,669
humanity right right right yeah so i
guess let me just try to understand is

7358
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:15,679
guess let me just try to understand is
 

7359
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:18,870
guess let me just try to understand is
the point of this dojo system to

7360
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:18,880
the point of this dojo system to
 

7361
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:22,229
the point of this dojo system to
figure out the the parameters that then

7362
02:06:22,229 --> 02:06:22,239
figure out the the parameters that then
 

7363
02:06:22,239 --> 02:06:24,790
figure out the the parameters that then
plug into neural networks and then

7364
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:24,800
plug into neural networks and then
 

7365
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,950
plug into neural networks and then
you don't need to retrain you you just

7366
02:06:26,950 --> 02:06:26,960
you don't need to retrain you you just
 

7367
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:29,430
you don't need to retrain you you just
make copies of a certain chip that has

7368
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,440
make copies of a certain chip that has
 

7369
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,750
make copies of a certain chip that has
all the all the parameters established

7370
02:06:31,750 --> 02:06:31,760
all the all the parameters established
 

7371
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:35,589
all the all the parameters established
or no it's straight up retraining a

7372
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:35,599
or no it's straight up retraining a
 

7373
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:37,830
or no it's straight up retraining a
large neural network over and over and

7374
02:06:37,830 --> 02:06:37,840
large neural network over and over and
 

7375
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,310
large neural network over and over and
over so you have to do it once for every

7376
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:40,320
over so you have to do it once for every
 

7377
02:06:40,320 --> 02:06:41,589
over so you have to do it once for every
new car

7378
02:06:41,589 --> 02:06:41,599
new car
 

7379
02:06:41,599 --> 02:06:43,910
new car
no no you have to uh so they do this

7380
02:06:43,910 --> 02:06:43,920
no no you have to uh so they do this
 

7381
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:45,430
no no you have to uh so they do this
interesting process which i think is a

7382
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:45,440
interesting process which i think is a
 

7383
02:06:45,440 --> 02:06:47,510
interesting process which i think is a
process for machine learning supervised

7384
02:06:47,510 --> 02:06:47,520
process for machine learning supervised
 

7385
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:49,270
process for machine learning supervised
machine learning systems

7386
02:06:49,270 --> 02:06:49,280
machine learning systems
 

7387
02:06:49,280 --> 02:06:52,149
machine learning systems
you're going to have to do which is

7388
02:06:52,149 --> 02:06:52,159
you're going to have to do which is
 

7389
02:06:52,159 --> 02:06:54,310
you're going to have to do which is
you uh have a system you train your

7390
02:06:54,310 --> 02:06:54,320
you uh have a system you train your
 

7391
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,310
you uh have a system you train your
network once it takes a long time i

7392
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
network once it takes a long time i
 

7393
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,550
network once it takes a long time i
don't know how long but maybe a week

7394
02:06:58,550 --> 02:06:58,560
don't know how long but maybe a week
 

7395
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:00,709
don't know how long but maybe a week
okay the train

7396
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
okay the train
 

7397
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:03,510
okay the train
and then you deploy it on let's say

7398
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:03,520
and then you deploy it on let's say
 

7399
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,430
and then you deploy it on let's say
about a million cars i don't know what

7400
02:07:05,430 --> 02:07:05,440
about a million cars i don't know what
 

7401
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:07,270
about a million cars i don't know what
the number is that part you just write

7402
02:07:07,270 --> 02:07:07,280
the number is that part you just write
 

7403
02:07:07,280 --> 02:07:08,950
the number is that part you just write
software that updates some weights in a

7404
02:07:08,950 --> 02:07:08,960
software that updates some weights in a
 

7405
02:07:08,960 --> 02:07:12,229
software that updates some weights in a
table and yeah okay but there's a loop

7406
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:12,239
table and yeah okay but there's a loop
 

7407
02:07:12,239 --> 02:07:15,189
table and yeah okay but there's a loop
back yeah yeah okay each of those cars

7408
02:07:15,189 --> 02:07:15,199
back yeah yeah okay each of those cars
 

7409
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:17,910
back yeah yeah okay each of those cars
run into trouble

7410
02:07:17,910 --> 02:07:17,920
run into trouble
 

7411
02:07:17,920 --> 02:07:21,750
run into trouble
rarely but like they they uh

7412
02:07:21,750 --> 02:07:21,760
rarely but like they they uh
 

7413
02:07:21,760 --> 02:07:23,910
rarely but like they they uh
they catch the edge cases of the

7414
02:07:23,910 --> 02:07:23,920
they catch the edge cases of the
 

7415
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:25,910
they catch the edge cases of the
performance of that particular system

7416
02:07:25,910 --> 02:07:25,920
performance of that particular system
 

7417
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:28,229
performance of that particular system
and then send that data back

7418
02:07:28,229 --> 02:07:28,239
and then send that data back
 

7419
02:07:28,239 --> 02:07:31,350
and then send that data back
and either automatically or by humans

7420
02:07:31,350 --> 02:07:31,360
and either automatically or by humans
 

7421
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:32,229
and either automatically or by humans
that

7422
02:07:32,229 --> 02:07:32,239
that
 

7423
02:07:32,239 --> 02:07:34,790
that
weird edge case data is annotated and

7424
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:34,800
weird edge case data is annotated and
 

7425
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:37,109
weird edge case data is annotated and
then the network has to become smart

7426
02:07:37,109 --> 02:07:37,119
then the network has to become smart
 

7427
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:39,189
then the network has to become smart
enough to now be able to perform in

7428
02:07:39,189 --> 02:07:39,199
enough to now be able to perform in
 

7429
02:07:39,199 --> 02:07:41,669
enough to now be able to perform in
those edge cases so has to get retrained

7430
02:07:41,669 --> 02:07:41,679
those edge cases so has to get retrained
 

7431
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:43,270
those edge cases so has to get retrained
there's clever ways of retraining

7432
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,280
there's clever ways of retraining
 

7433
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,109
there's clever ways of retraining
different parts of that network but for

7434
02:07:45,109 --> 02:07:45,119
different parts of that network but for
 

7435
02:07:45,119 --> 02:07:47,189
different parts of that network but for
the most part i think they prefer to

7436
02:07:47,189 --> 02:07:47,199
the most part i think they prefer to
 

7437
02:07:47,199 --> 02:07:49,510
the most part i think they prefer to
retrain the entire thing so you have

7438
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:49,520
retrain the entire thing so you have
 

7439
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:53,189
retrain the entire thing so you have
this giant monster that kind of has to

7440
02:07:53,189 --> 02:07:53,199
this giant monster that kind of has to
 

7441
02:07:53,199 --> 02:07:56,790
this giant monster that kind of has to
be trained regularly i think the vision

7442
02:07:56,790 --> 02:07:56,800
be trained regularly i think the vision
 

7443
02:07:56,800 --> 02:08:00,149
be trained regularly i think the vision

applications right but like so they're

7454
02:08:11,350 --> 02:08:11,360
applications right but like so they're
 

7455
02:08:11,360 --> 02:08:12,790

that's one of the things so this does
 

7499
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,669
that's one of the things so this does
seem like one of those spaces where

you talk about the weaknesses like i
said okay well you have to cool it down

7508
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:04,079
said okay well you have to cool it down
 

7509
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:05,990
said okay well you have to cool it down
at this scale that's fine that's because

7510
02:09:05,990 --> 02:09:06,000
at this scale that's fine that's because
 

7511
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:08,470
at this scale that's fine that's because
that's not that's not an too much of an

that's not that's not an too much of an

7515
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,990

7517
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:14,310

02:09:14,310 --> 02:09:14,320
not the cooling and also
 

7519
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:16,830
not the cooling and also
you have one

7520
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:16,840
you have one
 

7521
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:19,669
you have one
centralized kind of cognitive hub if you

7522
02:09:19,669 --> 02:09:19,679
centralized kind of cognitive hub if you
 

7523
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:20,709

02:09:20,719 --> 02:09:22,310
will
and so

7526
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,320
and so
 

7527
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:24,870
and so
when if we're talking about putting a

02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:29,280
that's questionable do you really want
 

7533
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:30,950
that's questionable do you really want
to cryostat in the trunk of everyone

7534
02:09:30,950 --> 02:09:30,960
to cryostat in the trunk of everyone
 

7535
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:32,390
to cryostat in the trunk of everyone
your car it'll fit it's not that big of

02:09:32,390 --> 02:09:32,400
your car it'll fit it's not that big of
 

7537
02:09:32,400 --> 02:09:34,149
your car it'll fit it's not that big of
a deal but

7538
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:34,159
a deal but
 

7539
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:35,830
a deal but
hopefully there's a better way right but

7540
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:35,840
hopefully there's a better way right but
 

7541
02:09:35,840 --> 02:09:38,310
hopefully there's a better way right but
since this is sort of a central supreme

7542
02:09:38,310 --> 02:09:38,320
since this is sort of a central supreme
 

7543
02:09:38,320 --> 02:09:40,310
since this is sort of a central supreme
intelligence or something like that

intelligence or something like that
 

7545
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:43,430
intelligence or something like that
and it's it needs to really have this

7546
02:09:43,430 --> 02:09:43,440
and it's it needs to really have this
 

7547
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:45,669

7565
02:09:58,239 --> 02:09:59,589
development that needs to be done
but you know

cars for a lot of reasons we were all
optimistic that they would be here by

7572
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:04,239
optimistic that they would be here by
 

7573
02:10:04,239 --> 02:10:07,189
optimistic that they would be here by
now and okay they are to some extent but

7574
02:10:07,189 --> 02:10:07,199
now and okay they are to some extent but
 

7575
02:10:07,199 --> 02:10:09,030
now and okay they are to some extent but
if we're thinking five or ten years down

7576
02:10:09,030 --> 02:10:09,040
if we're thinking five or ten years down
 

7577
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:11,430
if we're thinking five or ten years down
the line it it's it's not

7578
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:11,440
the line it it's it's not
 

7579
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:12,950
the line it it's it's not
unreasonable one other thing i'll just

7580
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:12,960
unreasonable one other thing i'll just
 

7581
02:10:12,960 --> 02:10:14,709
unreasonable one other thing i'll just
let me just mention

7582
02:10:14,709 --> 02:10:14,719
let me just mention
 

7583
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:16,629
let me just mention
that getting into self-driving cars and

7584
02:10:16,629 --> 02:10:16,639
that getting into self-driving cars and
 

7585
02:10:16,639 --> 02:10:18,550
that getting into self-driving cars and
technologies that are using ai out in

7586
02:10:18,550 --> 02:10:18,560
technologies that are using ai out in
 

7587
02:10:18,560 --> 02:10:20,790
technologies that are using ai out in
the world this is something nist cares a

7588
02:10:20,790 --> 02:10:20,800
the world this is something nist cares a
 

7589
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,830
the world this is something nist cares a
lot about elham dabasi is leading up a

7590
02:10:23,830 --> 02:10:23,840
lot about elham dabasi is leading up a
 

7591
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:26,870
lot about elham dabasi is leading up a
much larger effort in ai at nist than

7592
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:26,880
much larger effort in ai at nist than
 

7593
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:29,270
much larger effort in ai at nist than
than my my little project

7594
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:29,280
than my my little project
 

7595
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:30,069
than my my little project
and

7596
02:10:30,069 --> 02:10:30,079
and
 

7597
02:10:30,079 --> 02:10:31,430
and
really

7598
02:10:31,430 --> 02:10:31,440
really
 

7599
02:10:31,440 --> 02:10:33,350
really
central to that mission is this concept

7600
02:10:33,350 --> 02:10:33,360
central to that mission is this concept
 

7601
02:10:33,360 --> 02:10:35,030
central to that mission is this concept
of trustworthiness

7602
02:10:35,030 --> 02:10:35,040
of trustworthiness
 

7603
02:10:35,040 --> 02:10:35,910
of trustworthiness
so

7604
02:10:35,910 --> 02:10:35,920
so
 

7605
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:38,149
so
when you're going to deploy this neural

7606
02:10:38,149 --> 02:10:38,159
when you're going to deploy this neural
 

7607
02:10:38,159 --> 02:10:39,830
when you're going to deploy this neural
network

7608
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:39,840
network
 

7609
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,149
network
in every single automobile with so much

7610
02:10:42,149 --> 02:10:42,159
in every single automobile with so much
 

7611
02:10:42,159 --> 02:10:44,470
in every single automobile with so much
on the line you have to be able to trust

7612
02:10:44,470 --> 02:10:44,480
on the line you have to be able to trust
 

7613
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:46,870
on the line you have to be able to trust
that so now how do we know how do we

7614
02:10:46,870 --> 02:10:46,880
that so now how do we know how do we
 

7615
02:10:46,880 --> 02:10:48,229
that so now how do we know how do we
know that we can trust that how do we

7616
02:10:48,229 --> 02:10:48,239
know that we can trust that how do we
 

7617
02:10:48,239 --> 02:10:49,669
know that we can trust that how do we
know that we can trust the self-driving

7618
02:10:49,669 --> 02:10:49,679
know that we can trust the self-driving
 

7619
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:52,550
know that we can trust the self-driving
car or the the supercomputer that that

7620
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560
car or the the supercomputer that that
 

7621
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:53,669
car or the the supercomputer that that
trained it

7622
02:10:53,669 --> 02:10:53,679
trained it
 

7623
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:54,950
trained it
there's a lot of work there and there's

7624
02:10:54,950 --> 02:10:54,960
there's a lot of work there and there's
 

7625
02:10:54,960 --> 02:10:57,189
there's a lot of work there and there's
a lot of that going on at nist and we're

7626
02:10:57,189 --> 02:10:57,199
a lot of that going on at nist and we're
 

7627
02:10:57,199 --> 02:10:59,589
a lot of that going on at nist and we're
it's still early days i mean

7628
02:10:59,589 --> 02:10:59,599
it's still early days i mean
 

7629
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:01,189
it's still early days i mean
you're familiar with the yeah yeah and

7630
02:11:01,189 --> 02:11:01,199
you're familiar with the yeah yeah and
 

7631
02:11:01,199 --> 02:11:03,589
you're familiar with the yeah yeah and
all that but there's a fascinating dance

7632
02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:03,599
all that but there's a fascinating dance
 

7633
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:05,510
all that but there's a fascinating dance
in engineering with like safety critical

7634
02:11:05,510 --> 02:11:05,520
in engineering with like safety critical
 

7635

just recently talked to don knuth

7640
02:11:11,510 --> 02:11:11,520
just recently talked to don knuth
 

7641
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:14,229
just recently talked to don knuth
to to uh you know for algorithms and for

7642
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
to to uh you know for algorithms and for
 

7643
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:16,229
to to uh you know for algorithms and for
systems for them to be provably correct

7644
02:11:16,229 --> 02:11:16,239
systems for them to be provably correct
 

7645
02:11:16,239 --> 02:11:18,470
systems for them to be provably correct
or provably safe and

7646
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:18,480
or provably safe and
 

7647
02:11:18,480 --> 02:11:20,149
or provably safe and
you know this is one other difference

7648
02:11:20,149 --> 02:11:20,159
you know this is one other difference
 

7649
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:22,390
you know this is one other difference
between humans and biological systems is

7650
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:22,400
between humans and biological systems is
 

7651
02:11:22,400 --> 02:11:24,790
between humans and biological systems is
we're not provably anything right right

7652
02:11:24,790 --> 02:11:24,800
we're not provably anything right right
 

7653
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,910
we're not provably anything right right
and so there's uh some aspect of uh

7654
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:27,920
and so there's uh some aspect of uh
 

7655
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:31,510
and so there's uh some aspect of uh
imperfection yes that we need to have

7656
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:31,520
imperfection yes that we need to have
 

7657
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,790

02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:35,840
no i think the goal
 

7719
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:38,069
no i think the goal
should be um

7720
02:12:38,069 --> 02:12:38,079
should be um

7732
02:12:54,069 --> 02:12:54,079
human and the robot together are better
 

7733
02:12:54,079 --> 02:12:56,470
human and the robot together are better
than any either of them individually but

7734
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:56,480
than any either of them individually but
 

7735
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:59,350
than any either of them individually but
the robot itself is not perfect any in

7736
02:12:59,350 --> 02:12:59,360
the robot itself is not perfect any in
 

7737
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:01,990
the robot itself is not perfect any in
in any way of course there's had a bunch

7738
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:02,000
in any way of course there's had a bunch
 

7739
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,310
in any way of course there's had a bunch
of disagreements including with mr elon

7740
02:13:04,310 --> 02:13:04,320
of disagreements including with mr elon
 

7741
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:05,189
of disagreements including with mr elon
about

02:13:05,189 --> 02:13:05,199
about
 

7743
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:06,310
about
uh

02:13:06,310 --> 02:13:06,320
uh
 

7745
02:13:06,320 --> 02:13:07,990
uh
to me autonomous driving is

7746
02:13:07,990 --> 02:13:08,000
to me autonomous driving is
 

7747
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:09,990
to me autonomous driving is
fundamentally a human robot interaction

7748
02:13:09,990 --> 02:13:10,000
fundamentally a human robot interaction
 

7749
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,390
fundamentally a human robot interaction
problem not a robotics problem right

7750
02:13:12,390 --> 02:13:12,400
problem not a robotics problem right
 

7751
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:14,629
problem not a robotics problem right
elon is a robotics problem that's

7752
02:13:14,629 --> 02:13:14,639
elon is a robotics problem that's
 

7753
02:13:14,639 --> 02:13:16,790
elon is a robotics problem that's
actually an open

7754
02:13:16,790 --> 02:13:16,800
actually an open
 

7755
02:13:16,800 --> 02:13:19,189
actually an open
and fascinating question whether humans

7756
02:13:19,189 --> 02:13:19,199
and fascinating question whether humans
 

7757
02:13:19,199 --> 02:13:24,390
and fascinating question whether humans
can be removed from the loop completely

7758
02:13:24,390 --> 02:13:24,400

 

7759
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:26,790

we've talked about a lot of fascinating

7760
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:26,800
we've talked about a lot of fascinating
 

7761
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,629
we've talked about a lot of fascinating
chemistry and

7762
02:13:28,629 --> 02:13:28,639
chemistry and
 

7763
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:31,910
chemistry and
physics and engineering and we're always

7764
02:13:31,910 --> 02:13:31,920
physics and engineering and we're always
 

7765
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:34,069
physics and engineering and we're always
running up against this issue that

7766
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:34,079
running up against this issue that
 

7767
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:36,149
running up against this issue that
nature seems to dictate what's easy and

7768
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:36,159
nature seems to dictate what's easy and
 

7769
02:13:36,159 --> 02:13:37,430
nature seems to dictate what's easy and
what's hard

7770
02:13:37,430 --> 02:13:37,440
what's hard
 

7771
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:39,990
what's hard
so you have this uh cool little paper

7772
02:13:39,990 --> 02:13:40,000
so you have this uh cool little paper
 

7773
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:43,589
so you have this uh cool little paper
that i'd love to just ask you about

7774
02:13:43,589 --> 02:13:43,599
that i'd love to just ask you about
 

7775
02:13:43,599 --> 02:13:45,910
that i'd love to just ask you about
it's titled does cosmological evolution

7776
02:13:45,910 --> 02:13:45,920
it's titled does cosmological evolution
 

7777
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,149

select for technology

7778
02:13:48,149 --> 02:13:48,159
select for technology
 

7779
02:13:48,159 --> 02:13:49,189
select for technology
so

7780
02:13:49,189 --> 02:13:49,199
so
 

7781
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:50,470
so
in physics

7782
02:13:50,470 --> 02:13:50,480
in physics
 

7783
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:52,149
in physics
there's uh

7784
02:13:52,149 --> 02:13:52,159
there's uh
 

7785
02:13:52,159 --> 02:13:54,390
there's uh
parameters that seem to define the way

7786
02:13:54,390 --> 02:13:54,400
parameters that seem to define the way
 

7787
02:13:54,400 --> 02:13:56,069
parameters that seem to define the way
our universe works

7788
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:56,079
our universe works
 

7789
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:58,470
our universe works
that physics works that if it worked any

7790
02:13:58,470 --> 02:13:58,480
that physics works that if it worked any
 

7791
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:00,470
that physics works that if it worked any
differently we would get a very

7792
02:14:00,470 --> 02:14:00,480
differently we would get a very
 

7793
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:02,470
differently we would get a very
different world so it seems like the

7794
02:14:02,470 --> 02:14:02,480
different world so it seems like the
 

7795
02:14:02,480 --> 02:14:04,390
different world so it seems like the
parameters are very fine-tuned to the

7796
02:14:04,390 --> 02:14:04,400
parameters are very fine-tuned to the
 

7797
02:14:04,400 --> 02:14:06,390
parameters are very fine-tuned to the
kind of physics that we see

7798
02:14:06,390 --> 02:14:06,400
kind of physics that we see
 

7799
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,390
kind of physics that we see
all the beautiful e equals mc squared

7800
02:14:08,390 --> 02:14:08,400
all the beautiful e equals mc squared
 

7801
02:14:08,400 --> 02:14:10,310
all the beautiful e equals mc squared
that would get these nice beautiful laws

7802
02:14:10,310 --> 02:14:10,320
that would get these nice beautiful laws
 

7803
02:14:10,320 --> 02:14:13,030
that would get these nice beautiful laws
it seems like very fine-tuned for that

7804
02:14:13,030 --> 02:14:13,040
it seems like very fine-tuned for that
 

7805
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,990
it seems like very fine-tuned for that
so what you argue in this article

7806
02:14:15,990 --> 02:14:16,000
so what you argue in this article
 

7807
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:19,189
so what you argue in this article
is uh it may be that the universe has

7808
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:19,199
is uh it may be that the universe has
 

7809
02:14:19,199 --> 02:14:22,470
is uh it may be that the universe has
also fine-tuned its parameters

7810
02:14:22,470 --> 02:14:22,480
also fine-tuned its parameters
 

7811
02:14:22,480 --> 02:14:25,350
also fine-tuned its parameters
that enable the kind of technological

7812
02:14:25,350 --> 02:14:25,360
that enable the kind of technological
 

7813
02:14:25,360 --> 02:14:27,189
that enable the kind of technological
innovation that we see

7814
02:14:27,189 --> 02:14:27,199
innovation that we see
 

7815
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:29,990
innovation that we see
that technology that we see can you can

7816
02:14:29,990 --> 02:14:30,000
that technology that we see can you can
 

7817
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,229
that technology that we see can you can
you explain this idea yeah i think

7818
02:14:32,229 --> 02:14:32,239
you explain this idea yeah i think
 

7819
02:14:32,239 --> 02:14:33,910
you explain this idea yeah i think
you've introduced it nicely let me let

7820
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:33,920
you've introduced it nicely let me let
 

7821
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:35,350
you've introduced it nicely let me let
me just

7822
02:14:35,350 --> 02:14:35,360
me just
 

7823
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:37,589
me just
try to say a few things in in

7824
02:14:37,589 --> 02:14:37,599
try to say a few things in in
 

7825
02:14:37,599 --> 02:14:39,109
try to say a few things in in
my language

7826
02:14:39,109 --> 02:14:39,119
my language
 

7827
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,189
my language
leia what is what is this fine-tuning

7828
02:14:41,189 --> 02:14:41,199
leia what is what is this fine-tuning
 

7829
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:42,709
leia what is what is this fine-tuning
problem so

7830
02:14:42,709 --> 02:14:42,719
problem so
 

7831
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:45,270
problem so
physicists have spent centuries

7832
02:14:45,270 --> 02:14:45,280
physicists have spent centuries
 

7833
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:46,550
physicists have spent centuries
trying to understand

7834
02:14:46,550 --> 02:14:46,560
trying to understand
 

7835
02:14:46,560 --> 02:14:47,669
trying to understand
the

7836
02:14:47,669 --> 02:14:47,679
the
 

7837
02:14:47,679 --> 02:14:50,229
the
the system of equations that govern the

7838
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
the system of equations that govern the
 

7839
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:52,229
the system of equations that govern the
way nature behaves the way particles

7840
02:14:52,229 --> 02:14:52,239
way nature behaves the way particles
 

7841
02:14:52,239 --> 02:14:53,270
way nature behaves the way particles
move and

7842
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
move and
 

7843
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:55,030
move and
interact with each other

7844
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:55,040
interact with each other
 

7845
02:14:55,040 --> 02:14:58,790
interact with each other
and as that understanding has become

7846
02:14:58,790 --> 02:14:58,800
and as that understanding has become
 

7847
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,709
and as that understanding has become
more clear over time

7848
02:15:00,709 --> 02:15:00,719
more clear over time
 

7849
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:05,270
more clear over time
it it it became sort of evident that

7850
02:15:05,270 --> 02:15:05,280
it it it became sort of evident that
 

7851
02:15:05,280 --> 02:15:09,669
it it it became sort of evident that
it's all it's all well adjusted to allow

7852
02:15:09,669 --> 02:15:09,679
it's all it's all well adjusted to allow
 

7853
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:12,950
it's all it's all well adjusted to allow
a universe like like we see very complex

7854
02:15:12,950 --> 02:15:12,960
a universe like like we see very complex
 

7855
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,390
a universe like like we see very complex
this this large long-lived universe

7856
02:15:16,390 --> 02:15:16,400
this this large long-lived universe
 

7857
02:15:16,400 --> 02:15:19,270
this this large long-lived universe
and so one one answer to that is well of

7858
02:15:19,270 --> 02:15:19,280
and so one one answer to that is well of
 

7859
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:20,950
and so one one answer to that is well of
course it is because we wouldn't be here

7860
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
course it is because we wouldn't be here
 

7861
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,589
course it is because we wouldn't be here
otherwise but um i don't know that's not

7862
02:15:23,589 --> 02:15:23,599
otherwise but um i don't know that's not
 

7863
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:25,109
otherwise but um i don't know that's not
very satisfying that's sort of that's

7864
02:15:25,109 --> 02:15:25,119
very satisfying that's sort of that's
 

7865
02:15:25,119 --> 02:15:26,629
very satisfying that's sort of that's
what's known as the weak anthropic

7866
02:15:26,629 --> 02:15:26,639
what's known as the weak anthropic
 

7867
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:28,790
what's known as the weak anthropic
principle it's a statement of selection

7868
02:15:28,790 --> 02:15:28,800
principle it's a statement of selection
 

7869
02:15:28,800 --> 02:15:30,790
principle it's a statement of selection
bias we can only observe a universe that

7870
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800
bias we can only observe a universe that
 

7871
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,310
bias we can only observe a universe that
is fit for us

7872
02:15:32,310 --> 02:15:32,320
is fit for us
 

7873
02:15:32,320 --> 02:15:34,550
is fit for us
to to live in so what does it mean for a

7874
02:15:34,550 --> 02:15:34,560
to to live in so what does it mean for a
 

7875
02:15:34,560 --> 02:15:36,069
to to live in so what does it mean for a
universe to be fit for us to live in

7876
02:15:36,069 --> 02:15:36,079
universe to be fit for us to live in
 

7877
02:15:36,079 --> 02:15:36,950
universe to be fit for us to live in
well

7878
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:36,960
well
 

7879
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:40,069
well
the pursuit of physics it is based

7880
02:15:40,069 --> 02:15:40,079
the pursuit of physics it is based
 

7881
02:15:40,079 --> 02:15:42,470
the pursuit of physics it is based
partially on coming up with equations

7882
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:42,480
partially on coming up with equations
 

7883
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:44,709
partially on coming up with equations
that describe how things behave and

7884
02:15:44,709 --> 02:15:44,719
that describe how things behave and
 

7885
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:46,310
that describe how things behave and
interact with each other

7886
02:15:46,310 --> 02:15:46,320
interact with each other
 

7887
02:15:46,320 --> 02:15:48,550
interact with each other
but in all those equations you have so

7888
02:15:48,550 --> 02:15:48,560
but in all those equations you have so
 

7889
02:15:48,560 --> 02:15:50,149
but in all those equations you have so
there's the form of the equation sort of

7890
02:15:50,149 --> 02:15:50,159
there's the form of the equation sort of
 

7891
02:15:50,159 --> 02:15:52,229
there's the form of the equation sort of
how how different

7892
02:15:52,229 --> 02:15:52,239
how how different
 

7893
02:15:52,239 --> 02:15:55,270
how how different

long time which was

it's just absolutely um astonishing that

the most beautiful physical phenomena
 

8027

and it's also
 

8029
02:18:03,639 --> 02:18:06,629
and it's also
extraordinarily useful for technology so

8030
02:18:06,629 --> 02:18:06,639
extraordinarily useful for technology so
 

8031
02:18:06,639 --> 02:18:08,230
extraordinarily useful for technology so
you can argue that the universe has to

you can argue that the universe has to

02:18:08,240 --> 02:18:10,709
you can argue that the universe has to
have the parameters it does for us to

yeah so it's asking the why question i
mean the

02:18:33,669 --> 02:18:33,679
a slight natural extension of that
 

8057
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:36,709
a slight natural extension of that
question is i wonder if

8058
02:18:36,709 --> 02:18:36,719
question is i wonder if
 

8059
02:18:36,719 --> 02:18:39,429
question is i wonder if
the parameters were different

8060
02:18:39,429 --> 02:18:39,439
the parameters were different
 

8061
02:18:39,439 --> 02:18:41,830
the parameters were different
if we would simply have just

8062
02:18:41,830 --> 02:18:41,840
if we would simply have just
 

8063
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:45,349
if we would simply have just
another set of paint brushes to create

8064
02:18:45,349 --> 02:18:45,359
another set of paint brushes to create
 

8065
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:47,429
another set of paint brushes to create
totally other things that wouldn't like

8066
02:18:47,429 --> 02:18:47,439
totally other things that wouldn't like
 

8067
02:18:47,439 --> 02:18:49,110
totally other things that wouldn't like
like that wouldn't look like anything

8068
02:18:49,110 --> 02:18:49,120
like that wouldn't look like anything
 

8069
02:18:49,120 --> 02:18:51,110
like that wouldn't look like anything
like the technology of today but would

8070
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:51,120
like the technology of today but would
 

8071
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:52,950
like the technology of today but would
nevertheless have

8072
02:18:52,950 --> 02:18:52,960
nevertheless have
 

8073
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:55,110
nevertheless have
incredible complexity which is if you

8074
02:18:55,110 --> 02:18:55,120
incredible complexity which is if you
 

8075
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,790
incredible complexity which is if you
sort of zoom out and start defining

8076
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:56,800
sort of zoom out and start defining
 

8077
02:18:56,800 --> 02:18:58,469
sort of zoom out and start defining
things not by

8078
02:18:58,469 --> 02:18:58,479
things not by
 

8079
02:18:58,479 --> 02:19:01,509
things not by
uh like how many batteries it needs and

8080
02:19:01,509 --> 02:19:01,519
uh like how many batteries it needs and
 

8081
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:03,589
uh like how many batteries it needs and
whether it can make toast

8082
02:19:03,589 --> 02:19:03,599
whether it can make toast
 

8083
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:05,509
whether it can make toast
but more like how much complexities

8084
02:19:05,509 --> 02:19:05,519
but more like how much complexities
 

8085
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:07,030
but more like how much complexities
within the system or something like that

8086
02:19:07,030 --> 02:19:07,040
within the system or something like that
 

8087
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:08,950
within the system or something like that
right well yeah you can you can start to

8088
02:19:08,950 --> 02:19:08,960
right well yeah you can you can start to
 

8089
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:10,549
right well yeah you can you can start to
quantify things like you're exactly

8090
02:19:10,549 --> 02:19:10,559
quantify things like you're exactly
 

8091
02:19:10,559 --> 02:19:12,150
quantify things like you're exactly
right so

8092
02:19:12,150 --> 02:19:12,160
right so
 

8093
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:14,709
right so
nowhere am i arguing that in all of the

8094
02:19:14,709 --> 02:19:14,719
nowhere am i arguing that in all of the
 

8095
02:19:14,719 --> 02:19:16,469
nowhere am i arguing that in all of the
vast parameter space of everything that

8096
02:19:16,469 --> 02:19:16,479
vast parameter space of everything that
 

8097
02:19:16,479 --> 02:19:18,309
vast parameter space of everything that
could conceivably exist in the

8098
02:19:18,309 --> 02:19:18,319
could conceivably exist in the
 

8099
02:19:18,319 --> 02:19:20,549
could conceivably exist in the
multiverse of nature

8100
02:19:20,549 --> 02:19:20,559
multiverse of nature
 

8101
02:19:20,559 --> 02:19:22,870
multiverse of nature
there is this one point in parameter

8102
02:19:22,870 --> 02:19:22,880
there is this one point in parameter
 

8103
02:19:22,880 --> 02:19:25,830
there is this one point in parameter
space where complexity arises i i doubt

8104
02:19:25,830 --> 02:19:25,840
space where complexity arises i i doubt
 

8105
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:28,150
space where complexity arises i i doubt
it it that would be

8106
02:19:28,150 --> 02:19:28,160
it it that would be
 

8107
02:19:28,160 --> 02:19:30,549
it it that would be
a shameful waste of resources it seems

8108
02:19:30,549 --> 02:19:30,559
a shameful waste of resources it seems
 

8109
02:19:30,559 --> 02:19:34,070
a shameful waste of resources it seems
yeah but it might be that we reside at

8110
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:34,080
yeah but it might be that we reside at
 

8111
02:19:34,080 --> 02:19:36,070
yeah but it might be that we reside at
one place in parameter space that has

8112
02:19:36,070 --> 02:19:36,080
one place in parameter space that has
 

8113
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,110
one place in parameter space that has
been

8114
02:19:37,110 --> 02:19:37,120
been
 

8115
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:39,429
been
um adapted through an evolutionary

8116
02:19:39,429 --> 02:19:39,439
um adapted through an evolutionary
 

8117
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:42,469
um adapted through an evolutionary
process to allow us to make certain

8118
02:19:42,469 --> 02:19:42,479
process to allow us to make certain
 

8119
02:19:42,479 --> 02:19:44,870
process to allow us to make certain
technologies that that allow our our

8120
02:19:44,870 --> 02:19:44,880
technologies that that allow our our
 

8121
02:19:44,880 --> 02:19:47,990
technologies that that allow our our
particular kind of universe to arise and

8122
02:19:47,990 --> 02:19:48,000
particular kind of universe to arise and
 

8123
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,070
particular kind of universe to arise and
sort of achieve the things it does see i

8124
02:19:50,070 --> 02:19:50,080
sort of achieve the things it does see i
 

8125
02:19:50,080 --> 02:19:51,990
sort of achieve the things it does see i
wonder if nature in this kind of

8126
02:19:51,990 --> 02:19:52,000
wonder if nature in this kind of
 

8127
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:55,030
wonder if nature in this kind of
discussion if nature is a catalyst for

8128
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,040
discussion if nature is a catalyst for
 

8129
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:57,030
discussion if nature is a catalyst for
innovation or if it's a ceiling for

8130
02:19:57,030 --> 02:19:57,040
innovation or if it's a ceiling for
 

8131
02:19:57,040 --> 02:19:58,870
innovation or if it's a ceiling for
innovation so like

8132
02:19:58,870 --> 02:19:58,880
innovation so like
 

8133
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:01,910
innovation so like
is it going to always limit us like what

8134
02:20:01,910 --> 02:20:01,920
is it going to always limit us like what
 

8135
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:03,830
is it going to always limit us like what
you're talking about silicon

8136
02:20:03,830 --> 02:20:03,840
you're talking about silicon
 

8137
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,750
you're talking about silicon
is it just make it super easy to do

8138
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:05,760
is it just make it super easy to do
 

8139
02:20:05,760 --> 02:20:07,990
is it just make it super easy to do
awesome stuff in a certain dimension but

8140
02:20:07,990 --> 02:20:08,000
awesome stuff in a certain dimension but
 

8141
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:09,670
awesome stuff in a certain dimension but
we could still do awesome stuff in other

8142
02:20:09,670 --> 02:20:09,680
we could still do awesome stuff in other
 

8143
02:20:09,680 --> 02:20:12,469
we could still do awesome stuff in other
ways it'll just be harder or it doesn't

8144
02:20:12,469 --> 02:20:12,479
ways it'll just be harder or it doesn't
 

8145
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:15,670
ways it'll just be harder or it doesn't
really set like the maximum we can do

8146
02:20:15,670 --> 02:20:15,680
really set like the maximum we can do
 

8147
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:18,070
really set like the maximum we can do
this that's a good thing to that's a

8148
02:20:18,070 --> 02:20:18,080
this that's a good thing to that's a
 

8149
02:20:18,080 --> 02:20:20,150
this that's a good thing to that's a
good subject to discuss i guess i feel

8150
02:20:20,150 --> 02:20:20,160
good subject to discuss i guess i feel
 

8151
02:20:20,160 --> 02:20:22,309
good subject to discuss i guess i feel
like we need to lay a little bit more

8152
02:20:22,309 --> 02:20:22,319
like we need to lay a little bit more
 

8153
02:20:22,319 --> 02:20:24,870
like we need to lay a little bit more
groundwork so i want to make sure that

8154
02:20:24,870 --> 02:20:24,880
groundwork so i want to make sure that
 

8155
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:27,429

smolin's previous idea so who's lee

8160
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:32,560
smolin's previous idea so who's lee
 

8161
02:20:32,560 --> 02:20:35,190
smolin's previous idea so who's lee
smolin and what kind of ideas does he

8162
02:20:35,190 --> 02:20:35,200
smolin and what kind of ideas does he
 

8163
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:38,070
smolin and what kind of ideas does he
have okay lee smolin is a theoretical

8164
02:20:38,070 --> 02:20:38,080

physicist who

8166
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:39,840
physicist who
 

8167
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,309
physicist who
back in the late 1980s published a paper

8168

back in the late 1980s published a paper
in the early 1990s introduced this idea

8170
02:20:44,950 --> 02:20:44,960
in the early 1990s introduced this idea
 

8171
02:20:44,960 --> 02:20:47,270
in the early 1990s introduced this idea
of cosmological natural selection which

8172
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:47,280
of cosmological natural selection which
 

8173
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:49,510
of cosmological natural selection which
argues that

8174
02:20:49,510 --> 02:20:49,520
argues that
 

8175
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:52,389
argues that
the universe did evolve so his paper was

8176
02:20:52,389 --> 02:20:52,399
the universe did evolve so his paper was
 

8177
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:55,990
the universe did evolve so his paper was
called did the universe evolve and

8178
02:20:55,990 --> 02:20:56,000
called did the universe evolve and
 

8179
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,630
called did the universe evolve and

so but i i want to introduce this idea

8206
02:21:27,670 --> 02:21:27,680
so but i i want to introduce this idea
 

8207

so but i i want to introduce this idea

02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:39,750
how the universe got here our role in it
what technology's doing here

8218
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:39,760
what technology's doing here
 

8219
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:41,270
what technology's doing here
but there's a couple more pieces that

8220
02:21:41,270 --> 02:21:41,280
but there's a couple more pieces that
 

8221
02:21:41,280 --> 02:21:43,190
but there's a couple more pieces that
need to be set up first so the beginning

8222
02:21:43,190 --> 02:21:43,200
need to be set up first so the beginning
 

8223
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:45,270
need to be set up first so the beginning
of our universe is

8224
02:21:45,270 --> 02:21:45,280
of our universe is
 

8225
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:47,349
of our universe is
largely accepted to be the big bang and

8226
02:21:47,349 --> 02:21:47,359
largely accepted to be the big bang and
 

8227
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:49,429
largely accepted to be the big bang and
what that means is if you look back in

8228
02:21:49,429 --> 02:21:49,439
what that means is if you look back in
 

8229
02:21:49,439 --> 02:21:50,790
what that means is if you look back in
time by looking

8230
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:50,800
time by looking
 

8231
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:53,990
time by looking
far away in space you see that um

8232
02:21:53,990 --> 02:21:54,000
far away in space you see that um
 

8233
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,790
far away in space you see that um
everything used to be at at one point

8234
02:21:56,790 --> 02:21:56,800
everything used to be at at one point
 

8235
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:59,030
everything used to be at at one point
and it expanded away from there there

8236
02:21:59,030 --> 02:21:59,040
and it expanded away from there there
 

8237
02:21:59,040 --> 02:22:00,550

was a uh

8238
02:22:00,550 --> 02:22:00,560
was a uh
 

8239
02:22:00,560 --> 02:22:02,950
was a uh
era in the evolutionary process of our

8240
02:22:02,950 --> 02:22:02,960
era in the evolutionary process of our
 

8241
02:22:02,960 --> 02:22:05,429
era in the evolutionary process of our
universe that was called inflation and

02:22:05,429 --> 02:22:05,439
universe that was called inflation and
 

8243
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:08,070
universe that was called inflation and
this idea was developed primarily by

8244
02:22:08,070 --> 02:22:08,080
this idea was developed primarily by
 

8245
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:10,309
this idea was developed primarily by
alan guth and and others andre linde and

other others in the 80s
 

8249
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:15,030
other others in the 80s
and this idea of inflation is is

8250
02:22:15,030 --> 02:22:15,040
and this idea of inflation is is
 

8251
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:18,150
and this idea of inflation is is
basically that when a

basically that when a

02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,670
basically that when a

uh
 

8257
02:22:21,120 --> 02:22:22,870
uh
begins this process

8258
02:22:22,870 --> 02:22:22,880
begins this process
 

8259
02:22:22,880 --> 02:22:25,110
begins this process

there can be a temporary stage where it

02:22:27,990 --> 02:22:28,000
there can be a temporary stage where it

there can be a temporary stage where it
just accelerates incredibly rapidly and

based on
 

8267
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:34,389
based on
quantum field theory this tells us that

8268
02:22:34,389 --> 02:22:34,399
quantum field theory this tells us that
 

8269
02:22:34,399 --> 02:22:36,550
quantum field theory this tells us that
this should produce matter in precisely

8270

this should produce matter in precisely
 

8271
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:38,630
this should produce matter in precisely

speak for him but this is my reading of

02:23:51,840 --> 02:23:52,950
speak for him but this is my reading of
it so

8340
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:52,960
it so
 

8341
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:55,910
it so
what lee smullen will say is that

02:23:55,910 --> 02:23:55,920
what lee smullen will say is that
 

8343
02:23:55,920 --> 02:23:58,150
what lee smullen will say is that
a black hole in one universe is a big

8344
02:23:58,150 --> 02:23:58,160
a black hole in one universe is a big
 

8345
02:23:58,160 --> 02:24:00,630
a black hole in one universe is a big
bang in another universe

bang in another universe
 

8347
02:24:00,640 --> 02:24:03,349
bang in another universe
and this allows us to have

02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
and this allows us to have
 

8349
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,830
and this allows us to have
progeny offspring so uh

8350
02:24:05,830 --> 02:24:05,840
progeny offspring so uh
 

8351
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:08,309
progeny offspring so uh
a universe can be said to have come

8352
02:24:08,309 --> 02:24:08,319
a universe can be said to have come
 

8353
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:10,389
a universe can be said to have come
before another universe

when a black hole forms it's not a

02:24:21,359 --> 02:24:23,349
when a black hole forms it's not a
classical entity it's a quantum

classical entity it's a quantum
 

8367
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:25,429
classical entity it's a quantum
gravitational entity so there it is

of that system

8380
02:24:38,550 --> 02:24:38,560
of that system
 

8381
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:40,950
of that system
are subject to slight mutations so that

8382
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:40,960
are subject to slight mutations so that
 

8383
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:43,510
are subject to slight mutations so that
the offspring universe does not have the

8384
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:43,520
the offspring universe does not have the
 

8385
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,670
the offspring universe does not have the
exact same parameters defining its

8386
02:24:45,670 --> 02:24:45,680
exact same parameters defining its
 

8387
02:24:45,680 --> 02:24:48,309
exact same parameters defining its
physics as its parent universe

8388
02:24:48,309 --> 02:24:48,319
physics as its parent universe
 

8389
02:24:48,319 --> 02:24:49,910
physics as its parent universe
they're close but they're a little bit

8390
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
they're close but they're a little bit
 

8391
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,429
they're close but they're a little bit
different and so now you have a

8392
02:24:51,429 --> 02:24:51,439
different and so now you have a
 

8393
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:53,750
different and so now you have a
mechanism for

8394
02:24:53,750 --> 02:24:53,760
mechanism for
 

8395
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:55,110
mechanism for
evolution

8396
02:24:55,110 --> 02:24:55,120
evolution
 

8397
02:24:55,120 --> 02:24:57,110
evolution
for natural selection

8398
02:24:57,110 --> 02:24:57,120
for natural selection
 

8399
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:59,590
for natural selection
so this mutation so there's

8400
02:24:59,590 --> 02:24:59,600
so this mutation so there's
 

8401
02:24:59,600 --> 02:25:01,750
so this mutation so there's
and then if you think about the

8402
02:25:01,750 --> 02:25:01,760
and then if you think about the
 

8403
02:25:01,760 --> 02:25:03,830
and then if you think about the
the dna of the universe are the basic

8404
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:03,840
the dna of the universe are the basic
 

8405
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,389
the dna of the universe are the basic
parameters that govern its laws exactly

8406
02:25:06,389 --> 02:25:06,399
parameters that govern its laws exactly
 

8407
02:25:06,399 --> 02:25:07,510
parameters that govern its laws exactly
so so

8408
02:25:07,510 --> 02:25:07,520
so so
 

8409
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:10,389
so so
that so what smallin said is our

8410
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
that so what smallin said is our
 

8411
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:12,950
that so what smallin said is our
universe results from an evolutionary

8413
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,790

initially there was something like a

8418
02:25:19,270 --> 02:25:19,280
initially there was something like a
 

8419
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:22,389
initially there was something like a

a universe that was able to reproduce

8424
02:25:26,790 --> 02:25:26,800
a universe that was able to reproduce
 

8425
02:25:26,800 --> 02:25:28,710
a universe that was able to reproduce
just once so now it had one offspring

8426
02:25:28,710 --> 02:25:28,720
just once so now it had one offspring
 

8427
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,309
just once so now it had one offspring
and then over time it was able to make

8428
02:25:30,309 --> 02:25:30,319
and then over time it was able to make
 

8429
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:33,030
and then over time it was able to make
more and more until it evolved into a

stars
 

8443
02:25:45,520 --> 02:25:47,990

stars make black holes therefore we

8444
02:25:47,990 --> 02:25:48,000
stars make black holes therefore we
 

8445
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,230
stars make black holes therefore we
should expect our universe to be

8446
02:25:50,230 --> 02:25:50,240
should expect our universe to be
 

8447
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:52,230
should expect our universe to be
optimized have its physical parameters

yeah i have uh cognitively in incapable
as i think all of us are and

02:29:33,510 --> 02:29:33,520
well and nothing but also the concept of
 

8649
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:36,469
well and nothing but also the concept of
a lot is pretty difficult

8650
02:29:36,469 --> 02:29:36,479
a lot is pretty difficult
 

8651
02:29:36,479 --> 02:29:38,469
a lot is pretty difficult
i could just i can count i run out of

8652
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:38,479
i could just i can count i run out of
 

8653
02:29:38,479 --> 02:29:40,150
i could just i can count i run out of
fingers yeah at a certain point and then

8654
02:29:40,150 --> 02:29:40,160
fingers yeah at a certain point and then
 

8655
02:29:40,160 --> 02:29:41,349
fingers yeah at a certain point and then
you're screwed and when you're wearing

8656
02:29:41,349 --> 02:29:41,359
you're screwed and when you're wearing
 

8657
02:29:41,359 --> 02:29:42,550
you're screwed and when you're wearing
shoes and you can't even get down to

8658
02:29:42,550 --> 02:29:42,560
shoes and you can't even get down to
 

8659
02:29:42,560 --> 02:29:44,309
shoes and you can't even get down to
your toes it's like

8660
02:29:44,309 --> 02:29:44,319
your toes it's like
 

8661
02:29:44,319 --> 02:29:47,190
your toes it's like
it's like a thousand fine a million is

8662
02:29:47,190 --> 02:29:47,200
it's like a thousand fine a million is
 

8663
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:49,510
it's like a thousand fine a million is
that what and then it gets crazier and

8664
02:29:49,510 --> 02:29:49,520
that what and then it gets crazier and
 

8665
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:51,590
that what and then it gets crazier and
crazier right right

8666
02:29:51,590 --> 02:29:51,600
crazier right right
 

8667
02:29:51,600 --> 02:29:53,349
crazier right right
so this particular so when we say

8668
02:29:53,349 --> 02:29:53,359
so this particular so when we say
 

8669
02:29:53,359 --> 02:29:55,670
so this particular so when we say
technology by the way

8671
02:29:55,680 --> 02:29:56,950
technology by the way
i mean

8672
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:56,960
i mean
 

8673
02:29:56,960 --> 02:29:58,230
i mean
there's some

8674
02:29:58,230 --> 02:29:58,240
there's some
 

8675
02:29:58,240 --> 02:30:00,870
there's some
not to over romanticize the thing but

8676
02:30:00,870 --> 02:30:00,880
not to over romanticize the thing but
 

8677
02:30:00,880 --> 02:30:02,870
not to over romanticize the thing but
there is some aspect about this branch

8678
02:30:02,870 --> 02:30:02,880
there is some aspect about this branch
 

8679
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:06,469
there is some aspect about this branch
of ours that allows us to um for the

8680
02:30:06,469 --> 02:30:06,479
of ours that allows us to um for the
 

8681
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:09,670

okay i'm just human but

02:30:34,469 --> 02:30:34,479
okay i'm just human but
 

8705
02:30:34,479 --> 02:30:36,550
okay i'm just human but
it feels like that if i were to build a

it feels like that if i were to build a

it feels like that if i were to build a

02:36:08,150 --> 02:36:08,160
producing offspring universes and then
 

9027
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:10,630
producing offspring universes and then
wouldn't you expect that

9028
02:36:10,630 --> 02:36:10,640
wouldn't you expect that
 

9029
02:36:10,640 --> 02:36:12,309
wouldn't you expect that
that's where we came from instead of a

9030
02:36:12,309 --> 02:36:12,319
that's where we came from instead of a
 

9031
02:36:12,319 --> 02:36:15,190
that's where we came from instead of a
star yeah so you have to somehow become

9032
02:36:15,190 --> 02:36:15,200
star yeah so you have to somehow become
 

9033
02:36:15,200 --> 02:36:17,750
star yeah so you have to somehow become
masters of gravity so like or just

9034
02:36:17,750 --> 02:36:17,760
masters of gravity so like or just
 

9035
02:36:17,760 --> 02:36:19,750
masters of gravity so like or just
necessarily gravity so stars make black

9036
02:36:19,750 --> 02:36:19,760
necessarily gravity so stars make black
 

9037
02:36:19,760 --> 02:36:21,910
necessarily gravity so stars make black
holes with gravity but any force that

9038
02:36:21,910 --> 02:36:21,920
holes with gravity but any force that
 

9039
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:23,510
holes with gravity but any force that
can

9040
02:36:23,510 --> 02:36:23,520
can
 

9041
02:36:23,520 --> 02:36:26,070
can
make the energy density

9042
02:36:26,070 --> 02:36:26,080
make the energy density
 

9043
02:36:26,080 --> 02:36:28,950
make the energy density
can compactify matter to produce a great

9044
02:36:28,950 --> 02:36:28,960
can compactify matter to produce a great
 

9045
02:36:28,960 --> 02:36:30,469
can compactify matter to produce a great
enough energy density can form a

9046
02:36:30,469 --> 02:36:30,479
enough energy density can form a
 

9047
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,469
enough energy density can form a
singularity it doesn't it would not

9048
02:36:32,469 --> 02:36:32,479
singularity it doesn't it would not
 

9049
02:36:32,479 --> 02:36:34,389
singularity it doesn't it would not
likely be gravity it's the weakest force

9050
02:36:34,389 --> 02:36:34,399
likely be gravity it's the weakest force
 

9051
02:36:34,399 --> 02:36:36,469
likely be gravity it's the weakest force
you're more likely to use

9052
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:36,479
you're more likely to use
 

9053
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:38,469
you're more likely to use
something like the technologies that

9054
02:36:38,469 --> 02:36:38,479
something like the technologies that
 

9055
02:36:38,479 --> 02:36:40,469
something like the technologies that
we're developing for fusion for example

9056
02:36:40,469 --> 02:36:40,479
we're developing for fusion for example
 

9057
02:36:40,479 --> 02:36:42,630
we're developing for fusion for example
so i don't know um

9058
02:36:42,630 --> 02:36:42,640
so i don't know um
 

9059
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:45,510
so i don't know um
the large ignition facility recently

9060
02:36:45,510 --> 02:36:45,520
the large ignition facility recently
 

9061
02:36:45,520 --> 02:36:47,670
the large ignition facility recently
blasted a pellet with

9062
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:47,680
blasted a pellet with
 

9063
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:51,349
blasted a pellet with
a 100 really bright lasers and

9064
02:36:51,349 --> 02:36:51,359
a 100 really bright lasers and
 

9065
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:53,830
a 100 really bright lasers and
caused that to get dense enough to

9066
02:36:53,830 --> 02:36:53,840
caused that to get dense enough to
 

9067
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:55,910
caused that to get dense enough to
engage in nuclear fusion so something

9068
02:36:55,910 --> 02:36:55,920
engage in nuclear fusion so something
 

9069
02:36:55,920 --> 02:36:57,750
engage in nuclear fusion so something
more like that or a tokamak with a

9070
02:36:57,750 --> 02:36:57,760
more like that or a tokamak with a
 

9071
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:00,150
more like that or a tokamak with a
really hot plasma i'm not sure something

9072
02:37:00,150 --> 02:37:00,160
really hot plasma i'm not sure something
 

9073
02:37:00,160 --> 02:37:01,670
really hot plasma i'm not sure something
i don't know exactly how it would be

9074
02:37:01,670 --> 02:37:01,680
i don't know exactly how it would be
 

9075
02:37:01,680 --> 02:37:04,469
i don't know exactly how it would be
done i do like the idea that um

9076
02:37:04,469 --> 02:37:04,479
done i do like the idea that um
 

9077
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:06,070
done i do like the idea that um
especially just been reading a lot about

9078
02:37:06,070 --> 02:37:06,080
especially just been reading a lot about
 

9079
02:37:06,080 --> 02:37:08,389
especially just been reading a lot about
gravitational waves and you know

9080
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:08,399
gravitational waves and you know
 

9081
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:09,830
gravitational waves and you know
the fact that us humans with our

the fact that us humans with our
 

9083

the fact that us humans with our
technological capabilities one of the

uh technological accomplishments of
 

9089
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:17,830
uh technological accomplishments of
human history is ligo being able to

02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:21,429
human history is ligo being able to
precisely detect gravitational waves i'm

particularly

9094
02:37:23,670 --> 02:37:23,680
particularly
 

9095
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:26,230
particularly
find appealing the idea that other alien

9096
02:37:26,230 --> 02:37:26,240
find appealing the idea that other alien
 

9097
02:37:26,240 --> 02:37:28,150
find appealing the idea that other alien
civilizations from

9098
02:37:28,150 --> 02:37:28,160
civilizations from
 

9099
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:31,670
civilizations from
very far distances communicate

9100
02:37:31,670 --> 02:37:31,680
very far distances communicate
 

9101
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:34,309
very far distances communicate
with gravity with gravitational waves

9102
02:37:34,309 --> 02:37:34,319
with gravity with gravitational waves
 

9103
02:37:34,319 --> 02:37:36,309
with gravity with gravitational waves
because as you become greater and

9104
02:37:36,309 --> 02:37:36,319
because as you become greater and
 

9105
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:38,469
because as you become greater and
greater master of gravity which seems

9106
02:37:38,469 --> 02:37:38,479
greater master of gravity which seems
 

9107
02:37:38,479 --> 02:37:40,550
greater master of gravity which seems
way out of reach for us right now

9108
02:37:40,550 --> 02:37:40,560
way out of reach for us right now
 

9109
02:37:40,560 --> 02:37:42,710
way out of reach for us right now
maybe that seems like a effective way of

9110
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:42,720
maybe that seems like a effective way of
 

9111
02:37:42,720 --> 02:37:44,070
maybe that seems like a effective way of
sending signals

9112
02:37:44,070 --> 02:37:44,080
sending signals
 

9113
02:37:44,080 --> 02:37:46,630
sending signals
especially if your job is to

9114
02:37:46,630 --> 02:37:46,640
especially if your job is to
 

9115
02:37:46,640 --> 02:37:49,190
especially if your job is to
manufacture black holes right

9116
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:49,200
manufacture black holes right
 

9117
02:37:49,200 --> 02:37:53,349
manufacture black holes right
so that that so let me ask there

9118
02:37:53,349 --> 02:37:53,359
so that that so let me ask there
 

9119
02:37:53,359 --> 02:37:56,389
so that that so let me ask there
whatever i mean broadly thinking because

9120
02:37:56,389 --> 02:37:56,399
whatever i mean broadly thinking because
 

9121
02:37:56,399 --> 02:37:58,070
whatever i mean broadly thinking because
we tend to think other alien

9122
02:37:58,070 --> 02:37:58,080
we tend to think other alien
 

9123
02:37:58,080 --> 02:37:59,910
we tend to think other alien
civilizations would be very human-like

9124
02:37:59,910 --> 02:37:59,920
civilizations would be very human-like
 

9125
02:37:59,920 --> 02:38:01,030
civilizations would be very human-like
but

9126
02:38:01,030 --> 02:38:01,040
but
 

9127
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:03,190
but
if we think of alien civilizations out

9128
02:38:03,190 --> 02:38:03,200
if we think of alien civilizations out
 

9129
02:38:03,200 --> 02:38:05,830
if we think of alien civilizations out
there as basically generators of black

9130
02:38:05,830 --> 02:38:05,840
there as basically generators of black
 

9131
02:38:05,840 --> 02:38:07,510
there as basically generators of black
holes

9132

holes
 

9133
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:09,270

stars
 

9137
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:12,950
stars
do you think there's a lot of them in

9138
02:38:12,950 --> 02:38:12,960
do you think there's a lot of them in
 

9139
02:38:12,960 --> 02:38:14,950
do you think there's a lot of them in
our particular universe

9140
02:38:14,950 --> 02:38:14,960
our particular universe
 

9141
02:38:14,960 --> 02:38:17,670
our particular universe
out there

9142
02:38:17,670 --> 02:38:17,680

 

9143
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:20,389

in our universe

in our universe
 

9145
02:38:20,399 --> 02:38:23,190
in our universe
well okay let me ask okay this is great

9146
02:38:23,190 --> 02:38:23,200
well okay let me ask okay this is great
 

9147
02:38:23,200 --> 02:38:24,230
well okay let me ask okay this is great
let me ask

9148
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:24,240
let me ask
 

9149
02:38:24,240 --> 02:38:26,550
let me ask
a very generic question

9150
02:38:26,550 --> 02:38:26,560
a very generic question
 

9151
02:38:26,560 --> 02:38:27,590
a very generic question
and then

9152
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:27,600
and then
 

9153
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:30,870
and then
let's see how you answer it which is uh

9154
02:38:30,870 --> 02:38:30,880
let's see how you answer it which is uh
 

9155
02:38:30,880 --> 02:38:33,510
let's see how you answer it which is uh
how many alien civilizations are out

9156
02:38:33,510 --> 02:38:33,520
how many alien civilizations are out
 

9157
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:34,950
how many alien civilizations are out
there

9158
02:38:34,950 --> 02:38:34,960
there
 

9159
02:38:34,960 --> 02:38:38,309
there
if the hypothesis that i just described

9160
02:38:38,309 --> 02:38:38,319
if the hypothesis that i just described
 

9161
02:38:38,319 --> 02:38:39,190
if the hypothesis that i just described
is

9162
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,200
is
 

9163
02:38:39,200 --> 02:38:41,429
is
on the right track yes it would mean

9164
02:38:41,429 --> 02:38:41,439
on the right track yes it would mean
 

9165
02:38:41,439 --> 02:38:44,230
on the right track yes it would mean
that the parameters of our universe have

9166
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:44,240
that the parameters of our universe have
 

9167
02:38:44,240 --> 02:38:45,670
that the parameters of our universe have
been selected

9168
02:38:45,670 --> 02:38:45,680
been selected
 

9169
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:47,030
been selected
so that

9170
02:38:47,030 --> 02:38:47,040
so that
 

9171
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:48,950
so that
intelligent civilizations will occur in

9172
02:38:48,950 --> 02:38:48,960
intelligent civilizations will occur in
 

9173
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:51,110
intelligent civilizations will occur in
sufficient numbers

9174
02:38:51,110 --> 02:38:51,120
sufficient numbers
 

9175
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:54,230
sufficient numbers
so that the if they reach

9176
02:38:54,230 --> 02:38:54,240
so that the if they reach
 

9177
02:38:54,240 --> 02:38:55,910
so that the if they reach
something like supreme technological

9178
02:38:55,910 --> 02:38:55,920
something like supreme technological
 

9179
02:38:55,920 --> 02:38:57,670
something like supreme technological
maturity let's define that as the

9180
02:38:57,670 --> 02:38:57,680
maturity let's define that as the
 

9181
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:00,070
maturity let's define that as the
ability to produce black holes

9182
02:39:00,070 --> 02:39:00,080
ability to produce black holes
 

9183
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,070
ability to produce black holes
then that's not a highly improbable

9184
02:39:02,070 --> 02:39:02,080
then that's not a highly improbable
 

9185
02:39:02,080 --> 02:39:03,349
then that's not a highly improbable
event it

9186
02:39:03,349 --> 02:39:03,359
event it
 

9187
02:39:03,359 --> 02:39:05,590
event it
it doesn't need to happen often because

9188
02:39:05,590 --> 02:39:05,600
it doesn't need to happen often because
 

9189
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:07,750
it doesn't need to happen often because
as i just described if you get one of

9190
02:39:07,750 --> 02:39:07,760
as i just described if you get one of
 

9191
02:39:07,760 --> 02:39:09,590
as i just described if you get one of
them in a galaxy you're going to make

9192
02:39:09,590 --> 02:39:09,600
them in a galaxy you're going to make
 

9193
02:39:09,600 --> 02:39:11,349
them in a galaxy you're going to make
more black holes than the stars in that

9194
02:39:11,349 --> 02:39:11,359
more black holes than the stars in that
 

9195
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:12,790
more black holes than the stars in that
galaxy

9196
02:39:12,790 --> 02:39:12,800
galaxy
 

9197
02:39:12,800 --> 02:39:13,990
galaxy
but

9198
02:39:13,990 --> 02:39:14,000
but
 

9199
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,670
but
there's also not a super strong

9200
02:39:15,670 --> 02:39:15,680
there's also not a super strong
 

9201
02:39:15,680 --> 02:39:19,750
there's also not a super strong
motivation well

9202
02:39:19,750 --> 02:39:19,760

 

9203
02:39:19,760 --> 02:39:21,590

it's not obvious that you need them to

9204
02:39:21,590 --> 02:39:21,600
it's not obvious that you need them to
 

9205
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,750
it's not obvious that you need them to
be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy

9206
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:23,760
be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy
 

9207
02:39:23,760 --> 02:39:25,510
be ubiquitous throughout the galaxy
right so so one of the things that's

9208
02:39:25,510 --> 02:39:25,520
right so so one of the things that's
 

9209
02:39:25,520 --> 02:39:27,750
right so so one of the things that's
that i try to emphasize in that paper is

9210
02:39:27,750 --> 02:39:27,760
that i try to emphasize in that paper is
 

9211
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,270
that i try to emphasize in that paper is
that

9212
02:39:29,270 --> 02:39:29,280
that
 

9213
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:32,309
that
given this idea of of how

9214
02:39:32,309 --> 02:39:32,319
given this idea of of how
 

9215
02:39:32,319 --> 02:39:35,030
given this idea of of how
our parameters might have been selected

9216
02:39:35,030 --> 02:39:35,040
our parameters might have been selected
 

9217
02:39:35,040 --> 02:39:36,710
our parameters might have been selected
it's clear that

9218
02:39:36,710 --> 02:39:36,720
it's clear that
 

9219
02:39:36,720 --> 02:39:39,190
it's clear that
it's a it's a series of trade-offs right

9220
02:39:39,190 --> 02:39:39,200
it's a it's a series of trade-offs right
 

9221
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:40,950
it's a it's a series of trade-offs right
if you make i mean in order for

9222
02:39:40,950 --> 02:39:40,960
if you make i mean in order for
 

9223
02:39:40,960 --> 02:39:43,750
if you make i mean in order for
intelligent life of our variety or

9224
02:39:43,750 --> 02:39:43,760
intelligent life of our variety or
 

9225
02:39:43,760 --> 02:39:45,830
intelligent life of our variety or
anything resembling us to occur you need

9226
02:39:45,830 --> 02:39:45,840
anything resembling us to occur you need
 

9227
02:39:45,840 --> 02:39:48,550
anything resembling us to occur you need
a bunch of stuff you need stars so

9228
02:39:48,550 --> 02:39:48,560
a bunch of stuff you need stars so
 

9229
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:50,550
a bunch of stuff you need stars so
that's right back to smolin's roots of

9230
02:39:50,550 --> 02:39:50,560
that's right back to smolin's roots of
 

9231
02:39:50,560 --> 02:39:52,469
that's right back to smolin's roots of
this idea but you also need

9232
02:39:52,469 --> 02:39:52,479
this idea but you also need
 

9233
02:39:52,479 --> 02:39:54,389
this idea but you also need
water to have certain certain properties

water to have certain certain properties
 

9235

the field of astrobiology trying to

9252
02:40:06,950 --> 02:40:06,960
the field of astrobiology trying to
 

9253
02:40:06,960 --> 02:40:09,190
the field of astrobiology trying to
understand life in the universe but you

9254
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,200
understand life in the universe but you
 

9255
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,510
understand life in the universe but you
can't over emphasize you can't

9256
02:40:11,510 --> 02:40:11,520
can't over emphasize you can't
 

9257
02:40:11,520 --> 02:40:13,670
can't over emphasize you can't
tune the parameters so precisely to

9258
02:40:13,670 --> 02:40:13,680
tune the parameters so precisely to
 

9259
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:16,150
tune the parameters so precisely to
maximize the number of stars or to

9260
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:16,160
maximize the number of stars or to
 

9261
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:19,190
maximize the number of stars or to
to give water exactly the properties or

9262
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:19,200
to give water exactly the properties or
 

9263
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:21,510
to give water exactly the properties or
or to make rocky planets like earth the

9264
02:40:21,510 --> 02:40:21,520
or to make rocky planets like earth the
 

9265
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:23,670
or to make rocky planets like earth the
most numerous you have to compromise on

9266
02:40:23,670 --> 02:40:23,680
most numerous you have to compromise on
 

9267
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:25,510
most numerous you have to compromise on
all these things and so i think the way

9268
02:40:25,510 --> 02:40:25,520
all these things and so i think the way
 

9269
02:40:25,520 --> 02:40:27,349
all these things and so i think the way
to test this idea

9270
02:40:27,349 --> 02:40:27,359
to test this idea
 

9271
02:40:27,359 --> 02:40:29,590
to test this idea
is to look at what parameters are

9272
02:40:29,590 --> 02:40:29,600
is to look at what parameters are
 

9273
02:40:29,600 --> 02:40:31,349
is to look at what parameters are
necessary for for each of these

9274
02:40:31,349 --> 02:40:31,359
necessary for for each of these
 

9275
02:40:31,359 --> 02:40:33,510
necessary for for each of these
different subsystems and i've laid out a

9276
02:40:33,510 --> 02:40:33,520
different subsystems and i've laid out a
 

9277
02:40:33,520 --> 02:40:34,950
different subsystems and i've laid out a
few that i think are promising there

9278
02:40:34,950 --> 02:40:34,960
few that i think are promising there
 

9279
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:36,950
few that i think are promising there
there could be countless others

9280
02:40:36,950 --> 02:40:36,960
there could be countless others
 

9281
02:40:36,960 --> 02:40:38,790
there could be countless others
and see how

9282
02:40:38,790 --> 02:40:38,800
and see how
 

9283
02:40:38,800 --> 02:40:40,870
and see how
changing the parameters

9284
02:40:40,870 --> 02:40:40,880
changing the parameters
 

9285
02:40:40,880 --> 02:40:43,030
changing the parameters
makes it more or less likely that stars

9286
02:40:43,030 --> 02:40:43,040
makes it more or less likely that stars
 

9287
02:40:43,040 --> 02:40:44,630
makes it more or less likely that stars
would form and have long lifetimes or

9288
02:40:44,630 --> 02:40:44,640
would form and have long lifetimes or
 

9289
02:40:44,640 --> 02:40:46,469
would form and have long lifetimes or
that or that rocky planets in the

9290
02:40:46,469 --> 02:40:46,479
that or that rocky planets in the
 

9291
02:40:46,479 --> 02:40:48,309
that or that rocky planets in the
habitable zone are likely to form all

9292
02:40:48,309 --> 02:40:48,319
habitable zone are likely to form all
 

9293
02:40:48,319 --> 02:40:50,710
habitable zone are likely to form all
these different things so we can test

9294
02:40:50,710 --> 02:40:50,720
these different things so we can test
 

9295
02:40:50,720 --> 02:40:52,870
these different things so we can test
how how much these things are in a tug

9296
02:40:52,870 --> 02:40:52,880
how how much these things are in a tug
 

9297
02:40:52,880 --> 02:40:54,469
how how much these things are in a tug
of war with each other

9298
02:40:54,469 --> 02:40:54,479
of war with each other
 

9299
02:40:54,479 --> 02:40:56,630
of war with each other
and the prediction would be that we kind

9300
02:40:56,630 --> 02:40:56,640
and the prediction would be that we kind
 

9301
02:40:56,640 --> 02:40:58,870

if you if you move the parameters too
 

9305
02:41:00,800 --> 02:41:04,150
if you if you move the parameters too
much stars aren't stable or

9306
02:41:04,150 --> 02:41:04,160
much stars aren't stable or
 

9307
02:41:04,160 --> 02:41:06,950
much stars aren't stable or
life doesn't form or technology's

we don't it doesn't necessarily predict

we don't it doesn't necessarily predict
 

9357
02:41:56,240 --> 02:41:58,630
we don't it doesn't necessarily predict
that intelligent civilizations are just

02:41:58,630 --> 02:41:58,640
that intelligent civilizations are just
 

9359
02:41:58,640 --> 02:42:00,950
that intelligent civilizations are just
everywhere because even if you just get

9360
02:42:00,950 --> 02:42:00,960
everywhere because even if you just get
 

9361
02:42:00,960 --> 02:42:03,110
everywhere because even if you just get
one of them in a galaxy which is quite

02:42:03,110 --> 02:42:03,120
one of them in a galaxy which is quite

it could be enough to dramatically uh

9366
02:42:07,429 --> 02:42:07,439
it could be enough to dramatically uh
 

9367
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:09,510
it could be enough to dramatically uh
increase the fecundity of the universe

9368
02:42:09,510 --> 02:42:09,520
increase the fecundity of the universe
 

9369
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:11,670
increase the fecundity of the universe
as a whole yeah and i wonder once you

9370
02:42:11,670 --> 02:42:11,680
as a whole yeah and i wonder once you
 

9371
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:13,349
as a whole yeah and i wonder once you
start generating the offspring for

9372
02:42:13,349 --> 02:42:13,359
start generating the offspring for
 

9373
02:42:13,359 --> 02:42:15,429

civilizations within that universe maybe

9384
02:42:26,389 --> 02:42:26,399
civilizations within that universe maybe
 

9385
02:42:26,399 --> 02:42:28,870

02:42:28,870 --> 02:42:28,880
it has a destructive aspect or there
 

9387
02:42:28,880 --> 02:42:30,309
it has a destructive aspect or there
could be some arguments about once you

9388
02:42:30,309 --> 02:42:30,319
could be some arguments about once you
 

9389
02:42:30,319 --> 02:42:32,870
could be some arguments about once you
have a lot of offspring that that just

9390
02:42:32,870 --> 02:42:32,880
have a lot of offspring that that just
 

9391
02:42:32,880 --> 02:42:34,469
have a lot of offspring that that just
quickly accelerates to where the other

9392
02:42:34,469 --> 02:42:34,479
quickly accelerates to where the other
 

9393
02:42:34,479 --> 02:42:36,710

02:42:36,710 --> 02:42:36,720
ones can't even catch up it could
 

9395
02:42:36,720 --> 02:42:38,070
ones can't even catch up it could
but i guess

9396
02:42:38,070 --> 02:42:38,080
but i guess
 

9397
02:42:38,080 --> 02:42:41,429
but i guess
if you want me to put my chips on the

if you want me to put my chips on the
 

9399
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:43,990
if you want me to put my chips on the

intelligent life civilizations
 

9407
02:42:50,960 --> 02:42:52,309
intelligent life civilizations
are rare

9408
02:42:52,309 --> 02:42:52,319
are rare
 

9409
02:42:52,319 --> 02:42:57,269
are rare
and um i guess i follow max tegmark here

9410
02:42:57,269 --> 02:42:57,279
and um i guess i follow max tegmark here
 

9411
02:42:57,279 --> 02:42:59,910
and um i guess i follow max tegmark here
and also there's there's a lot of papers

9412
02:42:59,910 --> 02:42:59,920
and also there's there's a lot of papers
 

9413
02:42:59,920 --> 02:43:01,750
and also there's there's a lot of papers
coming out recently in the field of

02:43:01,750 --> 02:43:01,760
coming out recently in the field of
 

9415
02:43:01,760 --> 02:43:04,309
coming out recently in the field of
astrobiology that are seeming to say all

02:43:04,309 --> 02:43:04,319
astrobiology that are seeming to say all
 

9417
02:43:04,319 --> 02:43:05,349
astrobiology that are seeming to say all
right you just worked through the

9418
02:43:05,349 --> 02:43:05,359
right you just worked through the
 

9419
02:43:05,359 --> 02:43:06,710
right you just worked through the
numbers on

9420
02:43:06,710 --> 02:43:06,720
numbers on
 

9421
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:08,870
numbers on
on some modified drake equation or

9422
02:43:08,870 --> 02:43:08,880
on some modified drake equation or
 

9423
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:11,429
on some modified drake equation or
something like that and it looks like

9424
02:43:11,429 --> 02:43:11,439
something like that and it looks like
 

9425
02:43:11,439 --> 02:43:13,830
something like that and it looks like
it's not improbable you wouldn't you

9426
02:43:13,830 --> 02:43:13,840
it's not improbable you wouldn't you
 

9427
02:43:13,840 --> 02:43:15,190
it's not improbable you wouldn't you
shouldn't be surprised that an

9428
02:43:15,190 --> 02:43:15,200
shouldn't be surprised that an
 

9429
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:16,870
shouldn't be surprised that an
intelligent species has arisen in our

9430
02:43:16,870 --> 02:43:16,880
intelligent species has arisen in our
 

9431
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:19,110
intelligent species has arisen in our
galaxy but if you think there's one the

9432
02:43:19,110 --> 02:43:19,120
galaxy but if you think there's one the
 

9433
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:20,870
galaxy but if you think there's one the
next solar system over it's it's highly

9434
02:43:20,870 --> 02:43:20,880
next solar system over it's it's highly
 

9435
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,750
next solar system over it's it's highly
improbable so i can see that the number

9436
02:43:23,750 --> 02:43:23,760
improbable so i can see that the number
 

9437
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:26,230
improbable so i can see that the number
the probability of finding a

9438
02:43:26,230 --> 02:43:26,240
the probability of finding a
 

9439
02:43:26,240 --> 02:43:28,630
the probability of finding a
a civilization in a galaxy maybe it's

9440
02:43:28,630 --> 02:43:28,640
a civilization in a galaxy maybe it's
 

9441
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:31,030
a civilization in a galaxy maybe it's
most likely that you're gonna find

9442
02:43:31,030 --> 02:43:31,040
most likely that you're gonna find
 

9443
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:33,269
most likely that you're gonna find
one to a hundred or something but okay

9444
02:43:33,269 --> 02:43:33,279
one to a hundred or something but okay
 

9445
02:43:33,279 --> 02:43:35,110
one to a hundred or something but okay
now it's it's really important to put a

9446
02:43:35,110 --> 02:43:35,120
now it's it's really important to put a
 

9447
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:37,590
now it's it's really important to put a
time window on that i think because

9448
02:43:37,590 --> 02:43:37,600
time window on that i think because
 

9449
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:39,990
time window on that i think because
does that mean in the entire lifetime of

9450
02:43:39,990 --> 02:43:40,000
does that mean in the entire lifetime of
 

9451
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:44,230
does that mean in the entire lifetime of
the galaxy before it it um

9452
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:44,240
the galaxy before it it um
 

9453
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:46,070
the galaxy before it it um
so for in our case before we run into

9454
02:43:46,070 --> 02:43:46,080
so for in our case before we run into
 

9455
02:43:46,080 --> 02:43:49,590
so for in our case before we run into
andromeda

9456
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:49,600

 

9457
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:52,070

i think it's highly probable i shouldn't

9458
02:43:52,070 --> 02:43:52,080
i think it's highly probable i shouldn't
 

9459
02:43:52,080 --> 02:43:53,830
i think it's highly probable i shouldn't
say i think

9460
02:43:53,830 --> 02:43:53,840
say i think
 

9461
02:43:53,840 --> 02:43:55,429
say i think
it's tempting to believe that it's

9462
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
it's tempting to believe that it's
 

9463
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:58,630
it's tempting to believe that it's
highly probable that in that entire

9464
02:43:58,630 --> 02:43:58,640
highly probable that in that entire
 

9465
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:00,150
highly probable that in that entire
lifetime of your galaxy you're going to

9466
02:44:00,150 --> 02:44:00,160
lifetime of your galaxy you're going to
 

9467
02:44:00,160 --> 02:44:02,550
lifetime of your galaxy you're going to
get at least one intelligent species

9468
02:44:02,550 --> 02:44:02,560
get at least one intelligent species
 

9469
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:05,110
get at least one intelligent species
maybe thousands or something like that

9470
02:44:05,110 --> 02:44:05,120
maybe thousands or something like that
 

9471
02:44:05,120 --> 02:44:06,550
maybe thousands or something like that
but it's also

9472
02:44:06,550 --> 02:44:06,560
but it's also
 

9473
02:44:06,560 --> 02:44:08,950
but it's also
i think um

9474
02:44:08,950 --> 02:44:08,960
i think um
 

9475
02:44:08,960 --> 02:44:10,710
i think um
a little bit naive to think that they're

9476
02:44:10,710 --> 02:44:10,720
a little bit naive to think that they're
 

9477
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:13,269
a little bit naive to think that they're
going to coincide in time

9478
02:44:13,269 --> 02:44:13,279
going to coincide in time
 

9479
02:44:13,279 --> 02:44:15,030
going to coincide in time
and we'll be able to observe them and

9480
02:44:15,030 --> 02:44:15,040
and we'll be able to observe them and
 

9481
02:44:15,040 --> 02:44:17,030
and we'll be able to observe them and
also if you look at the

9482
02:44:17,030 --> 02:44:17,040
also if you look at the
 

9483
02:44:17,040 --> 02:44:19,030
also if you look at the
span of

9484
02:44:19,030 --> 02:44:19,040
span of
 

9485
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:21,510
span of
life on earth the earth earth

9486
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:21,520
life on earth the earth earth

9488
02:44:23,190 --> 02:44:23,200

9489
02:44:23,200 --> 02:44:25,429
history
it was surprising to me to kind of look

9490
02:44:25,429 --> 02:44:25,439
it was surprising to me to kind of look
 

9491
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:26,389
it was surprising to me to kind of look
at

at
 

9493
02:44:26,399 --> 02:44:28,469
at
the amount of time well first of all the

02:44:28,469 --> 02:44:28,479
the amount of time well first of all the
 

9495
02:44:28,479 --> 02:44:30,309
the amount of time well first of all the
the short amount of time there's no life

9496
02:44:30,309 --> 02:44:30,319
the short amount of time there's no life
 

9497
02:44:30,319 --> 02:44:32,790
the short amount of time there's no life
is surprising life sprang up pretty

9498
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:32,800
is surprising life sprang up pretty
 

9499
02:44:32,800 --> 02:44:35,349
is surprising life sprang up pretty
quickly it's cellular single cell so but

9500
02:44:35,349 --> 02:44:35,359
quickly it's cellular single cell so but
 

9501
02:44:35,359 --> 02:44:36,630
quickly it's cellular single cell so but
that was that's the point i'm trying to

9502
02:44:36,630 --> 02:44:36,640
that was that's the point i'm trying to
 

9503
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:40,309
that was that's the point i'm trying to
make is like so much with what

02:44:40,309 --> 02:44:40,319
make is like so much with what
 

9505
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:42,870
make is like so much with what
of life on earth was just like single

9506
02:44:42,870 --> 02:44:42,880
of life on earth was just like single

cell organisms like most of it most of

cell organisms like most of it most of
 

9509
02:44:46,160 --> 02:44:48,469
cell organisms like most of it most of
us like boring bacteria type of stuff

02:44:48,479 --> 02:44:50,230
us like boring bacteria type of stuff
well bacteria are fascinating but i take

9512
02:44:50,230 --> 02:44:50,240
well bacteria are fascinating but i take
 

9513
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:52,230
well bacteria are fascinating but i take
your point no i get it i mean no offense

9514
02:44:52,230 --> 02:44:52,240
your point no i get it i mean no offense
 

9515
02:44:52,240 --> 02:44:54,389
your point no i get it i mean no offense
to them

9516
02:44:54,389 --> 02:44:54,399
to them
 

9517
02:44:54,399 --> 02:44:56,230
to them
this kind of speaking from the

9518
02:44:56,230 --> 02:44:56,240
this kind of speaking from the
 

9519
02:44:56,240 --> 02:44:58,150
this kind of speaking from the
perspective of your paper of something

9520
02:44:58,150 --> 02:44:58,160
perspective of your paper of something
 

9521
02:44:58,160 --> 02:45:00,150
perspective of your paper of something
that's able to generate technology as we

9522
02:45:00,150 --> 02:45:00,160
that's able to generate technology as we
 

9523
02:45:00,160 --> 02:45:02,150
that's able to generate technology as we
kind of understand it that's a very

9524
02:45:02,150 --> 02:45:02,160
kind of understand it that's a very
 

9525
02:45:02,160 --> 02:45:05,349
kind of understand it that's a very
short moment in time relative to that

9526
02:45:05,349 --> 02:45:05,359
short moment in time relative to that
 

9527
02:45:05,359 --> 02:45:08,710
short moment in time relative to that
that full history of life on earth and

9528
02:45:08,710 --> 02:45:08,720
that full history of life on earth and
 

9529
02:45:08,720 --> 02:45:11,429
that full history of life on earth and
maybe our universe is just

9530
02:45:11,429 --> 02:45:11,439
maybe our universe is just
 

9531
02:45:11,439 --> 02:45:13,030
maybe our universe is just
saturated with

saturated with
 

9533
02:45:13,040 --> 02:45:14,950
saturated with
bacteria like

02:45:14,950 --> 02:45:14,960
bacteria like
 

9535
02:45:14,960 --> 02:45:17,510
bacteria like
humans right

9536
02:45:17,510 --> 02:45:17,520
humans right
 

9537
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:18,389
humans right
but

9539
02:45:18,399 --> 02:45:20,950

that those are very rare and once those

9546
02:45:26,950 --> 02:45:26,960
that those are very rare and once those
 

9547
02:45:26,960 --> 02:45:28,389
that those are very rare and once those
spring up

everything just goes to like it

9550
02:45:31,269 --> 02:45:31,279
everything just goes to like it
 

9551
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:33,349
everything just goes to like it
accelerates very quickly

9552
02:45:33,349 --> 02:45:33,359
accelerates very quickly
 

9553
02:45:33,359 --> 02:45:35,349
accelerates very quickly
yeah it's it's we just don't have enough

9554
02:45:35,349 --> 02:45:35,359
yeah it's it's we just don't have enough
 

9555
02:45:35,359 --> 02:45:37,510
yeah it's it's we just don't have enough
data to really say but i find this whole

9556
02:45:37,510 --> 02:45:37,520
data to really say but i find this whole
 

9557
02:45:37,520 --> 02:45:40,389
data to really say but i find this whole
subject extremely engaging i mean

9558
02:45:40,389 --> 02:45:40,399
subject extremely engaging i mean
 

9559
02:45:40,399 --> 02:45:42,230
subject extremely engaging i mean
there's this concept i think it's called

9560
02:45:42,230 --> 02:45:42,240
there's this concept i think it's called
 

9561
02:45:42,240 --> 02:45:45,110
there's this concept i think it's called
the rare earth hypothesis which is that

9562
02:45:45,110 --> 02:45:45,120
the rare earth hypothesis which is that
 

9563
02:45:45,120 --> 02:45:46,870
the rare earth hypothesis which is that
basically stating that

9564
02:45:46,870 --> 02:45:46,880
basically stating that
 

9565
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:49,429
basically stating that
okay microbes were here right away after

9566
02:45:49,429 --> 02:45:49,439
okay microbes were here right away after
 

9567
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:51,349
okay microbes were here right away after
the haitian era where we were being

9568
02:45:51,349 --> 02:45:51,359
the haitian era where we were being
 

9569
02:45:51,359 --> 02:45:54,070
the haitian era where we were being
bombarded well after yeah bombarded by

9570
02:45:54,070 --> 02:45:54,080
bombarded well after yeah bombarded by
 

9571
02:45:54,080 --> 02:45:55,349
bombarded well after yeah bombarded by
comets asteroids things like that and

9572
02:45:55,349 --> 02:45:55,359
comets asteroids things like that and
 

9573
02:45:55,359 --> 02:45:57,429
comets asteroids things like that and
also after the moon formed so once

9574
02:45:57,429 --> 02:45:57,439
also after the moon formed so once
 

9575
02:45:57,439 --> 02:45:59,429
also after the moon formed so once
things settled down a little bit

9576
02:45:59,429 --> 02:45:59,439
things settled down a little bit
 

9577
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:02,230
things settled down a little bit
in a few hundred million years

9578
02:46:02,230 --> 02:46:02,240
in a few hundred million years
 

9579
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,670
in a few hundred million years
you have microbes everywhere and it

9580
02:46:03,670 --> 02:46:03,680
you have microbes everywhere and it
 

9581
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:05,030
you have microbes everywhere and it
could have been we don't know exactly

9582
02:46:05,030 --> 02:46:05,040
could have been we don't know exactly
 

9583
02:46:05,040 --> 02:46:07,269
could have been we don't know exactly
when it could have been remarkably brief

9584
02:46:07,269 --> 02:46:07,279
when it could have been remarkably brief
 

9585
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:09,830
when it could have been remarkably brief
that that took so it does indicate that

9586
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:09,840
that that took so it does indicate that
 

9587
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:12,150
that that took so it does indicate that
okay life forms relatively easily i

9588
02:46:12,150 --> 02:46:12,160
okay life forms relatively easily i
 

9589
02:46:12,160 --> 02:46:12,950
okay life forms relatively easily i
think

9590
02:46:12,950 --> 02:46:12,960
think
 

9591
02:46:12,960 --> 02:46:15,429
think
that alone is sort of a checker on the

9592
02:46:15,429 --> 02:46:15,439
that alone is sort of a checker on the
 

9593
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:16,790
that alone is sort of a checker on the
scale for the

9594
02:46:16,790 --> 02:46:16,800
scale for the
 

9595
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:19,590
scale for the
argument that

9596
02:46:19,590 --> 02:46:19,600
argument that
 

9597
02:46:19,600 --> 02:46:22,150
argument that
the parameters that allow even microbial

9598
02:46:22,150 --> 02:46:22,160
the parameters that allow even microbial
 

9599
02:46:22,160 --> 02:46:25,030
the parameters that allow even microbial
life to form are not just a fluke but

9600
02:46:25,030 --> 02:46:25,040
life to form are not just a fluke but
 

9601
02:46:25,040 --> 02:46:27,830
life to form are not just a fluke but
anyway that aside yes then there was

9602
02:46:27,830 --> 02:46:27,840
anyway that aside yes then there was
 

9603
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:30,550
anyway that aside yes then there was
this long dormant period not dormant

9604
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:30,560
this long dormant period not dormant
 

9605
02:46:30,560 --> 02:46:32,309
this long dormant period not dormant
things were happening but

9606
02:46:32,309 --> 02:46:32,319
things were happening but
 

9607
02:46:32,319 --> 02:46:34,630
things were happening but
um important things were happening for

9608
02:46:34,630 --> 02:46:34,640
um important things were happening for
 

9609
02:46:34,640 --> 02:46:36,710
um important things were happening for
some two and a half billion years or

9610
02:46:36,710 --> 02:46:36,720
some two and a half billion years or
 

9611
02:46:36,720 --> 02:46:39,990
some two and a half billion years or
something after um the metabolic process

9612
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:40,000
something after um the metabolic process
 

9613
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:43,670
something after um the metabolic process
that releases oxygen was developed then

9614
02:46:43,670 --> 02:46:43,680
that releases oxygen was developed then
 

9615
02:46:43,680 --> 02:46:45,349
that releases oxygen was developed then
basically the plant is just sitting

9616
02:46:45,349 --> 02:46:45,359
basically the plant is just sitting
 

9617
02:46:45,359 --> 02:46:47,429
basically the plant is just sitting
there getting more and more oxygenated

9618
02:46:47,429 --> 02:46:47,439
there getting more and more oxygenated
 

9619
02:46:47,439 --> 02:46:49,590
there getting more and more oxygenated
more and more oxygenated until it's

9620
02:46:49,590 --> 02:46:49,600
more and more oxygenated until it's
 

9621
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:52,790
more and more oxygenated until it's
enough that you can build these large

9622
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:52,800
enough that you can build these large
 

9623
02:46:52,800 --> 02:46:55,030
enough that you can build these large
complex organisms and so the rare earth

9624
02:46:55,030 --> 02:46:55,040
complex organisms and so the rare earth
 

9625
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:58,389
complex organisms and so the rare earth
hypothesis would argue that

9626
02:46:58,389 --> 02:46:58,399
hypothesis would argue that
 

9627
02:46:58,399 --> 02:47:01,030
hypothesis would argue that
the microbes are common in everywhere in

9628
02:47:01,030 --> 02:47:01,040
the microbes are common in everywhere in
 

9629
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:03,110
the microbes are common in everywhere in
any planet that's like roughly in the

9630
02:47:03,110 --> 02:47:03,120
any planet that's like roughly in the
 

9631
02:47:03,120 --> 02:47:04,950
any planet that's like roughly in the
habitable zone and has some water on

9632
02:47:04,950 --> 02:47:04,960
habitable zone and has some water on
 

9633
02:47:04,960 --> 02:47:06,950
habitable zone and has some water on
it's probably gonna have those but then

9634
02:47:06,950 --> 02:47:06,960
it's probably gonna have those but then
 

9635
02:47:06,960 --> 02:47:09,349
it's probably gonna have those but then
getting to this cambrian explosion that

9636
02:47:09,349 --> 02:47:09,359
getting to this cambrian explosion that
 

9637
02:47:09,359 --> 02:47:11,910
getting to this cambrian explosion that
happened some between five and six

9638
02:47:11,910 --> 02:47:11,920
happened some between five and six
 

9639
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:13,750
happened some between five and six
hundred million years ago

9640
02:47:13,750 --> 02:47:13,760
hundred million years ago
 

9641
02:47:13,760 --> 02:47:16,230
hundred million years ago
that's that's rare you know

9642
02:47:16,230 --> 02:47:16,240
that's that's rare you know
 

9643
02:47:16,240 --> 02:47:19,269
that's that's rare you know
and i i buy that i think that is rare so

9644
02:47:19,269 --> 02:47:19,279
and i i buy that i think that is rare so
 

9645
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:21,349
and i i buy that i think that is rare so
if you say how much life is in our

9646
02:47:21,349 --> 02:47:21,359
if you say how much life is in our
 

9647
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:23,269
if you say how much life is in our
galaxy i think that's probably

9648
02:47:23,269 --> 02:47:23,279
galaxy i think that's probably
 

9649
02:47:23,279 --> 02:47:25,349
galaxy i think that's probably
the right answer is that microbes are

9650
02:47:25,349 --> 02:47:25,359
the right answer is that microbes are
 

9651
02:47:25,359 --> 02:47:27,750
the right answer is that microbes are
everywhere cambrian explosion is

9652
02:47:27,750 --> 02:47:27,760
everywhere cambrian explosion is
 

9653
02:47:27,760 --> 02:47:29,190
everywhere cambrian explosion is
extremely rare

9654
02:47:29,190 --> 02:47:29,200
extremely rare
 

9655
02:47:29,200 --> 02:47:30,389
extremely rare
and then

9656
02:47:30,389 --> 02:47:30,399
and then
 

9657
02:47:30,399 --> 02:47:32,070
and then
but the cambrian explosion kind of went

9658
02:47:32,070 --> 02:47:32,080
but the cambrian explosion kind of went
 

9659
02:47:32,080 --> 02:47:33,429
but the cambrian explosion kind of went
like that where

9660
02:47:33,429 --> 02:47:33,439
like that where
 

9661
02:47:33,439 --> 02:47:37,110
like that where
um within a couple tens or 100 million

9662
02:47:37,110 --> 02:47:37,120
um within a couple tens or 100 million
 

9663
02:47:37,120 --> 02:47:38,469
um within a couple tens or 100 million
years

9664
02:47:38,469 --> 02:47:38,479
years
 

9665
02:47:38,479 --> 02:47:40,309
years
all of these body plans came into

9666
02:47:40,309 --> 02:47:40,319
all of these body plans came into
 

9667
02:47:40,319 --> 02:47:42,309
all of these body plans came into
existence and and basically all of the

9668
02:47:42,309 --> 02:47:42,319
existence and and basically all of the
 

9669
02:47:42,319 --> 02:47:44,309
existence and and basically all of the
body plans that are now in existence on

9670
02:47:44,309 --> 02:47:44,319
body plans that are now in existence on
 

9671
02:47:44,319 --> 02:47:45,910
body plans that are now in existence on
the on the planet

9672
02:47:45,910 --> 02:47:45,920
the on the planet
 

9673
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:48,550
the on the planet
were formed in that brief window

9674
02:47:48,550 --> 02:47:48,560
were formed in that brief window
 

9675
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:50,389
were formed in that brief window
and we've just been

9676
02:47:50,389 --> 02:47:50,399
and we've just been
 

9677
02:47:50,399 --> 02:47:52,230
and we've just been
shuffling around since then so then what

9678
02:47:52,230 --> 02:47:52,240
shuffling around since then so then what
 

9679
02:47:52,240 --> 02:47:53,030
shuffling around since then so then what
what

9680
02:47:53,030 --> 02:47:53,040
what
 

9681
02:47:53,040 --> 02:47:56,150
what
caused humans to pop out of that i mean

9682
02:47:56,150 --> 02:47:56,160
caused humans to pop out of that i mean
 

9683
02:47:56,160 --> 02:47:58,469
caused humans to pop out of that i mean
that could be another

02:47:58,469 --> 02:47:58,479
that could be another
 

9685
02:47:58,479 --> 02:48:00,830
that could be another
extremely rare

9686
02:48:00,830 --> 02:48:00,840
extremely rare

much more than if you think about it's
 

9727
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:49,269
much more than if you think about it's
like most of our universes are pretty

9728

like most of our universes are pretty
 

9729
02:48:49,279 --> 02:48:50,710
like most of our universes are pretty
freaking boring

02:48:50,720 --> 02:48:52,309
freaking boring
there's not much going on there's a few

there's not much going on there's a few
 

9733
02:48:52,319 --> 02:48:53,750
there's not much going on there's a few
rocks flying around and there's some

rocks flying around and there's some
 

9735
02:48:53,760 --> 02:48:55,750
rocks flying around and there's some
like apes that are just like

like apes that are just like
 

9737
02:48:55,760 --> 02:48:56,950
like apes that are just like
um

9738

um
 

9739
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:59,269
um
doing podcasts

9740
02:48:59,269 --> 02:48:59,279
doing podcasts
 

9741
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:01,590
doing podcasts
on some weird planet it just seems very

9742
02:49:01,590 --> 02:49:01,600
on some weird planet it just seems very
 

9743
02:49:01,600 --> 02:49:04,230
on some weird planet it just seems very
inefficient if you think about like the

9744
02:49:04,230 --> 02:49:04,240
inefficient if you think about like the
 

9745
02:49:04,240 --> 02:49:05,990
inefficient if you think about like the
the amazing thing the human eye the

9746
02:49:05,990 --> 02:49:06,000
the amazing thing the human eye the
 

9747
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,870
the amazing thing the human eye the
visual cortex can do the the brain the

powerful than
 

9753
02:49:13,680 --> 02:49:16,150
powerful than
single cell organisms like if there's an

9754
02:49:16,150 --> 02:49:16,160
single cell organisms like if there's an
 

9755
02:49:16,160 --> 02:49:18,870
single cell organisms like if there's an
equivalent of that for universes

9756
02:49:18,870 --> 02:49:18,880
equivalent of that for universes
 

9757
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:21,590
equivalent of that for universes
they're like the richness of physics

9758
02:49:21,590 --> 02:49:21,600
they're like the richness of physics
 

9759
02:49:21,600 --> 02:49:23,269
they're like the richness of physics
that could be uh

9760
02:49:23,269 --> 02:49:23,279
that could be uh
 

9761
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:24,790
that could be uh
they could be expressed through a

9762
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:24,800
they could be expressed through a
 

9763
02:49:24,800 --> 02:49:26,790
they could be expressed through a
particular set of parameters

9764
02:49:26,790 --> 02:49:26,800
particular set of parameters
 

9765
02:49:26,800 --> 02:49:27,590
particular set of parameters
like

9766
02:49:27,590 --> 02:49:27,600
like
 

9767
02:49:27,600 --> 02:49:29,030
like
i mean

9768
02:49:29,030 --> 02:49:29,040
i mean
 

9769
02:49:29,040 --> 02:49:30,389
i mean
that

9770
02:49:30,389 --> 02:49:30,399
that
 

9771
02:49:30,399 --> 02:49:32,469
that
like for me i'm uh so from a computer

9772
02:49:32,469 --> 02:49:32,479
like for me i'm uh so from a computer
 

9773
02:49:32,479 --> 02:49:34,309
like for me i'm uh so from a computer
science perspective a huge fan of

9774
02:49:34,309 --> 02:49:34,319
science perspective a huge fan of
 

9775
02:49:34,319 --> 02:49:37,269
science perspective a huge fan of
cellular automata which is a nice

9776
02:49:37,269 --> 02:49:37,279
cellular automata which is a nice
 

9777
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:40,309
cellular automata which is a nice
sort of pretty visual way to illustrate

9778
02:49:40,309 --> 02:49:40,319
sort of pretty visual way to illustrate
 

9779
02:49:40,319 --> 02:49:43,670
sort of pretty visual way to illustrate
how different laws can result in uh

9780
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:43,680
how different laws can result in uh
 

9781
02:49:43,680 --> 02:49:45,269
how different laws can result in uh
drastically different levels of

9782
02:49:45,269 --> 02:49:45,279
drastically different levels of
 

9783
02:49:45,279 --> 02:49:48,870
drastically different levels of
complexity so like it's like yeah okay

9784
02:49:48,870 --> 02:49:48,880
complexity so like it's like yeah okay
 

9785
02:49:48,880 --> 02:49:50,790
complexity so like it's like yeah okay
so we're all like celebrating look our

9786
02:49:50,790 --> 02:49:50,800
so we're all like celebrating look our
 

9787
02:49:50,800 --> 02:49:52,469
so we're all like celebrating look our
little cellular automata is able to

9788
02:49:52,469 --> 02:49:52,479
little cellular automata is able to
 

9789
02:49:52,479 --> 02:49:54,469
little cellular automata is able to
generate pretty triangles and squares

9790
02:49:54,469 --> 02:49:54,479
generate pretty triangles and squares
 

9791
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:56,630
generate pretty triangles and squares
and therefore we achieve general

9792
02:49:56,630 --> 02:49:56,640
and therefore we achieve general
 

9793
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:59,190
and therefore we achieve general
intelligence and then there'll be like

9794
02:49:59,190 --> 02:49:59,200
intelligence and then there'll be like
 

9795
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:02,710
intelligence and then there'll be like
some badass chuck norris type like

9796
02:50:02,710 --> 02:50:02,720
some badass chuck norris type like
 

9797
02:50:02,720 --> 02:50:03,590
some badass chuck norris type like
uh

9798
02:50:03,590 --> 02:50:03,600
uh
 

9799
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,510
uh
universal touring machine type of

universal touring machine type of
 

9801
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:06,950
universal touring machine type of

generate other cellular automata

9804
02:50:09,429 --> 02:50:09,439
generate other cellular automata
 

9805
02:50:09,439 --> 02:50:10,950
generate other cellular automata
that does any arbitrary level of

it like those have to then exist

9810
02:50:16,309 --> 02:50:16,319
it like those have to then exist
 

9811
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:18,710
it like those have to then exist
and then we're just like this we're just

9812
02:50:18,710 --> 02:50:18,720
and then we're just like this we're just
 

9813
02:50:18,720 --> 02:50:20,790
and then we're just like this we're just
we'll be forgotten is this the story

9814
02:50:20,790 --> 02:50:20,800
we'll be forgotten is this the story

02:50:20,800 --> 02:50:23,750
we'll be forgotten is this the story
this is uh this podcast just entertains

9816
02:50:23,750 --> 02:50:23,760
this is uh this podcast just entertains
 

9817
02:50:23,760 --> 02:50:25,750
this is uh this podcast just entertains
a few other apes for

9818
02:50:25,750 --> 02:50:25,760
a few other apes for
 

9819
02:50:25,760 --> 02:50:28,070
a few other apes for
for a few months well i i'm kind of

9820
02:50:28,070 --> 02:50:28,080
for a few months well i i'm kind of
 

9821
02:50:28,080 --> 02:50:30,870
for a few months well i i'm kind of
surprised to hear your cynicism be no

9822
02:50:30,870 --> 02:50:30,880
surprised to hear your cynicism be no
 

9823
02:50:30,880 --> 02:50:33,269
surprised to hear your cynicism be no
i'm very up i i usually think of you as

9824
02:50:33,269 --> 02:50:33,279
i'm very up i i usually think of you as
 

9825
02:50:33,279 --> 02:50:34,309
i'm very up i i usually think of you as
like a

9826
02:50:34,309 --> 02:50:34,319
like a
 

9827
02:50:34,319 --> 02:50:36,469
like a
one who celebrates humanity in all its

9828
02:50:36,469 --> 02:50:36,479
one who celebrates humanity in all its
 

9829
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:38,070
one who celebrates humanity in all its
forms and things like that and i i guess

9830
02:50:38,070 --> 02:50:38,080
forms and things like that and i i guess
 

9831
02:50:38,080 --> 02:50:40,389
forms and things like that and i i guess
i just i don't i see it the way you just

9832
02:50:40,389 --> 02:50:40,399
i just i don't i see it the way you just
 

9833
02:50:40,399 --> 02:50:42,630
i just i don't i see it the way you just
described i mean okay fif we've been

9834
02:50:42,630 --> 02:50:42,640
described i mean okay fif we've been
 

9835
02:50:42,640 --> 02:50:44,790
described i mean okay fif we've been
here for 13.7 billion years and you're

9836
02:50:44,790 --> 02:50:44,800
here for 13.7 billion years and you're
 

9837
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:45,830
here for 13.7 billion years and you're
saying

9838
02:50:45,830 --> 02:50:45,840
saying
 

9839
02:50:45,840 --> 02:50:47,590
saying
gosh that's a long time let's get on

9840
02:50:47,590 --> 02:50:47,600
gosh that's a long time let's get on
 

9841
02:50:47,600 --> 02:50:49,190
gosh that's a long time let's get on
with the show already some other

9842
02:50:49,190 --> 02:50:49,200
with the show already some other
 

9843
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:51,190
with the show already some other
universe could have kicked our butt by

9844
02:50:51,190 --> 02:50:51,200
universe could have kicked our butt by
 

9845
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:53,670
universe could have kicked our butt by
now but

9846
02:50:53,670 --> 02:50:53,680

 

9847
02:50:53,680 --> 02:50:55,269

that's putting a characteristic time i

9848
02:50:55,269 --> 02:50:55,279
that's putting a characteristic time i
 

9849
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:58,309
that's putting a characteristic time i
mean why is 13.7 billion a long time i

9850
02:50:58,309 --> 02:50:58,319
mean why is 13.7 billion a long time i
 

9851
02:50:58,319 --> 02:51:00,469
mean why is 13.7 billion a long time i
mean compared to compared to what i

9852
02:51:00,469 --> 02:51:00,479
mean compared to compared to what i
 

9853
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:02,389
mean compared to compared to what i
guess so when i look at our universe i

9854
02:51:02,389 --> 02:51:02,399
guess so when i look at our universe i
 

9855
02:51:02,399 --> 02:51:05,510
guess so when i look at our universe i
see this extraordinary hierarchy that

9856
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:05,520
see this extraordinary hierarchy that
 

9857
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:08,550
see this extraordinary hierarchy that
has developed over that time so at the

9858
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:08,560
has developed over that time so at the
 

9859
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:11,590
has developed over that time so at the
beginning it was a chaotic mess of

9860
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:11,600
beginning it was a chaotic mess of
 

9861
02:51:11,600 --> 02:51:12,790
beginning it was a chaotic mess of
you know some

9862
02:51:12,790 --> 02:51:12,800
you know some
 

9863
02:51:12,800 --> 02:51:14,309
you know some
plasma and

9864
02:51:14,309 --> 02:51:14,319
plasma and
 

9865
02:51:14,319 --> 02:51:16,710
plasma and
nothing interesting going on there and

9866
02:51:16,710 --> 02:51:16,720
nothing interesting going on there and
 

9867
02:51:16,720 --> 02:51:19,349
nothing interesting going on there and
even for the first stars to form that a

9868
02:51:19,349 --> 02:51:19,359
even for the first stars to form that a
 

9869
02:51:19,359 --> 02:51:20,790
even for the first stars to form that a
lot of

9870
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:20,800
lot of
 

9871
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:23,190
lot of
really interesting uh evolutionary

9872
02:51:23,190 --> 02:51:23,200
really interesting uh evolutionary
 

9873
02:51:23,200 --> 02:51:25,670
really interesting uh evolutionary
processes had to occur by evolutionary

9874
02:51:25,670 --> 02:51:25,680
processes had to occur by evolutionary
 

9875
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:27,429
processes had to occur by evolutionary
in that sense i just mean

9876
02:51:27,429 --> 02:51:27,439
in that sense i just mean
 

9877
02:51:27,439 --> 02:51:29,429
in that sense i just mean
um taking place over extended periods of

9878
02:51:29,429 --> 02:51:29,439
um taking place over extended periods of
 

9879
02:51:29,439 --> 02:51:30,389
um taking place over extended periods of
time

9880
02:51:30,389 --> 02:51:30,399
time
 

9881
02:51:30,399 --> 02:51:32,230
time
and structures are forming then and then

9882
02:51:32,230 --> 02:51:32,240
and structures are forming then and then
 

9883
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:34,550
and structures are forming then and then
it took that first generation of stars

9884
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:34,560
it took that first generation of stars
 

9885
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:36,230
it took that first generation of stars
in order to

9886
02:51:36,230 --> 02:51:36,240
in order to
 

9887
02:51:36,240 --> 02:51:38,710
in order to
produce the metals

9888
02:51:38,710 --> 02:51:38,720
produce the metals
 

9889
02:51:38,720 --> 02:51:41,190
produce the metals
that then can more efficiently produce

9890
02:51:41,190 --> 02:51:41,200
that then can more efficiently produce
 

9891
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:43,030
that then can more efficiently produce
another generation of stars we're only

9892
02:51:43,030 --> 02:51:43,040
another generation of stars we're only
 

9893
02:51:43,040 --> 02:51:45,269
another generation of stars we're only
the third generation of stars so we

9894
02:51:45,269 --> 02:51:45,279
the third generation of stars so we
 

9895
02:51:45,279 --> 02:51:47,110
the third generation of stars so we
might still be pretty quick to the to

9896
02:51:47,110 --> 02:51:47,120
might still be pretty quick to the to
 

9897
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:48,710
might still be pretty quick to the to
the game here so

9898
02:51:48,710 --> 02:51:48,720
the game here so
 

9899
02:51:48,720 --> 02:51:50,630
the game here so
i but i don't think i don't

9900
02:51:50,630 --> 02:51:50,640
i but i don't think i don't
 

9901
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:52,070
i but i don't think i don't
okay so then so then you have these

9902
02:51:52,070 --> 02:51:52,080
okay so then so then you have these
 

9903
02:51:52,080 --> 02:51:53,510
okay so then so then you have these
stars now you have solar systems on

9904
02:51:53,510 --> 02:51:53,520
stars now you have solar systems on
 

9905
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:55,590
stars now you have solar systems on
those solar systems you have

9906
02:51:55,590 --> 02:51:55,600
those solar systems you have
 

9907
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:56,790
those solar systems you have
um

9908
02:51:56,790 --> 02:51:56,800
um
 

9909
02:51:56,800 --> 02:51:58,870
um
rocky worlds you have gas giants like

9910
02:51:58,870 --> 02:51:58,880
rocky worlds you have gas giants like
 

9911
02:51:58,880 --> 02:52:00,309
rocky worlds you have gas giants like
all this complexity and then you start

9912
02:52:00,309 --> 02:52:00,319
all this complexity and then you start
 

9913
02:52:00,319 --> 02:52:02,070
all this complexity and then you start
getting life and the

9914
02:52:02,070 --> 02:52:02,080
getting life and the
 

9915
02:52:02,080 --> 02:52:03,910
getting life and the
the complexity that's evolved through

9916
02:52:03,910 --> 02:52:03,920
the complexity that's evolved through
 

9917
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:05,990
the complexity that's evolved through
the evolutionary process in in life

9918
02:52:05,990 --> 02:52:06,000
the evolutionary process in in life
 

9919
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:07,590
the evolutionary process in in life
forms is just

9920
02:52:07,590 --> 02:52:07,600
forms is just
 

9921
02:52:07,600 --> 02:52:10,389
forms is just
it's not a a letdown to me just no no

9922
02:52:10,389 --> 02:52:10,399
it's not a a letdown to me just no no
 

9923
02:52:10,399 --> 02:52:11,990
it's not a a letdown to me just no no
and there's some of it is like some some

9924
02:52:11,990 --> 02:52:12,000
and there's some of it is like some some
 

9925
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,510
and there's some of it is like some some
of the planets is like

9926
02:52:13,510 --> 02:52:13,520
of the planets is like
 

9927
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:15,750
of the planets is like
icy it's like different flavors of ice

9928
02:52:15,750 --> 02:52:15,760
icy it's like different flavors of ice
 

9929
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,190
icy it's like different flavors of ice
cream they're icy but there might be

9930
02:52:17,190 --> 02:52:17,200
cream they're icy but there might be
 

9931
02:52:17,200 --> 02:52:18,550
cream they're icy but there might be
water under yeah

9932
02:52:18,550 --> 02:52:18,560
water under yeah
 

9933
02:52:18,560 --> 02:52:19,750
water under yeah
all kinds of life forms with some

9934
02:52:19,750 --> 02:52:19,760
all kinds of life forms with some
 

9935
02:52:19,760 --> 02:52:22,230
all kinds of life forms with some
volcanoes right all kinds of weird stuff

9936
02:52:22,230 --> 02:52:22,240
volcanoes right all kinds of weird stuff
 

9937
02:52:22,240 --> 02:52:24,070
volcanoes right all kinds of weird stuff
no no i i don't uh i think it's

9938
02:52:24,070 --> 02:52:24,080
no no i i don't uh i think it's
 

9939
02:52:24,080 --> 02:52:25,830
no no i i don't uh i think it's
beautiful i think our life is beautiful

9940
02:52:25,830 --> 02:52:25,840
beautiful i think our life is beautiful
 

9941
02:52:25,840 --> 02:52:28,710
beautiful i think our life is beautiful
and i think it was uh designed that by

9942
02:52:28,710 --> 02:52:28,720
and i think it was uh designed that by
 

9943
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:30,550
and i think it was uh designed that by
by design the scarcity of the whole

9944
02:52:30,550 --> 02:52:30,560
by design the scarcity of the whole
 

9945
02:52:30,560 --> 02:52:33,429
by design the scarcity of the whole
thing i think mortality as terrifying as

9946
02:52:33,429 --> 02:52:33,439
thing i think mortality as terrifying as
 

9947
02:52:33,439 --> 02:52:35,910
thing i think mortality as terrifying as
it is is fundamental to the whole

9948
02:52:35,910 --> 02:52:35,920
it is is fundamental to the whole
 

9949
02:52:35,920 --> 02:52:37,590
it is is fundamental to the whole
reason we enjoy everything no i think

9950
02:52:37,590 --> 02:52:37,600
reason we enjoy everything no i think
 

9951
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,190
reason we enjoy everything no i think
it's beautiful i just think that all of

9952
02:52:39,190 --> 02:52:39,200
it's beautiful i just think that all of
 

9953
02:52:39,200 --> 02:52:40,389
it's beautiful i just think that all of
us

9954
02:52:40,389 --> 02:52:40,399
us
 

9955
02:52:40,399 --> 02:52:43,269
us
um conscious beings in the grand scheme

9956
02:52:43,269 --> 02:52:43,279
um conscious beings in the grand scheme
 

9957
02:52:43,279 --> 02:52:45,510
um conscious beings in the grand scheme
of basically every at every scale will

9958
02:52:45,510 --> 02:52:45,520
of basically every at every scale will
 

9959
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:47,670
of basically every at every scale will
be completely forgotten well that's true

9960
02:52:47,670 --> 02:52:47,680
be completely forgotten well that's true
 

9961
02:52:47,680 --> 02:52:49,510
be completely forgotten well that's true
i think everything is transient and that

9962
02:52:49,510 --> 02:52:49,520
i think everything is transient and that
 

9963
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,110
i think everything is transient and that
would go back to maybe something more

9964
02:52:51,110 --> 02:52:51,120
would go back to maybe something more
 

9965
02:52:51,120 --> 02:52:51,830
would go back to maybe something more
like

9966
02:52:51,830 --> 02:52:51,840
like
 

9967
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:53,750
like
lao tzu the dao de jing or something

9968
02:52:53,750 --> 02:52:53,760
lao tzu the dao de jing or something
 

9969
02:52:53,760 --> 02:52:55,429
lao tzu the dao de jing or something
where it's like

9970
02:52:55,429 --> 02:52:55,439
where it's like
 

9971
02:52:55,439 --> 02:52:57,910
where it's like
yes there is nothing but change there is

9972
02:52:57,910 --> 02:52:57,920
yes there is nothing but change there is
 

9973
02:52:57,920 --> 02:52:59,910
yes there is nothing but change there is
nothing but emergence and dissolve and

9974
02:52:59,910 --> 02:52:59,920
nothing but emergence and dissolve and
 

9975
02:52:59,920 --> 02:53:02,070
nothing but emergence and dissolve and
that that's it but i just

9976
02:53:02,070 --> 02:53:02,080
that that's it but i just
 

9977
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:03,910
that that's it but i just
in this picture of this hierarchy that's

9978
02:53:03,910 --> 02:53:03,920
in this picture of this hierarchy that's
 

9979
02:53:03,920 --> 02:53:05,830
in this picture of this hierarchy that's
developed i don't mean to say that now

9980
02:53:05,830 --> 02:53:05,840
developed i don't mean to say that now
 

9981
02:53:05,840 --> 02:53:07,429
developed i don't mean to say that now
it gets to us and that's the pinnacle in

9982
02:53:07,429 --> 02:53:07,439
it gets to us and that's the pinnacle in
 

9983
02:53:07,439 --> 02:53:08,790
it gets to us and that's the pinnacle in
fact i think

9984
02:53:08,790 --> 02:53:08,800
fact i think
 

9985
02:53:08,800 --> 02:53:09,750
fact i think
the

9986
02:53:09,750 --> 02:53:09,760
the
 

9987
02:53:09,760 --> 02:53:12,469
the
at a high level the story i'm trying to

9988
02:53:12,469 --> 02:53:12,479
at a high level the story i'm trying to
 

9989
02:53:12,479 --> 02:53:14,389
at a high level the story i'm trying to
tease out in my research is about okay

9990
02:53:14,389 --> 02:53:14,399
tease out in my research is about okay
 

9991
02:53:14,399 --> 02:53:16,230
tease out in my research is about okay
well so then what's the next level of

9992
02:53:16,230 --> 02:53:16,240
well so then what's the next level of
 

9993
02:53:16,240 --> 02:53:19,190
well so then what's the next level of
hierarchy and if in if it's

9994
02:53:19,190 --> 02:53:19,200
hierarchy and if in if it's
 

9995
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:21,510
hierarchy and if in if it's
okay we're we're kind of pretty smart i

9996
02:53:21,510 --> 02:53:21,520
okay we're we're kind of pretty smart i
 

9997
02:53:21,520 --> 02:53:23,670
okay we're we're kind of pretty smart i
mean talking about people like lee small

9998
02:53:23,670 --> 02:53:23,680
mean talking about people like lee small
 

9999
02:53:23,680 --> 02:53:25,590
mean talking about people like lee small
and alan guth max tegmark okay we're

10000
02:53:25,590 --> 02:53:25,600
and alan guth max tegmark okay we're
 

10001
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:27,110
and alan guth max tegmark okay we're
really smart talking about me okay we're

10002
02:53:27,110 --> 02:53:27,120
really smart talking about me okay we're
 

10003
02:53:27,120 --> 02:53:29,429
really smart talking about me okay we're
kind of we're we can find our way to the

10004
02:53:29,429 --> 02:53:29,439
kind of we're we can find our way to the
 

10005
02:53:29,439 --> 02:53:31,830
kind of we're we can find our way to the
grocery store or whatever but sometimes

10006
02:53:31,830 --> 02:53:31,840
grocery store or whatever but sometimes
 

10007
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:33,670
grocery store or whatever but sometimes
but what's next you know i mean what if

10008
02:53:33,670 --> 02:53:33,680
but what's next you know i mean what if
 

10009
02:53:33,680 --> 02:53:35,429
but what's next you know i mean what if
what if there's another level of

10010
02:53:35,429 --> 02:53:35,439
what if there's another level of
 

10011
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:37,910
what if there's another level of
hierarchy that grows on top of us that

10012
02:53:37,910 --> 02:53:37,920
hierarchy that grows on top of us that
 

10013
02:53:37,920 --> 02:53:41,030
hierarchy that grows on top of us that
is even more profoundly capable and

10014
02:53:41,030 --> 02:53:41,040
is even more profoundly capable and
 

10015
02:53:41,040 --> 02:53:42,230
is even more profoundly capable and
i mean we've talked a lot about

10016
02:53:42,230 --> 02:53:42,240
i mean we've talked a lot about
 

10017
02:53:42,240 --> 02:53:44,950
i mean we've talked a lot about
superconducting sensors imagine these

10018
02:53:44,950 --> 02:53:44,960
superconducting sensors imagine these
 

10019
02:53:44,960 --> 02:53:48,150
superconducting sensors imagine these
uh cognitive systems far more capable

10020
02:53:48,150 --> 02:53:48,160
uh cognitive systems far more capable
 

10021
02:53:48,160 --> 02:53:50,309
uh cognitive systems far more capable
than us residing

10022
02:53:50,309 --> 02:53:50,319
than us residing
 

10023
02:53:50,319 --> 02:53:52,469

02:53:54,150 --> 02:53:54,160
of the surface of the earth where it's
 

10027
02:53:54,160 --> 02:53:55,830
of the surface of the earth where it's
much darker much colder much more

naturally suited to them and they have

10030
02:53:57,429 --> 02:53:57,439
naturally suited to them and they have
 

10031
02:53:57,439 --> 02:53:59,750
naturally suited to them and they have
these sensors that can detect single

02:54:05,110 --> 02:54:05,120
to all across the spectrum to gamma rays
 

10037
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:07,750

and just see the whole universe and they

10038
02:54:07,750 --> 02:54:07,760
and just see the whole universe and they
 

10039
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:10,389
and just see the whole universe and they
just live in space with these massive

10040
02:54:10,389 --> 02:54:10,399
just live in space with these massive
 

10041
02:54:10,399 --> 02:54:11,510
just live in space with these massive
um

10042
02:54:11,510 --> 02:54:11,520
um
 

10043
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:13,190
um
collection optics so that they what what

10044
02:54:13,190 --> 02:54:13,200
collection optics so that they what what
 

10045
02:54:13,200 --> 02:54:15,269
collection optics so that they what what
did they do they just look out and and

10046
02:54:15,269 --> 02:54:15,279
did they do they just look out and and
 

10047
02:54:15,279 --> 02:54:19,429
did they do they just look out and and
experience that that vast array of

10048
02:54:19,429 --> 02:54:19,439
experience that that vast array of
 

10049
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:20,790
experience that that vast array of
of what's

10050
02:54:20,790 --> 02:54:20,800
of what's
 

10051
02:54:20,800 --> 02:54:22,389
of what's
being developed

10052
02:54:22,389 --> 02:54:22,399
being developed
 

10053
02:54:22,399 --> 02:54:25,030
being developed
and if you're such a system

10054
02:54:25,030 --> 02:54:25,040
and if you're such a system
 

10055
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:27,910
and if you're such a system
presumably you would do some things for

10056
02:54:27,910 --> 02:54:27,920
presumably you would do some things for
 

10057
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:28,790
presumably you would do some things for
fun

10058
02:54:28,790 --> 02:54:28,800
fun
 

10059
02:54:28,800 --> 02:54:31,830
fun
and the kind of fun thing i would do

10060
02:54:31,830 --> 02:54:31,840
and the kind of fun thing i would do
 

10061
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:34,309
and the kind of fun thing i would do
somebody who likes video games is i

10062
02:54:34,309 --> 02:54:34,319
somebody who likes video games is i
 

10063
02:54:34,319 --> 02:54:37,910
somebody who likes video games is i
would create and maintain and observe

10064
02:54:37,910 --> 02:54:37,920
would create and maintain and observe
 

10065
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:41,269
would create and maintain and observe
something like earth

10066
02:54:41,269 --> 02:54:41,279

 

10067
02:54:41,279 --> 02:54:42,630

and

10068
02:54:42,630 --> 02:54:42,640
and
 

10069
02:54:42,640 --> 02:54:45,110
and
so in some sense we're like all what

10070
02:54:45,110 --> 02:54:45,120
so in some sense we're like all what
 

10071
02:54:45,120 --> 02:54:45,990
so in some sense we're like all what
players

10072
02:54:45,990 --> 02:54:46,000
players
 

10073
02:54:46,000 --> 02:54:49,750
players
on a stage for this uh superconducting

10074
02:54:49,750 --> 02:54:49,760
on a stage for this uh superconducting
 

10075
02:54:49,760 --> 02:54:51,190
on a stage for this uh superconducting
um

10076
02:54:51,190 --> 02:54:51,200
um
 

10077
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:52,230

computing system out there i mean all of

10080
02:54:54,710 --> 02:54:54,720
computing system out there i mean all of
 

10081
02:54:54,720 --> 02:54:57,190
computing system out there i mean all of
this is fascinating to think the the

10082
02:54:57,190 --> 02:54:57,200
this is fascinating to think the the
 

10083
02:54:57,200 --> 02:54:58,870
this is fascinating to think the the
fact that you're actually designing

10084
02:54:58,870 --> 02:54:58,880
fact that you're actually designing
 

10085
02:54:58,880 --> 02:55:00,309
fact that you're actually designing
systems here on earth that are trying to

10086
02:55:00,309 --> 02:55:00,319
systems here on earth that are trying to
 

10087
02:55:00,319 --> 02:55:02,150
systems here on earth that are trying to
push this technological at the very

10088
02:55:02,150 --> 02:55:02,160
push this technological at the very
 

10089
02:55:02,160 --> 02:55:05,030
push this technological at the very
cutting edge and also thinking about how

10090
02:55:05,030 --> 02:55:05,040
cutting edge and also thinking about how
 

10091
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:06,070
cutting edge and also thinking about how
does the

10092
02:55:06,070 --> 02:55:06,080
does the
 

10093
02:55:06,080 --> 02:55:09,750
does the
like the evolution of physical laws

10094
02:55:09,750 --> 02:55:09,760
like the evolution of physical laws
 

10095
02:55:09,760 --> 02:55:13,190
like the evolution of physical laws
lead us to the way we are

10096
02:55:13,190 --> 02:55:13,200
lead us to the way we are
 

10097
02:55:13,200 --> 02:55:14,950
lead us to the way we are
it's fascinating that that coupling is

10098
02:55:14,950 --> 02:55:14,960
it's fascinating that that coupling is
 

10099
02:55:14,960 --> 02:55:18,070
it's fascinating that that coupling is
fascinating it's like the ultimate

10100
02:55:18,070 --> 02:55:18,080
fascinating it's like the ultimate
 

10101
02:55:18,080 --> 02:55:20,710
fascinating it's like the ultimate
rigorous application of philosophy

10102
