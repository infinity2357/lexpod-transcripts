uh you know kicks in an instinct which

1054
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:32,880
uh you know kicks in an instinct which
 

1055
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,230
uh you know kicks in an instinct which
is acceptance

1056
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:34,240
is acceptance
 

1057
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,829
is acceptance
where you kind of i don't know it's a

1058
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:35,839
where you kind of i don't know it's a
 

1059
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,110
where you kind of i don't know it's a
chemical release or whatever i don't

1060
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:37,120
chemical release or whatever i don't
 

1061
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,389
chemical release or whatever i don't
know you know

1062
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
know you know
 

1063
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,310
know you know
we're all we're robots basically so some

1064
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
we're all we're robots basically so some
 

1065
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,670
we're all we're robots basically so some
sort of chemical is released that

1066
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:41,680
sort of chemical is released that
 

1067
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,710
sort of chemical is released that
protects you but

1068
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:42,720
protects you but
 

1069
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,710
protects you but
there is an acceptance i don't know how

1070
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
there is an acceptance i don't know how
 

1071
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,910
there is an acceptance i don't know how
much uh

1072
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:45,920
much uh
 

1073
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,590
much uh
of it was a conscious choice probably

1074
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:47,600
of it was a conscious choice probably
 

1075
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,350
of it was a conscious choice probably
very little um

1076
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:49,360
very little um
 

1077
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,790
very little um
and that's the point i'm making is it's

1078
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:50,800
and that's the point i'm making is it's
 

1079
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,069
and that's the point i'm making is it's
instinctual we don't really have a

1080
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
instinctual we don't really have a
 

1081
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,710
instinctual we don't really have a
choice

1082
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:52,720
choice
 

1083
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,470
choice
in fearing death otherwise there would

1084
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:54,480
in fearing death otherwise there would
 

1085
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,389
in fearing death otherwise there would
be no progression we wouldn't

1086
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:56,399
be no progression we wouldn't
 

1087
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,509
be no progression we wouldn't
all life seems to want to survive

1089
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,710

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:21,600
like a hundred years from now
 

1503
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,310
like a hundred years from now
we'll look back at this time as like one

1504
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,320
we'll look back at this time as like one
 

1505
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,590
we'll look back at this time as like one
of the great

1506
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:25,600

a lot because i think about
robotics i think about creating

robotics i think about creating
 

1525
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,029
robotics i think about creating
artificial

so like the dick the as far as i

2222
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
so like the dick the as far as i
 

2223
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:58,790
so like the dick the as far as i
understand

2224
00:34:58,790 --> 00:34:58,800
understand
 

2225
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,349
understand
the signs of an evil dictator weren't

2226
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
the signs of an evil dictator weren't
 

2227
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,030

exactly there
 

2229
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,109
exactly there
so again there's i don't know if power

2230
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:05,119
so again there's i don't know if power
 

2231
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,190
so again there's i don't know if power
revealed the power corrupted

2232
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,200
revealed the power corrupted
 

2233
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,390
revealed the power corrupted

or that could have been the initial
 

2235
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,630
or that could have been the initial
subterfuge to kind of get everybody

the same thing they only show when the
 

2823
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,349
the same thing they only show when the
cheetah

2824
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:19,359
cheetah
 

2825
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,270
cheetah
gets it because that's that's the

2826
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
gets it because that's that's the
 

2827
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,950

exciting part but what most people don't

2828
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:22,960
exciting part but what most people don't
 

2829
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:23,270
exciting part but what most people don't
know

2830
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
know
 

2831
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,069
know
is that those predators strike out

2832
00:44:26,069 --> 00:44:26,079
is that those predators strike out
 

2833
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,030
is that those predators strike out
almost always

2834
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:27,040
almost always
 

2835
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,990
almost always
a majority of the time the prey wins and

2836
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:30,000
a majority of the time the prey wins and
 

2837
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,390
a majority of the time the prey wins and
so

2838
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:30,400
so
 

2839
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,230
so
if you saw that and put in context you

2840
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:32,240
if you saw that and put in context you
 

2841
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,390
if you saw that and put in context you
might not hate it as much

2842
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:34,400
might not hate it as much
 

2843
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,309
might not hate it as much
when the predator actually gets the

2844
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:36,319
when the predator actually gets the
 

2845
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,589
when the predator actually gets the
little fawn or whatever

2846
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:37,599
little fawn or whatever
 

2847
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,589
little fawn or whatever
because it's so many fawns got away it's

2848
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
because it's so many fawns got away it's

it was the first time i think it was the
 

3269
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,390
it was the first time i think it was the
first time the germans

3270
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:14,400
first time the germans
 

3271

wanted to
 

3275
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:22,069
wanted to
early in the war which is a little like

3276
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:22,079
early in the war which is a little like
 

3277
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,990
early in the war which is a little like
psychologically the impact of that i

3278
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
psychologically the impact of that i
 

3279
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,390
psychologically the impact of that i
think is immeasurable

3280
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
think is immeasurable
 

3281
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,630
think is immeasurable
and also a lot of people argue from a

3282
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:28,640
and also a lot of people argue from a
 

3283
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:29,510
and also a lot of people argue from a
military

3284
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:29,520
military
 

3285
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,710
military
strategy perspective that the

3286
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
strategy perspective that the
 

3287
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,069
strategy perspective that the
just like you said it was an aerial

3288
00:51:34,069 --> 00:51:34,079
just like you said it was an aerial
 

3289
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,829
just like you said it was an aerial
attack and that

3290
00:51:35,829 --> 00:51:35,839
attack and that
 

3291
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,030
attack and that
hitler didn't think that that that

3292
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:39,040
hitler didn't think that that that
 

3293
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,710
hitler didn't think that that that
kind of attack would then be useful for

3294
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:40,720
kind of attack would then be useful for
 

3295
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,069
kind of attack would then be useful for
the rest of the war

3296
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:42,079
the rest of the war
 

3297
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,390
the rest of the war
so that's that's a really part where

3298
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
so that's that's a really part where
 

3299
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,230
so that's that's a really part where
whereas it might have been very

3300
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:46,240
whereas it might have been very
 

3301
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,230
whereas it might have been very
useful so it's uh it's really

3302
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
useful so it's uh it's really
 

3303
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:50,230
useful so it's uh it's really
interesting how these little battles can

3304
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:50,240
interesting how these little battles can
 

3305
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,309
interesting how these little battles can
steer the directions of war of course

and we made so much progress i guess
 

3621
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,710
and we made so much progress i guess
in the past couple of centuries the

3622

3627
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,630
but do you think also that it's that
effect that we would

3628
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
effect that we would
 

3629
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,470

yeah that just went it's fascinating
 

3825
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,510
yeah that just went it's fascinating
like when you hear someone sing or

3826
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
like when you hear someone sing or

3829
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:51,349
when a jazz band hits a rhythm or even
when i'm on stage and i just

3830
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:51,359
when i'm on stage and i just
 

3831
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,349
when i'm on stage and i just
catch a rhythm it's like dude i didn't

3832
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:53,359
catch a rhythm it's like dude i didn't
 

3833
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,630
catch a rhythm it's like dude i didn't
make a choice there i don't know what

3834
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:54,640
make a choice there i don't know what
 

3835
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:56,710
make a choice there i don't know what
that is i don't know how to explain it

3836
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:56,720
that is i don't know how to explain it
 

3837
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:59,430
that is i don't know how to explain it
but it comes from somewhere else and uh

3838
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
but it comes from somewhere else and uh
 

3839
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,390
but it comes from somewhere else and uh
i don't know what it is

01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
i don't know what it is
 

3841
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,109
i don't know what it is
it's beyond my comprehension but with

3842
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
it's beyond my comprehension but with
 

3843
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:03,990
it's beyond my comprehension but with
chris

3844
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:04,000
chris
 

3845
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,230
chris
uh there was this magical chemistry that

3846
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:06,240
uh there was this magical chemistry that
 

3847
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,829
uh there was this magical chemistry that
uh you know i have chemistry with a lot

3848
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:07,839
uh you know i have chemistry with a lot
 

3849
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,710
uh you know i have chemistry with a lot
of people

3850
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:08,720
of people
 

3851
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,789
of people
and uh it can be funny and i feel zero

3852
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:10,799
and uh it can be funny and i feel zero
 

3853
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:12,789
and uh it can be funny and i feel zero
chemistry here this is great

3854
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:12,799
chemistry here this is great
 

3855
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:14,150
chemistry here this is great
yeah it's a little bit more intelligent

3856
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:14,160
yeah it's a little bit more intelligent
 

3857
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,990
yeah it's a little bit more intelligent
than what me and chris did

3858
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,000
than what me and chris did
 

3859
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,789
than what me and chris did
uh but you know uh me and chris uh i

3860
01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:18,799
uh but you know uh me and chris uh i
 

3861
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:19,670
uh but you know uh me and chris uh i
think we connected

3862
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
think we connected
 

3863
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,109
think we connected
in on the funny bone like i he i found

3864
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119
in on the funny bone like i he i found
 

3865
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:23,750
in on the funny bone like i he i found
him so

3866
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:23,760
him so
 

3867
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,630
him so
funny and we found the same things funny

3868
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:26,640
funny and we found the same things funny
 

3869
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,589
funny and we found the same things funny
and from that

3870
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
and from that
 

3871
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,069
and from that
these organic expressions came from the

3872
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
these organic expressions came from the
 

3873
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,309
these organic expressions came from the
some part of our brains

3874
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
some part of our brains
 

3875
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,309
some part of our brains
that was created from this chemistry and

3876
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
that was created from this chemistry and
 

3877
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,230
that was created from this chemistry and
yeah we just developed this in

3878
01:00:36,230 --> 01:00:36,240
yeah we just developed this in
 

3879
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:37,670
yeah we just developed this in
language in this cult following and

3880
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
language in this cult following and
 

3881
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,270
language in this cult following and
people were really upset

3882
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:39,280
people were really upset
 

3883
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,270
people were really upset
when we ended but it was the right thing

3884
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:41,280
when we ended but it was the right thing
 

3885
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,630
when we ended but it was the right thing
to end because

3886
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
to end because
 

3887
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,069
to end because
like all things that end it was kind of

3888
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
like all things that end it was kind of
 

3889
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,910
like all things that end it was kind of
done a few episodes even before we

3890
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
done a few episodes even before we
 

3891
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:46,789
done a few episodes even before we
finished and

3892
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
finished and
 

3893
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:48,710
finished and
i think we pulled the plug before it

3894
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:48,720
i think we pulled the plug before it
 

3895
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,230
i think we pulled the plug before it
started rolling downhill

3896
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
started rolling downhill
 

3897
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,030

i just found myself just like staring it
 

3949
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,710
i just found myself just like staring it
at you uh ranting for same with tim

3950
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:40,720
at you uh ranting for same with tim
 

3951
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:42,309

those rants are the genius of just

3954
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:44,160
those rants are the genius of just
 

3955
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:45,990
those rants are the genius of just
one thing after the other but definitely

3956
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:46,000
one thing after the other but definitely
 

3957
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,430
one thing after the other but definitely
the chemistry

3958
01:01:47,430 --> 01:01:47,440
the chemistry
 

3959
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,069
the chemistry
almost as a study i remember the reason

3960
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:50,079
almost as a study i remember the reason
 

3961
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,670
almost as a study i remember the reason
i first started listening to it i was

3962
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
i first started listening to it i was
 

3963
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,430
i first started listening to it i was
trying to get

3964
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
trying to get
 

3965
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,990
trying to get
an a perspective on certain historical

3966
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:56,000
an a perspective on certain historical
 

3967
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,349
an a perspective on certain historical
moments

3968
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
moments
 

3969
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,349
moments
like it was interesting i tuned in to

3970
01:01:59,349 --> 01:01:59,359
like it was interesting i tuned in to
 

3971
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:01,270
like it was interesting i tuned in to
learn history

3972
01:02:01,270 --> 01:02:01,280
learn history
 

3973
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,510
learn history
yeah i came for the history and like

3974
01:02:03,510 --> 01:02:03,520
yeah i came for the history and like
 

3975
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,710
yeah i came for the history and like
stayed for the

3976
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:04,720
stayed for the
 

3977
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:08,549
stayed for the
the chaos and crack open and clean out

3978
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:08,559
the chaos and crack open and clean out
 

3979
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:11,109
the chaos and crack open and clean out
and yeah this it was almost i listened

3980
01:02:11,109 --> 01:02:11,119
and yeah this it was almost i listened
 

3981
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:12,150
and yeah this it was almost i listened
to rogan

3982
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:12,160
to rogan
 

3983
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:15,349
to rogan
like this sometimes i'll i'll re-listen

3984
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:15,359

conspiratorial
 

5137
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:30,390

um nobody cares that much um but they're

5138
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400

 

5139
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,629

but then you know what happens is you
 

5141
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:34,950
but then you know what happens is you
find out this one or this two

5142

find out this one or this two
 

5143
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:36,550
find out this one or this two
uh and you start questioning everything

5144
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:36,560
uh and you start questioning everything
 

5145
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:37,910
uh and you start questioning everything
and you start questioning everything man

5159
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,310
um you know there's some strange things
from a scientific perspective i'm no

5160
01:20:52,310 --> 01:20:52,320
from a scientific perspective i'm no
 

5161
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,510
from a scientific perspective i'm no
scientist but it's like

5162
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:53,520
scientist but it's like
 

5163
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,390
scientist but it's like
you know yeah three steel framed uh

5164
01:20:56,390 --> 01:20:56,400
you know yeah three steel framed uh
 

5165
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,070
you know yeah three steel framed uh
skyscrapers falling

skyscrapers falling
 

5167
01:20:58,080 --> 01:21:00,950
skyscrapers falling
on the same day in the same way a lot of

5168
01:21:00,950 --> 01:21:00,960
on the same day in the same way a lot of
 

5169
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,430
on the same day in the same way a lot of
people

5170
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:01,440
people
 

5171
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:03,430

it's like yeah but that's not where they

5174
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,400
it's like yeah but that's not where they
 

5175
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,390
it's like yeah but that's not where they
fell they fell because of fires

5176
01:21:06,390 --> 01:21:06,400
fell they fell because of fires
 

5177
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:09,990
fell they fell because of fires
and usually not usually

5178
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
and usually not usually
 

5179
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:13,350
and usually not usually
all the time except for three times and

5180
01:21:13,350 --> 01:21:13,360
all the time except for three times and
 

5181
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:14,950
all the time except for three times and
there was buildings that have burned for

5182
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:14,960
there was buildings that have burned for
 

5183
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,870
there was buildings that have burned for
longer than that um

5184
01:21:16,870 --> 01:21:16,880
longer than that um
 

5185
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:18,390
longer than that um
and there might be good explanations but

5186

just a neat the physical i mean you're a
 

5197
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,229
just a neat the physical i mean you're a
scientist

5198
01:21:28,229 --> 01:21:28,239
scientist
 

5199
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:30,390

5201
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:31,990
is that well i don't i i has their
resistance from the steel and so

5202
01:21:31,990 --> 01:21:32,000
resistance from the steel and so
 

5203
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:33,910
resistance from the steel and so
no is it in the free fall not all
