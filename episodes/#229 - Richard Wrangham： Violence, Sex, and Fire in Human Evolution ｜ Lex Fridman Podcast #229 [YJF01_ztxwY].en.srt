is that there are two kinds of violence

is that there are two kinds of violence
 

61
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,190
is that there are two kinds of violence
one stems from proactive aggression and

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:13,200
one stems from proactive aggression and
 

63
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,429
one stems from proactive aggression and
the other stems from reactive aggression

64
00:01:15,429 --> 00:01:15,439
the other stems from reactive aggression
 

65
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,870
the other stems from reactive aggression
proactive aggression is planned

impulsive defensive it's reactive

70
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:21,600
impulsive defensive it's reactive
 

71
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,030
impulsive defensive it's reactive
because

72
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,040
because
 

73
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,190
because
it takes place in

74
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,200
it takes place in
 

75
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,749
it takes place in
seconds after the threat

76
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:27,759
seconds after the threat
 

77
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,429
seconds after the threat
and the thing that is really striking

78
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:29,439
and the thing that is really striking
 

79
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,990
and the thing that is really striking
about humans compared to

80
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,000
about humans compared to
 

81
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,749
about humans compared to
our close relatives

82
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:33,759
our close relatives
 

83
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,149
our close relatives
is the great reduction in the degree of

is the great reduction in the degree of
 

85
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,030
is the great reduction in the degree of
of reactive aggression so we are far

86
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:41,040
of reactive aggression so we are far
 

87
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,109

centuries uh aristotle drew attention to
 

175
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,509
centuries uh aristotle drew attention to
the fact that we behave in many ways

176
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:17,519
the fact that we behave in many ways
 

177
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,350
the fact that we behave in many ways
like domesticated animals because we're

like domesticated animals because we're
 

179
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,190

and
 

195
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,030
and
that is all proactive violence you know

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,040
that is all proactive violence you know
 

197

that is all proactive violence you know
all of that is

all of that is
 

199
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,789
all of that is
is gangs of people

200
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:40,799
is gangs of people
 

201
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,149
is gangs of people
uh

00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
kills and then get out of there
 

215
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,710

in other words not

way that arm is trying to work

220
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
way that arm is trying to work
 

221
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,470
way that arm is trying to work
and um

222
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:00,480
and um
 

223
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,589
and um
and there

224
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:01,599
and there
 

225
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,509
and there
it turns out that uh humans and

226
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:03,519
it turns out that uh humans and
 

227
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,990
it turns out that uh humans and
chimpanzees are in a very similar kind

228
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,000
chimpanzees are in a very similar kind
 

229
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,630
chimpanzees are in a very similar kind
of state that's to say if you look at

230
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
of state that's to say if you look at
 

231
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,509
of state that's to say if you look at
the

232
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:09,519
the
 

233
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,390
the
the rate of death from chimpanzees

234
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
the rate of death from chimpanzees
 

235
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,309
the rate of death from chimpanzees
conducting proactive coalitionary

236
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:14,319
conducting proactive coalitionary
 

237
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,589
conducting proactive coalitionary
violence

238
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:15,599
violence
 

239
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,390
violence
it's very similar in many ways to what

240
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
it's very similar in many ways to what
 

241
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,229
it's very similar in many ways to what
you see in humans

242
00:04:20,229 --> 00:04:20,239
you see in humans
 

243
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,310
you see in humans
so when not down regulated with

244
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:22,320
so when not down regulated with
 

245
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,629
so when not down regulated with
proactive violence it's just this

246
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
proactive violence it's just this
 

247
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,550
proactive violence it's just this
reactive violence that is

248
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:26,560
reactive violence that is
 

249
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,950
reactive violence that is
strikingly reduced in humans

250
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
strikingly reduced in humans
 

251
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,749
strikingly reduced in humans
so chimpanzees also practice kind of

252
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:31,759
so chimpanzees also practice kind of
 

253
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,909
so chimpanzees also practice kind of
tribal warfare

254
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:33,919
tribal warfare
 

255
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,909
tribal warfare
indeed they do yeah

256
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
indeed they do yeah
 

257
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,870
indeed they do yeah
so this was discovered first in 1974 it

258
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
so this was discovered first in 1974 it
 

259
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,830
so this was discovered first in 1974 it
was observed first 974.

260
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
was observed first 974.
 

261
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,230
was observed first 974.
which was about the time that

262
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,240
which was about the time that
 

263
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,110
which was about the time that
um

264
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:45,120
um
 

265
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,990
um
the

266
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:46,000
the

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,189
the
first

268
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:47,199

272
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:51,040
by jane goodall
 

273
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,270
by jane goodall
had been going for

274
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
had been going for
 

275
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,430
had been going for
something like five years

276
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:55,440
something like five years
 

277
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,790
something like five years
during

278
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:56,800
during
 

279
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,469
during
of

280
00:04:58,469 --> 00:04:58,479
of
 

281
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,469
of
the chimpanzees being observed wherever

282
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:00,479
the chimpanzees being observed wherever
 

283
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,870
the chimpanzees being observed wherever
they went

284
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
they went
 

285
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,430
they went
until then they'd been observed

286
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
until then they'd been observed
 

287
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,749
until then they'd been observed
at a feeding station where jane was

288
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:07,759
at a feeding station where jane was
 

289
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,070
at a feeding station where jane was
luring them into

290
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,080
luring them into
 

291
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,830
luring them into
to be observed by seeing bananas which

292
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
to be observed by seeing bananas which
 

293
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,790
to be observed by seeing bananas which
is great

294
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:12,800
is great
 

295
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,110
is great
she learned a lot but she didn't learn

296
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
she learned a lot but she didn't learn
 

297
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,550
she learned a lot but she didn't learn
what was happening at the edges of their

298
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:16,560
what was happening at the edges of their
 

299
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,749
what was happening at the edges of their
ranges

300
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:17,759
ranges
 

301
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,390
ranges
so five years later

302
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:20,400
so five years later
 

303
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,590
so five years later
it became

304
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
it became
 

305
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,590
it became
very obvious that there was hostile

306
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:23,600
very obvious that there was hostile
 

307
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,510
very obvious that there was hostile
relationships between groups

308
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:25,520
relationships between groups
 

309
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,990
relationships between groups
and those hostile relationships

310
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,000
and those hostile relationships
 

311
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,350
and those hostile relationships
sometimes

312
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:29,360
sometimes
 

313
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,909
sometimes
take the form of the kind of hostile

314
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
take the form of the kind of hostile
 

315
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,189
take the form of the kind of hostile
relationships that you see in many

316
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:33,199
relationships that you see in many
 

317
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,790
relationships that you see in many
animals which is a bunch of

318
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:36,800
animals which is a bunch of
 

319
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,870
animals which is a bunch of
chimps in this case uh

320
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
chimps in this case uh
 

321
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,230
chimps in this case uh
shouting uh at a bunch of other chimps

322
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
shouting uh at a bunch of other chimps
 

323
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,790
shouting uh at a bunch of other chimps
uh on their borders

324
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
uh on their borders
 

325
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,350
uh on their borders
but dramatically in addition to that

326
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:47,360
but dramatically in addition to that
 

327
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,189
but dramatically in addition to that
there is a second kind of interaction

328
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:49,199
there is a second kind of interaction
 

329
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,790
there is a second kind of interaction
and that is

330
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:50,800
and that is
 

331
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,590
and that is
when

332
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
when
 

333
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,909
when
a a party of chimpanzees

334
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
a a party of chimpanzees
 

335
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,430
a a party of chimpanzees
makes a

336
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
makes a
 

337
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,469
makes a
deliberate venture uh to the edge of

338
00:06:00,469 --> 00:06:00,479
deliberate venture uh to the edge of
 

339
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,230
deliberate venture uh to the edge of
their territory

340
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:02,240
their territory
 

341
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,990
their territory
silently

00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:04,000
silently
 

343
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,430
silently
and then

344
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:05,440
and then
 

345
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,990
and then
search for members of neighboring groups

346
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
search for members of neighboring groups
 

347
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,150
search for members of neighboring groups
and what they're searching for is a lone

348
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:10,160
and what they're searching for is a lone

individual
so i've been with chimps when they've

so i've been with chimps when they've
heard a lone individual under these

354
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:16,400
heard a lone individual under these
 

355
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,670
heard a lone individual under these
circumstances

356
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
circumstances
 

357
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,390

they touch each other and look at each
 

361
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,950
they touch each other and look at each
other and then charge forward

other and then charge forward
 

363
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,430
other and then charge forward
very excited

364
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:27,440
very excited
 

365
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,790
very excited
and then

366
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
and then
 

367
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,710
and then
while they're charging

368
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:30,720
while they're charging
 

369
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,629
while they're charging
all of a sudden

370
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:32,639
all of a sudden
 

371
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,430
all of a sudden
the place where they heard a lone call

372
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:35,440
the place where they heard a lone call
 

373
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,590
the place where they heard a lone call
erupts with a volley of calls it was

374
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:37,600
erupts with a volley of calls it was
 

375
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,710
erupts with a volley of calls it was
just one calling out of a larger party

376
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:40,720
just one calling out of a larger party
 

377
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,670
just one calling out of a larger party
and our chimps put on the brakes and

378
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:43,680
and our chimps put on the brakes and
 

379
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,590
and our chimps put on the brakes and
scoot back for safety into their own

380
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
scoot back for safety into their own
 

381
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,550
scoot back for safety into their own
territory but if in fact they do find a

382
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
territory but if in fact they do find a
 

383
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,029
territory but if in fact they do find a
lone individual and they they can sneak

384
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:51,039
lone individual and they they can sneak
 

385
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,390
lone individual and they they can sneak
up to them

386
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:52,400
up to them
 

387
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,790
up to them
then they make a deliberate attack uh

388
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:54,800
then they make a deliberate attack uh
 

389
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,150
then they make a deliberate attack uh
they're hunting

390
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:56,160
they're hunting
 

391
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,230
they're hunting
they're stalking and hunting and and

392
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
they're stalking and hunting and and
 

393
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,790
they're stalking and hunting and and
then they impose terrible damage which

394
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
then they impose terrible damage which
 

395
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,870
then they impose terrible damage which
typically ends in a kill straight away

396
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
typically ends in a kill straight away
 

397
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,430
typically ends in a kill straight away
but it might end up with the victim

398
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:07,440

 

399
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,909

so damaged that they'll crawl away and

400
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:09,919
so damaged that they'll crawl away and
 

401
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,430
so damaged that they'll crawl away and
die a few days

402
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
die a few days
 

403
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,270
die a few days
or hours later

404
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,280
or hours later
 

405
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,189
or hours later
so that was a very dramatic discovery

406
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:15,199
so that was a very dramatic discovery
 

407
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,790
so that was a very dramatic discovery
because it really

408
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:16,800
because it really
 

409
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,309
because it really
made people

410
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
made people
 

411
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,029
made people
realize for the first time that conrad

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
bunch of animals that deliberately kill
 

425

overwhelmingly what happens is that if
 

489
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,310
overwhelmingly what happens is that if
they discover that there's several

individuals on the other side then both
 

493
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,070

and then you can leave it to the
 

643
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,949

what it means
 

647
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,030
what it means
so what is the process of observation

648
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
so what is the process of observation
 

649
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,030
so what is the process of observation
like this

650
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,040
like this
 

651
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,670
like this
like observing the personality but also

652
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:39,680
like observing the personality but also
 

653
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,509
like observing the personality but also

that's not projecting your beliefs about

which is probably really tempting
 

663
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,829
which is probably really tempting
to project so your understanding of the

to project so your understanding of the

the chimp world
 

671
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,870
the chimp world
yes i mean it's particularly difficult

672
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
yes i mean it's particularly difficult
 

673
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,310
yes i mean it's particularly difficult
with chimps because chimps are so

with chimps because chimps are so

00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:13,279
the process involves
 

685
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,670
the process involves
making very clear definitions of of what

686
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:15,680
making very clear definitions of of what
 

687
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,910
making very clear definitions of of what
a behavior is

688
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:17,920
a behavior is
 

689
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,310
a behavior is
you know aggression

690
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
you know aggression
 

691
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,030
you know aggression
can be defined in terms of

692
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
can be defined in terms of
 

693
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,629
can be defined in terms of
a forceful hit a byte and so on

694
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:26,639
a forceful hit a byte and so on
 

695
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,030
a forceful hit a byte and so on
and uh writing down every time these

696
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,040
and uh writing down every time these
 

697
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,230
and uh writing down every time these
things happen

698
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
things happen
 

699
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,069
things happen
and then slowly totting up the numbers

700
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:32,079
and then slowly totting up the numbers
 

701
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,310
and then slowly totting up the numbers
of times that they happen uh you know

702
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
of times that they happen uh you know
 

703
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,710
of times that they happen uh you know
from individual a towards individuals b

704
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
from individual a towards individuals b
 

705
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,949
from individual a towards individuals b
c d and e

706
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:38,959
c d and e
 

707
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,110
c d and e
so that you build up a very concrete

708
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:41,120
so that you build up a very concrete
 

709
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,350
so that you build up a very concrete
picture rather than interpreting at any

710
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
picture rather than interpreting at any
 

711
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,269
picture rather than interpreting at any
point and stopping and saying well you

712
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:45,279
point and stopping and saying well you
 

713
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,310
point and stopping and saying well you
know they seem to be rather aggressive

714
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:48,320
know they seem to be rather aggressive
 

715
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,550
know they seem to be rather aggressive
so the

716
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:50,560
so the
 

717
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,550
so the
sort of formal system is that you build

718
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:52,560
sort of formal system is that you build
 

719
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,790
sort of formal system is that you build
up a pattern of the relationships based

720
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
up a pattern of the relationships based
 

721
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,069
up a pattern of the relationships based
on

722
00:12:56,069 --> 00:12:56,079
on
 

723
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,550
on
a description of the different types of

724
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
a description of the different types of
 

725
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,629
a description of the different types of
interactions the aggressive and the

726
00:13:00,629 --> 00:13:00,639
interactions the aggressive and the
 

727
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,310
interactions the aggressive and the
friendly interactions

728
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:02,320
friendly interactions
 

729
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,269
friendly interactions
um and all of these are defined in

730
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
um and all of these are defined in
 

731
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,590
um and all of these are defined in
concrete

732
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
concrete
 

733
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,310
concrete
and

734
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:08,320
and
 

735
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,790
and
so that from that you extract a pattern

736
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
so that from that you extract a pattern
 

737
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,230
so that from that you extract a pattern
of relationships

738
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
of relationships
 

739
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,590
of relationships
and the relationships uh can be defined

740
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
and the relationships uh can be defined
 

741
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,470
and the relationships uh can be defined
as

742
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:18,480

 

743
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,670

relatively friendly relatively uh

744
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:21,680
relatively friendly relatively uh
 

745
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,470
relatively friendly relatively uh
aggressive competitive uh based on the

746
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,480
aggressive competitive uh based on the
 

747
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,350
aggressive competitive uh based on the
frequency of these types of interactions

748
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
frequency of these types of interactions
 

749
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,670
frequency of these types of interactions
and so one can talk in terms of

750
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:29,680
and so one can talk in terms of
 

751
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,990
and so one can talk in terms of
uh individuals having

752
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
uh individuals having
 

753
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,310
uh individuals having
a relationship which uh on the scores of

754
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:34,320
a relationship which uh on the scores of
 

755
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,829
a relationship which uh on the scores of
friendliness is

756
00:13:35,829 --> 00:13:35,839
friendliness is
 

757
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,189
friendliness is
two standard deviations outside the mean

758
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:39,199
two standard deviations outside the mean
 

759
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,069
two standard deviations outside the mean
i mean

760
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
i mean
 

761
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,790
i mean
you know it's in which direction sorry

762
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
you know it's in which direction sorry
 

763
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,509
you know it's in which direction sorry
uh in both directions

764
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,519
uh in both directions
 

765
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,269
uh in both directions
well i mean you know there will be

766
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:47,279
well i mean you know there will be
 

767
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,189
well i mean you know there will be
obviously the friendly ones would be the

768
00:13:49,189 --> 00:13:49,199
obviously the friendly ones would be the
 

769
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,910
obviously the friendly ones would be the
ones who have exceptionally high rates

770
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
ones who have exceptionally high rates
 

771
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,310
ones who have exceptionally high rates
of uh spending time close to each other

772
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
of uh spending time close to each other
 

773
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,550
of uh spending time close to each other
of touching each other in a gentle way

774
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:56,560
of touching each other in a gentle way
 

775
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,030
of touching each other in a gentle way
of grooming each other

776
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,040
of grooming each other
 

777
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,949
of grooming each other
and by the way finding that those things

778
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
and by the way finding that those things
 

779
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,269
and by the way finding that those things
are correlated with each other

780
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:03,279
are correlated with each other
 

781
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,069
are correlated with each other
so

782
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:04,079
so
 

783
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,150
so
it's possible to define

784
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
it's possible to define
 

785
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,629
it's possible to define
a friendship with a capital f in a very

786
00:14:08,629 --> 00:14:08,639
a friendship with a capital f in a very
 

787
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,150
a friendship with a capital f in a very
systematic way and and to compare that

788
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
systematic way and and to compare that
 

789
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,670
systematic way and and to compare that
uh between

790
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:13,680
uh between
 

791
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,710
uh between
uh individuals but also between

792
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:16,720
uh individuals but also between
 

793
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,629
uh individuals but also between
communities of chimpanzees

794
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
communities of chimpanzees
 

795
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,949
communities of chimpanzees
and between different species

796
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
and between different species
 

797
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,470
and between different species
so that you know we can say that in some

798
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
so that you know we can say that in some
 

799
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,470
so that you know we can say that in some
species individuals have friends and

800
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:24,480
species individuals have friends and
 

801
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,710
species individuals have friends and
others they don't at all

802
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
others they don't at all
 

803
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,470
others they don't at all
what about just because there's

804
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:28,480
what about just because there's
 

805
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,230
what about just because there's
different personalities and because

806
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:30,240
different personalities and because
 

807
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,389
different personalities and because
they're so fascinating what about sort

808
00:14:32,389 --> 00:14:32,399
they're so fascinating what about sort
 

809
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,389
they're so fascinating what about sort
of falling in love or

810
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:34,399
of falling in love or
 

811
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,110
of falling in love or
forming friendships with chimps you know

812
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:37,120
forming friendships with chimps you know
 

813
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,629
forming friendships with chimps you know
like really

814

00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:47,120
play because you're tracking these
 

821
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,590

00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,240
especially in those days for jane she's
 

829
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,269
especially in those days for jane she's
alone

observing it he gets lonely as a human i

832
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:02,000
observing it he gets lonely as a human i
 

833
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,629
observing it he gets lonely as a human i
mean probably deeply lonely as a human

834
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:04,639
mean probably deeply lonely as a human
 

835
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,310
mean probably deeply lonely as a human
being observe these other intelligent

species
 

839
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,949
species
it's a very reasonable question and of

840
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:08,959
it's a very reasonable question and of
 

841
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,550
it's a very reasonable question and of
course jane in those early years i think

842
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:12,560
course jane in those early years i think
 

843
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,110
course jane in those early years i think
she's willing now to talk about the fact

844
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:15,120
she's willing now to talk about the fact
 

845
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:15,910
she's willing now to talk about the fact
that

846
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
that
 

847
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,790
that
uh she regrets to some extent how close

848
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:18,800
uh she regrets to some extent how close
 

849
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,470
uh she regrets to some extent how close
she became

850
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:20,480
she became
 

851
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,110
she became
um and the problem is not just from the

852
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:23,120

um some chimps are aggressive to people
 

903
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,550
um some chimps are aggressive to people
um and others are friendly

um and others are friendly
 

905

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:18,240
and the ones that are friendly tend to
 

907
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,030
and the ones that are friendly tend to
be rather sympathetic characters because

908
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:21,040
be rather sympathetic characters because
 

909
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,430
be rather sympathetic characters because
they might be ones who are having

they might be ones who are having
 

911
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,910
they might be ones who are having
problems in their own society

912
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:25,920
problems in their own society
 

913
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,030
problems in their own society
you know so jomio in gombe used to uh

914
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:29,040
you know so jomio in gombe used to uh
 

915
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,110
you know so jomio in gombe used to uh
come and sit next to me quite often

916
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,120
come and sit next to me quite often
 

917
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,550
come and sit next to me quite often
um and

918
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
um and
 

919
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,389
um and
he was having a hard time making it in

920
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
he was having a hard time making it in
 

921
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,069
he was having a hard time making it in
that society you know which i can

922
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
that society you know which i can
 

923
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,910
that society you know which i can
describe to you in terms of the number

924
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:37,920
describe to you in terms of the number
 

925
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,350
describe to you in terms of the number
of aggressive interactions if you want

926
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
of aggressive interactions if you want
 

927
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,310
of aggressive interactions if you want
you know but

928
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,320
you know but
 

929
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,189
you know but
um just to be informed about it

930
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:43,199
um just to be informed about it
 

931
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:44,550
um just to be informed about it
so

932
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:44,560
so
 

933
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,189
so
all of this is a temptation to be very

934
00:16:47,189 --> 00:16:47,199
all of this is a temptation to be very
 

935
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,030
all of this is a temptation to be very
firmly resisted

936
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
firmly resisted
 

937
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,910
firmly resisted
and

938
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:49,920
and
 

939
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,350
and
in the community that i've been working

940
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
in the community that i've been working
 

941
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,430
in the community that i've been working
with in uganda for the last 30 years we

942
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
with in uganda for the last 30 years we
 

943
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,389
with in uganda for the last 30 years we
try

944
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:54,399
try
 

945
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,470
try
extremely hard to impress on all of the

946
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:56,480
extremely hard to impress on all of the
 

947
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,389
extremely hard to impress on all of the
research students who come with us that

948
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:58,399
research students who come with us that
 

949
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,269
research students who come with us that
it is absolutely vital that you do not

950
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:01,279
it is absolutely vital that you do not
 

951
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,350
it is absolutely vital that you do not
fall into that temptation now you know

952
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
fall into that temptation now you know
 

953
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,309
fall into that temptation now you know
we heard a story of one person who did

954
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
we heard a story of one person who did
 

955
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,189
we heard a story of one person who did
reach out and touch one of our chimps

956
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:09,199
reach out and touch one of our chimps
 

957
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,150
reach out and touch one of our chimps
it's a very very bad idea

958
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,160
it's a very very bad idea
 

959
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,189
it's a very very bad idea
not because the chimp is going to

960
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
not because the chimp is going to
 

961
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:18,390
not because the chimp is going to
do anything violent at the time

962
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:18,400
do anything violent at the time
 

963
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,590
do anything violent at the time
but because

964
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
but because
 

965
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,029
but because
if they learn

966
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:21,039
if they learn
 

967
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,470
if they learn
that humans are as weak uh physically as

968
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:24,480
that humans are as weak uh physically as
 

969
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,230
that humans are as weak uh physically as
we are compared to them then they can

970
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:26,240
we are compared to them then they can
 

971
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,829
we are compared to them then they can
take advantage of it

972
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
take advantage of it
 

973
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,870
take advantage of it
us and that's what happened in gambi so

974
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:30,880
us and that's what happened in gambi so
 

975
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,870
us and that's what happened in gambi so
after jane had

976
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:32,880
after jane had
 

977
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,110
after jane had
done the um you know very obvious thing

978
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:35,120
done the um you know very obvious thing
 

979
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,590
done the um you know very obvious thing
when you're first engaged in this

980
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:37,600
when you're first engaged in this
 

981
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,710
when you're first engaged in this
game

982
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:38,720
game
 

983
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,110
game
of uh allowing the infants to approach

984
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
of uh allowing the infants to approach
 

985
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,029
of uh allowing the infants to approach
her and then tickling them and playing

986
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,039
her and then tickling them and playing
 

987
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,350
her and then tickling them and playing
with them

988
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
with them
 

989
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,270
with them
some of those infants

990
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
some of those infants
 

991
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,029
some of those infants
had the personality

992
00:17:49,029 --> 00:17:49,039
had the personality
 

993
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,510
had the personality
of wanting to take advantage of that

994
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
of wanting to take advantage of that
 

995
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,190
of wanting to take advantage of that
knowledge later

996
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
knowledge later
 

997
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,430
knowledge later
and so you know you had an individual

998
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
and so you know you had an individual
 

999
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,029
and so you know you had an individual
frodo who was

1000
00:17:57,029 --> 00:17:57,039
frodo who was
 

1001
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,430
frodo who was
um violent on a regular basis towards

quite dangerous i mean he could easily
have killed someone in fact he did kill

1008
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
have killed someone in fact he did kill
 

1009

have killed someone in fact he did kill
on one person he killed a baby

1010
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
on one person he killed a baby
 

1011
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,990
on one person he killed a baby
that he he took from a mother a human

met her on the path
 

1017
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,669
met her on the path
so it's a reminder that we're dealing

1018
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:17,679
so it's a reminder that we're dealing
 

1019

so it's a reminder that we're dealing
with

1020
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:19,039
with
 

1021
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,390
with
a species

1022
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
a species
 

1023
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,110
a species
that are rather human-like in the range

1024
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
that are rather human-like in the range
 

1025
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,350
that are rather human-like in the range
of emotions they have in the capacities

1026
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
of emotions they have in the capacities
 

1027
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,390
of emotions they have in the capacities
they have and even uh in the strength

they have and even uh in the strength
they have they are uh

1030
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:30,559
they have they are uh
 

1031
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,430
they have they are uh
you know

1032
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,440
you know
 

1033
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,190
you know
in many ways stronger than humans so

1034
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,200
in many ways stronger than humans so
 

1035
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,029
in many ways stronger than humans so
it's uh

1036
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:35,039
it's uh
 

1037
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,029
it's uh
you you've got to be careful

1038
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:37,039
you you've got to be careful

you you've got to be careful
in the full range of friendliness and

1040
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
in the full range of friendliness and
 

1041
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,669
in the full range of friendliness and
violence the capacity for these

1042
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
violence the capacity for these
 

1043
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,990
violence the capacity for these
very human things

1044
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
very human things
 

1045
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,470
very human things
yes i mean it's it's very obvious with

1046
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
yes i mean it's it's very obvious with
 

1047
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,150
yes i mean it's it's very obvious with
with violence as we talked about you

1048
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:48,160
with violence as we talked about you
 

1049
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,270
with violence as we talked about you
know that

1050
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
know that
 

1051
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,110
know that
they will kill they will kill not just

1052
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,120
they will kill they will kill not just
 

1053
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,310
they will kill they will kill not just
strangers

1054
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
strangers
 

1055
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,190
strangers
um

1056
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:53,200
um
 

1057
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,230
um
they can

1058
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
they can
 

1059
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,110
they can
kill

1060
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:55,120
kill
 

1061
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,510
kill
other adults within their own group uh

1062
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:57,520
other adults within their own group uh
 

1063
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,510
other adults within their own group uh
they can kill babies that are strangers

1064
00:18:59,510 --> 00:18:59,520
they can kill babies that are strangers
 

1065
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,110
they can kill babies that are strangers
they can kill babies in their own group

1066
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,120
they can kill babies in their own group
 

1067
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,870
they can kill babies in their own group
so you know they're

1068
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:02,880
so you know they're
 

1069
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,310
so you know they're
this is a long-lived individual

1070
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
this is a long-lived individual
 

1071
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,230
this is a long-lived individual
obviously these killings can't have very

1072
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:06,240
obviously these killings can't have very
 

1073
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,590
obviously these killings can't have very
often because otherwise they'd all be

1074
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
often because otherwise they'd all be
 

1075
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,470
often because otherwise they'd all be
dead

1076
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
dead
 

1077
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,270
dead
um

1078
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:09,280
um
 

1079
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,669
um
and uh we're now finding that they can

1080
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:11,679
and uh we're now finding that they can
 

1081
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,470
and uh we're now finding that they can
live to 50 or 60 years in the wild at

1082
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
live to 50 or 60 years in the wild at
 

1083
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,070
live to 50 or 60 years in the wild at
relatively low population density

1084
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
relatively low population density
 

1085
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,669
relatively low population density
because they're big animals eating a

1086
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:17,679
because they're big animals eating a
 

1087
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,830
because they're big animals eating a
rather specialized kind of food the ripe

1088
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:19,840
rather specialized kind of food the ripe
 

1089
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,110
rather specialized kind of food the ripe
fruits

1090
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
fruits
 

1091
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,230
fruits
um

1092
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:22,240
um
 

1093
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,070
um
so it doesn't happen all the time with

1094
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
so it doesn't happen all the time with
 

1095
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,990
so it doesn't happen all the time with
friendliness

1096
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,000
friendliness
 

1097
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,390
friendliness
they are very strong to support each

1098
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:28,400
they are very strong to support each
 

1099
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,390
they are very strong to support each
other they very much depend on their um

1100
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:32,400
other they very much depend on their um
 

1101
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,549
other they very much depend on their um
their close friendships

1102
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
their close friendships
 

1103
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,270
their close friendships
which they express through

1104
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
which they express through
 

1105
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,789
which they express through
physical contact

1106
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
physical contact
 

1107
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,549
physical contact
and particularly through through

1108
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
and particularly through through
 

1109
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,510
and particularly through through
grooming

1110
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,520
grooming
 

1111
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,789
grooming
so grooming

1112
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
so grooming
 

1113
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,710
so grooming
occurs when one individual approaches

1114
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
occurs when one individual approaches
 

1115
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,430
occurs when one individual approaches
another i might present

1116
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:47,440
another i might present
 

1117
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,669
another i might present
for grooming a very common way of

1118
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:49,679
for grooming a very common way of
 

1119
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,710
for grooming a very common way of
starting

1120
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:50,720
starting
 

1121
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,029
starting
turning their back or presenting an arm

1122
00:19:53,029 --> 00:19:53,039
turning their back or presenting an arm
 

1123
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,390
turning their back or presenting an arm
or something like that and the other

1124
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
or something like that and the other
 

1125
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,310
or something like that and the other
just riffles their fingers through the

1126
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:56,320
just riffles their fingers through the
 

1127
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,750
just riffles their fingers through the
hair

1128
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:57,760
hair
 

1129
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,390
hair
and that's partly just soothing

1130
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
and that's partly just soothing
 

1131
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,230
and that's partly just soothing
and it's partly uh looking for parasites

1132
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:04,240
and it's partly uh looking for parasites
 

1133
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,710
and it's partly uh looking for parasites
but mostly it's just soothing yes and

1134
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
but mostly it's just soothing yes and
 

1135
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,190
but mostly it's just soothing yes and
and the point about this is it can go on

1136
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
and the point about this is it can go on
 

1137
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,710
and the point about this is it can go on
for uh

1138
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
for uh
 

1139
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,590
for uh
half an hour it can go on for sometimes

1140
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:13,600
half an hour it can go on for sometimes
 

1141
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,270
half an hour it can go on for sometimes
even an hour

1142
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
even an hour
 

1143
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,430
even an hour
so this is amazing you know a major

1144
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:17,440
so this is amazing you know a major
 

1145
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,190
so this is amazing you know a major
expression of interest in somebody else

1146
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:21,200

interested in
well

1162
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
well
 

1163
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,350
well
um for my phd in the early 1970s

1164
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:41,360
um for my phd in the early 1970s
 

1165
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,909
um for my phd in the early 1970s
i was in gombe with jane goodall and was

1166
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
i was in gombe with jane goodall and was
 

1167
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,070
i was in gombe with jane goodall and was
studying feeding behavior

1168
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
studying feeding behavior
 

1169
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,110
studying feeding behavior
but during that time we were seeing and

1170
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,120
but during that time we were seeing and
 

1171
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,990
but during that time we were seeing and
i say uh we because there were uh half a

1172
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,000
i say uh we because there were uh half a
 

1173
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,470
i say uh we because there were uh half a
dozen research students uh all

1174
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
dozen research students uh all
 

1175
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,430
dozen research students uh all
uh in her camp

1176
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:57,440
uh in her camp
 

1177
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,390
uh in her camp
um

1178
00:20:58,390 --> 00:20:58,400
um
 

1179
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,070
um
we were discovering

1180
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,080
we were discovering
 

1181
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,110
we were discovering
that uh chimps had this capacity for

1182
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,120
that uh chimps had this capacity for
 

1183
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,470
that uh chimps had this capacity for
for violence um the first kill happened

1184

during that time which was of an infant
 

1187
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,710
during that time which was of an infant
and a neighboring group

1188
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
and a neighboring group
 

1189
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,590
and a neighboring group
um

1190
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:11,600
um
 

1191
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,669
um
and we were starting to see these uh

1192
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:13,679
and we were starting to see these uh
 

1193
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,830
and we were starting to see these uh
hunting

1194

hunting
 

1195
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,350
hunting
expeditions and this was

1196
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
expeditions and this was
 

1197
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,270
expeditions and this was
the start of my interest because it was

1198
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:19,280
the start of my interest because it was
 

1199
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,149
the start of my interest because it was
such

such
 

1201
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,710
such
chilling evidence of

00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:22,720
chilling evidence of
 

1203
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,029
chilling evidence of
an extraordinary similarity between

we didn't know very much
 

1213

three big black hairy things that live
in the african forests and

in the african forests and
 

1225
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,390
in the african forests and
eat fruits and

1226
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:46,400
eat fruits and
 

1227
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,870
eat fruits and
leaves when they can't find fruits

1228
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:48,880

1231
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,830
and walk on their knuckles and they all
look rather similar to each other so

1232
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
look rather similar to each other so
 

1233
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,510
look rather similar to each other so
they seem as though

those three species chimps and gorillas
 

1237
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,990
those three species chimps and gorillas

something rather separate and so any of

something rather separate and so any of
 

1243
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,710
something rather separate and so any of
them will be of interest to us

them will be of interest to us
 

1245
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,630
them will be of interest to us
subsequently we learn

subsequently we learn

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,950
subsequently we learn
that actually that's not true and that

that actually that's not true and that

that actually that's not true and that
there's a special relationship between

there's a special relationship between

apart from the rest of nature because we
 

1321
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,669
apart from the rest of nature because we
are so peculiar but when it turns out

are fascinated by these topics so as
 

1363
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,390
are fascinated by these topics so as
you're saying

1364

you're saying
 

1365
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,590
you're saying
why

1366
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:13,600
why
 

1367
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,789
why
do we

1368
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:14,799
do we
 

1369
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,669
do we
find the exploration of violence and the

1370
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
find the exploration of violence and the
 

1371
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,870
find the exploration of violence and the
relations between chimps so interesting

1372
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
relations between chimps so interesting
 

1373
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,070
relations between chimps so interesting
what can they teach us about ourselves

1374
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080

 

1375
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,230

has occurred in chimpanzees
 

1429
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,269
has occurred in chimpanzees
and in both species uh it has evolved

1430
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:29,279
and in both species uh it has evolved
 

1431
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,430
and in both species uh it has evolved
because of its uh evolutionary

1432
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
because of its uh evolutionary
 

1433
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,950
because of its uh evolutionary
significance in other words because it's

1434
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:32,960
significance in other words because it's
 

1435
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,230
significance in other words because it's
been helpful to the individuals who have

1436
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:36,240
been helpful to the individuals who have
 

1437
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,830
been helpful to the individuals who have
practiced it

1438
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
practiced it
 

1439
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,110
practiced it
and

1440
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:39,120
and
 

1441
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,029
and
now we know that

1442
00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:41,039
now we know that
 

1443
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,110
now we know that
as i mentioned other species do this as

1444
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,120
as i mentioned other species do this as
 

1445
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,990
as i mentioned other species do this as
well

1446
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
well
 

1447
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,310
well
in fact you know wolves

1448
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
in fact you know wolves
 

1449
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,590
in fact you know wolves
um

which this is a really kind of
 

1453
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,430
which this is a really kind of
ironical

in the form of killing members of our

in the form of killing members of our
 

1467
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,149
in the form of killing members of our
own species was unique to our species he

1468
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:04,159
own species was unique to our species he
 

1469
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:05,990
own species was unique to our species he
was a great fan of wolves he studied

1470
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,000
was a great fan of wolves he studied
 

1471
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,190
was a great fan of wolves he studied
wolves and in captivity he noted that

1472
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:09,200
wolves and in captivity he noted that
 

1473
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,510
wolves and in captivity he noted that
wolves are very unlikely to harm each

1474
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
wolves are very unlikely to harm each
 

1475
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,830
wolves are very unlikely to harm each
other in um

1476
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:13,840
other in um
 

1477
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,029
other in um
spats

1478
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
spats
 

1479
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,269
spats
among members of the same group

1480
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
among members of the same group
 

1481
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,549
among members of the same group
what happens is that one of them will

1482
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:18,559
what happens is that one of them will
 

1483
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,230
what happens is that one of them will
roll over and present their neck much as

1484
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:20,240
roll over and present their neck much as
 

1485
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,269
roll over and present their neck much as
you see in a dog park nowadays and and

1486
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:23,279
you see in a dog park nowadays and and
 

1487
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,350
you see in a dog park nowadays and and
the other uh might put their jaws on the

1488
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
the other uh might put their jaws on the
 

1489
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,590
the other uh might put their jaws on the
neck but will not bite

1490
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
neck but will not bite
 

1491
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,269
neck but will not bite
okay so now it turns out that if you

1492
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:29,279
okay so now it turns out that if you
 

1493
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,830
okay so now it turns out that if you
studied wolves in the wild

1494
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:31,840
studied wolves in the wild
 

1495
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,190
studied wolves in the wild
then neighboring packs often go hunting

1496
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
then neighboring packs often go hunting
 

1497
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,630
then neighboring packs often go hunting
for each other

1498
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:36,640
for each other
 

1499
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,269
for each other
they are in fierce competition

1500
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:39,279
they are in fierce competition
 

1501
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,190
they are in fierce competition
and uh as much as 50 of the mortality of

1502
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,200
and uh as much as 50 of the mortality of
 

1503
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,190
and uh as much as 50 of the mortality of
wolves is due to being killed by other

1504
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:45,200
wolves is due to being killed by other
 

1505
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,230

wolves
adult mortality wow so it's a really

1508
00:26:49,029 --> 00:26:49,039
adult mortality wow so it's a really
 

1509
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,110
adult mortality wow so it's a really
serious business

1510
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:51,120
serious business
 

1511
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,549
serious business
the chimpanzees and humans uh fit into a

1512
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
the chimpanzees and humans uh fit into a
 

1513
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,110
the chimpanzees and humans uh fit into a
larger pattern of understanding animals

1514
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
larger pattern of understanding animals
 

1515

1517
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,909

you don't have an instinct for violence

you don't have an instinct for violence

you don't have an instinct for violence
what you have is an instinct if you like

1520
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:05,039
what you have is an instinct if you like
 

1521
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,669
what you have is an instinct if you like
to use violence adaptively

1522
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
to use violence adaptively
 

1523
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,549
to use violence adaptively
and if the right circumstances come up

1524
00:27:10,549 --> 00:27:10,559
and if the right circumstances come up
 

1525
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,070
and if the right circumstances come up
it'll be adaptive if the right

1526
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
it'll be adaptive if the right
 

1527
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,630
it'll be adaptive if the right
circumstances don't come up it won't be

1528
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
circumstances don't come up it won't be
 

1529
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,590
circumstances don't come up it won't be
so some chimpanzee communities are much

1530
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,600
so some chimpanzee communities are much
 

1531
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,750
so some chimpanzee communities are much
more violent than others because of

1532
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:19,760
more violent than others because of
 

1533
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,029
more violent than others because of
things like

1534
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:21,039
things like
 

1535
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,389
things like
the frequency with which a large party

1536
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
the frequency with which a large party
 

1537
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,190
the frequency with which a large party
of males is likely to meet us a lone

1538
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,200
of males is likely to meet us a lone
 

1539
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,269
of males is likely to meet us a lone
victim and that's going to depend on the

1540
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
victim and that's going to depend on the
 

1541
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,750
victim and that's going to depend on the
local ecology

1542
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
local ecology
 

1543
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,549
local ecology
but you know so the overall

1544
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:34,559
but you know so the overall
 

1545
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,990
but you know so the overall
answer to the question of what did

1546
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,000
answer to the question of what did
 

1547
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,350
answer to the question of what did
chimps teach us is that we have to take

1548
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:39,360
chimps teach us is that we have to take
 

1549
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,149
chimps teach us is that we have to take
very seriously the notion that in humans

1550
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
very seriously the notion that in humans
 

1551
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,549
very seriously the notion that in humans
the tendency to

1552
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
the tendency to
 

1553
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:47,669
the tendency to
make war

1554
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:47,679
make war
 

1555
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,549
make war
is a consequence of a long-term

1556
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:50,559
is a consequence of a long-term
 

1557
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,669
is a consequence of a long-term
evolutionary adaptation and not just a

1558
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:53,679
evolutionary adaptation and not just a
 

1559
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,310
evolutionary adaptation and not just a
military ideology or some you know sort

1560
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
military ideology or some you know sort
 

1561
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,389
military ideology or some you know sort
of local patriarchal phenomenon um and

1562
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:00,399
of local patriarchal phenomenon um and
 

1563
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,549
of local patriarchal phenomenon um and
of course you know his a reading of

1564
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:02,559
of course you know his a reading of
 

1565
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,750
of course you know his a reading of
history a judicious reading of history

1566
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:05,760
history a judicious reading of history
 

1567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,909
history a judicious reading of history
fits that very easily because

1568
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:07,919
fits that very easily because
 

1569
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,630
fits that very easily because
war is so commonplace

1570
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:10,640
war is so commonplace
 

1571
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,070
war is so commonplace
it's not an accident so it's not a

1572
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
it's not an accident so it's not a
 

1573
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,470
it's not an accident so it's not a
construction of human civilization

1574
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
construction of human civilization
 

1575
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,430
construction of human civilization
it's uh it's deeply within us violence

1576
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:17,440
it's uh it's deeply within us violence
 

1577
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,549
it's uh it's deeply within us violence
so what

1578
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
so what
 

1579
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,230
so what
what's the difference between violence

1580
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:20,240
what's the difference between violence
 

1581
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,510
what's the difference between violence
on the individual level versus group

1582
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:23,520
on the individual level versus group
 

1583
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,830
on the individual level versus group
is um it seems like with chimps and with

1584
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:25,840
is um it seems like with chimps and with
 

1585
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,230
is um it seems like with chimps and with
wolves there's something about

1586
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
wolves there's something about
 

1587
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,430
wolves there's something about
the dynamic of multiple

1588
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:31,440
the dynamic of multiple
 

1589
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,230
the dynamic of multiple
uh

1590
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:32,240
uh
 

1591
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,909
uh
chimps together

1592
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
chimps together
 

1593
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,310
chimps together
that increase the chance of violence or

1594
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
that increase the chance of violence or
 

1595
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,710
that increase the chance of violence or
is is violence still

1596
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:38,720
is is violence still
 

1597
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,870
is is violence still
fundamentally part of the individual

1598
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:40,880
fundamentally part of the individual
 

1599
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,590
fundamentally part of the individual
like what would an individual be

1600
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
like what would an individual be
 

1601
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,710
like what would an individual be
as violent as they might be as part of a

1602
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
as violent as they might be as part of a
 

1603
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,830
as violent as they might be as part of a
group

1604
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:47,840
group
 

1605
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,470
group
if we're talking about uh killing

1606
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:50,480
if we're talking about uh killing
 

1607
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,669
if we're talking about uh killing
okay then um violence in the sense of

1608
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
okay then um violence in the sense of
 

1609
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,430
okay then um violence in the sense of
killing is very much associated with

1610
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:57,440
killing is very much associated with
 

1611
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,789
killing is very much associated with
a group

1612
00:28:58,789 --> 00:28:58,799
a group
 

1613
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,470
a group
and the reason is

1614
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:00,480
and the reason is
 

1615
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,710
and the reason is
that individuals

1616
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
that individuals
 

1617
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,590
that individuals
don't benefit by getting into a fight in

1618
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:05,600
don't benefit by getting into a fight in
 

1619
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,549
don't benefit by getting into a fight in
which they risk being hurt themselves

1620
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:08,559
which they risk being hurt themselves
 

1621
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,590
which they risk being hurt themselves
so it's only when you have overwhelming

1622
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:11,600
so it's only when you have overwhelming
 

1623
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,549
so it's only when you have overwhelming
power

1624
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:12,559
power
 

1625
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,789
power
that the temptation to try and kill

1626
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
that the temptation to try and kill
 

1627
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:16,710
that the temptation to try and kill
another victim

1628
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:16,720
another victim
 

1629
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,990
another victim
rises

1630
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:18,000
rises
 

1631
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,070
rises
sufficiently for them to be motivated to

1632
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,080
sufficiently for them to be motivated to
 

1633
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,510
sufficiently for them to be motivated to
do it

1634
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:21,520
do it
 

1635
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,269
do it
the

1636
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
the
 

1637
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,630
the
the average

00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:24,640
the average
 

1639
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,669
the average
number of chimpanzee males

in
 

1645
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,269
in
something like 50 observations that have

1646
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
something like 50 observations that have
 

1647
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,909
something like 50 observations that have
accumulated in the last 50 years

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,310
accumulated in the last 50 years
from various different study sites

1650
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:38,320
from various different study sites
 

1651
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,070
from various different study sites
is eight

1652
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
is eight
 

1653
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,750
is eight
eight to one

1654
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
eight to one
 

1655
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,110
eight to one
now sometimes it can go as low as uh

1656
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,120
now sometimes it can go as low as uh
 

1657
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,630
now sometimes it can go as low as uh
three to one

1658
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:46,640
three to one
 

1659
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,269
three to one
but that's a that's getting risky

1660
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:49,279
but that's a that's getting risky
 

1661
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,950
but that's a that's getting risky
but if you have eight you can see what

1662
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:50,960
but if you have eight you can see what
 

1663
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,510
but if you have eight you can see what
can happen i mean basically uh

1664
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:53,520
can happen i mean basically uh
 

1665
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,070
can happen i mean basically uh
you have one male on one foot another

1666
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
you have one male on one foot another
 

1667
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,669
you have one male on one foot another
male another foot another male and an

1668
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
male another foot another male and an
 

1669
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,590
male another foot another male and an
arm another male another arm

1670
00:29:59,590 --> 00:29:59,600
arm another male another arm
 

1671
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,389
arm another male another arm
now you have an immobilized victim

1672
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:02,399
now you have an immobilized victim
 

1673
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,870
now you have an immobilized victim
with uh four individuals capable of just

1674
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:04,880
with uh four individuals capable of just
 

1675
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,950
with uh four individuals capable of just
doing the damage and so they can then

1676
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
doing the damage and so they can then
 

1677
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,870
doing the damage and so they can then
move in and tear out his thorax and tear

1678
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
move in and tear out his thorax and tear
 

1679
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,269
move in and tear out his thorax and tear
off his testicles and and twist an arm

1680
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
off his testicles and and twist an arm
 

1681
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,470
off his testicles and and twist an arm
until it breaks and uh and do this you

1682
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:14,480
until it breaks and uh and do this you
 

1683
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,389
until it breaks and uh and do this you
know appalling damage with no weapons

1684
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399

 

1685
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,830

what is uh

1686
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:19,840
what is uh

the way in which they prefer
 

1689
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,510
the way in which they prefer
to commit the violence

1690
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:23,520
to commit the violence
 

1691
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,430
to commit the violence
is there something to be said about like

1692
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:25,440
is there something to be said about like
 

1693
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,789
is there something to be said about like
the actual

1694

the actual
 

1695
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,190
the actual
process of it is there an artistry to it

1696
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:29,200
process of it is there an artistry to it
 

1697
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,029
process of it is there an artistry to it
so if you look at human

1698
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
so if you look at human
 

1699
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,310
so if you look at human

00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:42,159
the human side but
 

1711
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,950
the human side but
just the nature of violence itself sorry

and they just rip off different parts of
 

1723
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,630

yeah you have to understand that

1726
00:30:59,190 --> 00:30:59,200
yeah you have to understand that
 

1727
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,110
yeah you have to understand that
these things are happening at high speed

in thick vegetation yes mostly so that
 

1731
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,269

they have not been filmed uh carefully
you know we we have a few

1736
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,240
you know we we have a few
 

1737
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,789
you know we we have a few
little glimpses of them from uh

1738
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
little glimpses of them from uh
 

1739
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,630

one or two people like david watts so

1740
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
one or two people like david watts so
 

1741
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,549
one or two people like david watts so
he's got some great video but

1742
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
he's got some great video but
 

1743
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,549
he's got some great video but
uh we don't know enough to be able to to

1744
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
uh we don't know enough to be able to to
 

1745
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,310
uh we don't know enough to be able to to
say that it's hard for me to imagine

1746
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
say that it's hard for me to imagine
 

1747

that there are styles that vary between
 

1749
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,310
that there are styles that vary between
um communities you know cultural styles

1750
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
um communities you know cultural styles
 

1751
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,149
um communities you know cultural styles
but it is possible on one thing that is

1752
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
but it is possible on one thing that is
 

1753
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,750
but it is possible on one thing that is
striking is that

1754
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:33,760
striking is that
 

1755
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,549
striking is that
the

1756
00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:34,559
the
 

1757
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,549
the
number of times that an individual

1761
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,310
victim has been killed immediately
uh has been higher in

1762
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:42,320
uh has been higher in
 

1763
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,110
uh has been higher in
uh kibali forest in uganda

1764
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:45,120
uh kibali forest in uganda
 

1765
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,830
uh kibali forest in uganda
than in in gombe national park in

1766
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
than in in gombe national park in
 

1767
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,669
than in in gombe national park in
tanzania it's conceivable that's just

1768
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:49,679
tanzania it's conceivable that's just
 

1769
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,750
tanzania it's conceivable that's just
chance we don't have real numbers now

1770
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:51,760
chance we don't have real numbers now
 

1771
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,710
chance we don't have real numbers now
but

1772
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:52,720
but
 

1773
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,950
but
was this um i can't remember exact

1774
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:54,960
was this um i can't remember exact
 

1775
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,029
was this um i can't remember exact
numbers but you know 10 versus

1776
00:31:57,029 --> 00:31:57,039
numbers but you know 10 versus
 

1777
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,990
numbers but you know 10 versus
15 or something um

1778
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:00,000
15 or something um
 

1779
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,310
15 or something um
so maybe

1780
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,320
so maybe
 

1781
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,190
so maybe
they

1782
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:03,200
they
 

1783
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,950
they
damage to the point of

1784
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:04,960
damage to the point of
 

1785
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,590
damage to the point of
uh expecting a death in one place and

1786
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:07,600
uh expecting a death in one place and
 

1787
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,590
uh expecting a death in one place and
they just finish it off in the other but

1788
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
they just finish it off in the other but
 

1789
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,029
they just finish it off in the other but
most likely

1790
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,039
most likely
 

1791
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,430
most likely
that sort of difference will be due to

1792
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:13,440
that sort of difference will be due to
 

1793
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,590
that sort of difference will be due to
differences in the numbers of

1794
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
differences in the numbers of
 

1795
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,029

you know human beings are able to

1798
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:18,960
you know human beings are able to
 

1799
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,590
you know human beings are able to
conceive of the philosophical notion of

conceive of the philosophical notion of
 

1801
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,389
conceive of the philosophical notion of
death of mortality is there any of that

00:32:26,389 --> 00:32:26,399
death of mortality is there any of that
 

1803
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,710
death of mortality is there any of that
for chimps

1804
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:28,720
for chimps
 

1805
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,549
for chimps
when they're thinking about violence is

when they're thinking about violence is
 

1807

violence like what what is the nature
 

1809
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,350
violence like what what is the nature
of their conception of violence do you

1810
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:35,360
of their conception of violence do you
 

1811
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,310
of their conception of violence do you
think

1812
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
think
 

1813
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,310
think
do they do they realize they're taking

1814
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,320
do they do they realize they're taking
 

1815
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,630
do they do they realize they're taking
another conscious being's

1816

another conscious being's
 

1817
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,310
another conscious being's
life or is it some kind of

1818
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,320
life or is it some kind of
 

1819
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,710
life or is it some kind of
like optimization over the use of

1820
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:46,720
like optimization over the use of
 

1821

any way to get an answer to the question
of what they know about that um

1828

of what they know about that um
i think that

1830
00:32:59,190 --> 00:32:59,200
i think that
 

1831
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,269
i think that
uh the way to think about

00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:01,279
uh the way to think about
 

1833
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,269
uh the way to think about
the motivation

1834
00:33:03,269 --> 00:33:03,279
the motivation
 

1835
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,149
the motivation
is

1836
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:04,159
is
 

1837
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,549

whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans

1848
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:18,720
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans
 

1849
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,549
whether it's in chimpanzees or in humans
they don't think about the fact that

1850
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:20,559
they don't think about the fact that
 

1851
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,830
they don't think about the fact that
what this is going to do is to lead to a

1852
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:22,840
what this is going to do is to lead to a
 

1853
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,110
what this is going to do is to lead to a
baby mostly

1854
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,120
baby mostly
 

1855
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,470
baby mostly
you're right mostly what they're

1856
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480
you're right mostly what they're
 

1857
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,070
you're right mostly what they're
thinking about is i want to get my

1858
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:28,080
thinking about is i want to get my
 

1859
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,830
thinking about is i want to get my
underway

1860
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:29,840
underway
 

1861
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,350
underway
and um

1862
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:31,360
and um
 

1863
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,509
and um
i think that that's a similar kind of

1864
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:33,519
i think that that's a similar kind of
 

1865
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,909
i think that that's a similar kind of
process uh with the gems you know what

1866
00:33:35,909 --> 00:33:35,919
process uh with the gems you know what
 

1867
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,110
process uh with the gems you know what
they are thinking about is i i want to

1868
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:39,120
they are thinking about is i i want to
 

1869
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,509
they are thinking about is i i want to
kill this yes individual

1870
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
kill this yes individual
 

1871
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,029
kill this yes individual
and it's hard to imagine that

1872
00:33:45,029 --> 00:33:45,039
and it's hard to imagine that
 

1873
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,710
and it's hard to imagine that
taking the other individual's

1874
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:46,720
taking the other individual's
 

1875
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,630
taking the other individual's
perspective and thinking about what it

1876
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:48,640
perspective and thinking about what it
 

1877
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,710
perspective and thinking about what it
means for them to die is going to be an

1878
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:50,720
means for them to die is going to be an
 

1879
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,389
means for them to die is going to be an
important part of that in fact

1880
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
important part of that in fact
 

1881
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,750
important part of that in fact
you know there's reasons to think it

1882
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:53,760
you know there's reasons to think it
 

1883
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,950
you know there's reasons to think it
should not be an important part of it

1884
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
should not be an important part of it
 

1885
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,630
should not be an important part of it
because it might inhibit them and they

1886
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:56,640
because it might inhibit them and they
 

1887
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,909
because it might inhibit them and they
don't want to be inhibited you know the

1888
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:57,919
don't want to be inhibited you know the
 

1889
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:00,549
don't want to be inhibited you know the
more efficient they are in doing this

1890
00:34:00,549 --> 00:34:00,559
more efficient they are in doing this
 

1891
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,389
more efficient they are in doing this
the better but you know i think it's

1892
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
the better but you know i think it's
 

1893
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,669
the better but you know i think it's
interesting to think about this whole

1894
00:34:03,669 --> 00:34:03,679
interesting to think about this whole
 

1895
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,909
interesting to think about this whole
motivational question because it does

1896
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919

 

1897
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:09,829

produce a rather haunting thought that

1898
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:09,839
produce a rather haunting thought that
 

1899
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,470
produce a rather haunting thought that
there has been selection in favor of

1900
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:13,480
there has been selection in favor of
 

1901
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,950
there has been selection in favor of
enthusiasm about killing

1902
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:16,960
enthusiasm about killing
 

1903
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,710
enthusiasm about killing
and in our

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:26,480
moral society that we have today
 

1909
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,470
moral society that we have today
it's very difficult for us to face the

1910
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
it's very difficult for us to face the
 

1911
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,230
it's very difficult for us to face the
thought that

1912
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:30,240
thought that
 

1913
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,190

still be part of us for example he said

that somehow as a very dark

2012
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:28,720
that somehow as a very dark
 

2013
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,670
that somehow as a very dark
thought

2014
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:29,680
thought
 

2015
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,510
thought
that we were drawn to that

2016
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:31,520
that we were drawn to that
 

2017
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,349
that we were drawn to that
so you think that's part of us in there

2018
00:36:33,349 --> 00:36:33,359
so you think that's part of us in there
 

2019
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,630
so you think that's part of us in there
somewhere that

2020
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:34,640
somewhere that
 

2021
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,430
somewhere that
selection that we evolved for the

2022
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
selection that we evolved for the
 

2023
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,470
selection that we evolved for the
enjoyment of killing and the enjoyment

2024
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:40,480
enjoyment of killing and the enjoyment
 

2025
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,950
enjoyment of killing and the enjoyment
of observing

2026
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:42,960
of observing
 

2027
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,230
of observing
uh

2028
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,240
uh
 

2029
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,390
uh
those in our tribe

2030
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:46,400
those in our tribe
 

2031
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,230
those in our tribe
doing the killing

2032
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
doing the killing
 

2033
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,710
doing the killing
yes i mean and that word you produced at

2034
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:50,720
yes i mean and that word you produced at
 

2035
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,829
yes i mean and that word you produced at
the end is critical i think you know

2036
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839
the end is critical i think you know
 

2037
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,870
the end is critical i think you know
because uh

2038
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:54,880
because uh
 

2039
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,790
because uh
it would be a little bit weird i think

2040
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:56,800
it would be a little bit weird i think
 

2041
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,230
it would be a little bit weird i think
uh to

2042
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,240
uh to
 

2043
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,670
uh to
imagine

2044
00:36:59,670 --> 00:36:59,680
imagine
 

2045
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,670
imagine
a lot of enjoyment about

2046
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
a lot of enjoyment about
 

2047
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,589
a lot of enjoyment about
people in your own tribe being killed

2048
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:03,599
people in your own tribe being killed
 

2049
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,190
people in your own tribe being killed
right yeah i i don't think we're

2050
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:05,200
right yeah i i don't think we're
 

2051
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,270
right yeah i i don't think we're
interested in violence for violence's

2052
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:07,280
interested in violence for violence's
 

2053
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,829
interested in violence for violence's
sake that much

2054
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:09,839
sake that much
 

2055
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,910
sake that much
it's um

2056
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:11,920

it's when you get these social
 

2059
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,270
it's when you get these social
boundaries set up

2060
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
boundaries set up
 

2061
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,390
boundaries set up
and

2062
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
and
 

2063
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,150
and
in today's world

2064
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,160
in today's world
 

2065
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,750
in today's world
you know happily

uh
 

2069
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,390
uh
we kind of are already one world

2070
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
we kind of are already one world
 

2071
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,589
we kind of are already one world
you know we

2072
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
you know we
 

2073
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,310
you know we
you have to dehumanize someone to get to

2074
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:28,320
you have to dehumanize someone to get to
 

2075
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,430
you have to dehumanize someone to get to
the point where they are really outside

2076
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
the point where they are really outside
 

2077
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,230
the point where they are really outside
you know our recognition of a tribe at

2078
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:34,240
you know our recognition of a tribe at
 

2079
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,589
you know our recognition of a tribe at
some level which is you know the whole

2080
00:37:35,589 --> 00:37:35,599
some level which is you know the whole
 

2081
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,270
some level which is you know the whole
human species

2082
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:37,280
human species
 

2083
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,630
human species
but in

2084
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
but in
 

2085
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,470
but in
uh ancient times that would not have

2086
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,480
uh ancient times that would not have
 

2087
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,750
uh ancient times that would not have
been true because in ancient times

2088
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:43,760
been true because in ancient times
 

2089
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,510
been true because in ancient times
there are lots of accounts of hunters

2090
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:45,520
there are lots of accounts of hunters
 

2091
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,190
there are lots of accounts of hunters
and gatherers uh

2092
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
and gatherers uh
 

2093
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,230
and gatherers uh
in which

2094
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,240
in which
 

2095
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,829
in which
the appearance of a stranger

2096
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:51,839
the appearance of a stranger
 

2097
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:53,430
the appearance of a stranger
would lead to

2098
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
would lead to
 

2099
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,430
would lead to
an immediate response of

2100
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:55,440
an immediate response of
 

2101
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,349
an immediate response of
shooting on site

2102
00:37:57,349 --> 00:37:57,359
shooting on site
 

2103
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,550
shooting on site
because what was human was the people

2104
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:00,560
because what was human was the people
 

2105
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,109
because what was human was the people
that were in your society

2106
00:38:03,109 --> 00:38:03,119
that were in your society
 

2107
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,190
that were in your society
and the other things that actually

2108
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
and the other things that actually
 

2109
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,270
and the other things that actually
looked like us and you know were human

2110
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:07,280
looked like us and you know were human
 

2111
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,550
looked like us and you know were human
in that sense were not regarded as human

2112
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
in that sense were not regarded as human
 

2113
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,430
in that sense were not regarded as human
so there was a kind of automatic

2114
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:12,440
so there was a kind of automatic
 

2115
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,109
so there was a kind of automatic
dehumanization of everybody that didn't

2116
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
dehumanization of everybody that didn't
 

2117
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,190
dehumanization of everybody that didn't
speak our language or hadn't already

2118
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,200
speak our language or hadn't already
 

2119
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,589
speak our language or hadn't already
somehow become

2120
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:19,599
somehow become
 

2121
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,390
somehow become
recognized as uh

2122
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:22,400
recognized as uh
 

2123
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,910
recognized as uh
sufficiently like us to escape the

2124
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:25,920
sufficiently like us to escape the
 

2125
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,990
sufficiently like us to escape the
the dehumanization context and so

2126
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
the dehumanization context and so
 

2127
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,069
the dehumanization context and so
hopefully the story of human history is

2128
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:30,079
hopefully the story of human history is
 

2129
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,430
hopefully the story of human history is
that we

2130
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,440
that we
 

2131
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,630
that we
are

2132
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
are
 

2133
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,109
are
that tribalism fades away

2134
00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:35,119
that tribalism fades away
 

2135
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,150
that tribalism fades away
that our

2136
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,160
that our
 

2137
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,230
that our
dehumanization the natural desire to

2138
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:38,240
dehumanization the natural desire to
 

2139
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,750
dehumanization the natural desire to
dehumanize or a tendency to dehumanize

2140
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:41,760
dehumanize or a tendency to dehumanize
 

2141
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:44,069
dehumanize or a tendency to dehumanize
groups that are not within this tribe

2142
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:44,079
groups that are not within this tribe
 

2143
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,950
groups that are not within this tribe
decreases over time and so then

2144
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:46,960
decreases over time and so then
 

2145
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,109
decreases over time and so then
the desire for violence decreases over

2146
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:49,119
the desire for violence decreases over
 

2147
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,950
the desire for violence decreases over
time yeah i mean that that's the

2148
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
time yeah i mean that that's the
 

2149
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,829
time yeah i mean that that's the
optimistic perspective and uh and the

2150
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:53,839
optimistic perspective and uh and the
 

2151
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,310
optimistic perspective and uh and the
the great sort of concern of course is

2152
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:56,320
the great sort of concern of course is
 

2153
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,270
the great sort of concern of course is
that

2154
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:57,280
that
 

2155
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,430
that
um small conflicts can build up into

2156
00:38:59,430 --> 00:38:59,440
um small conflicts can build up into
 

2157
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,510
um small conflicts can build up into
bigger conflicts and then dehumanization

2158
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:01,520
bigger conflicts and then dehumanization
 

2159
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,630
bigger conflicts and then dehumanization
happens and then violence is released

2160
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
happens and then violence is released
 

2161
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,630
happens and then violence is released
as hannah aaron says you know there

2162
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:06,640
as hannah aaron says you know there
 

2163
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,589
as hannah aaron says you know there
currently is no uh known alternative to

2164
00:39:09,589 --> 00:39:09,599
currently is no uh known alternative to
 

2165
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,790
currently is no uh known alternative to
war as a means of settling really

2166
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:12,800
war as a means of settling really
 

2167
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,390
war as a means of settling really
important conflicts

2168
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400

 

2169
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,950

so if we look at the big picture what

2170
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,960
so if we look at the big picture what
 

2171
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,349
so if we look at the big picture what
role has violence or do you think

2172
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:21,359
role has violence or do you think
 

2173
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,510
role has violence or do you think
violence has played in the evolution of

2174
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:23,520
violence has played in the evolution of
 

2175
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,310
violence has played in the evolution of
homo sapiens so we are

2176
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:26,320
homo sapiens so we are
 

2177
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,510
homo sapiens so we are
quite an intelligent got a beautiful

2178
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:29,520
quite an intelligent got a beautiful
 

2179
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,510
quite an intelligent got a beautiful
particular little branch on the

2180
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:31,520
particular little branch on the
 

2181
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,310
particular little branch on the
evolutionary tree

2182
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
evolutionary tree
 

2183
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,990
evolutionary tree
what part of that

2184
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
what part of that
 

2185
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,510
what part of that
was played by

2186
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:37,520
was played by
 

2187
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,589
was played by
our tendency to be violent

2188
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599

 

2189
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,109

well i think that violence was

2190
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:43,119
well i think that violence was
 

2191
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,190
well i think that violence was
responsible for creating your homo

2192
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
responsible for creating your homo
 

2193
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,990
responsible for creating your homo
sapiens

2194
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:48,000

 

2195
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,190

um

2196
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
um
 

2197
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,990
um
and

2198
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000

 

2199
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,430

that raises the question of what homo

2200
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
that raises the question of what homo
 

2201
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,030
that raises the question of what homo
sapiens is

2202
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,040
sapiens is
 

2203
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,109
sapiens is
yes

2204
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
yes
 

2205
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,710
yes
yeah exactly

2206
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:58,720
yeah exactly
 

2207
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,069
yeah exactly
so

2208
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
so
 

2209
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,190
so
you know nowadays people um

2210
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
you know nowadays people um
 

2211
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,230
you know nowadays people um
begin

2212
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:04,240
begin
 

2213
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,750
begin
the

2214
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
the
 

2215
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,349
the
the concept of what homo sapiens is by

2216
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:09,359
the concept of what homo sapiens is by
 

2217
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,430
the concept of what homo sapiens is by
thinking about features that are very

2218
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
thinking about features that are very
 

2219
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,870
thinking about features that are very
obviously different from all of the

2220
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:12,880
obviously different from all of the
 

2221
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,670
obviously different from all of the
other species of homo

2222
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:15,680
other species of homo
 

2223
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,470
other species of homo
and

2224
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:16,480
and
 

2225
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,790
and
our large brain are

2226
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800
our large brain are
 

2227
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,230
our large brain are
a very rounded

2228
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
a very rounded
 

2229
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,030
a very rounded
cranium a relatively small face

2230
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:23,040
cranium a relatively small face
 

2231
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,430
cranium a relatively small face
these are characteristics which are

2232
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
these are characteristics which are
 

2233
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,910
these are characteristics which are
developed in a relatively modern way by

2234
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
developed in a relatively modern way by
 

2235
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,230
developed in a relatively modern way by
about 170

2236
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:30,240
about 170
 

2237
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,910
about 170
000 years ago say you know it's one of

2238
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:31,920
000 years ago say you know it's one of
 

2239
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,550
000 years ago say you know it's one of
the earliest skulls in africa that

2240
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:34,560
the earliest skulls in africa that
 

2241
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,510
the earliest skulls in africa that
really captures that

2242
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:36,520
really captures that
 

2243
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:40,069
really captures that
but uh it has been argued that

2244
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
but uh it has been argued that
 

2245
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,990
but uh it has been argued that
that is a

2246
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
that is a
 

2247
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,270
that is a
um

2248
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
um
 

2249
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,069
um
an episode in a process

2250
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:46,079
an episode in a process
 

2251
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,829
an episode in a process
that has been

2252
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
that has been
 

2253
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,230
that has been
uh started substantially earlier and

2254
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
uh started substantially earlier and
 

2255
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,589
uh started substantially earlier and
there's no doubt that that's true you

2256
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:51,599
there's no doubt that that's true you
 

2257
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,829
there's no doubt that that's true you
know homo sapiens is a species that has

2258
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:53,839
know homo sapiens is a species that has
 

2259
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,150
know homo sapiens is a species that has
been changing pretty continuously

2260
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,160
been changing pretty continuously
 

2261
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,270
been changing pretty continuously
throughout

2262
00:40:57,270 --> 00:40:57,280
throughout
 

2263
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,309
throughout
the

2264
00:40:58,309 --> 00:40:58,319
the
 

2265
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,150
the
length of time it's there

2266
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:00,160
length of time it's there
 

2267
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,309
length of time it's there
and it goes back to 300 000 years ago

2268
00:41:03,309 --> 00:41:03,319
and it goes back to 300 000 years ago
 

2269
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:06,950
and it goes back to 300 000 years ago
315 literally is the the time

00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
315 literally is the the time
 

2271
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,430

the the best estimate of a date for
 

2273
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,030
the the best estimate of a date for
uh a series of bones from morocco

2274
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:13,040
uh a series of bones from morocco
 

2275
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,109
uh a series of bones from morocco
that have been dated uh three or four

2276
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:15,119
that have been dated uh three or four
 

2277
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,349
that have been dated uh three or four
years ago at that time and have been

2278
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:17,359
years ago at that time and have been
 

2279
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,109
years ago at that time and have been
characterized as

2280
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:19,119
characterized as
 

2281
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:21,270
characterized as
earliest homo sapiens

2282
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
earliest homo sapiens
 

2283
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,349
earliest homo sapiens
now at that point

2284
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
now at that point
 

2285
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:26,630
now at that point
they are only beginning the trend of

2286
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:26,640
they are only beginning the trend of
 

2287
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:29,349
they are only beginning the trend of
sapionization and that trend consists

2288
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:29,359
sapionization and that trend consists
 

2289
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:31,750
sapionization and that trend consists
basically of grassonization

2290
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:31,760
basically of grassonization
 

2291
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,950
basically of grassonization

reduced violence
 

2309
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,069
reduced violence
okay so that's that's saying what

2310
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:54,079
okay so that's that's saying what
 

2311
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,630
okay so that's that's saying what
that's homo sapiens beginning so it

2312
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
that's homo sapiens beginning so it
 

2313
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,470
that's homo sapiens beginning so it
began sometimes three three to four

2314
00:41:58,470 --> 00:41:58,480
began sometimes three three to four
 

2315
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,230
began sometimes three three to four
hundred thousand years ago because by

2316
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,240
hundred thousand years ago because by
 

2317
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,430
hundred thousand years ago because by
three hundred fifteen 000 years ago

2318
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
three hundred fifteen 000 years ago
 

2319
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,230
three hundred fifteen 000 years ago
you've already got something

2320
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,240
you've already got something
 

2321
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,150
you've already got something
recognizable so you're you're more on

2322
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
recognizable so you're you're more on
 

2323
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,670
recognizable so you're you're more on
that side of things that there was this

2324
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:05,680
that side of things that there was this
 

2325
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:08,630
that side of things that there was this
gradual process it's not 150 170 000

2326
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:08,640
gradual process it's not 150 170 000
 

2327
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,910
gradual process it's not 150 170 000
years ago it's

2328
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
years ago it's
 

2329
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,510
years ago it's
it started like 400 000 years ago and

2330
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
it started like 400 000 years ago and
 

2331
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,190
it started like 400 000 years ago and
it's just it started three to four

2332
00:42:15,190 --> 00:42:15,200
it's just it started three to four
 

2333
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,109
it's just it started three to four
hundred thousand years ago and and if

2334
00:42:17,109 --> 00:42:17,119
hundred thousand years ago and and if
 

2335
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,589
hundred thousand years ago and and if
you look at 170 it's got even more like

2336
00:42:19,589 --> 00:42:19,599
you look at 170 it's got even more like
 

2337
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,750
you look at 170 it's got even more like
us and if you if you look at at a

2338
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:21,760
us and if you if you look at at a
 

2339
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,430
us and if you if you look at at a
hundred it's got more like us again and

2340
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:23,440
hundred it's got more like us again and
 

2341
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,870
hundred it's got more like us again and
if you look at 50 it's more like us

2342
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:24,880
if you look at 50 it's more like us
 

2343
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,790
if you look at 50 it's more like us
again it's all the way it's just getting

2344
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:26,800
again it's all the way it's just getting
 

2345
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,950
again it's all the way it's just getting
more and more like the moderns

2346
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:28,960
more and more like the moderns
 

2347
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,870
more and more like the moderns
so the question is what happened between

2348
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:30,880
so the question is what happened between
 

2349
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,990
so the question is what happened between
three and four hundred thousand years

2350
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:32,000
three and four hundred thousand years
 

2351
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,550
three and four hundred thousand years
ago to produce homo sapiens

2352
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:34,560
ago to produce homo sapiens
 

2353
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,550
ago to produce homo sapiens
and i i think we have a pretty good

2354
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:36,560
and i i think we have a pretty good
 

2355
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,829
and i i think we have a pretty good
answer now

2356
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
answer now
 

2357
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,990
answer now
and the answer comes from violence

2358
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:40,000
and the answer comes from violence
 

2359
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,630
and the answer comes from violence
and the story begins by focusing on this

2360
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
and the story begins by focusing on this
 

2361
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,470
and the story begins by focusing on this
question why is it that in

2362
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
question why is it that in
 

2363
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,349
question why is it that in
the

2364
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:47,359
the
 

2365
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:48,950
the
human species

2366
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:48,960
human species
 

2367
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,990
human species
we are unique among all primates in not

2368
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
we are unique among all primates in not
 

2369
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,109
we are unique among all primates in not
having

2370
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:53,119
having
 

2371
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,790
having
an alpha male in any group

2372
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:56,800
an alpha male in any group
 

2373
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,470
an alpha male in any group
in the sense that

2374
00:42:58,470 --> 00:42:58,480
in the sense that
 

2375
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,710
in the sense that
what we don't have is an alpha male who

2376
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:00,720
what we don't have is an alpha male who
 

2377
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,710
what we don't have is an alpha male who
personally beats up

2378
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:02,720
personally beats up
 

2379
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,109
personally beats up
every other male

2380
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
every other male
 

2381
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,630
every other male
and the answer

2382
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:06,640
and the answer
 

2383
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,270
and the answer
uh that

2384
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,280
uh that
 

2385
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,870
uh that
has been

and whose work i've elaborated on
 

2393
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,470
and whose work i've elaborated on
uh is that

2394
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
uh is that
 

2395
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,470
uh is that
only in humans

2396
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480
only in humans
 

2397
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,470
only in humans
do you have a system by which any male

2398
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
do you have a system by which any male
 

2399
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,589
do you have a system by which any male
who tries to bully others

2400
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
who tries to bully others
 

2401
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,150
who tries to bully others
and become the alpha equivalent to an

2402
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:32,160
and become the alpha equivalent to an
 

2403
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,230
and become the alpha equivalent to an
alpha gorilla or an alpha chimpanzee or

2404
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
alpha gorilla or an alpha chimpanzee or
 

2405
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,150
alpha gorilla or an alpha chimpanzee or
an alpha bonobo or an alpha baboon or

an alpha bonobo or an alpha baboon or
 

2407
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,349
an alpha bonobo or an alpha baboon or
anything like that

2408

anything like that
 

2409
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:40,470
anything like that
any male who tries to do that in humans

2410
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:40,480
any male who tries to do that in humans
 

2411
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,270
any male who tries to do that in humans
gets taken down by a coalition

2412
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:43,280
gets taken down by a coalition
 

2413
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,069
gets taken down by a coalition
of beta males

2414
00:43:46,069 --> 00:43:46,079
of beta males
 

2415
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,109
of beta males
um that coalition yes

2416
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:49,119
um that coalition yes
 

2417
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,950
um that coalition yes
it's a really good uh picture of human

2418
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:50,960
it's a really good uh picture of human
 

2419
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,510
it's a really good uh picture of human
society yes i like it okay

2420
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:53,520
society yes i like it okay
 

2421
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,950
society yes i like it okay
so and that's the way all our societies

2422
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:54,960
so and that's the way all our societies
 

2423
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,190
so and that's the way all our societies
work now yes um because

2424
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:57,200
work now yes um because
 

2425
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,030
work now yes um because
individuals try and be alpha and then

2426
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,040
individuals try and be alpha and then
 

2427
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,790
individuals try and be alpha and then
they get taken out yeah i mean we don't

2428
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:00,800
they get taken out yeah i mean we don't
 

2429
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,550
they get taken out yeah i mean we don't
usually think of ourselves as beta males

2430
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:02,560
usually think of ourselves as beta males
 

2431
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,470
usually think of ourselves as beta males
but yes i i suppose i suppose that's

2432
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:04,480
but yes i i suppose i suppose that's
 

2433
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,390
but yes i i suppose i suppose that's
what democracy is

2434
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:06,400
what democracy is
 

2435
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:08,950
what democracy is
exactly yes exactly

2436
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:08,960
exactly yes exactly
 

2437
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,870
exactly yes exactly
um okay so

um okay so
 

2439
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,190
um okay so
well so at some point alpha males get

2440
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
well so at some point alpha males get
 

2441
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,390
well so at some point alpha males get
taken out

2442
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:14,400
taken out
 

2443
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,030
taken out
well what alpha males are are males who

2444
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
well what alpha males are are males who
 

2445
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,470
well what alpha males are are males who
respond with high reactive violence

2446
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:20,480
respond with high reactive violence
 

2447
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,870
respond with high reactive violence
to any challenge to their status you see

2448
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
to any challenge to their status you see
 

2449
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,910
to any challenge to their status you see
it all the time in in primates some

2450
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
it all the time in in primates some
 

2451
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,910

peter male thinks he's getting strong

2452

and so on and uh he refuses to
 

2457
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,990
and so on and uh he refuses to
uh kowtow to the alpha male and the

2458
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:36,000
uh kowtow to the alpha male and the
 

2459
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,309
uh kowtow to the alpha male and the
alpha male comes straight in and and

alpha male comes straight in and and
 

2461
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,790
alpha male comes straight in and and
charges at him or maybe he'll just wait

charges at him or maybe he'll just wait
 

2463
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,950
charges at him or maybe he'll just wait
for a few minutes or and then take an

for a few minutes or and then take an
 

2465
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,150
for a few minutes or and then take an
opportunity to attack him

2466
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160

 

2467
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:46,950

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:46,960
the
 

2469
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,390
the
um

2470

um
 

2471
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,710
um
all of these primates have got a high

2472
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:50,720
all of these primates have got a high
 

2473
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,030
all of these primates have got a high
tendency for reactive aggression

2474
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:53,040
tendency for reactive aggression
 

2475
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,270
tendency for reactive aggression
and that make enables the possibility of

2476
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280
and that make enables the possibility of
 

2477
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,829
and that make enables the possibility of
alpha males we don't we have this great

00:44:57,829 --> 00:44:57,839
alpha males we don't we have this great
 

2479

reduction as i talked about earlier
 

2481
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,910
reduction as i talked about earlier
and the question is when did that

2482
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:01,920
and the question is when did that
 

2483
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:05,270
and the question is when did that
reduction happen well

2484
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
reduction happen well
 

2485
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,630

when you domesticate wild animals what
 

2497
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,589
when you domesticate wild animals what
you're doing is

you're doing is
 

2499
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,550
you're doing is
reducing reactive aggression

2500
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:24,560
reducing reactive aggression

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,109
who are most willing to be approached by
a human or by another member of their

2508
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:33,119
a human or by another member of their
 

2509
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,750
a human or by another member of their
own species and are least likely to

2510
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:35,760
own species and are least likely to
 

2511
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,910
own species and are least likely to
erupt in a reactive uh aggression

2512
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:39,920
erupt in a reactive uh aggression
 

2513
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,910
erupt in a reactive uh aggression
and you only have to do that for a few

2514
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:41,920
and you only have to do that for a few
 

2515
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,309
and you only have to do that for a few
generations to discover that there are

2516
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
generations to discover that there are
 

2517
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,950
generations to discover that there are
changes in the skull

2518
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:46,960
changes in the skull
 

2519
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,190
changes in the skull
and those changes

2520
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
and those changes
 

2521
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,510
and those changes
consist of

2522
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:51,520
consist of
 

2523
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,109
consist of
a

2524
00:45:53,109 --> 00:45:53,119
a
 

2525
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,470
a
shorter face

2526
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:54,480
shorter face
 

2527
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,230
shorter face
smaller teeth

2528
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
smaller teeth
 

2529
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:56,950
smaller teeth
a

2530
00:45:56,950 --> 00:45:56,960
a
 

2531
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,950
a
reduced maleness

2532
00:45:58,950 --> 00:45:58,960
reduced maleness
 

2533
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,870
reduced maleness
are the males become increasingly

2534
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
are the males become increasingly
 

2535
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,030
are the males become increasingly
female-like

2536
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
female-like
 

2537
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,230
female-like
and reduced brain size

2538
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
and reduced brain size
 

2539
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,230
and reduced brain size
well the changes that are characteristic

2540
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:08,240
well the changes that are characteristic
 

2541
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,309
well the changes that are characteristic
of domesticated animals in general

2542
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,319
of domesticated animals in general
 

2543
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:12,630
of domesticated animals in general
compared to wild animals are all found

2544
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
compared to wild animals are all found
 

2545
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,950
compared to wild animals are all found
in homo sapiens compared to our early

2546
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
in homo sapiens compared to our early
 

2547
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,470
in homo sapiens compared to our early
ancestors

2548
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:16,480
ancestors
 

2549
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,190
ancestors
so it's a very strong signal that when

2550
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:19,200
so it's a very strong signal that when
 

2551
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,270
so it's a very strong signal that when
we first see homo sapiens what we're

2552
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
we first see homo sapiens what we're
 

2553
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:24,309
we first see homo sapiens what we're
seeing is evidence of a reduction in

2554
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:24,319
seeing is evidence of a reduction in
 

2555
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,069
seeing is evidence of a reduction in
reactive aggression

2556
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
reactive aggression
 

2557
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,829
reactive aggression
and that suggests that what's happening

2558
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:27,839
and that suggests that what's happening
 

2559
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,030
and that suggests that what's happening
with homo sapiens is that uh that is the

2560
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
with homo sapiens is that uh that is the
 

2561
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,430
with homo sapiens is that uh that is the
point at which there is selection

2562
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
point at which there is selection
 

2563
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,349
point at which there is selection
against the alpha males

2564
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:35,359
against the alpha males
 

2565
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,349
against the alpha males
and therefore

2566
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:37,359
and therefore
 

2567
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,190
and therefore
the way in which the selection happened

2568
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:39,200
the way in which the selection happened
 

2569
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,270
the way in which the selection happened
would have been the way it happens today

2570
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
would have been the way it happens today
 

2571
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,069
would have been the way it happens today
the beta males take them out

2572
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
the beta males take them out
 

2573
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,670
the beta males take them out
so i think that

2574
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
so i think that
 

2575
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,870
so i think that
homo sapiens is a species characterized

2576
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:48,880
homo sapiens is a species characterized
 

2577
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:49,750
homo sapiens is a species characterized
by

2578
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:49,760
by
 

2579
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,109
by
the suppression of reactive aggression

2580
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:53,119
the suppression of reactive aggression
 

2581
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,510
the suppression of reactive aggression
as a kind of incidental consequence of

2582
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:55,520
as a kind of incidental consequence of
 

2583
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,390
as a kind of incidental consequence of
the suppression of the alpha male

2584
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
the suppression of the alpha male
 

2585
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,109
the suppression of the alpha male
and and the story of our species is the

2586
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,119
and and the story of our species is the
 

2587
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,670
and and the story of our species is the
story of how the beta males took charge

2588
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:05,680
story of how the beta males took charge
 

2589
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,270
story of how the beta males took charge
and have been responsible for

2590
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:09,280
and have been responsible for
 

2591
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,270
and have been responsible for
the generation of a new kind of human

2592
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
the generation of a new kind of human
 

2593
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,309
the generation of a new kind of human
and incidentally

2594
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:16,319
and incidentally
 

2595
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:17,750
and incidentally
for

2596
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:17,760
for
 

2597
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,109
for
imposing

2598
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
imposing
 

2599
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:21,030
imposing
on the society

2600
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:21,040
on the society
 

2601
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,109
on the society
a new set of values because when those

2602
00:47:25,109 --> 00:47:25,119
a new set of values because when those
 

2603
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,109
a new set of values because when those
beta males discovered that they could

2604
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
beta males discovered that they could
 

2605
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,750
beta males discovered that they could
take out the previous alpha male

2606
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:29,760
take out the previous alpha male
 

2607
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,510
take out the previous alpha male
and continue to do so because in every

2608
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:31,520
and continue to do so because in every
 

2609
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,950
and continue to do so because in every
generation there'll always be some male

2610
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:32,960
generation there'll always be some male
 

2611
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:33,910
generation there'll always be some male
who says

2612
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:33,920
who says
 

2613
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,430
who says
maybe i'll become the alpha male and

2614
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
maybe i'll become the alpha male and
 

2615
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,430
maybe i'll become the alpha male and
they you know so they just keep chopping

2616
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:37,440
they you know so they just keep chopping
 

2617
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,430
they you know so they just keep chopping
them down

2618
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:39,440
them down
 

2619
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,750
them down
in discovering that they also obviously

2620
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:41,760
in discovering that they also obviously
 

2621
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,349
in discovering that they also obviously
discovered that they could kill anybody

2622
00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:43,359
discovered that they could kill anybody
 

2623
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,270
discovered that they could kill anybody
in the group

2624
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
in the group
 

2625
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,470
in the group
females

2626
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
females
 

2627
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,309
females
young males

2628
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
young males
 

2629
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,990
young males
anybody who

2630
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:50,000
anybody who
 

2631
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,790
anybody who
didn't follow their values

2632
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800
didn't follow their values
 

2633
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,990
didn't follow their values
and so this story is one of um

2634
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
and so this story is one of um
 

2635
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,430
and so this story is one of um
one in which the males of our species

2636
00:47:59,430 --> 00:47:59,440
one in which the males of our species
 

2637
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,870
one in which the males of our species
and these would be the breeding males

2638
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:02,880
and these would be the breeding males
 

2639
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,990
and these would be the breeding males
have been able to impose their values on

2640
00:48:05,990 --> 00:48:06,000
have been able to impose their values on
 

2641
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,430
have been able to impose their values on
everybody else and there's two kind of

2642
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:07,440
everybody else and there's two kind of
 

2643
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,270
everybody else and there's two kind of
values there's one kind of value is

2644
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
values there's one kind of value is
 

2645
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,030
values there's one kind of value is
things that are good for the group like

2646
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
things that are good for the group like
 

2647
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,750
things that are good for the group like
thou shalt not murder

2648
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:13,760
thou shalt not murder
 

2649
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,910
thou shalt not murder
and the other kind of value is things

2650
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:15,920
and the other kind of value is things
 

2651
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,190
and the other kind of value is things
that are good for

2652
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:17,200
that are good for
 

2653
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,349
that are good for
the males

2654
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:19,359
the males
 

2655
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,750
the males
such as hey guess what when good food

2656
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
such as hey guess what when good food
 

2657
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,109
such as hey guess what when good food
comes in males get it first yes

2658
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:25,119
comes in males get it first yes
 

2659
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,950
comes in males get it first yes
so i mean it's fascinating that that

2660
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:26,960
so i mean it's fascinating that that
 

2661
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,549
so i mean it's fascinating that that
kind of set of ideals could out-compete

2662
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
kind of set of ideals could out-compete
 

2663
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:32,790
kind of set of ideals could out-compete
the the others

2664
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:32,800
the the others
 

2665
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,109
the the others
do you have a sense of why

2666
00:48:35,109 --> 00:48:35,119
do you have a sense of why
 

2667
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:37,270
do you have a sense of why
or maybe you can comment on neanderthals

2668
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:37,280
or maybe you can comment on neanderthals
 

2669
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,910
or maybe you can comment on neanderthals
and all the other early humans why did

2670
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:39,920
and all the other early humans why did
 

2671
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,069
and all the other early humans why did

people are much more inclined to say
 

2727
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:43,670
people are much more inclined to say
well the neanderthals were at low

well the neanderthals were at low
 

2729
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,470
well the neanderthals were at low

or the disease came in and you know
 

2739
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:55,430
or the disease came in and you know
maybe those things

2740
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:55,440
maybe those things
 

2741
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,270
maybe those things
might have been important but

00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
might have been important but
 

2743
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,109
might have been important but
you know far and away the most obvious

00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
you know far and away the most obvious
 

2745
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,910
you know far and away the most obvious
possibility is that

possibility is that
 

2747
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,270
possibility is that
sapiens were just

2749
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,549

everyone agrees they had larger groups

everyone agrees they had larger groups
 

2755
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,270
everyone agrees they had larger groups
they had better weapons uh they they had

you know nowadays there's
 

2769
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:29,030
you know nowadays there's
evidence of of interbreeding uh quite

2770
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:29,040
evidence of of interbreeding uh quite
 

2771

evidence of of interbreeding uh quite
extensive interbreeding between sapiens

extensive interbreeding between sapiens
 

2773
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,750
extensive interbreeding between sapiens

if you just follow through from
 

2791
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,950
if you just follow through from
typical ethnographies nowadays of when

groups they didn't know each other
 

2797
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,430
groups they didn't know each other
then uh you can imagine that

2798
00:50:59,430 --> 00:50:59,440
then uh you can imagine that
 

2799
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,030
then uh you can imagine that
neanderthal females would essentially be

2800

neanderthal females would essentially be
 

2801
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,230
neanderthal females would essentially be
captured

maybe you can comment on this

2808
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,280
maybe you can comment on this
 

2809
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,309
maybe you can comment on this
uh cautiously

2810
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:12,319
uh cautiously
 

2811
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,430
uh cautiously
and eloquently what's the role of sexual

2812
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:15,440
and eloquently what's the role of sexual
 

2813
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,390
and eloquently what's the role of sexual
violence in human evolution because you

00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
violence in human evolution because you
 

2815
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,069
violence in human evolution because you
mentioned taking

00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:20,079
mentioned taking
 

2817
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,829
mentioned taking
neanderthal females you've also

2818

neanderthal females you've also
 

2819
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,910
neanderthal females you've also
mentioned that some of these rules are

2820
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:23,920
mentioned that some of these rules are
 

2821
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,510
mentioned that some of these rules are
defined by the

2822

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,710
uh by the male side of the society
what's the role of sexual violence in

00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:30,720
what's the role of sexual violence in
 

2827
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,950
what's the role of sexual violence in
this story

2828

this story
 

2829
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,990
this story
i think you've got to distinguish

2830
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:34,000
i think you've got to distinguish
 

2831
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,510
i think you've got to distinguish
between groups and within groups

2832
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:37,520
between groups and within groups
 

2833
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,510
between groups and within groups

and
 

2835
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,990
and
you know i think where the world has

2836
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,000
you know i think where the world has
 

2837
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,390
you know i think where the world has
been slowly waking up over the last

2838
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400

2927
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,549
and gatherers would typically have felt
which would have been that if we attack

which would have been that if we attack
 

2929

away with it
nowadays

2934
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:22,960
nowadays
 

2935
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,790
nowadays
uh you know you're sent in across the

2936
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
uh you know you're sent in across the
 

2937
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,870
uh you know you're sent in across the
somme or whatever it is and and there's

2943
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,630
and that's totally unnatural and a novel
evolutionary experience i think

2944
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:34,640
evolutionary experience i think
 

2945
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,390
evolutionary experience i think
then there's sexual coercion within

2946
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
then there's sexual coercion within
 

2947

and um

2950
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
and um
 

2951
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,950
and um
so that takes various kinds of forms

2952
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
so that takes various kinds of forms
 

2953
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,950
so that takes various kinds of forms
you know but nowadays of course i think

2954
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:44,960
you know but nowadays of course i think
 

2955
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,990
you know but nowadays of course i think
people recognize increasingly that

2956
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
people recognize increasingly that
 

2957
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,510
people recognize increasingly that
the principal form of

00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:05,030
you know statistically important there's
much more

but what they're doing is
 

3009
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,910
but what they're doing is
intimidating someone

3010
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
intimidating someone
 

3011
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,870
intimidating someone
in a relationship in which the relative

3012
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:48,880
in a relationship in which the relative
 

3013
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,430
in a relationship in which the relative
power in the relationship has continuing

3014
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
power in the relationship has continuing
 

3015
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,230
power in the relationship has continuing
significance uh for a long time

3016
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:54,240
significance uh for a long time
 

3017
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,270
significance uh for a long time
and that power probably goes well beyond

3018
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:57,280
and that power probably goes well beyond
 

3019
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,990
and that power probably goes well beyond
uh just the sexual you know it's it's to

3020
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:00,000
uh just the sexual you know it's it's to

the man getting his his own way all the
 

3027
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:08,710
the man getting his his own way all the
way it's power dynamics and uh the

3028
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:08,720
way it's power dynamics and uh the
 

3029
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,430
way it's power dynamics and uh the
sexual aggression is one of the tools to

3030
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
sexual aggression is one of the tools to
 

3031
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,990
sexual aggression is one of the tools to
regain power gain power gain more power

3032
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:14,000
regain power gain power gain more power
 

3033
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,670
regain power gain power gain more power
and that kind of thing yeah

3034
00:55:15,670 --> 00:55:15,680
and that kind of thing yeah
 

3035
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,109
and that kind of thing yeah
exactly and and in that respect

3036
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
exactly and and in that respect
 

3037
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:22,230
exactly and and in that respect
um it's worth noting that

3038
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:22,240
um it's worth noting that
 

3039
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,549
um it's worth noting that
although this wasn't appreciated uh for

3040
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
although this wasn't appreciated uh for
 

3041
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:27,349
although this wasn't appreciated uh for
some time it's it's emerging that in a

3042
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:27,359
some time it's it's emerging that in a
 

3043
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,950
some time it's it's emerging that in a
bunch of primates you have somewhat

3044
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:28,960
bunch of primates you have somewhat
 

3045
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,710
bunch of primates you have somewhat
similar

3046
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
similar
 

3047
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,589
similar
somewhat parallel kinds of sexual

3048
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:33,599
somewhat parallel kinds of sexual
 

3049
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,870
somewhat parallel kinds of sexual
intimidation

3050
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:34,880
intimidation
 

3051
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,190
intimidation
where males will target particular

3052
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:37,200
where males will target particular
 

3053
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,870
where males will target particular
females even in a

3054
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:38,880
females even in a
 

3055
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,190
females even in a
group in which the norm is for females

3056
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,200
group in which the norm is for females
 

3057
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,349
group in which the norm is for females
to mate with multiple males

3058
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:43,359
to mate with multiple males
 

3059
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,349
to mate with multiple males
but each male will target a particular

3060
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:45,359
but each male will target a particular
 

3061
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:46,950
but each male will target a particular
female and

3062
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:46,960
female and
 

3063
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,430
female and
the more he is aggressive towards her

3064
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
the more he is aggressive towards her
 

3065
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,270
the more he is aggressive towards her
then the more she

3066
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:51,280
then the more she
 

3067
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,230
then the more she
conforms to his wishes when he wants to

3068
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
conforms to his wishes when he wants to
 

3069
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:55,190
conforms to his wishes when he wants to
mate

3070
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:55,200
mate
 

3071
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,870
mate
so a long-term pattern of sexual

3072
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
so a long-term pattern of sexual
 

3073
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,710
so a long-term pattern of sexual
intimidation

3074
00:55:58,710 --> 00:55:58,720
intimidation
 

3075
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,870
intimidation
so there's that aspect the other aspect

3076
00:56:00,870 --> 00:56:00,880
so there's that aspect the other aspect
 

3077
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,990
so there's that aspect the other aspect
i would just just note is that

3078
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
i would just just note is that
 

3079
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,630
i would just just note is that
males

3080
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640

 

3081
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,150

get away with a lot compared to females

3082
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,160
get away with a lot compared to females
 

3083
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,390
get away with a lot compared to females
in the any kind of intersexual conflict

3084
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:14,400
in the any kind of intersexual conflict

um
you know so the punishment uh

3088
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:18,160
you know so the punishment uh
 

3089
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,910
you know so the punishment uh
here's one example of this the

3090
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
here's one example of this the

00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
um and and you see similar sorts of
 

3099
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,990
um and and you see similar sorts of
things in terms of the punishments for

3100
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:34,000
things in terms of the punishments for

and so on and
 

3105
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,109
and so on and
i bring this up in the context of

3106
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:41,119
i bring this up in the context of
 

3107
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:42,950
i bring this up in the context of
of males

3108
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:42,960
of males
 

3109
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:46,789
of males
sexually intimidating uh their partners

3110
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:46,799
sexually intimidating uh their partners
 

3111
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,549
sexually intimidating uh their partners
may be wives or or whoever

3112

may be wives or or whoever
 

3113
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,430
may be wives or or whoever
because it's a reminder that

3114
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
because it's a reminder that
 

3115
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,670
because it's a reminder that
it's basically a patriarchal world that

3116
00:56:55,670 --> 00:56:55,680
it's basically a patriarchal world that
 

3117
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,589
it's basically a patriarchal world that
we have come from

3118
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
we have come from
 

3119
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,069
we have come from
a patriarchal world in which

3120
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
a patriarchal world in which
 

3121
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,910
a patriarchal world in which
male alliances

3122
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:01,920
male alliances
 

3123
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,990
male alliances
tend to support males

3124
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
tend to support males
 

3125
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,390
tend to support males
and take advantage of the fact that they

3126
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:06,400
and take advantage of the fact that they
 

3127
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,470
and take advantage of the fact that they
have political power at the expense of

3128
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
have political power at the expense of
 

3129
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,589
have political power at the expense of
females

3130
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:09,599
females
 

3131
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,829
females
and i would say that that all goes back

3132
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
and i would say that that all goes back
 

3133
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,270
and i would say that that all goes back
to what happened three to four hundred

3134
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,280
to what happened three to four hundred
 

3135
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,630
to what happened three to four hundred
thousand years ago

3136
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:14,640
thousand years ago
 

3137
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,870
thousand years ago
when the beta males took charge and they

3138
00:57:16,870 --> 00:57:16,880
when the beta males took charge and they
 

3139
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:19,510
when the beta males took charge and they
started imposing their own norms on

3140
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:19,520
started imposing their own norms on
 

3141
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:21,349
started imposing their own norms on
society as a whole and they've continued

3142
00:57:21,349 --> 00:57:21,359
society as a whole and they've continued
 

3143
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,430
society as a whole and they've continued
to do so and you we now look at

3144
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
to do so and you we now look at
 

3145
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,430
to do so and you we now look at
ourselves and you know jordan peterson

3146
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
ourselves and you know jordan peterson
 

3147
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,710
ourselves and you know jordan peterson
says we are not a patriarchal society

3148
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:28,720
says we are not a patriarchal society
 

3149
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,030
says we are not a patriarchal society
well you know it's true that the laws

3150
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,040
well you know it's true that the laws
 

3151
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,670
well you know it's true that the laws
try and make it even-handed nowadays

3152
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
try and make it even-handed nowadays
 

3153
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,829
try and make it even-handed nowadays
between males and females but obviously

3154
00:57:35,829 --> 00:57:35,839
between males and females but obviously
 

3155
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,710
between males and females but obviously
we are patriarchal de facto

3156
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
we are patriarchal de facto
 

3157
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,230
we are patriarchal de facto
because society still in many ways uh

3158
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
because society still in many ways uh
 

3159
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,430
because society still in many ways uh
supports

3160
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:43,440
supports

men better than it supports women in
 

3165
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,349
men better than it supports women in

if we're looking
 

3173
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:56,069
if we're looking
at the evolutionary history okay is

3174
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
at the evolutionary history okay is
 

3175
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,390
at the evolutionary history okay is
there uh maybe sticking on jordan for a

3176
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:58,400
there uh maybe sticking on jordan for a
 

3177
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,950
there uh maybe sticking on jordan for a
second is is there

3178
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
second is is there
 

3179
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:01,910
second is is there
um

3180
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:01,920
um
 

3181
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,589
um
so he's a psychologist right and

3182
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599

 

3183
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,109

what part of the picture do you think

3184
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
what part of the picture do you think
 

3185
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:13,030
what part of the picture do you think
he's missing in analyzing

3186
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,040

 

3187
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,990

the human relations

3188
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,000
the human relations
 

3189
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,390
the human relations
like what needs what does he need to

3190
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
like what needs what does he need to
 

3191
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,069
like what needs what does he need to
understand

3192
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:20,079
understand
 

3193
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,630
understand
about our origins and violence and the

3194
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:22,640
about our origins and violence and the
 

3195
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,030
about our origins and violence and the
way the society has been constructed oh

3196
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:25,040
way the society has been constructed oh
 

3197
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,870
way the society has been constructed oh
i i don't want to

3198
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:26,880
i i don't want to
 

3199
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,950
i i don't want to
go deep into into his

3200
00:58:28,950 --> 00:58:28,960
go deep into into his
 

3201
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,789
go deep into into his
missing perspectives you know but i just

3202
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
missing perspectives you know but i just
 

3203
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:31,750
missing perspectives you know but i just
think that

3204
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:31,760
think that
 

3205
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,030
think that
um

3206
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,040
um
 

3207
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,270
um
that what he's doing in that particular

3208
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:35,280
that what he's doing in that particular
 

3209
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,710
that what he's doing in that particular
example is

3210
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
example is
 

3211
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,950
example is
uh focusing on the legalistic position

3212
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:40,960
uh focusing on the legalistic position
 

3213
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,230
uh focusing on the legalistic position
and that's great

3214
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
and that's great
 

3215
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,670
and that's great
that um you know you do not find

3216
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:45,680
that um you know you do not find
 

3217
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,630
that um you know you do not find
uh formal patriarchy in the law anything

3218
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:48,640
uh formal patriarchy in the law anything
 

3219
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,349
uh formal patriarchy in the law anything
like to the extent that you could find

3220
00:58:51,349 --> 00:58:51,359
like to the extent that you could find
 

3221
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:52,950
like to the extent that you could find
it 100 years ago

3222
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
it 100 years ago
 

3223
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,309
it 100 years ago
and so on you know women have got the

3224
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
and so on you know women have got the
 

3225
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,789
and so on you know women have got the
vote now hooray but it took a long time

3226
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
vote now hooray but it took a long time
 

3227
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,549
vote now hooray but it took a long time
for women to get the vote

3228
00:58:58,549 --> 00:58:58,559
for women to get the vote
 

3229
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,150
for women to get the vote
and um you know it remains the case

3230
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:02,160
and um you know it remains the case
 

3231
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,109
and um you know it remains the case
that

3232
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
that
 

3233
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,710
that
um

3234
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:04,720
um
 

3235
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:05,829
um
the women

3236
00:59:05,829 --> 00:59:05,839
the women
 

3237
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,390
the women
suffer in in various uh kinds of ways

3238

suffer in in various uh kinds of ways
 

3239
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,069
suffer in in various uh kinds of ways
you know you know

3240
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:10,079
you know you know
 

3241
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,109
you know you know
a woman who is

3242
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:13,119

 

3243
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,549

uh has lots of sexual partners uh is uh

3244

uh has lots of sexual partners uh is uh
treated much more rudely than a male who

3246
00:59:18,549 --> 00:59:18,559
treated much more rudely than a male who
 

3247
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,710
treated much more rudely than a male who
has lots of sexual partners

3248

has lots of sexual partners
 

3249
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:23,030
has lots of sexual partners
uh there are all sorts of informal ways

3250
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
uh there are all sorts of informal ways
 

3251
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,670
uh there are all sorts of informal ways
in which uh it's a rougher being a woman

3252
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:25,680
in which uh it's a rougher being a woman
 

3253
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,109
in which uh it's a rougher being a woman
than it is a man

3254
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:27,119
than it is a man
 

3255
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:28,789
than it is a man
and uh if we look at

3256
00:59:28,789 --> 00:59:28,799
and uh if we look at
 

3257
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:30,710
and uh if we look at
the surface layer

3258
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:30,720
the surface layer
 

3259
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,470
the surface layer
of uh the law

3260
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:32,480
of uh the law
 

3261
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,950
of uh the law
we may miss the deeper

3262
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:34,960
we may miss the deeper
 

3263
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,030
we may miss the deeper
human nature

3264
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:37,040
human nature
 

3265
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:37,990
human nature
uh

3266
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
uh
 

3267
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,069
uh
like the origins of our human nature

3268
00:59:40,069 --> 00:59:40,079
like the origins of our human nature
 

3269
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,750
like the origins of our human nature
that still operates no matter what the

3270
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
that still operates no matter what the
 

3271
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,069
that still operates no matter what the
law says yeah

3272
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:44,079
law says yeah
 

3273
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:45,510
law says yeah
which is

3274
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:45,520
which is
 

3275
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,750
which is
you know human nature is awkward because

3276
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:47,760
you know human nature is awkward because
 

3277
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,510
you know human nature is awkward because
uh it includes

3278
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
uh it includes
 

3279
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,150
uh it includes
some unpleasant features that uh when we

3280
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
some unpleasant features that uh when we
 

3281
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,230
some unpleasant features that uh when we
sit back and reflect about them uh we

3282
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:54,240
sit back and reflect about them uh we
 

3283
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:55,349
sit back and reflect about them uh we
would like to

3284
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
would like to
 

3285
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,750
would like to
uh them to go away yeah

3286
00:59:57,750 --> 00:59:57,760
uh them to go away yeah
 

3287
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,390
uh them to go away yeah
but it remains the fact that

3288
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:00,400
but it remains the fact that
 

3289
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,430
but it remains the fact that
men

3290
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:01,440
men
 

3291
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,510
men
are

3292
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:03,520
are
 

3293
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,390
are
hugely concerned to try and

3294
01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:06,400
hugely concerned to try and
 

3295
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,230
hugely concerned to try and
have sex with

3296
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:08,240
have sex with
 

3297
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,549
have sex with
um

3298
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
um
 

3299
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,870
um
at least one woman and you know often

3300
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:12,880
at least one woman and you know often
 

3301
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,789
at least one woman and you know often
lots of women yeah and so women are con

3302
01:00:14,789 --> 01:00:14,799
lots of women yeah and so women are con
 

3303
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,710
lots of women yeah and so women are con
men are constantly putting pressure on

3304
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:16,720
men are constantly putting pressure on
 

3305
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,150
men are constantly putting pressure on
women in

3306
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:18,160
women in
 

3307
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,069
women in
ways that women find unpleasant and if

3308
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
ways that women find unpleasant and if
 

3309
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,589
ways that women find unpleasant and if
men sit back and reflect about it they

3310
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
men sit back and reflect about it they
 

3311
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,950
men sit back and reflect about it they
think yeah we shouldn't do this but

3312
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:22,960
think yeah we shouldn't do this but
 

3313
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:24,870
think yeah we shouldn't do this but
actually just it just goes on because of

3314
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:24,880
actually just it just goes on because of
 

3315
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:26,150
actually just it just goes on because of
human nature

3316
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
human nature
 

3317
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,430
human nature
so maybe looking at particular humans in

3318
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:29,440
so maybe looking at particular humans in
 

3319
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,710
so maybe looking at particular humans in
history uh let's talk about genghis khan

3320
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:32,720
history uh let's talk about genghis khan
 

3321
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,430
history uh let's talk about genghis khan
so

3322
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
so
 

3323
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,870
so
is uh this particular human who was

3324
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:36,880
is uh this particular human who was
 

3325
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:40,309
is uh this particular human who was
one of the most famous examples of

3326
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:40,319
one of the most famous examples of
 

3327
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:43,349
one of the most famous examples of
a large-scale violence is he a deep

3328
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:43,359
a large-scale violence is he a deep
 

3329
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:46,150
a large-scale violence is he a deep
representative of human nature or is he

3330
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:46,160
representative of human nature or is he
 

3331
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,829
representative of human nature or is he
a rare exception

3332
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:47,839
a rare exception
 

3333
01:00:47,839 --> 01:00:48,789
a rare exception
well

3334
01:00:48,789 --> 01:00:48,799
well
 

3335
01:00:48,799 --> 01:00:52,069
well
i think that

3336
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:52,079

 

3337
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,390

it's easy to imagine that

3338
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
it's easy to imagine that
 

3339
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,630

01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,520
because he wanted to sell it on the
 

3673
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,430
because he wanted to sell it on the
market in order to be able to build up

3674
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:57,440
market in order to be able to build up
 

3675
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,270
market in order to be able to build up
the power of

3676
01:06:59,270 --> 01:06:59,280
the power of
 

3677
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,710
the power of
the soviet union

3678
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
the soviet union
 

3679
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:02,710
the soviet union
you know alternative view of communism

3680
01:07:02,710 --> 01:07:02,720
you know alternative view of communism
 

3681
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,789
you know alternative view of communism
might have been well you know

3682
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:04,799
might have been well you know
 

3683
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:07,029
might have been well you know
let's just make sure everybody survives

3684
01:07:07,029 --> 01:07:07,039
let's just make sure everybody survives
 

3685
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,950
let's just make sure everybody survives
and make sure everybody has enough to

3686
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:08,960
and make sure everybody has enough to
 

3687
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,910
and make sure everybody has enough to
eat and we'll all be mutually supportive

3688
01:07:11,910 --> 01:07:11,920
eat and we'll all be mutually supportive
 

3689
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,069
eat and we'll all be mutually supportive
in a communal network but no but he

3690
01:07:14,069 --> 01:07:14,079
in a communal network but no but he
 

3691
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,309
in a communal network but no but he
wanted the power for the country well i

3692
01:07:16,309 --> 01:07:16,319
wanted the power for the country well i
 

3693
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:18,470
wanted the power for the country well i
guess exactly so that it's not even

3694
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:18,480
guess exactly so that it's not even
 

3695
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,309
guess exactly so that it's not even
communism the set of ideas or like

3696
01:07:20,309 --> 01:07:20,319
communism the set of ideas or like
 

3697
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,990
communism the set of ideas or like
marxism or something like that it's the

3698
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
marxism or something like that it's the
 

3699
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,950
marxism or something like that it's the
country i guess what i'm saying is uh

3700
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
country i guess what i'm saying is uh
 

3701
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,069
country i guess what i'm saying is uh
it's not

3702
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
it's not
 

3703
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,670
it's not
purely power for the individual

3704
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:29,680
purely power for the individual
 

3705
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,069
purely power for the individual
it's power for a vision for this great

3706
01:07:32,069 --> 01:07:32,079
it's power for a vision for this great
 

3707
01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:33,270
it's power for a vision for this great
nation

3708
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
nation
 

3709
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,750
nation
the soviet union yeah and similar with

3710
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
the soviet union yeah and similar with
 

3711
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,270
the soviet union yeah and similar with
hitler

3712
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:37,280
hitler
 

3713
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,190
hitler
the guy believed

3714
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:39,200
the guy believed
 

3715
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,390
the guy believed
that this is a great nation germany and

3716
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
that this is a great nation germany and
 

3717
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,589
that this is a great nation germany and
like they it it's a nation that's been

3718
01:07:45,589 --> 01:07:45,599
like they it it's a nation that's been
 

3719
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,069
like they it it's a nation that's been
wronged throughout history and needs to

3720
01:07:48,069 --> 01:07:48,079
wronged throughout history and needs to
 

3721
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:49,829
wronged throughout history and needs to
be righted

3722
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:49,839
be righted
 

3723
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:51,589
be righted
and there's some

3724
01:07:51,589 --> 01:07:51,599
and there's some
 

3725
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:54,470
and there's some
dance between the individual human and

3726
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
dance between the individual human and
 

3727
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:57,910
dance between the individual human and
the tribe yes no absolutely yes and so

3728
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:57,920
the tribe yes no absolutely yes and so
 

3729
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,069
the tribe yes no absolutely yes and so
so just like chimpanzees uh you know we

3730
01:08:00,069 --> 01:08:00,079
so just like chimpanzees uh you know we
 

3731
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,990
so just like chimpanzees uh you know we
are fiercely tribal

3732
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:02,000
are fiercely tribal
 

3733
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,990
are fiercely tribal
and the tribalism uh resides

3734
01:08:03,990 --> 01:08:04,000
and the tribalism uh resides
 

3735
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,870
and the tribalism uh resides
particularly in male psychology

3736
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:06,880
particularly in male psychology
 

3737
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:10,069
particularly in male psychology
and uh it's it's very scary because once

3738
01:08:10,069 --> 01:08:10,079
and uh it's it's very scary because once
 

3739
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:11,829
and uh it's it's very scary because once
you assemble

3740
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:11,839
you assemble
 

3741
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,270
you assemble
a

3742
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:13,280
a
 

3743
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,270
a
set of males who

3744
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:15,280
set of males who
 

3745
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:17,910
set of males who
share tribal identity then they have

3746
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:17,920
share tribal identity then they have
 

3747
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:22,149
share tribal identity then they have
power that they can exert

3748
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:22,159
power that they can exert
 

3749
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:23,189
power that they can exert
with

3750
01:08:23,189 --> 01:08:23,199
with
 

3751
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:25,030
with
very little

3752
01:08:25,030 --> 01:08:25,040
very little
 

3753
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:26,709
very little
concern about what they're doing to

3754
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:26,719
concern about what they're doing to
 

3755
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,030
concern about what they're doing to
damage other people

3756
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
damage other people
 

3757
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:30,550
damage other people
do you think this

3758
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
do you think this
 

3759
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,829
do you think this
so nietzsche

3760
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:31,839
so nietzsche
 

3761
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,749
so nietzsche
will to power

3762
01:08:33,749 --> 01:08:33,759
will to power
 

3763
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,669
will to power
we talked about the corrupting nature of

3764
01:08:35,669 --> 01:08:35,679
we talked about the corrupting nature of
 

3765
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:36,709
we talked about the corrupting nature of
power do you think that's a

3766
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:36,719
power do you think that's a
 

3767
01:08:36,719 --> 01:08:38,630
power do you think that's a
manifestation

3768
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:38,640
manifestation
 

3769
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:40,149
manifestation
of those

3770
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
of those
 

3771
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,789
of those
uh early origins of violence

3772
01:08:42,789 --> 01:08:42,799
uh early origins of violence
 

3773
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:44,789
uh early origins of violence
what's the connection of this desire for

3774
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
what's the connection of this desire for
 

3775
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:45,990
what's the connection of this desire for
power

3776
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:46,000
power
 

3777
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,910
power
and our proclivity for violence

3778
01:08:49,910 --> 01:08:49,920
and our proclivity for violence
 

3779
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,550
and our proclivity for violence
you know what we're talking about is um

3780
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:52,560
you know what we're talking about is um
 

3781
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,390
you know what we're talking about is um
tribal power right power on behalf of a

3782
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
tribal power right power on behalf of a
 

3783
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,110
tribal power right power on behalf of a
group yes and uh yeah that seems to me

3784
01:08:59,110 --> 01:08:59,120
group yes and uh yeah that seems to me
 

3785
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:01,829
group yes and uh yeah that seems to me
to go right back to

3786
01:09:01,829 --> 01:09:01,839
to go right back to
 

3787
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:04,390
to go right back to
a deep evolutionary origin

3788
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:04,400
a deep evolutionary origin
 

3789
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:06,630
a deep evolutionary origin
because you see essentially the same

3790
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
because you see essentially the same
 

3791
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,309
because you see essentially the same
thing in uh in a whole bunch of animals

3792
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:10,319
thing in uh in a whole bunch of animals
 

3793
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,789
thing in uh in a whole bunch of animals
you know they that most

3794
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:12,799
you know they that most
 

3795
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,030
you know they that most
uh of the sort of

3796
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:15,040
uh of the sort of
 

3797
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:17,269
uh of the sort of
cognitively complex animals live in

3798
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:17,279
cognitively complex animals live in
 

3799
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,430
cognitively complex animals live in
social groups in which they have tribal

3800
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:19,440
social groups in which they have tribal
 

3801
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,910
social groups in which they have tribal
boundaries

3802
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920

 

3803
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,349

and

3804
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
and
 

3805
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,229
and
so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed

3806
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:26,239
so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed
 

3807
01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:28,870
so what you see in chimpanzees is echoed
in almost all of the primates the

3808
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:28,880
in almost all of the primates the
 

3809
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:30,789
in almost all of the primates the
difference between

3810
01:09:30,789 --> 01:09:30,799
difference between
 

3811
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,550
difference between
us and

3812
01:09:32,550 --> 01:09:32,560
us and
 

3813
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,470
us and
chimpanzees and humans on the one hand

3814
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:34,480
chimpanzees and humans on the one hand
 

3815
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:37,510
chimpanzees and humans on the one hand
and other primates on the other

3816
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:37,520
and other primates on the other
 

3817
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,349
and other primates on the other
is that we kill and they don't and the

3818
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:39,359
is that we kill and they don't and the
 

3819
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,590
is that we kill and they don't and the
reason they don't is because

3820
01:09:41,590 --> 01:09:41,600
reason they don't is because
 

3821
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,829
reason they don't is because
they never meet in the context where

3822
01:09:43,829 --> 01:09:43,839
they never meet in the context where
 

3823
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:46,789
they never meet in the context where
there are massive imbalances of power

3824
01:09:46,789 --> 01:09:46,799
there are massive imbalances of power
 

3825
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:47,669
there are massive imbalances of power
so

3826
01:09:47,669 --> 01:09:47,679
so
 

3827
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,189
so
two groups of baboons you know there's

3828
01:09:49,189 --> 01:09:49,199
two groups of baboons you know there's
 

3829
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:50,229
two groups of baboons you know there's
30 on

3830
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
30 on
 

3831
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:52,470
30 on
this side and 50 on this side fine

3832
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:52,480
this side and 50 on this side fine
 

3833
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,310
this side and 50 on this side fine
nobody's going to try and kill anybody

3834
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:54,320
nobody's going to try and kill anybody
 

3835
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:55,830
nobody's going to try and kill anybody

01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:02,960
but nevertheless they are tribal so
 

3841
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:05,270
but nevertheless they are tribal so
you know they will have

3842
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,280
you know they will have
 

3843
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,270
you know they will have
fairly intense intergroup interactions

3844
01:10:07,270 --> 01:10:07,280
fairly intense intergroup interactions
 

3845
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:08,149
fairly intense intergroup interactions
uh

3846
01:10:08,149 --> 01:10:08,159
uh
 

3847
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:10,550
uh
in which everybody knows whose side is

3848
01:10:10,550 --> 01:10:10,560
in which everybody knows whose side is
 

3849
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,990

on who is on whose side and um
 

3851
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,110

the long-term consequences of

3852
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:17,120
the long-term consequences of
 

3853
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:21,030
the long-term consequences of
winning those battles non-lethal battles

3854
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:21,040
winning those battles non-lethal battles
 

3855
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,950
winning those battles non-lethal battles
is that the dominance i get access to

3856
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
is that the dominance i get access to
 

3857
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,189
is that the dominance i get access to
larger areas of land

3858
01:10:27,189 --> 01:10:27,199
larger areas of land
 

3859
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:32,390
larger areas of land
more safety and so on with chances are

3860
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:32,400

 

3861
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,870

better

3862
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:34,880

do you think this from an evolutionary

3868
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:42,080
do you think this from an evolutionary
 

3869
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:46,390
do you think this from an evolutionary
perspective is a feature or a bug our

3870
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:46,400
perspective is a feature or a bug our
 

3871
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,750
perspective is a feature or a bug our
natural

3872
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:47,760
natural
 

3873
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,630
natural
sort of tendency to form tribes

3874
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
sort of tendency to form tribes
 

3875
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,790
sort of tendency to form tribes
so what's a bug

3876
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
so what's a bug
 

3877
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,950
so what's a bug
oh sorry this is a computer uh

3878
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
oh sorry this is a computer uh
 

3879
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,669
oh sorry this is a computer uh
programming analogy

3880
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679
programming analogy
 

3881
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:01,189
programming analogy
meaning like

3882
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:01,199

 

3883
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:03,350

it would be more beneficial

3884
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,360
it would be more beneficial
 

3885
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,149
it would be more beneficial
is it beneficial or detrimental

3886
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
is it beneficial or detrimental
 

3887
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,550
is it beneficial or detrimental
to form tribes from an evolutionary

3888
01:11:08,550 --> 01:11:08,560
to form tribes from an evolutionary
 

3889
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,870
to form tribes from an evolutionary
perspective yeah yeah but but but

3890
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
perspective yeah yeah but but but
 

3891
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:12,229
perspective yeah yeah but but but
what is that what does it mean what does

3892
01:11:12,229 --> 01:11:12,239
what is that what does it mean what does
 

3893
01:11:12,239 --> 01:11:15,110
what is that what does it mean what does
a bug mean yes right i mean

3894
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
a bug mean yes right i mean
 

3895
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:16,790
a bug mean yes right i mean
well yeah it's like where's evolution

3896
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
well yeah it's like where's evolution
 

3897
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,110
well yeah it's like where's evolution
going it's beneficial from you know it's

3898
01:11:19,110 --> 01:11:19,120
going it's beneficial from you know it's
 

3899
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,709
going it's beneficial from you know it's
beneficial in the sense that it evolved

3900
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
beneficial in the sense that it evolved
 

3901
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:22,390
beneficial in the sense that it evolved
by natural selection

3902
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:22,400
by natural selection
 

3903
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:24,390
by natural selection
to be to benefit the individuals who did

3904
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:24,400
to be to benefit the individuals who did
 

3905
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,510
to be to benefit the individuals who did
it yes but if you if by bug you mean

3906
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:27,520
it yes but if you if by bug you mean
 

3907
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,590
it yes but if you if by bug you mean
something that from the point of view of

3908
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:29,600
something that from the point of view of
 

3909
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,870
something that from the point of view of
the species it would be great if you

3910
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:30,880
the species it would be great if you
 

3911
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,630
the species it would be great if you
could just wipe this out right because

3912
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
could just wipe this out right because
 

3913
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,790
could just wipe this out right because
the species would somehow do better yes

3914
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
the species would somehow do better yes
 

3915
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:35,910
the species would somehow do better yes
as a result

3916
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
as a result
 

3917
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:37,750
as a result
then yes but but then you know males are

3918
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760
then yes but but then you know males are
 

3919
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,790
then yes but but then you know males are
a bug

3920
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:40,800
a bug
 

3921
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,669
a bug
oh come on now it's uh

3922
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
oh come on now it's uh
 

3923
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,830
oh come on now it's uh
there's some nice things to males

3924
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
there's some nice things to males
 

3925
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,470
there's some nice things to males
uh speaking as a male i the fact that

3926
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:48,480
uh speaking as a male i the fact that
 

3927
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,070
uh speaking as a male i the fact that
there are some nice things to males

3928
01:11:50,070 --> 01:11:50,080
there are some nice things to males
 

3929
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,910
there are some nice things to males
doesn't mean that they're not bugs you

3930
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:51,920
doesn't mean that they're not bugs you
 

3931
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,910
doesn't mean that they're not bugs you
know maybe they're quite nice bugs but

3932
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:53,920
know maybe they're quite nice bugs but
 

3933
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,830
know maybe they're quite nice bugs but
it'll be much better for the species as

3934
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:55,840
it'll be much better for the species as
 

3935
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,630
it'll be much better for the species as
a whole not to have to have males who

3936
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
a whole not to have to have males who
 

3937
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:01,110
a whole not to have to have males who
impose this violence on the species as a

3938
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:01,120
impose this violence on the species as a
 

3939
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:02,870
impose this violence on the species as a
whole yeah

3940
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:02,880
whole yeah
 

3941
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,550
whole yeah
as somebody who practiced controlled

3942
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:04,560
as somebody who practiced controlled
 

3943
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,110
as somebody who practiced controlled
violence and doing a lot of martial arts

3944
01:12:07,110 --> 01:12:07,120
violence and doing a lot of martial arts
 

3945
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,830
violence and doing a lot of martial arts
yeah it uh i'm not sure

3946
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
yeah it uh i'm not sure
 

3947
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,390
yeah it uh i'm not sure
it does seem kind of fun to have this

3948
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
it does seem kind of fun to have this
 

3949
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,189
it does seem kind of fun to have this
kind of controlled violence also sports

3950
01:12:15,189 --> 01:12:15,199
kind of controlled violence also sports
 

3951
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:17,910
kind of controlled violence also sports
also i mean the question of conflict in

3952
01:12:17,910 --> 01:12:17,920
also i mean the question of conflict in
 

3953
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:19,510
also i mean the question of conflict in
general i guess that's the deeper

3954
01:12:19,510 --> 01:12:19,520
general i guess that's the deeper
 

3955
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:20,390
general i guess that's the deeper
question

3956
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
question
 

3957
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,390
question
don't you think there's some value to

3958
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:22,400
don't you think there's some value to
 

3959
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,229
don't you think there's some value to
conflict

3960

conflict
 

3961
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:26,709

for the improvement of society for
 

3963
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,350
for the improvement of society for
progress that that this tension between

01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:29,360
progress that that this tension between
 

3965
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,950
progress that that this tension between
tribes

3966
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:30,960
tribes
 

3967
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,070
tribes
isn't this

3968
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:32,080
isn't this
 

3969
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,110
isn't this
like

3970
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,120
like
 

3971
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,110
like
uh experiment

3972
01:12:35,110 --> 01:12:35,120
uh experiment
 

3973
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,110
uh experiment
a continued experiment will conduct with

3974
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,120
a continued experiment will conduct with
 

3975
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,790
a continued experiment will conduct with
each other to figure out what is a

each other to figure out what is a
 

3977
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,110
each other to figure out what is a
better world to build like you need that

3978
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:41,120
better world to build like you need that

3983
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,750

to go to war with each other it's like

3984
01:12:47,750 --> 01:12:47,760
to go to war with each other it's like
 

3985
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:50,630
to go to war with each other it's like
the united states with the 50 states and

the united states with the 50 states and

01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,990
the it's the laboratory of ideas
don't you think that is again feature

3990
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
don't you think that is again feature
 

3991
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,590
don't you think that is again feature
versus bug

versus bug
 

3993
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,430
versus bug
um it

3994
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
um it
 

3995
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,350
um it
this kind of conflict when it doesn't

3996
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
this kind of conflict when it doesn't
 

3997
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,870
this kind of conflict when it doesn't
get out of hand

3998
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
get out of hand
 

3999
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,870
get out of hand

i mean you can have conflict in the
 

4007
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:14,229
i mean you can have conflict in the
sense of people have different ideas

4008

sense of people have different ideas
about the solution to a problem and so

4010
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:17,120
about the solution to a problem and so
 

4011
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:19,270
about the solution to a problem and so
their ideas are in conflict they can sit

4012
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:19,280
their ideas are in conflict they can sit
 

4013
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:21,510
their ideas are in conflict they can sit
down with it and uh

4014
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:21,520
down with it and uh
 

4015
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,830
down with it and uh
on a log and chat about it and then

4016
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:23,840
on a log and chat about it and then
 

4017
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,390
on a log and chat about it and then
decide okay you're right or i'm wrong or

4018
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
decide okay you're right or i'm wrong or
 

4019
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:27,510
decide okay you're right or i'm wrong or
whatever

4020
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:27,520
whatever
 

4021
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:28,870
whatever
um

4022
01:13:28,870 --> 01:13:28,880
um
 

4023
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,310
um
but but if by conflict uh you mean a

4024
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:32,320
but but if by conflict uh you mean a
 

4025
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,470
but but if by conflict uh you mean a
great idea to build a nuclear bomb and

4026
01:13:34,470 --> 01:13:34,480
great idea to build a nuclear bomb and
 

4027
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:36,390
great idea to build a nuclear bomb and
set that off

4028
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:36,400
set that off
 

4029
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:37,189
set that off
then

4030
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
then
 

4031
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:39,189
then
no you know i don't see why it's a good

4032
01:13:39,189 --> 01:13:39,199
no you know i don't see why it's a good
 

4033
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:43,430
no you know i don't see why it's a good
idea to have all this violence

4034
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440

 

4035
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,709

yeah there's

4036
01:13:46,709 --> 01:13:46,719

 

4037
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:48,310

i i wonder

4038
01:13:48,310 --> 01:13:48,320
i i wonder
 

4039
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,470
i i wonder
i mean it's not a good idea but i wonder

4040
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
i mean it's not a good idea but i wonder
 

4041
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,550
i mean it's not a good idea but i wonder
if human history would evolve the way it

4042
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:52,560
if human history would evolve the way it
 

4043
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:54,870
if human history would evolve the way it
did without the violence

4044
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:54,880
did without the violence
 

4045
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,030
did without the violence
oh i'm sure you're you're right probably

4046
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
oh i'm sure you're you're right probably
 

4047
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:59,110
oh i'm sure you're you're right probably
uh humans would not have evolved in in

4048
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,120
uh humans would not have evolved in in
 

4049
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:00,550
uh humans would not have evolved in in
the sense that we have

4050
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:00,560
the sense that we have
 

4051
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:02,310
the sense that we have
but i would hope that

4052
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
but i would hope that
 

4053
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,790
but i would hope that
uh the course of

4054
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:04,800
uh the course of
 

4055
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:05,830
uh the course of
uh

4056
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
uh
 

4057
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,189
uh
violence

4058
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:07,199
violence
 

4059
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:09,669
violence
in evolution will continue in the way it

4060
01:14:09,669 --> 01:14:09,679
in evolution will continue in the way it
 

4061
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,870
in evolution will continue in the way it
has

4062
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:10,880
has
 

4063
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,229
has
so

4064
01:14:12,229 --> 01:14:12,239
so
 

4065
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,430
so
you know there's all sorts of

4066
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:13,440
you know there's all sorts of
 

4067
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,510
you know there's all sorts of
indications um

4068
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:15,520
indications um
 

4069
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,430
indications um
that the

4070
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:17,440
that the
 

4071
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,510
that the
importance of violence has been reduced

4072
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:19,520
importance of violence has been reduced
 

4073
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:21,750
importance of violence has been reduced
over time

4074
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:21,760
over time
 

4075
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:23,590
over time
and you know this is

4076
01:14:23,590 --> 01:14:23,600
and you know this is
 

4077
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,750
and you know this is
made famous in stephen pinker's book but

4078
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:25,760
made famous in stephen pinker's book but
 

4079
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,950
made famous in stephen pinker's book but
others have written about it too

4080
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
others have written about it too
 

4081
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:32,310
others have written about it too
that the the frequency of uh death from

4082
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
that the the frequency of uh death from
 

4083
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,430
that the the frequency of uh death from
violence

4084
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
violence
 

4085
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,149
violence
in every country you look at

4086
01:14:36,149 --> 01:14:36,159
in every country you look at
 

4087
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,310
in every country you look at
has been declining

4088
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:38,320
has been declining
 

4089
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,830
has been declining
that's just great and so you know the

4090
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
that's just great and so you know the
 

4091
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,590
that's just great and so you know the
amazing thing about this is that even

4092
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:41,600
amazing thing about this is that even
 

4093
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:43,990
amazing thing about this is that even
when you take the death due to the first

4094
01:14:43,990 --> 01:14:44,000
when you take the death due to the first
 

4095
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,470
when you take the death due to the first
world war and the second world war the

4096
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
world war and the second world war the
 

4097
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:49,030
world war and the second world war the
20th century appears to have been

4098
01:14:49,030 --> 01:14:49,040
20th century appears to have been
 

4099
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:52,070
20th century appears to have been
statistically meaning rates of death per

4100
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
statistically meaning rates of death per
 

4101
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,070
statistically meaning rates of death per
individual

4102
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
individual
 

4103
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:54,950
individual
the

4104
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:54,960
the
 

4105
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,470
the
least violent

4106
01:14:56,470 --> 01:14:56,480
least violent
 

4107
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,590
least violent
in history

4108
01:14:59,590 --> 01:14:59,600

 

4109
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,070

so we haven't got very far down the

4110
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:02,080
so we haven't got very far down the
 

4111
01:15:02,080 --> 01:15:03,990
so we haven't got very far down the
course to non-violence but i don't see

4112
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
course to non-violence but i don't see
 

4113
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,590
course to non-violence but i don't see
why we shouldn't just carry on doing it

4114
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
why we shouldn't just carry on doing it
 

4115
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:08,310
why we shouldn't just carry on doing it
i think it's ridiculous frankly you know

4116
01:15:08,310 --> 01:15:08,320
i think it's ridiculous frankly you know
 

4117
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,669
i think it's ridiculous frankly you know
excuse my frankness uh to to say that uh

4118
01:15:11,669 --> 01:15:11,679
excuse my frankness uh to to say that uh
 

4119
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,590
excuse my frankness uh to to say that uh
violence is a good thing

4120
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:13,600
violence is a good thing
 

4121
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,149
violence is a good thing
um i think that it would be a wonderful

4122
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:16,159
um i think that it would be a wonderful
 

4123
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:18,790
um i think that it would be a wonderful
concept if we could evolve somehow to a

4124
01:15:18,790 --> 01:15:18,800
concept if we could evolve somehow to a
 

4125
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:21,910
concept if we could evolve somehow to a
world you know 3 000 years from now

4126
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:21,920
world you know 3 000 years from now
 

4127
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,750
world you know 3 000 years from now
where violence is really regarded as uh

4128
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:25,760
where violence is really regarded as uh
 

4129
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,510
where violence is really regarded as uh
simply appalling and that you know they

4130
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:27,520
simply appalling and that you know they
 

4131
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:30,630
simply appalling and that you know they
look back on our time and can't believe

4132
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
look back on our time and can't believe
 

4133
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:32,390
look back on our time and can't believe
what we were doing

4134
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:32,400
what we were doing
 

4135
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,270
what we were doing
yeah

4136
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
yeah
 

4137
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,790
yeah
but of course violence takes a lot of

4138
01:15:34,790 --> 01:15:34,800
but of course violence takes a lot of
 

4139
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:36,390
but of course violence takes a lot of
different shapes as we start to think

4140
01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
different shapes as we start to think
 

4141
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,270
different shapes as we start to think
deeper and deeper about living

4142
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
deeper and deeper about living
 

4143
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,110
deeper and deeper about living
beings on earth for example the violence

4144
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:41,120
beings on earth for example the violence
 

4145
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,470
beings on earth for example the violence
would commit and the torture would

4146
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:42,480
would commit and the torture would
 

4147
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:44,790
would commit and the torture would
commit to animals and then perhaps down

4148
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:44,800
commit to animals and then perhaps down
 

4149
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:46,870
commit to animals and then perhaps down
the line as we talked offline about is

4150
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
the line as we talked offline about is
 

4151
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,470
the line as we talked offline about is
with robots

4152
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
with robots
 

4153
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:49,990
with robots
and that kind of thing so there there's

4154
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:50,000
and that kind of thing so there there's
 

4155
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,229
and that kind of thing so there there's
just so many ways to commit violence to

4156
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
just so many ways to commit violence to
 

4157
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:53,910
just so many ways to commit violence to
others and some people now talk about

4158
01:15:53,910 --> 01:15:53,920
others and some people now talk about
 

4159
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,910
others and some people now talk about
violence in the space of ideas

4160
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:55,920
violence in the space of ideas
 

4161
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,310
violence in the space of ideas
which of course to me at least is a bit

4162
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:58,320
which of course to me at least is a bit
 

4163
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,790
which of course to me at least is a bit
of a silly notion relative to use that

4164
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:00,800
of a silly notion relative to use that
 

4165
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,910
of a silly notion relative to use that
same v word for the space of ideas

4166
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:03,920
same v word for the space of ideas
 

4167
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,790
same v word for the space of ideas
versus actual physical violence but it

4168
01:16:06,790 --> 01:16:06,800
versus actual physical violence but it
 

4169
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:09,189
versus actual physical violence but it
may be that a long time from now we see

4170
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
may be that a long time from now we see
 

4171
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,910
may be that a long time from now we see
that even violence in the space of ideas

4172
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
that even violence in the space of ideas
 

4173
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,270
that even violence in the space of ideas
is is quite a manifestation of that same

4174
01:16:15,270 --> 01:16:15,280
is is quite a manifestation of that same
 

4175
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,830
is is quite a manifestation of that same
kind of violence and so it is

4176
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
kind of violence and so it is
 

4177
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:20,550
kind of violence and so it is
interesting where this is headed and i

4178
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:20,560
interesting where this is headed and i
 

4179
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,870
interesting where this is headed and i
think you're absolutely right

4180
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
think you're absolutely right
 

4181
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,630
think you're absolutely right
a world

4182
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:24,640
a world
 

4183
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,630
a world
a non-violent world does seem like a

4184
01:16:26,630 --> 01:16:26,640
a non-violent world does seem like a
 

4185
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:29,110
a non-violent world does seem like a
better world i wonder if the constraints

4186
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:29,120
better world i wonder if the constraints
 

4187
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:30,550
better world i wonder if the constraints
on resources

4188
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:30,560
on resources
 

4189
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,390
on resources
somehow make that world

4190
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
somehow make that world
 

4191
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,870
somehow make that world
more and more difficult especially as we

4192
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:34,880
more and more difficult especially as we
 

4193
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:36,550
more and more difficult especially as we
run out of resources well it's got to be

4194
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:36,560
run out of resources well it's got to be
 

4195
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:37,750
run out of resources well it's got to be
very very different from what we're

4196
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:37,760
very very different from what we're
 

4197
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,110
very very different from what we're
doing nowadays

4198
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
doing nowadays
 

4199
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,950
doing nowadays
and it's unimaginably different if we

4200
01:16:40,950 --> 01:16:40,960
and it's unimaginably different if we
 

4201
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,310
and it's unimaginably different if we
could imagine it then maybe we could

4202
01:16:42,310 --> 01:16:42,320
could imagine it then maybe we could
 

4203
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,830
could imagine it then maybe we could
work towards it at the moment nobody

4204
01:16:43,830 --> 01:16:43,840
work towards it at the moment nobody
 

4205
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:45,590
work towards it at the moment nobody
knows how to work towards it well that's

4206
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
knows how to work towards it well that's
 

4207
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,510
knows how to work towards it well that's
kind of the stories of humans as we we

4208
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:47,520
kind of the stories of humans as we we
 

4209
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:48,630
kind of the stories of humans as we we
don't really know the future we're

4210
01:16:48,630 --> 01:16:48,640
don't really know the future we're
 

4211
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,350
don't really know the future we're
trying to try to add hog kind of

4212
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
trying to try to add hog kind of
 

4213
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,750
trying to try to add hog kind of
develop it as we go and sometimes get

4214
01:16:53,750 --> 01:16:53,760
develop it as we go and sometimes get
 

4215
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,870
develop it as we go and sometimes get
into trouble yeah that's the violence

4216
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:56,880
into trouble yeah that's the violence
 

4217
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:58,790
into trouble yeah that's the violence
but it you know george orwell's vision

4218
01:16:58,790 --> 01:16:58,800
but it you know george orwell's vision
 

4219
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,350
but it you know george orwell's vision
in 1984 was of

4220
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
in 1984 was of
 

4221
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,750
in 1984 was of
of you know two or three world powers

4222
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:03,760
of you know two or three world powers
 

4223
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,070
of you know two or three world powers
each so powerful that nobody could

4224
01:17:06,070 --> 01:17:06,080
each so powerful that nobody could
 

4225
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,390
each so powerful that nobody could
could diminish the

4226
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:08,400
could diminish the
 

4227
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,669
could diminish the
could destroy the other

4228
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:11,679

 

4229
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:13,430

but the notion of

4230
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:13,440
but the notion of
 

4231
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:15,990
but the notion of
an evolutionarily stable relationship

4232
01:17:15,990 --> 01:17:16,000
an evolutionarily stable relationship
 

4233
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,590
an evolutionarily stable relationship
among

4234
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:17,600
among
 

4235
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:20,070
among
heavily armed world powers

4236
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:20,080
heavily armed world powers
 

4237
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:23,669
heavily armed world powers
just does not seem

4238
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:23,679

 

4239
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:25,590

as though

01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
as though
 

4241
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:27,189
as though
it's reasonable at all

4242
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
it's reasonable at all
 

4243
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,950
it's reasonable at all
that's to say

4244
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
that's to say
 

4245
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:31,510
that's to say
uh you know we've we've now got

4246

uh you know we've we've now got
 

4247

because the capacity for abuse by a
 

4297
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:28,870
because the capacity for abuse by a
single world power would be

single world power would be
 

4299
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:31,669
single world power would be
so problematic and in addition how do

no reasonable kind of future in mind but
 

4309
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:42,070
no reasonable kind of future in mind but
i'm sure it's there somewhere it's just

01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
i'm sure it's there somewhere it's just
 

4311
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,910
i'm sure it's there somewhere it's just
that we haven't yet to find it and a lot

4312
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
that we haven't yet to find it and a lot
 

4313
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,430
that we haven't yet to find it and a lot
of people like in the cryptocurrency

4314
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:45,440
of people like in the cryptocurrency
 

4315
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,750
of people like in the cryptocurrency
space argue that you can create

4316
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
space argue that you can create
 

4317
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,709
space argue that you can create
decentralized societies if you take away

4318
01:18:50,709 --> 01:18:50,719
decentralized societies if you take away
 

4319
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,030
decentralized societies if you take away
the power from states to define the

01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,350
the power from states to define the

monetary system so they argue like if
 

4323
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:58,149
monetary system so they argue like if
you give if if you make the monetary

4324
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:58,159
you give if if you make the monetary
 

4325
01:18:58,159 --> 01:19:00,070
you give if if you make the monetary
system such that it's disjoint from

4326
01:19:00,070 --> 01:19:00,080
system such that it's disjoint from
 

4327
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,470
system such that it's disjoint from
anyone the control of any one individual

4328
01:19:02,470 --> 01:19:02,480
anyone the control of any one individual
 

4329
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,550
anyone the control of any one individual
any one government then that might be a

4330
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:04,560
any one government then that might be a
 

4331
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:07,110
any one government then that might be a
way to form sort of ad-hoc decentralized

4332
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
way to form sort of ad-hoc decentralized
 

4333
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,750
way to form sort of ad-hoc decentralized
societies just they just pop up all over

4334
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
societies just they just pop up all over
 

4335
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,590
societies just they just pop up all over
the place that's a really interesting

4336
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:11,600
the place that's a really interesting
 

4337
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,870
the place that's a really interesting
technological uh solution to how to

4338
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:14,880
technological uh solution to how to
 

4339
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,270
technological uh solution to how to
remove the overreach of power from

4340
01:19:17,270 --> 01:19:17,280
remove the overreach of power from
 

4341
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:19,830
remove the overreach of power from
governments yeah that's right absolutely

4342
01:19:19,830 --> 01:19:19,840
governments yeah that's right absolutely
 

4343
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,390
governments yeah that's right absolutely
and and it may well be that uh

4344
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
and and it may well be that uh
 

4345
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,189
and and it may well be that uh
that

4346
01:19:23,189 --> 01:19:23,199
that
 

4347
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,189
that
the future will emerge out of some sort

4348
01:19:25,189 --> 01:19:25,199
the future will emerge out of some sort
 

4349
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,709
the future will emerge out of some sort
of quite surprising

4350
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
of quite surprising
 

4351
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,350
of quite surprising
direction uh like that is it

4352
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:29,360
direction uh like that is it
 

4353
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:31,430
direction uh like that is it
nevertheless surprising to you that we

4354
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
nevertheless surprising to you that we
 

4355
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,110
nevertheless surprising to you that we
have not destroyed ourselves with

4356
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:33,120
have not destroyed ourselves with
 

4357
01:19:33,120 --> 01:19:35,270
have not destroyed ourselves with
nuclear weapons so the mutually assured

4358
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:35,280
nuclear weapons so the mutually assured
 

4359
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,350
nuclear weapons so the mutually assured
destruction that we've had for many

4360
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:37,360
destruction that we've had for many
 

4361
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:39,510
destruction that we've had for many
decades from somebody who studies

4362
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:39,520
decades from somebody who studies
 

4363
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:41,830
decades from somebody who studies
violence

4364
01:19:41,830 --> 01:19:41,840
violence
 

4365
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,430
violence
how does that make sense to you well i

4366
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
how does that make sense to you well i
 

4367
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,350
how does that make sense to you well i
mean i'm surprised only in the sense

4368
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
mean i'm surprised only in the sense
 

4369
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:48,630
mean i'm surprised only in the sense
that um accidental the the the fact that

4370
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
that um accidental the the the fact that
 

4371
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,830
that um accidental the the the fact that
we have not had an accident yet

4372
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:51,840
we have not had an accident yet
 

4373
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,149
we have not had an accident yet
uh has been quite remarkable

4374
01:19:54,149 --> 01:19:54,159
uh has been quite remarkable
 

4375
01:19:54,159 --> 01:19:56,550
uh has been quite remarkable
yeah because all the accounts are that

4376
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
yeah because all the accounts are that
 

4377
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,229
yeah because all the accounts are that
we've come very close to having very

4378
01:19:58,229 --> 01:19:58,239
we've come very close to having very
 

4379
01:19:58,239 --> 01:19:59,910
we've come very close to having very
serious accidents where

4380
01:19:59,910 --> 01:19:59,920
serious accidents where
 

4381
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,229
serious accidents where
people either side of misread

4382
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:02,239
people either side of misread
 

4383
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,790
people either side of misread
intentions or apparent launches and so

4384
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:04,800
intentions or apparent launches and so
 

4385
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:06,470
intentions or apparent launches and so
on

4386
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:06,480
on
 

4387
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,709
on
uh so yes i think it is remarkable there

4388
01:20:08,709 --> 01:20:08,719
uh so yes i think it is remarkable there
 

4389
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:10,709
uh so yes i think it is remarkable there
is a a nasty

4390
01:20:10,709 --> 01:20:10,719
is a a nasty
 

4391
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:11,750
is a a nasty
um

4392
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:11,760
um
 

4393
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:14,709
um
generalization that can be made that uh

4394
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:14,719
generalization that can be made that uh
 

4395
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,709
generalization that can be made that uh
the longer that um powerful states go

4396
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:18,719
the longer that um powerful states go
 

4397
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,189
the longer that um powerful states go
uh without having wars then the worst

4398
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:21,199
uh without having wars then the worst
 

4399
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:25,270
uh without having wars then the worst
the war is afterwards

4400
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:25,280

 

4401
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,110

and you know you can sort of see that

4402
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
and you know you can sort of see that
 

4403
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,270
and you know you can sort of see that
that kind of makes sense because

4404
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
that kind of makes sense because
 

4405
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,189
that kind of makes sense because
basically what's happening uh with these

4406
01:20:31,189 --> 01:20:31,199
basically what's happening uh with these
 

4407
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,110
basically what's happening uh with these
tribal groups that the nations are at

4408
01:20:33,110 --> 01:20:33,120
tribal groups that the nations are at
 

4409
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:34,790
tribal groups that the nations are at
the moment

4410
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:34,800
the moment
 

4411
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,070
the moment
is that

4412
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:36,080
is that
 

4413
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:37,830
is that
after a big war like the second world

4414
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:37,840
after a big war like the second world
 

4415
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:38,950
after a big war like the second world
war

4416
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:38,960
war
 

4417
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,629
war
they established new kinds of dominance

4418
01:20:40,629 --> 01:20:40,639
they established new kinds of dominance
 

4419
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:42,070
they established new kinds of dominance
relationships

4420
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:42,080
relationships
 

4421
01:20:42,080 --> 01:20:43,510
relationships
and then

4422
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:43,520
and then
 

4423
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:46,229
and then
during the periods of peace what happens

4424
01:20:46,229 --> 01:20:46,239
during the periods of peace what happens
 

4425
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:47,990
during the periods of peace what happens
is that

4426
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,000
is that
 

4427
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,030
is that
the

4428
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,040
the
 

4429
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:52,149
the
de facto dominance relationships change

4430
01:20:52,149 --> 01:20:52,159
de facto dominance relationships change
 

4431
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:54,629
de facto dominance relationships change
because some nations become poorer some

4432
01:20:54,629 --> 01:20:54,639
because some nations become poorer some
 

4433
01:20:54,639 --> 01:20:56,629
because some nations become poorer some
become richer some become more

4434
01:20:56,629 --> 01:20:56,639
become richer some become more
 

4435
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,110
become richer some become more
militarily powerful and so on generally

4436
01:20:59,110 --> 01:20:59,120
militarily powerful and so on generally
 

4437
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,149
militarily powerful and so on generally
economy and military goes hand in hand

4438
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:02,159
economy and military goes hand in hand
 

4439
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:04,790
economy and military goes hand in hand
so you know right now china uh emerged

4440
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:04,800
so you know right now china uh emerged
 

4441
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,709
so you know right now china uh emerged
from the war is a relatively low status

4442
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:06,719
from the war is a relatively low status
 

4443
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,750
from the war is a relatively low status
state and is now high status so if this

4444
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:09,760
state and is now high status so if this
 

4445
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:11,110
state and is now high status so if this
were chimpanzees you know what would

4446
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:11,120
were chimpanzees you know what would
 

4447
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,550
were chimpanzees you know what would
happen is that you would predict a

4448
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:12,560
happen is that you would predict a
 

4449
01:21:12,560 --> 01:21:15,189
happen is that you would predict a
conflict because you need to have a

4450
01:21:15,189 --> 01:21:15,199
conflict because you need to have a
 

4451
01:21:15,199 --> 01:21:17,270
conflict because you need to have a
readjustment of the formal dominance

4452
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
readjustment of the formal dominance
 

4453
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,990
readjustment of the formal dominance
relationships to recognize the the new

4454
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,000
relationships to recognize the the new
 

4455
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,229
relationships to recognize the the new
in practice dominance relationships

4456
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:22,239
in practice dominance relationships
 

4457
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,070
in practice dominance relationships
recognized by the economy in the

4458
01:21:24,070 --> 01:21:24,080
recognized by the economy in the
 

4459
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:25,830
recognized by the economy in the
military

4460
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
military
 

4461
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,709
military
so the longer that you have of a period

4462
01:21:28,709 --> 01:21:28,719
so the longer that you have of a period
 

4463
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:31,030
so the longer that you have of a period
of peace following a war then the more

4464
01:21:31,030 --> 01:21:31,040
of peace following a war then the more
 

4465
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:34,310
of peace following a war then the more
these tensions of unresolved changed

4466
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:34,320
these tensions of unresolved changed
 

4467
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,030
these tensions of unresolved changed
dominance relationships build up

4468
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,040
dominance relationships build up
 

4469
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,990
dominance relationships build up
and the longer they take to occur then

4470
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:40,000
and the longer they take to occur then
 

4471
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,310
and the longer they take to occur then
uh the more uh challenging uh are going

4472
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:44,320
uh the more uh challenging uh are going
 

4473
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,030
uh the more uh challenging uh are going
to be the conflicts that's a terrifying

4474
01:21:47,030 --> 01:21:47,040
to be the conflicts that's a terrifying
 

4475
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,030
to be the conflicts that's a terrifying
view because we've been we've been out

4476
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:49,040
view because we've been we've been out
 

4477
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,870
view because we've been we've been out
of conflict for quite a bit that's right

4478
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:50,880
of conflict for quite a bit that's right
 

4479
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,310
of conflict for quite a bit that's right
maybe it's building up

4480
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:52,320
maybe it's building up
 

4481
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,149
maybe it's building up
so it's a scary view but on the other

4482
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,159
so it's a scary view but on the other
 

4483
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,550
so it's a scary view but on the other
hand you know things have changed hugely

4484
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
hand you know things have changed hugely
 

4485
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,830
hand you know things have changed hugely
with the

4486
01:21:57,830 --> 01:21:57,840
with the
 

4487
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:00,229
with the
advent of nuclear weapons because at

4488
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:00,239
advent of nuclear weapons because at
 

4489
01:22:00,239 --> 01:22:01,830
advent of nuclear weapons because at
least that

4490
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:01,840
least that
 

4491
01:22:01,840 --> 01:22:03,910
least that
conforms to

4492
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
conforms to
 

4493
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,990
conforms to
this psychology that is very clear in

4494
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
this psychology that is very clear in
 

4495
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,910
this psychology that is very clear in
other animals which is you don't want to

4496
01:22:07,910 --> 01:22:07,920
other animals which is you don't want to
 

4497
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,070
other animals which is you don't want to
get into a fight if you are going to get

4498
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:10,080
get into a fight if you are going to get
 

4499
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:10,870
get into a fight if you are going to get
hurt

4500
01:22:10,870 --> 01:22:10,880
hurt
 

4501
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,510
hurt
so that's the whole principle of mad

4502
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:13,520
so that's the whole principle of mad
 

4503
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,510
so that's the whole principle of mad
mutually assured destruction

4504
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
mutually assured destruction
 

4505
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,669
mutually assured destruction
and it's doubtless being why

4506
01:22:17,669 --> 01:22:17,679
and it's doubtless being why
 

4507
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,070
and it's doubtless being why
powerful nations like america and

4508
01:22:20,070 --> 01:22:20,080
powerful nations like america and
 

4509
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,830
powerful nations like america and
and russia

4510
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:21,840
and russia
 

4511
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,830
and russia
have not used their nuclear weapons

4512
01:22:23,830 --> 01:22:23,840
have not used their nuclear weapons
 

4513
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,390
have not used their nuclear weapons
since 1945

4514
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
since 1945
 

4515
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,390
since 1945
the you know so

4516
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:28,400
the you know so
 

4517
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:30,229
the you know so
if we can overcome the problem of

4518
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:30,239
if we can overcome the problem of
 

4519
01:22:30,239 --> 01:22:33,030
if we can overcome the problem of
accidental launches

4520
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
accidental launches
 

4521
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,229
accidental launches
then maybe the fact of mad does fit into

4522
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:36,239
then maybe the fact of mad does fit into
 

4523
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:38,149
then maybe the fact of mad does fit into
human psychology in a way that means

4524
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:38,159
human psychology in a way that means
 

4525
01:22:38,159 --> 01:22:41,430
human psychology in a way that means
that we really will resolve our tensions

4526
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:41,440
that we really will resolve our tensions
 

4527
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,390
that we really will resolve our tensions
without using them but

4528
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
without using them but
 

4529
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,149
without using them but
we haven't yet really faced that

4530
01:22:46,149 --> 01:22:46,159
we haven't yet really faced that
 

4531
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,550
we haven't yet really faced that
challenge you know i mean the soviet

4532
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:48,560
challenge you know i mean the soviet
 

4533
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,870

take back taiwan

4540
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:58,400
take back taiwan
 

4541
01:22:58,400 --> 01:22:59,350
take back taiwan
and

4542
01:22:59,350 --> 01:22:59,360
and
 

4543
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:02,229

the potential for something going wrong

4548
01:23:05,669 --> 01:23:05,679
the potential for something going wrong
 

4549
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,830
the potential for something going wrong
is clearly very high

4550
01:23:07,830 --> 01:23:07,840
is clearly very high
 

4551
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,430
is clearly very high
so what's the

4552
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:09,440
so what's the
 

4553
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,669
so what's the
hopeful case that you can make for a

4554
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:11,679
hopeful case that you can make for a
 

4555
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:14,070
hopeful case that you can make for a
long-term surviving and thriving human

4556
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,080
long-term surviving and thriving human
 

4557
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,750
long-term surviving and thriving human
civilization

4558
01:23:15,750 --> 01:23:15,760
civilization
 

4559
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,590
civilization
given all the dangers that we face

4560
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
given all the dangers that we face
 

4561
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,149
given all the dangers that we face
well i i can't really exactly make one i

4562
01:23:22,149 --> 01:23:22,159
well i i can't really exactly make one i
 

4563
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,830
well i i can't really exactly make one i
would just say that

4564
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:25,840

 

4565
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:27,350

we're talking about the dangers

4566
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
we're talking about the dangers
 

4567
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,830
we're talking about the dangers
obviously the dangers are there yeah um

4568
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
obviously the dangers are there yeah um
 

4569
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,350
obviously the dangers are there yeah um
but but what i would

4570
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:31,360
but but what i would
 

4571
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:33,510
but but what i would
sort of think about is um

4572
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:33,520
sort of think about is um
 

4573
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:35,750
sort of think about is um
the notion that

4574
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:35,760
the notion that
 

4575
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:37,510
the notion that
that surprises

4576
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
that surprises
 

4577
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,870
that surprises
come from all sorts of different

4578
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
come from all sorts of different
 

4579
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,229
come from all sorts of different
directions

4580
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
directions
 

4581
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:42,629
directions
you know and um i mean

4582
01:23:42,629 --> 01:23:42,639
you know and um i mean
 

4583
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:45,510
you know and um i mean
you you're you work in robotics and you

4584
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:45,520
you you're you work in robotics and you
 

4585
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,990
you you're you work in robotics and you
know i can well imagine that

4586
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:48,000
know i can well imagine that
 

4587
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,310
know i can well imagine that
there will be advances in robotics and

4588
01:23:50,310 --> 01:23:50,320
there will be advances in robotics and
 

4589
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,950
there will be advances in robotics and
in some way i can't even conceive will

4590
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:52,960
in some way i can't even conceive will
 

4591
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:54,709
in some way i can't even conceive will
somehow undermine

4592
01:23:54,709 --> 01:23:54,719
somehow undermine
 

4593
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:55,590
somehow undermine
the

4594
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:55,600
the
 

4595
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,990
the
motivation for conflict

4596
01:23:57,990 --> 01:23:58,000
motivation for conflict
 

4597
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,270
motivation for conflict
something about

4598
01:23:59,270 --> 01:23:59,280
something about
 

4599
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:01,110
something about
you know by the time chips have been

4600
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
you know by the time chips have been
 

4601
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:03,910
you know by the time chips have been
planted in human brains and we're all

4602
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
planted in human brains and we're all
 

4603
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,750
planted in human brains and we're all
instantly sharing information in a way

4604
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:05,760
instantly sharing information in a way
 

4605
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,390
instantly sharing information in a way
that we never did before

4606
01:24:08,390 --> 01:24:08,400
that we never did before
 

4607
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:10,629
that we never did before
will this change the nature of

4608
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:10,639
will this change the nature of
 

4609
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:13,110
will this change the nature of
uh human existence in such a way that

4610
01:24:13,110 --> 01:24:13,120
uh human existence in such a way that
 

4611
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:14,390
uh human existence in such a way that
these conflicts

4612
01:24:14,390 --> 01:24:14,400
these conflicts
 

4613
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,390
these conflicts
get resolved so remove the conflicts but

4614
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
get resolved so remove the conflicts but
 

4615
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,229
get resolved so remove the conflicts but
keep some of the magic the beauty of

4616
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:18,239
keep some of the magic the beauty of
 

4617
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:20,149
keep some of the magic the beauty of
what it means to be human so like still

4618
01:24:20,149 --> 01:24:20,159
what it means to be human so like still
 

4619
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:22,310
what it means to be human so like still
be able to enjoy life the richness of

4620
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:22,320
be able to enjoy life the richness of
 

4621
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,709
be able to enjoy life the richness of
life the full complexity of life because

4622
01:24:24,709 --> 01:24:24,719
life the full complexity of life because
 

4623
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:26,790
life the full complexity of life because
you can remove conflict by giving

4624
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:26,800
you can remove conflict by giving
 

4625
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,149
you can remove conflict by giving
everybody a pill

4626
01:24:28,149 --> 01:24:28,159
everybody a pill
 

4627
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,470
everybody a pill
and then they go to sleep right you

4628
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:30,480
and then they go to sleep right you
 

4629
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:32,550
and then they go to sleep right you
still want life to be amazing

4630
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:32,560
still want life to be amazing
 

4631
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,910
still want life to be amazing
uh exciting you know uh

4632
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:35,920
uh exciting you know uh
 

4633
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:38,310
uh exciting you know uh
interesting and so that's where you have

4634
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
interesting and so that's where you have
 

4635
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,750
interesting and so that's where you have
to find the balance

4636
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:39,760
to find the balance
 

4637
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,030
to find the balance
well it's

4638
01:24:41,030 --> 01:24:41,040
well it's
 

4639
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:42,470
well it's
yes i mean it's all science fiction

4640
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:42,480
yes i mean it's all science fiction
 

4641
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:45,669
yes i mean it's all science fiction
stuff and and uh so how it's going to

4642
01:24:45,669 --> 01:24:45,679
stuff and and uh so how it's going to
 

4643
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:48,229
stuff and and uh so how it's going to
work out totally unclear

4644
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
work out totally unclear
 

4645
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,629
work out totally unclear
um

4646
01:24:50,629 --> 01:24:50,639

 

4647
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:53,990

i don't see any worry about the magic of

4648
01:24:53,990 --> 01:24:54,000
i don't see any worry about the magic of
 

4649
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,750
i don't see any worry about the magic of
life disappearing i mean

4650
01:24:55,750 --> 01:24:55,760
life disappearing i mean
 

4651

01:25:49,030 --> 01:25:49,040
so there is
 

4707
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,350
so there is
a evolutionary distinction between men

4708
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
a evolutionary distinction between men
 

4709

4814
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:44,080
is
 

4815
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:45,590
is
incentivized

4816
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:45,600
incentivized
 

4817
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,990
incentivized
and encouraged empowered

4818
01:27:49,990 --> 01:27:50,000

 

4819
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,669

well

4820
01:27:51,669 --> 01:27:51,679
well
 

4821
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:52,550
well
look

4822
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
look
 

4823
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,310
look
i don't think it would be utopia if you

4824
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:54,320
i don't think it would be utopia if you
 

4825
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:56,310
i don't think it would be utopia if you
got rid of the males

4826
01:27:56,310 --> 01:27:56,320
got rid of the males
 

4827
01:27:56,320 --> 01:27:58,070
got rid of the males
right

4828
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:58,080
right
 

4829
01:27:58,080 --> 01:27:59,750
right
and certainly females capable of

4830
01:27:59,750 --> 01:27:59,760
and certainly females capable of
 

4831
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,350
and certainly females capable of
conflict

4832
01:28:01,350 --> 01:28:01,360
conflict
 

4833
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:03,110
conflict
i just think it's a gamble worth taking

4834
01:28:03,110 --> 01:28:03,120
i just think it's a gamble worth taking
 

4835
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:04,870
i just think it's a gamble worth taking
if you could actually do it

4836
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:04,880
if you could actually do it
 

4837
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,229
if you could actually do it
you can certainly find females in

4838
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
you can certainly find females in
 

4839
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,110
you can certainly find females in
history who've done unpleasant things

4840
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
history who've done unpleasant things
 

4841
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:10,870
history who've done unpleasant things
but nevertheless

4842
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:10,880
but nevertheless
 

4843
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,310
but nevertheless
you know we have a very strong

4844
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,320
you know we have a very strong
 

4845
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,550
you know we have a very strong
evolutionary theory which explains why

4846
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,560
evolutionary theory which explains why
 

4847
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,870
evolutionary theory which explains why
males benefit more

4848
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:16,880
males benefit more
 

4849
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:18,390
males benefit more
by

4850
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:18,400
by
 

4851
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:20,310
by
having conflict and winning conflicts

4852
01:28:20,310 --> 01:28:20,320
having conflict and winning conflicts
 

4853
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:22,390
having conflict and winning conflicts
than females do

4854
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:22,400
than females do
 

4855
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,350
than females do
and

4856
01:28:23,350 --> 01:28:23,360
and
 

4857
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:24,550
and
so

4858
01:28:24,550 --> 01:28:24,560
so
 

4859
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,350
so
if we want to talk about reducing

4860
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:27,360
if we want to talk about reducing
 

4861
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,910
if we want to talk about reducing
conflict yes then

4862
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:29,920
conflict yes then
 

4863
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,830
conflict yes then
it would reduce it to get rid of males

4864
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
it would reduce it to get rid of males
 

4865
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,990
it would reduce it to get rid of males
now i understand this is a fantasy yeah

4866
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
now i understand this is a fantasy yeah
 

4867
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,070
now i understand this is a fantasy yeah
and it i think it's a fantasy that

4868
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
and it i think it's a fantasy that
 

4869
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:37,750
and it i think it's a fantasy that
people would be able to talk about

4870
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:37,760
people would be able to talk about
 

4871
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,910
people would be able to talk about
fairly soon because reproductive

4872
01:28:39,910 --> 01:28:39,920
fairly soon because reproductive
 

4873
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:43,110
fairly soon because reproductive
technology is getting to the point where

4874
01:28:43,110 --> 01:28:43,120
technology is getting to the point where
 

4875
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:45,590
technology is getting to the point where
it's quite likely that

4876
01:28:45,590 --> 01:28:45,600
it's quite likely that
 

4877
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,149
it's quite likely that
human females could breed without the

4878
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
human females could breed without the
 

4879
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:50,390
human females could breed without the
use of males

4880
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:50,400
use of males
 

4881
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:51,430
use of males
and so

4882
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:51,440
and so
 

4883
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:53,590
and so
there would be a sort of

4884
01:28:53,590 --> 01:28:53,600
there would be a sort of
 

4885
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,510
there would be a sort of
a potential dynamic

4886
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:55,520
a potential dynamic
 

4887
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:56,870
a potential dynamic
if

4888
01:28:56,870 --> 01:28:56,880
if
 

4889
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,149
if
everybody just agreed not to have any

4890
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:00,159
everybody just agreed not to have any
 

4891
01:29:00,159 --> 01:29:01,669
everybody just agreed not to have any
male babies

4892
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:01,679
male babies
 

4893
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:03,030
male babies
it's a it's a really interesting thought

4894
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
it's a it's a really interesting thought
 

4895
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:05,590
it's a it's a really interesting thought
experiment i will agree with you that

4896
01:29:05,590 --> 01:29:05,600
experiment i will agree with you that
 

4897
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,229
experiment i will agree with you that
if given two buttons one is get rid of

4898
01:29:08,229 --> 01:29:08,239
if given two buttons one is get rid of
 

4899
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:09,430
if given two buttons one is get rid of
all women

4900
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
all women
 

4901
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:12,470
all women
and the other buttons get rid of all men

4902
01:29:12,470 --> 01:29:12,480
and the other buttons get rid of all men
 

4903
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:13,910
and the other buttons get rid of all men
um

4904
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
um
 

4905
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,750
um
realizing that uh

4906
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,760
realizing that uh
 

4907
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:18,709
realizing that uh
i have a stake in this uh choice uh

4908
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:18,719
i have a stake in this uh choice uh
 

4909
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:20,629
i have a stake in this uh choice uh
you're probably getting rid of all men

4910
01:29:20,629 --> 01:29:20,639
you're probably getting rid of all men
 

4911
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,470
you're probably getting rid of all men
if i wanted to preserve

4912
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
if i wanted to preserve
 

4913
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,590
if i wanted to preserve
earth

4914
01:29:25,590 --> 01:29:25,600
earth
 

4915
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,390
earth
and the richness of life on earth i

4916
01:29:28,390 --> 01:29:28,400
and the richness of life on earth i
 

4917
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,229
and the richness of life on earth i
would probably get rid of all men i

4918
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
would probably get rid of all men i
 

4919
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,590
would probably get rid of all men i
don't know i don't think you ever stake

4920
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:31,600
don't know i don't think you ever stake
 

4921
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,350
don't know i don't think you ever stake
in it you know i mean

4922
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:33,360
in it you know i mean
 

4923
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:34,790
in it you know i mean
but you're saying that because you're a

4924
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
but you're saying that because you're a
 

4925
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,390
but you're saying that because you're a
man yeah but i don't see why being a man

4926
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:38,400
man yeah but i don't see why being a man
 

4927
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:40,310
man yeah but i don't see why being a man
should make you any more interested in

4928
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:40,320
should make you any more interested in
 

4929
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:42,629
should make you any more interested in
having a male future for the world than

4930
01:29:42,629 --> 01:29:42,639
having a male future for the world than
 

4931
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:44,310
having a male future for the world than
a female future you know you've got just

4932
01:29:44,310 --> 01:29:44,320
a female future you know you've got just
 

4933
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,790
a female future you know you've got just
as many ancestors who were male as as

4934
01:29:46,790 --> 01:29:46,800
as many ancestors who were male as as
 

4935
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,229
as many ancestors who were male as as
were female

4936
01:29:48,229 --> 01:29:48,239
were female
 

4937
01:29:48,239 --> 01:29:51,350
were female
well my problem is i'll have to die

4938
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:51,360
well my problem is i'll have to die
 

4939
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,590
well my problem is i'll have to die
well that's going to happen anyway

4940
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:53,600
well that's going to happen anyway
 

4941
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,149
well that's going to happen anyway
i know but like i prefer to die tomorrow

4942
01:29:56,149 --> 01:29:56,159
i know but like i prefer to die tomorrow
 

4943
01:29:56,159 --> 01:29:58,629
i know but like i prefer to die tomorrow
not today you know i you know i prefer

4944
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
not today you know i you know i prefer
 

4945
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:00,950
not today you know i you know i prefer
to snooze hit the snooze button on the

4946
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:00,960
to snooze hit the snooze button on the
 

4947
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,189
to snooze hit the snooze button on the
whole mortality thing but it's

4948
01:30:03,189 --> 01:30:03,199
whole mortality thing but it's
 

4949
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:04,470
whole mortality thing but it's
interesting but this is not suggesting

4950
01:30:04,470 --> 01:30:04,480
interesting but this is not suggesting
 

4951
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:05,910
interesting but this is not suggesting
that males have to die in order to make

4952
01:30:05,910 --> 01:30:05,920
that males have to die in order to make
 

4953
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:07,750
that males have to die in order to make
room for females it's just

4954
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:07,760
room for females it's just
 

4955
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:09,830
room for females it's just
you know you you all you have to do is

4956
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
you know you you all you have to do is
 

4957
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:11,270
you know you you all you have to do is
just say

4958
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:11,280
just say
 

4959
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:13,830
just say
don't let's have any more males born

4960
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
don't let's have any more males born
 

4961
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,030
don't let's have any more males born
interesting of course you know the

4962
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
interesting of course you know the
 

4963
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:16,950
interesting of course you know the
difficulty is that that because we're

4964
01:30:16,950 --> 01:30:16,960
difficulty is that that because we're
 

4965
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,669
difficulty is that that because we're
tribal you know some country somewhere

4966
01:30:19,669 --> 01:30:19,679
tribal you know some country somewhere
 

4967
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:20,709
tribal you know some country somewhere
would say well we're not going to do

4968
01:30:20,709 --> 01:30:20,719
would say well we're not going to do
 

4969
01:30:20,719 --> 01:30:22,790
would say well we're not going to do
that yeah and then guess what they'd

4970
01:30:22,790 --> 01:30:22,800
that yeah and then guess what they'd
 

4971
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:24,790
that yeah and then guess what they'd
take over yeah because they're male so

4972
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:24,800
take over yeah because they're male so
 

4973
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,550
take over yeah because they're male so
that's why it's impossible to imagine

4974
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:26,560
that's why it's impossible to imagine
 

4975
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,310
that's why it's impossible to imagine
actually happening

4976
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:28,320

01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
repressed we are in terms of reactive
 

5309
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,590
repressed we are in terms of reactive
violence and i i told you the story of

5310
01:36:25,590 --> 01:36:25,600
violence and i i told you the story of
 

5311
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,350
violence and i i told you the story of
of how we get there you know so what's

5312
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
of how we get there you know so what's
 

5313
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,430
of how we get there you know so what's
so extraordinary about us is that

5314
01:36:29,430 --> 01:36:29,440
so extraordinary about us is that
 

5315
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,470
so extraordinary about us is that
uh most animals uh are either high on

5316
01:36:32,470 --> 01:36:32,480
uh most animals uh are either high on
 

5317
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:35,350
uh most animals uh are either high on
both or relatively low on both

5318
01:36:35,350 --> 01:36:35,360
both or relatively low on both
 

5319
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,750
both or relatively low on both
so chimpanzees are high on proactive

5320
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:37,760
so chimpanzees are high on proactive
 

5321
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,629
so chimpanzees are high on proactive
violence and reactive violence bonobos

5322
01:36:40,629 --> 01:36:40,639
violence and reactive violence bonobos
 

5323
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:41,750
violence and reactive violence bonobos
are less

5324
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:41,760
are less
 

5325
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,550
are less
than

5326
01:36:42,550 --> 01:36:42,560
than
 

5327
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:44,950
than
chimpanzees on both of those but still

5328
01:36:44,950 --> 01:36:44,960
chimpanzees on both of those but still
 

5329
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,510
chimpanzees on both of those but still
hundreds of times more

5330
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:47,520
hundreds of times more
 

5331
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:50,790
hundreds of times more
reactively aggressive than humans are

5332
01:36:50,790 --> 01:36:50,800
reactively aggressive than humans are
 

5333
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:52,950
reactively aggressive than humans are
what we've done is retain

5334
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:52,960
what we've done is retain
 

5335
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:56,149
what we've done is retain
uh proactive violence being high and got

5336
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:56,159
uh proactive violence being high and got
 

5337
01:36:56,159 --> 01:36:59,109
uh proactive violence being high and got
a reactive violence really being low

5338
01:36:59,109 --> 01:36:59,119
a reactive violence really being low
 

5339
01:36:59,119 --> 01:37:01,109
a reactive violence really being low
and so we have these wonderful societies

5340
01:37:01,109 --> 01:37:01,119
and so we have these wonderful societies
 

5341
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:03,109
and so we have these wonderful societies
in which we're all so incredibly nice to

5342
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:03,119
in which we're all so incredibly nice to
 

5343
01:37:03,119 --> 01:37:05,750
in which we're all so incredibly nice to
each other and tolerant and calm and and

5344
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:05,760
each other and tolerant and calm and and
 

5345
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:08,310
each other and tolerant and calm and and
can meet strangers and have no problem

5346
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:08,320
can meet strangers and have no problem
 

5347
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:11,669
can meet strangers and have no problem
about um

5348
01:37:11,669 --> 01:37:11,679

 

5349
01:37:11,679 --> 01:37:14,629

leading to any kind of conflict

5350
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:14,639
leading to any kind of conflict
 

5351
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:17,270
leading to any kind of conflict
at the same time as we are one of the

5352
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:17,280
at the same time as we are one of the
 

5353
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:20,390
at the same time as we are one of the
worst killing machine species that's

5354
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:20,400
worst killing machine species that's
 

5355
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,950
worst killing machine species that's
never existed so what's so extraordinary

5356
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960
never existed so what's so extraordinary
 

5357
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,510
never existed so what's so extraordinary
about this is that if you look at the

5358
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:25,520
about this is that if you look at the
 

5359
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,910
about this is that if you look at the
political philosophers of the last few

5360
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:27,920
political philosophers of the last few
 

5361
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,669
political philosophers of the last few
hundred years

5362
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
hundred years
 

5363
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:31,189
hundred years
you've got this fight

5364
01:37:31,189 --> 01:37:31,199
you've got this fight
 

5365
01:37:31,199 --> 01:37:34,149
you've got this fight
famously between thomas hobbes and

5366
01:37:34,149 --> 01:37:34,159
famously between thomas hobbes and
 

5367
01:37:34,159 --> 01:37:35,830
famously between thomas hobbes and
jean-jacques rousseau or literally

5368
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:35,840
jean-jacques rousseau or literally
 

5369
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,790
jean-jacques rousseau or literally
you've got the fight between their

5370
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:36,800
you've got the fight between their
 

5371
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:37,990
you've got the fight between their
followers

5372
01:37:37,990 --> 01:37:38,000
followers
 

5373
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,629
followers
you know so the followers of hobbes say

5374
01:37:40,629 --> 01:37:40,639
you know so the followers of hobbes say
 

5375
01:37:40,639 --> 01:37:42,629
you know so the followers of hobbes say
well hobbes was right because he says

5376
01:37:42,629 --> 01:37:42,639
well hobbes was right because he says
 

5377
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,629
well hobbes was right because he says
that we are naturally violent and you

5378
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
that we are naturally violent and you
 

5379
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:48,470
that we are naturally violent and you
need a leviathan a central government or

5380
01:37:48,470 --> 01:37:48,480
need a leviathan a central government or
 

5381
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,470
need a leviathan a central government or
a king to be able to suppress the

5382
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:50,480
a king to be able to suppress the
 

5383
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,590
a king to be able to suppress the
violence

5384
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:51,600
violence
 

5385
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:54,310
violence
so we're naturally hurried and we can

5386
01:37:54,310 --> 01:37:54,320
so we're naturally hurried and we can
 

5387
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,390
so we're naturally hurried and we can
learn to be good whereas jean-jacques

5388
01:37:56,390 --> 01:37:56,400
learn to be good whereas jean-jacques
 

5389
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,790
learn to be good whereas jean-jacques
rousseau is interpreted as saying the

5390
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
rousseau is interpreted as saying the
 

5391
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,350
rousseau is interpreted as saying the
opposite that we are naturally good and

5392
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
opposite that we are naturally good and
 

5393
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,669
opposite that we are naturally good and
it's only when culture intervenes and

5394
01:38:03,669 --> 01:38:03,679
it's only when culture intervenes and
 

5395
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:05,990
it's only when culture intervenes and
and horizontal ideologies come in that

5396
01:38:05,990 --> 01:38:06,000
and horizontal ideologies come in that
 

5397
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,109
and horizontal ideologies come in that
we become uncivilized and so people have

5398
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119
we become uncivilized and so people have
 

5399
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,270
we become uncivilized and so people have
have had this endless fight between are

5400
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
have had this endless fight between are
 

5401
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,629
have had this endless fight between are
we naturally

5402
01:38:12,629 --> 01:38:12,639
we naturally
 

5403
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:13,590
we naturally
corrupt

5404
01:38:13,590 --> 01:38:13,600
corrupt
 

5405
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:17,189
corrupt
or are we naturally uh kind

5406
01:38:17,189 --> 01:38:17,199
or are we naturally uh kind
 

5407
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:19,109
or are we naturally uh kind
and and that has gone on you know for

5408
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:19,119
and and that has gone on you know for
 

5409
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,590
and and that has gone on you know for
years and it's only in the last two or

5410
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:21,600
years and it's only in the last two or
 

5411
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:24,229
years and it's only in the last two or
three decades that anthropologists like

5412
01:38:24,229 --> 01:38:24,239
three decades that anthropologists like
 

5413
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:26,229
three decades that anthropologists like
christopher bohm and bruce naft have

5414
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
christopher bohm and bruce naft have
 

5415
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:27,990
christopher bohm and bruce naft have
said look you know it's obvious what the

5416
01:38:27,990 --> 01:38:28,000
said look you know it's obvious what the
 

5417
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,229
said look you know it's obvious what the
answer is we are both of these things

5418
01:38:30,229 --> 01:38:30,239
answer is we are both of these things
 

5419
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,470
answer is we are both of these things
and what is so exciting now is i think

5420
01:38:32,470 --> 01:38:32,480
and what is so exciting now is i think
 

5421
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:34,870
and what is so exciting now is i think
we can understand why we are both and

5422
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:34,880
we can understand why we are both and
 

5423
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:38,070
we can understand why we are both and
the answer is we come from ancestors

5424
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:38,080
the answer is we come from ancestors
 

5425
01:38:38,080 --> 01:38:40,070
the answer is we come from ancestors
that were elevated on proactive

5426
01:38:40,070 --> 01:38:40,080
that were elevated on proactive
 

5427
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:41,590
that were elevated on proactive
aggression that were

5428
01:38:41,590 --> 01:38:41,600
aggression that were
 

5429
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:43,590
aggression that were
hunters and killers

5430
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:43,600
hunters and killers
 

5431
01:38:43,600 --> 01:38:47,109
hunters and killers
both of animals and of each other

5432
01:38:47,109 --> 01:38:47,119
both of animals and of each other
 

5433
01:38:47,119 --> 01:38:49,270
both of animals and of each other
i think you've got to include that as

5434
01:38:49,270 --> 01:38:49,280
i think you've got to include that as
 

5435
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:52,790
i think you've got to include that as
almost certain uh from the past

5436
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
almost certain uh from the past
 

5437
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,910
almost certain uh from the past
and um and then now we've we've

5438
01:38:55,910 --> 01:38:55,920
and um and then now we've we've
 

5439
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,270
and um and then now we've we've
taken our reactive aggression and we've

5440
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,280
taken our reactive aggression and we've
 

5441
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:01,590
taken our reactive aggression and we've
down regulated it and that's given us

5442
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:01,600
down regulated it and that's given us
 

5443
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:04,550
down regulated it and that's given us
power it's given us power because

5444
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
power it's given us power because
 

5445
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,790
power it's given us power because
once you get rid of the alpha male once

5446
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:06,800
once you get rid of the alpha male once
 

5447
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,510
once you get rid of the alpha male once
the beta males take over and

5448
01:39:09,510 --> 01:39:09,520
the beta males take over and
 

5449
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,390
the beta males take over and
force selection in favor of a more

5450
01:39:12,390 --> 01:39:12,400
force selection in favor of a more
 

5451
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,350
force selection in favor of a more
tolerant less reactively aggressive

5452
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
tolerant less reactively aggressive
 

5453
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:16,950
tolerant less reactively aggressive
individual

5454
01:39:16,950 --> 01:39:16,960
individual
 

5455
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:18,470
individual
the effect is

5456
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
the effect is
 

5457
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:20,870
the effect is
that our cultures suddenly become

5458
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
that our cultures suddenly become
 

5459
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:23,510
that our cultures suddenly become
capable of focusing on things other than

5460
01:39:23,510 --> 01:39:23,520
capable of focusing on things other than
 

5461
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,790
capable of focusing on things other than
conflict

5462
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:24,800
conflict
 

5463
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,070
conflict
and so we have social groups in which

5464
01:39:28,070 --> 01:39:28,080
and so we have social groups in which
 

5465
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:30,149
and so we have social groups in which
individuals instead of constantly being

5466
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,159
individuals instead of constantly being
 

5467
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,229
individuals instead of constantly being
on edge in the way that chimpanzees are

5468

on edge in the way that chimpanzees are
 

5469
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,510
on edge in the way that chimpanzees are
with each other

5470
01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:33,520
with each other
 

5471
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:34,390
with each other
um

5472
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
um
 

5473
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,790
um
are able to interact

5474
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:36,800
are able to interact
 

5475
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,750
are able to interact
in ways that enable them to share

5476
01:39:39,750 --> 01:39:39,760
in ways that enable them to share

whatever the issue is cooperate in ways

5486
01:39:52,709 --> 01:39:52,719
whatever the issue is cooperate in ways
 

5487
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:54,390
whatever the issue is cooperate in ways
that make the group

5488
01:39:54,390 --> 01:39:54,400
that make the group
 

5489
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,870
that make the group
far more effective so you asked earlier

5490
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:56,880
far more effective so you asked earlier
 

5491
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,750
far more effective so you asked earlier
you know what did i think about why

5492
01:39:59,750 --> 01:39:59,760
you know what did i think about why
 

5493
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,750
you know what did i think about why
sapiens was able to expand at the

5494
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:01,760
sapiens was able to expand at the
 

5495
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,149
sapiens was able to expand at the
expense of neanderthals so dramatically

5496
01:40:04,149 --> 01:40:04,159
expense of neanderthals so dramatically
 

5497
01:40:04,159 --> 01:40:07,510
expense of neanderthals so dramatically
around 40 000 years ago and the answer

5498
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:07,520
around 40 000 years ago and the answer
 

5499
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,030
around 40 000 years ago and the answer
is uh

5500
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:09,040
is uh
 

5501
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:10,310
is uh
that

5502
01:40:10,310 --> 01:40:10,320
that
 

5503
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:12,629
that
whatever it was it had something to do

5504
01:40:12,629 --> 01:40:12,639
whatever it was it had something to do
 

5505
01:40:12,639 --> 01:40:15,669
whatever it was it had something to do
with the sapiens ability to cooperate

5506
01:40:15,669 --> 01:40:15,679
with the sapiens ability to cooperate
 

5507
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:17,430
with the sapiens ability to cooperate
yeah that was what gave them bigger

5508
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,440
yeah that was what gave them bigger
 

5509
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:21,109
yeah that was what gave them bigger
groups that's what enabled them to

5510
01:40:21,109 --> 01:40:21,119
groups that's what enabled them to
 

5511
01:40:21,119 --> 01:40:23,669
groups that's what enabled them to
have a far more effective way of living

5512
01:40:23,669 --> 01:40:23,679
have a far more effective way of living
 

5513
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:25,590
have a far more effective way of living
and i suspect it was to do with the

5514
01:40:25,590 --> 01:40:25,600
and i suspect it was to do with the
 

5515
01:40:25,600 --> 01:40:28,229
and i suspect it was to do with the
weapons and and military aspects but

5516
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:28,239
weapons and and military aspects but
 

5517
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:31,030
weapons and and military aspects but
even if it wasn't that the the

5518
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
even if it wasn't that the the
 

5519
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,830
even if it wasn't that the the
greater cooperation that sapiens were

5520
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:33,840
greater cooperation that sapiens were
 

5521
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,910
greater cooperation that sapiens were
showing uh would have been hugely

5522
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:35,920
showing uh would have been hugely
 

5523
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:39,030
showing uh would have been hugely
important so sapiens then had groups of

5524
01:40:39,030 --> 01:40:39,040
important so sapiens then had groups of
 

5525
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,830
important so sapiens then had groups of
uh

5526
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:39,840
uh
 

5527
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:41,669
uh
you know who knows exactly how big they

5528
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:41,679
you know who knows exactly how big they
 

5529
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:43,590
you know who knows exactly how big they
were but um

5530
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:43,600
were but um
 

5531
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:44,390
were but um

5537
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:51,830

neanderthals were living in um widely

5538
01:40:51,830 --> 01:40:51,840
neanderthals were living in um widely
 

5539
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,790

separated small groups of you know maybe

5540
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:54,800
separated small groups of you know maybe
 

5541
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:56,950
separated small groups of you know maybe
maybe as many as 15 or 20 people

where they saw others so rarely that

5546
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
where they saw others so rarely that
 

5547
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:03,430
where they saw others so rarely that
they were inbreeding at high levels you

5548
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,440
they were inbreeding at high levels you
 

5549
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:04,950
they were inbreeding at high levels you
know fathers

5550
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
know fathers
 

5551
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:08,229
know fathers
uh having babies with their daughters

5552
01:41:08,229 --> 01:41:08,239
uh having babies with their daughters
 

5553
01:41:08,239 --> 01:41:09,669
uh having babies with their daughters
very different world

5554
01:41:09,669 --> 01:41:09,679
very different world
 

5555
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:11,189
very different world
very different world and that's probably

5556
01:41:11,189 --> 01:41:11,199
very different world and that's probably
 

5557
01:41:11,199 --> 01:41:12,790
very different world and that's probably
what our world was like before we got

5558
01:41:12,790 --> 01:41:12,800
what our world was like before we got
 

5559
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,270
what our world was like before we got
sapiens before we got serpents and it's

5560
01:41:15,270 --> 01:41:15,280
sapiens before we got serpents and it's
 

5561
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:17,669
sapiens before we got serpents and it's
fascinating that there was that kind of

5562
01:41:17,669 --> 01:41:17,679
fascinating that there was that kind of
 

5563
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:20,229
fascinating that there was that kind of
violence against so

5564
01:41:20,229 --> 01:41:20,239
violence against so
 

5565
01:41:20,239 --> 01:41:21,590
violence against so
once you get the

5566
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
once you get the
 

5567
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:24,310
once you get the
get rid of the alpha males

5568
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:24,320
get rid of the alpha males
 

5569
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:27,189
get rid of the alpha males
you have now the freedom to uh

5570
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:27,199
you have now the freedom to uh
 

5571
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,750
you have now the freedom to uh
to have kindness amongst the beta

5572
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:29,760
to have kindness amongst the beta
 

5573
01:41:29,760 --> 01:41:32,790
to have kindness amongst the beta
the beta males like not not kindness but

5574
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:32,800
the beta males like not not kindness but
 

5575
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,030
the beta males like not not kindness but
collaboration that's the better word yes

5576
01:41:35,030 --> 01:41:35,040
collaboration that's the better word yes
 

5577
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,709
collaboration that's the better word yes
right much more correlation not just

5578
01:41:36,709 --> 01:41:36,719
right much more correlation not just
 

5579
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:38,790
right much more correlation not just
among the males but among the beta males

5580
01:41:38,790 --> 01:41:38,800
among the males but among the beta males
 

5581
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,109
among the males but among the beta males
but also among the gamma males and

5582
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
but also among the gamma males and
 

5583
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,430
but also among the gamma males and
the uh and the females yeah

5584
01:41:43,430 --> 01:41:43,440
the uh and the females yeah
 

5585
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,189
the uh and the females yeah
i don't know what a gamma male is but i

5586
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:45,199
i don't know what a gamma male is but i
 

5587
01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:47,350
i don't know what a gamma male is but i
imagine there's a whole alphabet

5588
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,360
imagine there's a whole alphabet
 

5589
01:41:47,360 --> 01:41:48,629
imagine there's a whole alphabet
well i don't know about hill alphabet

5590
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:48,639
well i don't know about hill alphabet
 

5591
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:50,870
well i don't know about hill alphabet
but i think the the big letters are the

5592
01:41:50,870 --> 01:41:50,880
but i think the the big letters are the
 

5593
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,350
but i think the the big letters are the
married men yeah and and the and the

5594
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:53,360
married men yeah and and the and the
 

5595
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:55,350
married men yeah and and the and the
unmarried men ah you know because now

5596
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
unmarried men ah you know because now
 

5597
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,270
unmarried men ah you know because now
the married men were had a problem with

5598
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:57,280
the married men were had a problem with
 

5599
01:41:57,280 --> 01:41:58,790
the married men were had a problem with
the unmarried men

5600
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
the unmarried men
 

5601
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,149
the unmarried men
right i mean you you see it in

5602
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:00,159
right i mean you you see it in
 

5603
01:42:00,159 --> 01:42:02,229
right i mean you you see it in
ethnographies of hunters and gatherers

5604
01:42:02,229 --> 01:42:02,239
ethnographies of hunters and gatherers
 

5605
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:04,950
ethnographies of hunters and gatherers
recently where uh the unmarried men

5606
01:42:04,950 --> 01:42:04,960
recently where uh the unmarried men
 

5607
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:07,510
recently where uh the unmarried men
would be given rules such as i mean the

5608
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
would be given rules such as i mean the
 

5609
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,590
would be given rules such as i mean the
very extreme rule in northern australia

5610
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
very extreme rule in northern australia
 

5611
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,550
very extreme rule in northern australia
was uh you cannot come to the camp uh

5612
01:42:12,550 --> 01:42:12,560
was uh you cannot come to the camp uh
 

5613
01:42:12,560 --> 01:42:15,270
was uh you cannot come to the camp uh
for months you have to go away and live

5614
01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:15,280
for months you have to go away and live
 

5615
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,270
for months you have to go away and live
uh somewhere out in the bush yes because

5616
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
uh somewhere out in the bush yes because
 

5617
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,629
uh somewhere out in the bush yes because
we don't want you anywhere near our

from something like

from something like
 

5707
01:43:54,639 --> 01:43:56,950
from something like
six or seven million years ago

six or seven million years ago

and then a branch
 

5715
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,669

led off to homo around 2 million years

and the way to think of

5720
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:08,400
and the way to think of
 

5721
01:44:08,400 --> 01:44:10,070
and the way to think of
australopithecines

5722
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:10,080
australopithecines
 

5723
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:12,229
australopithecines
is that they were like chimpanzees

5724
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:12,239
is that they were like chimpanzees
 

5725
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:13,990
is that they were like chimpanzees
standing upright

5726
01:44:13,990 --> 01:44:14,000
standing upright
 

5727
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,470
standing upright
so they were erect bipedal walkers

5728
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
so they were erect bipedal walkers
 

5729
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:20,390
so they were erect bipedal walkers
they were like chimpanzees

5730
01:44:20,390 --> 01:44:20,400
they were like chimpanzees
 

5731
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:23,189
they were like chimpanzees
in the sense that uh they had brains

5732
01:44:23,189 --> 01:44:23,199
in the sense that uh they had brains
 

5733
01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:25,750
in the sense that uh they had brains
about the size of a chimpanzee they were

5734
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
about the size of a chimpanzee they were
 

5735
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,350
about the size of a chimpanzee they were
literally about the body size of a

5736
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:27,360
literally about the body size of a
 

5737
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:30,310
literally about the body size of a
chimpanzee a little bit smaller actually

5738
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:30,320
chimpanzee a little bit smaller actually
 

5739
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:33,350
chimpanzee a little bit smaller actually
and they had big jaws because they were

5740
01:44:33,350 --> 01:44:33,360
and they had big jaws because they were
 

5741
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:35,590
and they had big jaws because they were
still eating

5742
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:35,600
still eating
 

5743
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,669
still eating
raw food they had

5744
01:44:37,669 --> 01:44:37,679
raw food they had
 

5745
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:39,510
raw food they had
big teeth and big jaws

5746
01:44:39,510 --> 01:44:39,520
big teeth and big jaws
 

5747
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:42,550
big teeth and big jaws
and then around two million years ago

5748
01:44:42,550 --> 01:44:42,560
and then around two million years ago
 

5749
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,390
and then around two million years ago
the line of australopithecines which

5750
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:44,400
the line of australopithecines which
 

5751
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,030
the line of australopithecines which
ended with a an intermediate species a

5752
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:47,040
ended with a an intermediate species a
 

5753
01:44:47,040 --> 01:44:48,550
ended with a an intermediate species a
kind of missing link area because it's

5754
01:44:48,550 --> 01:44:48,560
kind of missing link area because it's
 

5755
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:49,430
kind of missing link area because it's

was
 

5775
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:07,030
was
it had

5776
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
it had
 

5777
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:09,750
it had
a smaller mouth

5778
01:45:09,750 --> 01:45:09,760
a smaller mouth

5783
01:45:13,119 --> 01:45:16,709
smaller teeth
and to judge from its ribs and pelvis

5784
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:16,719
and to judge from its ribs and pelvis
 

5785
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:19,109
and to judge from its ribs and pelvis
smaller gut

5786

in addition

01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
in addition
 

5789
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,870
in addition
it had lost what australopithecines all

5790
01:45:22,870 --> 01:45:22,880
it had lost what australopithecines all
 

5791
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:25,350
it had lost what australopithecines all
had which was adaptations for climbing

5792
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:25,360
had which was adaptations for climbing
 

5793

in the trees
 

5795
01:45:27,440 --> 01:45:29,189
in the trees
and that meant that homo erectus must

5796
01:45:29,189 --> 01:45:29,199
and that meant that homo erectus must
 

5797
01:45:29,199 --> 01:45:31,590
and that meant that homo erectus must
have slept on the ground

5798
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:31,600
have slept on the ground
 

5799
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,990
have slept on the ground
and since it slept on the ground

5800
01:45:33,990 --> 01:45:34,000
and since it slept on the ground
 

5801
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,350
and since it slept on the ground
it should have been able to defend

5802
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:35,360
it should have been able to defend
 

5803
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,669
it should have been able to defend
itself somehow against predators and i

5804
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
itself somehow against predators and i
 

5805
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:39,030
itself somehow against predators and i
can't think of any way they could have

5806
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
can't think of any way they could have
 

5807
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,870
can't think of any way they could have
done that unless they had fire

5808
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:42,880

 

5809
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,669

so

5810
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
so
 

5811
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:47,430
so
there are two major clues to why

5812
01:45:47,430 --> 01:45:47,440
there are two major clues to why
 

5813
01:45:47,440 --> 01:45:48,870
there are two major clues to why
it was

5814
01:45:48,870 --> 01:45:48,880
it was
 

5815
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,550
it was
with homo erectus

5816
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
with homo erectus
 

5817
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:53,590
with homo erectus
that our ancestors first acquired the

5818
01:45:53,590 --> 01:45:53,600
that our ancestors first acquired the
 

5819
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:55,109
that our ancestors first acquired the
control of fire

5820
01:45:55,109 --> 01:45:55,119
control of fire
 

5821
01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:57,350
control of fire
one is the fact that they were clearly

5822
01:45:57,350 --> 01:45:57,360
one is the fact that they were clearly
 

5823
01:45:57,360 --> 01:45:59,430
one is the fact that they were clearly
not sleeping in trees in the way that

5824
01:45:59,430 --> 01:45:59,440
not sleeping in trees in the way that
 

5825
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,990
not sleeping in trees in the way that
chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos and

5826
01:46:01,990 --> 01:46:02,000
chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos and
 

5827
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,189
chimpanzees and gorillas and bonobos and
all the other primates do

5828
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:05,199
all the other primates do
 

5829
01:46:05,199 --> 01:46:07,669
all the other primates do
and the other is that

5830
01:46:07,669 --> 01:46:07,679
and the other is that
 

5831
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:09,189
and the other is that
there was this

5832
01:46:09,189 --> 01:46:09,199
there was this
 

5833
01:46:09,199 --> 01:46:12,950
there was this
striking reduction throughout the gut

5834
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:12,960
striking reduction throughout the gut
 

5835
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,390
striking reduction throughout the gut
reduction in

5836
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:14,400
reduction in
 

5837
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,830
reduction in
size of the mouth and the chewing

5838
01:46:15,830 --> 01:46:15,840
size of the mouth and the chewing
 

5839
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:17,270
size of the mouth and the chewing
apparatus

5840
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:17,280
apparatus
 

5841
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:19,189
apparatus
and in the gut itself

5842
01:46:19,189 --> 01:46:19,199
and in the gut itself
 

5843
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:20,149
and in the gut itself
and

5844
01:46:20,149 --> 01:46:20,159
and
 

5845
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:21,109
and
that

5846
01:46:21,109 --> 01:46:21,119
that
 

5847
01:46:21,119 --> 01:46:23,669
that
conforms to what we see nowadays about

5848
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
conforms to what we see nowadays about
 

5849
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,030
conforms to what we see nowadays about
humans which is that our guts are about

5850
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,040
humans which is that our guts are about
 

5851
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,350
humans which is that our guts are about
two-thirds of the size of what they

5852
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,360
two-thirds of the size of what they
 

5853
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:31,830
two-thirds of the size of what they
would be if we at raw food

5854
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
would be if we at raw food
 

5855
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,270
would be if we at raw food
to judge by

01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
to judge by
 

5857
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:35,270
to judge by
the great apes

5858
01:46:35,270 --> 01:46:35,280
the great apes
 

5859
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:35,990
the great apes
so

5860
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
so
 

5861
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,510
so
at some point in our revolution

5862
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
at some point in our revolution
 

5863
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,629
at some point in our revolution
we

5864
01:46:40,629 --> 01:46:40,639
we
 

5865
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:41,669
we
acquired

5866
01:46:41,669 --> 01:46:41,679
acquired
 

5867
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:43,669
acquired
the skill of cooking and skill of

5868
01:46:43,669 --> 01:46:43,679
the skill of cooking and skill of
 

5869
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:45,830
the skill of cooking and skill of
controlling fire

5870
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:45,840
controlling fire
 

5871
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:47,669
controlling fire
at no time

5872
01:46:47,669 --> 01:46:47,679
at no time
 

5873
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,750
at no time
between two million years ago and the

present
 

5877
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:53,669
present
do we see any changes in our anatomy

5878
01:46:53,669 --> 01:46:53,679
do we see any changes in our anatomy
 

5879
01:46:53,679 --> 01:46:56,550
do we see any changes in our anatomy
that can as it were justify

5880
01:46:56,550 --> 01:46:56,560
that can as it were justify

uh the
enormous change that happens when

enormous change that happens when

01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:03,109
enormous change that happens when
you are an animal that learns to control

5886
01:47:03,109 --> 01:47:03,119
you are an animal that learns to control
 

5887
01:47:03,119 --> 01:47:03,990
you are an animal that learns to control
fire

5888
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,000
fire
 

5889
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,590
fire
but at two million years ago we have

5890
01:47:05,590 --> 01:47:05,600
but at two million years ago we have
 

5891
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:08,390
but at two million years ago we have
exactly what you'd expect namely the

5892
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:08,400
exactly what you'd expect namely the
 

5893
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:10,629
exactly what you'd expect namely the
guts becoming smaller because the food

5894
01:47:10,629 --> 01:47:10,639
guts becoming smaller because the food
 

5895
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:12,870
guts becoming smaller because the food
is becoming softer and much more easy to

5896
01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:12,880
is becoming softer and much more easy to
 

5897
01:47:12,880 --> 01:47:14,790
is becoming softer and much more easy to
digest so you don't have to work so hard

5898
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800
digest so you don't have to work so hard
 

5899
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,109
digest so you don't have to work so hard
in your body to digest it

5900
01:47:17,109 --> 01:47:17,119
in your body to digest it
 

5901
01:47:17,119 --> 01:47:20,310
in your body to digest it
and as i say a commitment to sleeping on

5902
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:20,320
and as i say a commitment to sleeping on
 

5903
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,070
and as i say a commitment to sleeping on
the ground

5904
01:47:22,070 --> 01:47:22,080
the ground
 

5905
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:23,750
the ground
which i think you'd be absolutely crazy

5906
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:23,760
which i think you'd be absolutely crazy
 

5907
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:28,390
which i think you'd be absolutely crazy
to do nowadays uh on a moonless night uh

5908
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
to do nowadays uh on a moonless night uh
 

5909
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,229
to do nowadays uh on a moonless night uh
in the middle of serengeti unless you

5910
01:47:30,229 --> 01:47:30,239
in the middle of serengeti unless you
 

5911
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:32,629
in the middle of serengeti unless you
had fire i've slept out quite a lot in

5912
01:47:32,629 --> 01:47:32,639
had fire i've slept out quite a lot in
 

5913
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:35,510
had fire i've slept out quite a lot in
various parts of africa uh in the bush

5914
01:47:35,510 --> 01:47:35,520
various parts of africa uh in the bush
 

5915
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:37,830
various parts of africa uh in the bush
and you will not catch me

5916
01:47:37,830 --> 01:47:37,840
and you will not catch me
 

5917
01:47:37,840 --> 01:47:40,870
and you will not catch me
just lying on the ground um in an area

5918
01:47:40,870 --> 01:47:40,880
just lying on the ground um in an area
 

5919
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:43,030
just lying on the ground um in an area
with lots of predators unless i got a

5920
01:47:43,030 --> 01:47:43,040
with lots of predators unless i got a
 

5921
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:45,990
with lots of predators unless i got a
fire with me you're going to get eaten

5922
01:47:45,990 --> 01:47:46,000
fire with me you're going to get eaten
 

5923
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:47,590
fire with me you're going to get eaten
you're going to get terrified and you're

5924
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:47,600
you're going to get terrified and you're
 

5925
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:49,030
you're going to get terrified and you're
going to get eaten

5926
01:47:49,030 --> 01:47:49,040
going to get eaten
 

5927
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:51,510
going to get eaten
okay so there's a million questions i

5928
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
okay so there's a million questions i
 

5929
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,950
okay so there's a million questions i
want to ask so one

5930
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
want to ask so one
 

5931
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,910
want to ask so one
is is it very naturally coupled the

5932
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:55,920
is is it very naturally coupled the
 

5933
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,390
is is it very naturally coupled the
discovery of controlled fire and

5934
01:47:58,390 --> 01:47:58,400
discovery of controlled fire and
 

5935
01:47:58,400 --> 01:48:00,310
discovery of controlled fire and
cooking with fire is that an obvious

5936
01:48:00,310 --> 01:48:00,320
cooking with fire is that an obvious
 

5937
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:01,350
cooking with fire is that an obvious
leap

5938
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,360
leap
 

5939
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:03,590
leap
well what here's what we know we know

5940
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:03,600
well what here's what we know we know
 

5941
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:05,830
well what here's what we know we know
that um all the animals that we've

5942
01:48:05,830 --> 01:48:05,840
that um all the animals that we've
 

5943
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,629
that um all the animals that we've
tested like to eat their food cooked

5944
01:48:08,629 --> 01:48:08,639
tested like to eat their food cooked
 

5945
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,870
tested like to eat their food cooked
more than they like it raw okay so this

5946
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
more than they like it raw okay so this
 

5947
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:13,030
more than they like it raw okay so this
is true for all the great apes you know

5948
01:48:13,030 --> 01:48:13,040
is true for all the great apes you know
 

5949
01:48:13,040 --> 01:48:14,629
is true for all the great apes you know
we've tested them

5950
01:48:14,629 --> 01:48:14,639
we've tested them
 

5951
01:48:14,639 --> 01:48:17,590
we've tested them
um that's fascinating by the way why is

5952
01:48:17,590 --> 01:48:17,600
um that's fascinating by the way why is
 

5953
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,229
um that's fascinating by the way why is
that that's just like a property of food

5954
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:20,239
that that's just like a property of food
 

5955
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:22,629
that that's just like a property of food
i suppose yes i think what it is is that

5956
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:22,639
i suppose yes i think what it is is that
 

5957
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:23,910
i suppose yes i think what it is is that
um

5958
01:48:23,910 --> 01:48:23,920
um
 

5959
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,189
um
animals are always looking for any kind

5960
01:48:27,189 --> 01:48:27,199
animals are always looking for any kind
 

5961
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,070
animals are always looking for any kind
of way to get food that is easier to

5962
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:30,080
of way to get food that is easier to
 

5963
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,590
of way to get food that is easier to
digest

5964
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:31,600
digest
 

5965
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:33,270
digest
and there are various signals in the

5966
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:33,280
and there are various signals in the
 

5967
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:35,590
and there are various signals in the
food such as the amount of sugar there

5968
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600
food such as the amount of sugar there
 

5969
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,910
food such as the amount of sugar there
the amount of free amino acids because

5970
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:37,920
the amount of free amino acids because
 

5971
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:42,229
the amount of free amino acids because
the amino acids can be tasted

5972
01:48:42,229 --> 01:48:42,239
the amino acids can be tasted
 

5973
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,550
the amino acids can be tasted
and the physical qualities of the food

5974
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:44,560
and the physical qualities of the food
 

5975
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:46,629
and the physical qualities of the food
be particularly important how tough the

5976
01:48:46,629 --> 01:48:46,639
be particularly important how tough the
 

5977
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:49,350
be particularly important how tough the
food is always prefer softer food

5978
01:48:49,350 --> 01:48:49,360
food is always prefer softer food
 

5979
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:52,070
food is always prefer softer food
provided it it feels safe you know it

5980
01:48:52,070 --> 01:48:52,080
provided it it feels safe you know it
 

5981
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,750
provided it it feels safe you know it
tastes safe

5982
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:53,760
tastes safe
 

5983
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:57,750
tastes safe
and these kinds of sensory cues

5984
01:48:57,750 --> 01:48:57,760
and these kinds of sensory cues
 

5985
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:58,550
and these kinds of sensory cues
are

5986
01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,560
are
 

5987
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,709
are
all there in cooked food

5988
01:49:00,709 --> 01:49:00,719
all there in cooked food
 

5989
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:02,950
all there in cooked food
you know it's uh it's soft it doesn't

5990
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:02,960
you know it's uh it's soft it doesn't
 

5991
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,189
you know it's uh it's soft it doesn't
have so many uh toxins it's not so

5992
01:49:05,189 --> 01:49:05,199
have so many uh toxins it's not so
 

5993
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:08,390
have so many uh toxins it's not so
noxious to taste um easier to chew

5994
01:49:08,390 --> 01:49:08,400
noxious to taste um easier to chew
 

5995
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,750
noxious to taste um easier to chew
so

5996
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:09,760
so
 

5997
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,990
so
everyone loves it spontaneously uh your

5998
01:49:11,990 --> 01:49:12,000
everyone loves it spontaneously uh your
 

5999
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:13,990
everyone loves it spontaneously uh your
dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or

6000
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:14,000
dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or
 

6001
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,750
dogs and your cats prefer cooked food or
raw food well maybe you can say that's

6002
01:49:15,750 --> 01:49:15,760
raw food well maybe you can say that's
 

6003
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,510
raw food well maybe you can say that's
the consequence of domestication but

6004
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
the consequence of domestication but
 

6005
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,510
the consequence of domestication but
even you know as i say all of the great

6006
01:49:19,510 --> 01:49:19,520
even you know as i say all of the great
 

6007
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,109
even you know as i say all of the great
apes

6008
01:49:21,109 --> 01:49:21,119
apes
 

6009
01:49:21,119 --> 01:49:23,669
apes
not you test naive ones and uh they

6010
01:49:23,669 --> 01:49:23,679
not you test naive ones and uh they
 

6011
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:25,830
not you test naive ones and uh they
prefer it cooked if they can so

6012
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:25,840
prefer it cooked if they can so
 

6013
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,910
prefer it cooked if they can so
so then obvious once you have fire

6014
01:49:27,910 --> 01:49:27,920
so then obvious once you have fire
 

6015
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:29,510
so then obvious once you have fire
you're going to accidentally discover

6016
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
you're going to accidentally discover
 

6017
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:30,470
you're going to accidentally discover
that

6018
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:30,480
that
 

6019
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,470
that
food changes when you apply fire to it

6020
01:49:32,470 --> 01:49:32,480
food changes when you apply fire to it
 

6021
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,629
food changes when you apply fire to it
and then there's going it's going to be

6022
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:34,639
and then there's going it's going to be
 

6023
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:37,830
and then there's going it's going to be
the crate the big crazy new fad yeah you

6024
01:49:37,830 --> 01:49:37,840
the crate the big crazy new fad yeah you
 

6025
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:39,510
the crate the big crazy new fad yeah you
took the words out of my mouth i mean if

6026
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
took the words out of my mouth i mean if
 

6027
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:41,750
took the words out of my mouth i mean if
if they have fire at all and you know

6028
01:49:41,750 --> 01:49:41,760
if they have fire at all and you know
 

6029
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:43,830
if they have fire at all and you know
their food rolls into it

6030
01:49:43,830 --> 01:49:43,840
their food rolls into it
 

6031
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:45,430
their food rolls into it
five minutes later it tastes better than

6032
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
five minutes later it tastes better than
 

6033
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,870
five minutes later it tastes better than
before

6034
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:46,880
before
 

6035
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:49,109
before
how big of an invention from an

6036
01:49:49,109 --> 01:49:49,119
how big of an invention from an
 

6037
01:49:49,119 --> 01:49:50,870
how big of an invention from an
engineering perspective do you think is

6038
01:49:50,870 --> 01:49:50,880
engineering perspective do you think is
 

6039
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:53,430
engineering perspective do you think is
the discovery of fire

6040
01:49:53,430 --> 01:49:53,440
the discovery of fire
 

6041
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:55,669
the discovery of fire
do you think

6042
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:55,679
do you think
 

6043
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:57,589
do you think
for the

6044
01:49:57,589 --> 01:49:57,599
for the
 

6045
01:49:57,599 --> 01:50:00,310
for the
uh for homo erectus homo sapiens do you

6046
01:50:00,310 --> 01:50:00,320
uh for homo erectus homo sapiens do you
 

6047
01:50:00,320 --> 01:50:04,070
uh for homo erectus homo sapiens do you
think it's the greatest invention ever

6048
01:50:04,070 --> 01:50:04,080

 

6049
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,109

yeah

6050
01:50:05,109 --> 01:50:05,119
yeah
 

6051
01:50:05,119 --> 01:50:06,709
yeah
i think i think that

6052
01:50:06,709 --> 01:50:06,719
i think i think that
 

6053
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:07,830
i think i think that
that

6054
01:50:07,830 --> 01:50:07,840
that
 

6055
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:10,709
that
the control of fire has

6056
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:10,719
the control of fire has
 

6057
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:13,270
the control of fire has
been ultimately responsible for

6058
01:50:13,270 --> 01:50:13,280
been ultimately responsible for
 

6059
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,830
been ultimately responsible for
essentially

6060
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:15,840
essentially
 

6061
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:17,510
essentially
how grandiose do i want to be here you

6062
01:50:17,510 --> 01:50:17,520
how grandiose do i want to be here you
 

6063
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,229
how grandiose do i want to be here you
know the entire human story uh going

6064
01:50:20,229 --> 01:50:20,239
know the entire human story uh going
 

6065
01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:23,109
know the entire human story uh going
back to homo it is what changed us from

6066
01:50:23,109 --> 01:50:23,119
back to homo it is what changed us from
 

6067
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:26,149
back to homo it is what changed us from
being a regular kind of animal

6068
01:50:26,149 --> 01:50:26,159
being a regular kind of animal
 

6069
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:27,510
being a regular kind of animal
and

6070
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:27,520
and
 

6071
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,910
and
perhaps the biggest way in which it is

6072
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:29,920
perhaps the biggest way in which it is
 

6073
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:31,830
perhaps the biggest way in which it is
likely to have changed this is

6074
01:50:31,830 --> 01:50:31,840
likely to have changed this is
 

6075
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,830
likely to have changed this is
it reduced

6076
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
it reduced
 

6077
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:38,070
it reduced
the difficulty of making a large brain

6078
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:38,080
the difficulty of making a large brain
 

6079
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,510
the difficulty of making a large brain
so

6080
01:50:39,510 --> 01:50:39,520
so
 

6081
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,310
so
you know the story here is that

6082
01:50:42,310 --> 01:50:42,320
you know the story here is that
 

6083
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:44,709
you know the story here is that
the constraints on brain size

6084
01:50:44,709 --> 01:50:44,719
the constraints on brain size
 

6085
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:47,910
the constraints on brain size
are energetic

6086
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:47,920

 

6087
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:51,350

you and i have brains that are something

6088
01:50:51,350 --> 01:50:51,360
you and i have brains that are something
 

6089
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,510
you and i have brains that are something
like

6090
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:52,520
like
 

6091
01:50:52,520 --> 01:50:54,390
like
2.5

6092
01:50:54,390 --> 01:50:54,400
2.5
 

6093
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:56,629
2.5
of our body weight

6094
01:50:56,629 --> 01:50:56,639
of our body weight
 

6095
01:50:56,639 --> 01:51:00,470
of our body weight
uh it consumes around 25

6096
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
uh it consumes around 25
 

6097
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:03,430
uh it consumes around 25
of all of our calories

6098
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:03,440
of all of our calories
 

6099
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,350
of all of our calories
so it's disproportionate

6100
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
so it's disproportionate
 

6101
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:07,510
so it's disproportionate
there are other expensive organs in our

6102
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:07,520
there are other expensive organs in our
 

6103
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,510
there are other expensive organs in our
body as well such as the heart

6104
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,520

 

6105
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:13,270

and

6106
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
and
 

6107
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,350
and
what's different about their brain is

6108
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:15,360
what's different about their brain is
 

6109
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:18,070
what's different about their brain is
that in addition to us being able to

6110
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:18,080
that in addition to us being able to
 

6111
01:51:18,080 --> 01:51:19,669
that in addition to us being able to
fuel it in a way that other animals

6112
01:51:19,669 --> 01:51:19,679
fuel it in a way that other animals
 

6113
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:21,030
fuel it in a way that other animals
can't

6114
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:21,040
can't
 

6115
01:51:21,040 --> 01:51:23,830
can't
we also have reasons for wanting to have

6116
01:51:23,830 --> 01:51:23,840
we also have reasons for wanting to have
 

6117
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:25,350
we also have reasons for wanting to have
an even bigger brain whereas we don't

6118
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:25,360
an even bigger brain whereas we don't
 

6119
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,870
an even bigger brain whereas we don't
want an even bigger heart

6120
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:28,880

 

6121
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:32,470

so what those reasons are is unclear but

6122
01:51:32,470 --> 01:51:32,480
so what those reasons are is unclear but
 

6123
01:51:32,480 --> 01:51:35,189
so what those reasons are is unclear but
with regard to the costs of maintaining

6124
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:35,199
with regard to the costs of maintaining
 

6125
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:36,629
with regard to the costs of maintaining
a brain

6126
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:36,639
a brain
 

6127
01:51:36,639 --> 01:51:39,510
a brain
cooking makes it possible because it's

6128
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:39,520
cooking makes it possible because it's
 

6129
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,790
cooking makes it possible because it's
supplying

6130
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:40,800
supplying
 

6131
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,550
supplying
more calories

6132
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:42,560
more calories
 

6133
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:45,189
more calories
and it is enormously reducing the amount

6134
01:51:45,189 --> 01:51:45,199
and it is enormously reducing the amount
 

6135
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,310
and it is enormously reducing the amount
of time that it takes to chew your food

6136
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:48,320
of time that it takes to chew your food
 

6137
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,950
of time that it takes to chew your food
so if you were a gorilla

6138
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
so if you were a gorilla
 

6139
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,109
so if you were a gorilla
and you wanted to have a bigger brain

6140
01:51:53,109 --> 01:51:53,119
and you wanted to have a bigger brain
 

6141
01:51:53,119 --> 01:51:54,950
and you wanted to have a bigger brain
you might say okay well let's just eat

6142
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:54,960
you might say okay well let's just eat
 

6143
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,709
you might say okay well let's just eat
some more

6144
01:51:56,709 --> 01:51:56,719
some more
 

6145
01:51:56,719 --> 01:51:59,510
some more
but gorillas are eating

6146
01:51:59,510 --> 01:51:59,520
but gorillas are eating
 

6147
01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:00,550
but gorillas are eating
for

6148
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:00,560
for
 

6149
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,189
for
pretty much the entire day in the sense

6150
01:52:03,189 --> 01:52:03,199
pretty much the entire day in the sense
 

6151
01:52:03,199 --> 01:52:05,669
pretty much the entire day in the sense
that they are eating for

6152
01:52:05,669 --> 01:52:05,679
that they are eating for
 

6153
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:08,390
that they are eating for
maybe seven or eight hours a day in in

6154
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:08,400
maybe seven or eight hours a day in in
 

6155
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,070
maybe seven or eight hours a day in in
some seasons

6156
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:10,080
some seasons
 

6157
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,669
some seasons
uh that's just chewing and then they've

6158
01:52:11,669 --> 01:52:11,679
uh that's just chewing and then they've
 

6159
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:13,589
uh that's just chewing and then they've
got to sit around and digest their food

6160
01:52:13,589 --> 01:52:13,599
got to sit around and digest their food
 

6161
01:52:13,599 --> 01:52:15,430
got to sit around and digest their food
because they can't just eat all the time

6162
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:15,440
because they can't just eat all the time
 

6163
01:52:15,440 --> 01:52:16,470
because they can't just eat all the time
they've got to

6164
01:52:16,470 --> 01:52:16,480
they've got to
 

6165
01:52:16,480 --> 01:52:19,830
they've got to
take a break while the food is

6166
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:19,840
take a break while the food is
 

6167
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,470
take a break while the food is
digested in the stomach and then passed

6168
01:52:22,470 --> 01:52:22,480
digested in the stomach and then passed
 

6169
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:23,750
digested in the stomach and then passed
into the gut

6170
01:52:23,750 --> 01:52:23,760
into the gut
 

6171
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:26,790
into the gut
so the stomach is already full

6172
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:26,800
so the stomach is already full
 

6173
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:29,189
so the stomach is already full
so basically gorillas are eating about

6174
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
so basically gorillas are eating about
 

6175
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:31,030
so basically gorillas are eating about
the maximum rate already

6176
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:31,040
the maximum rate already
 

6177
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:33,350
the maximum rate already
so how does a gorilla get a bigger brain

6178
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
so how does a gorilla get a bigger brain
 

6179
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,669
so how does a gorilla get a bigger brain
it doesn't it's actually got a smaller

6180
01:52:35,669 --> 01:52:35,679
it doesn't it's actually got a smaller
 

6181
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:37,350
it doesn't it's actually got a smaller
brain relative to his body size than

6182
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:37,360
brain relative to his body size than
 

6183
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,030
brain relative to his body size than
chimpanzee does

6184
01:52:39,030 --> 01:52:39,040
chimpanzee does
 

6185
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:40,629
chimpanzee does
and um

6186
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:40,639
and um
 

6187
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:42,950
and um
and that's the basic problem for our

6188
01:52:42,950 --> 01:52:42,960
and that's the basic problem for our
 

6189
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:45,750
and that's the basic problem for our
ancestors then you come along and cook

6190
01:52:45,750 --> 01:52:45,760
ancestors then you come along and cook
 

6191
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,229
ancestors then you come along and cook
and all of a sudden you can get an

6192
01:52:48,229 --> 01:52:48,239
and all of a sudden you can get an
 

6193
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,229
and all of a sudden you can get an
increased amount of energy from your

6194
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,239
increased amount of energy from your
 

6195
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:51,830
increased amount of energy from your
food

6196
01:52:51,830 --> 01:52:51,840
food
 

6197
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:53,990
food
you are spending much less energy on

6198
01:52:53,990 --> 01:52:54,000
you are spending much less energy on
 

6199
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,149
you are spending much less energy on
digesting your food

6200
01:52:56,149 --> 01:52:56,159
digesting your food
 

6201
01:52:56,159 --> 01:52:57,430
digesting your food
you know there are

6202
01:52:57,430 --> 01:52:57,440
you know there are
 

6203
01:52:57,440 --> 01:52:59,589
you know there are
25 bodily processes

6204
01:52:59,589 --> 01:52:59,599
25 bodily processes
 

6205
01:52:59,599 --> 01:53:02,149
25 bodily processes
or more that are involved in digesting

6206
01:53:02,149 --> 01:53:02,159
or more that are involved in digesting
 

6207
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:05,350
or more that are involved in digesting
your food making the acid that

6208
01:53:05,350 --> 01:53:05,360
your food making the acid that
 

6209
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:07,910
your food making the acid that
takes the proteins apart

6210
01:53:07,910 --> 01:53:07,920
takes the proteins apart
 

6211
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:11,350
takes the proteins apart
maintaining the brush border where the

6212
01:53:11,350 --> 01:53:11,360
maintaining the brush border where the
 

6213
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:13,270
maintaining the brush border where the
molecules are taken across the gut wall

6214
01:53:13,270 --> 01:53:13,280
molecules are taken across the gut wall
 

6215
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:14,870
molecules are taken across the gut wall
and so on

6216
01:53:14,870 --> 01:53:14,880
and so on
 

6217
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:17,350
and so on
that all costs it costs you to digest

6218
01:53:17,350 --> 01:53:17,360
that all costs it costs you to digest
 

6219
01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:19,109
that all costs it costs you to digest
your food it costs less if you cook your

6220
01:53:19,109 --> 01:53:19,119
your food it costs less if you cook your
 

6221
01:53:19,119 --> 01:53:21,350
your food it costs less if you cook your
food so you get a net gain in the amount

6222
01:53:21,350 --> 01:53:21,360
food so you get a net gain in the amount
 

6223
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:22,709
food so you get a net gain in the amount
of energy

6224
01:53:22,709 --> 01:53:22,719
of energy
 

6225
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:25,589
of energy
and you are reducing the amount of time

6226
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
and you are reducing the amount of time
 

6227
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:26,550
and you are reducing the amount of time
from

6228
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:26,560
from
 

6229
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:29,510
from
uh in our case of our ancestors probably

6230
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:29,520
uh in our case of our ancestors probably
 

6231
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:31,750
uh in our case of our ancestors probably
around fifty percent of the day

6232
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:31,760
around fifty percent of the day
 

6233
01:53:31,760 --> 01:53:34,390
around fifty percent of the day
to chewing to nowadays

6234
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
to chewing to nowadays
 

6235
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,229
to chewing to nowadays
one hour a day chewing

6236
01:53:36,229 --> 01:53:36,239
one hour a day chewing
 

6237
01:53:36,239 --> 01:53:37,750
one hour a day chewing
so all of a sudden you've got hours a

6238
01:53:37,750 --> 01:53:37,760
so all of a sudden you've got hours a
 

6239
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:39,910
so all of a sudden you've got hours a
day in which to do other things and to

6240
01:53:39,910 --> 01:53:39,920
day in which to do other things and to
 

6241
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,709
day in which to do other things and to
use those those brains that you've now

6242
01:53:42,709 --> 01:53:42,719
use those those brains that you've now
 

6243
01:53:42,719 --> 01:53:45,990
use those those brains that you've now
enabled to grow so with homo erectus you

6244
01:53:45,990 --> 01:53:46,000
enabled to grow so with homo erectus you
 

6245
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,510
enabled to grow so with homo erectus you
start the process of getting a bigger

6246
01:53:47,510 --> 01:53:47,520
start the process of getting a bigger
 

6247
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,669
start the process of getting a bigger
brain and famously you know throughout

6248
01:53:49,669 --> 01:53:49,679
brain and famously you know throughout
 

6249
01:53:49,679 --> 01:53:51,350
brain and famously you know throughout
the whole period of the evolution of the

6250
01:53:51,350 --> 01:53:51,360
the whole period of the evolution of the
 

6251
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:53,669
the whole period of the evolution of the
genus homo you have a steadily

6252
01:53:53,669 --> 01:53:53,679
genus homo you have a steadily
 

6253
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,189
genus homo you have a steadily
increasing size of brain

6254
01:53:57,189 --> 01:53:57,199
increasing size of brain
 

6255
01:53:57,199 --> 01:53:58,229
increasing size of brain
until

6256
01:53:58,229 --> 01:53:58,239
until
 

6257
01:53:58,239 --> 01:54:00,390
until
right at the end when it actually gets

6258
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:00,400
right at the end when it actually gets
 

6259
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,470
right at the end when it actually gets
smaller but that's a different story

6260
01:54:02,470 --> 01:54:02,480
smaller but that's a different story
 

6261
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,910
smaller but that's a different story
which end is this

6262
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:03,920
which end is this
 

6263
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:06,149
which end is this
which are we talking about homo sapiens

6264
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:06,159
which are we talking about homo sapiens
 

6265
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,070
which are we talking about homo sapiens
yeah in with homo sapiens you've got a

6266
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,080
yeah in with homo sapiens you've got a
 

6267
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,790
yeah in with homo sapiens you've got a
smaller brain uh from

6268
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:10,800
smaller brain uh from
 

6269
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:13,030
smaller brain uh from
um people haven't got it exactly down

6270
01:54:13,030 --> 01:54:13,040
um people haven't got it exactly down
 

6271
01:54:13,040 --> 01:54:15,669
um people haven't got it exactly down
but at least 30 000 years ago it starts

6272
01:54:15,669 --> 01:54:15,679
but at least 30 000 years ago it starts
 

6273
01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:17,189
but at least 30 000 years ago it starts
declining

6274
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
declining
 

6275
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:18,310
declining
and

6276
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:18,320
and
 

6277
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,550
and
so the fascinating thing about that is

6278
01:54:20,550 --> 01:54:20,560
so the fascinating thing about that is
 

6279
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:22,470
so the fascinating thing about that is
that all domesticated animals have

6280
01:54:22,470 --> 01:54:22,480
that all domesticated animals have
 

6281
01:54:22,480 --> 01:54:25,430
that all domesticated animals have
smaller brains than their wild ancestors

6282
01:54:25,430 --> 01:54:25,440
smaller brains than their wild ancestors
 

6283
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,470
smaller brains than their wild ancestors
and

6284
01:54:26,470 --> 01:54:26,480
and
 

6285
01:54:26,480 --> 01:54:30,550
and
i

6286
01:54:30,550 --> 01:54:30,560

 

6287
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,310

the domestication is intricately

6288
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:32,320
the domestication is intricately
 

6289
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:34,149
the domestication is intricately
connected to this brain size you think

6290
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:34,159
connected to this brain size you think
 

6291
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:36,229
connected to this brain size you think
and do yeah exactly so i think what

6292
01:54:36,229 --> 01:54:36,239
and do yeah exactly so i think what
 

6293
01:54:36,239 --> 01:54:37,990
and do yeah exactly so i think what
we're seeing in humans is uh is that

6294
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:38,000
we're seeing in humans is uh is that
 

6295
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,790
we're seeing in humans is uh is that
same manifestation um and then the

6296
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:40,800
same manifestation um and then the
 

6297
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:43,750
same manifestation um and then the
fascinating question is is why and the

6298
01:54:43,750 --> 01:54:43,760
fascinating question is is why and the
 

6299
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,270
fascinating question is is why and the
only point i would want to make about

6300
01:54:45,270 --> 01:54:45,280
only point i would want to make about
 

6301
01:54:45,280 --> 01:54:46,310
only point i would want to make about
this is

6302
01:54:46,310 --> 01:54:46,320
this is
 

6303
01:54:46,320 --> 01:54:49,990
this is
that there's no evidence that in the

6304
01:54:49,990 --> 01:54:50,000
that there's no evidence that in the
 

6305
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,550
that there's no evidence that in the
small brain domesticates they're losing

6306
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,560
small brain domesticates they're losing
 

6307
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,310
small brain domesticates they're losing
say an average about 15 percent of brain

6308
01:54:54,310 --> 01:54:54,320
say an average about 15 percent of brain
 

6309
01:54:54,320 --> 01:54:55,189
say an average about 15 percent of brain
size

6310
01:54:55,189 --> 01:54:55,199
size
 

6311
01:54:55,199 --> 01:54:56,870
size
uh in those small brain domestics

6312
01:54:56,870 --> 01:54:56,880
uh in those small brain domestics
 

6313
01:54:56,880 --> 01:54:58,550
uh in those small brain domestics
compared to their wild ancestors there's

6314
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
compared to their wild ancestors there's
 

6315
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,109
compared to their wild ancestors there's
no indication of a loss of

6316
01:55:01,109 --> 01:55:01,119
no indication of a loss of
 

6317
01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:03,510
no indication of a loss of
cognitive ability

6318
01:55:03,510 --> 01:55:03,520
cognitive ability
 

6319
01:55:03,520 --> 01:55:05,750
cognitive ability
so i think what's going on is that

6320
01:55:05,750 --> 01:55:05,760
so i think what's going on is that
 

6321
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,629
so i think what's going on is that
uh it's a it's a younger brain it's a

6322
01:55:08,629 --> 01:55:08,639
uh it's a it's a younger brain it's a
 

6323
01:55:08,639 --> 01:55:11,030
uh it's a it's a younger brain it's a
more pedomorphic brain in looking like

6324
01:55:11,030 --> 01:55:11,040
more pedomorphic brain in looking like
 

6325
01:55:11,040 --> 01:55:13,750
more pedomorphic brain in looking like
the juveniles of the ancestor

6326
01:55:13,750 --> 01:55:13,760
the juveniles of the ancestor
 

6327
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:17,510
the juveniles of the ancestor
but just as our kids are very smart and

6328
01:55:17,510 --> 01:55:17,520
but just as our kids are very smart and
 

6329
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:19,270
but just as our kids are very smart and
can learn amazing things compared to

6330
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:19,280
can learn amazing things compared to
 

6331
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:20,950
can learn amazing things compared to
adults you know all they lack is wisdom

6332
01:55:20,950 --> 01:55:20,960
adults you know all they lack is wisdom
 

6333
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,629
adults you know all they lack is wisdom
and maturity but they you know in terms

6334
01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
and maturity but they you know in terms
 

6335
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,350
and maturity but they you know in terms
of sheer cognitive ability they got it

6336
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
of sheer cognitive ability they got it
 

6337
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,550
of sheer cognitive ability they got it
and i think that's the same with

6338
01:55:26,550 --> 01:55:26,560
and i think that's the same with
 

6339
01:55:26,560 --> 01:55:27,910
and i think that's the same with
domesticated animals compared to their

6340
01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:27,920
domesticated animals compared to their
 

6341
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,149
domesticated animals compared to their
wild ancestors and probably therefore

6342
01:55:30,149 --> 01:55:30,159
wild ancestors and probably therefore
 

6343
01:55:30,159 --> 01:55:30,950
wild ancestors and probably therefore
with

6344
01:55:30,950 --> 01:55:30,960
with
 

6345
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:34,310
with
um homo sapiens say 30 000 years ago

6346
01:55:34,310 --> 01:55:34,320
um homo sapiens say 30 000 years ago
 

6347
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,189
um homo sapiens say 30 000 years ago
compared to to their ancestors so we

6348
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:37,199
compared to to their ancestors so we
 

6349
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:40,629
compared to to their ancestors so we
have smaller brains than neanderthals

6350
01:55:40,629 --> 01:55:40,639
have smaller brains than neanderthals
 

6351
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:41,750
have smaller brains than neanderthals
size

what's the connection between fire

6356
01:55:47,270 --> 01:55:47,280
what's the connection between fire

what's the connection between fire
cooking and the eating of meat

humans

6362
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:54,320
humans
 

6363
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:56,870
humans
starting to enjoy the eating of meat

6364
01:55:56,870 --> 01:55:56,880
starting to enjoy the eating of meat
 

6365
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,310
starting to enjoy the eating of meat
or the

6366
01:55:58,310 --> 01:55:58,320
or the
 

6367
01:55:58,320 --> 01:56:00,310
or the
the the invention of fire and the use of

6368
01:56:00,310 --> 01:56:00,320
the the invention of fire and the use of
 

6369
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:02,229
the the invention of fire and the use of
fire for cooking i think that fire

6370
01:56:02,229 --> 01:56:02,239
fire for cooking i think that fire
 

6371
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:05,669
fire for cooking i think that fire
increased the using of meat but um

6372
01:56:05,669 --> 01:56:05,679
increased the using of meat but um
 

6373
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,870
increased the using of meat but um
but the fact that chimpanzees uh really

6374
01:56:08,870 --> 01:56:08,880
but the fact that chimpanzees uh really
 

6375
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:13,270
but the fact that chimpanzees uh really
like to hunt and kill meat as do bonobos

6376
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:13,280
like to hunt and kill meat as do bonobos
 

6377
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:16,149
like to hunt and kill meat as do bonobos
certainly puts us in so they they

6378
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
certainly puts us in so they they
 

6379
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:18,149
certainly puts us in so they they
those two species have a common ancestor

6380
01:56:18,149 --> 01:56:18,159
those two species have a common ancestor
 

6381
01:56:18,159 --> 01:56:19,910
those two species have a common ancestor
with us going six seven million years

6382
01:56:19,910 --> 01:56:19,920
with us going six seven million years
 

6383
01:56:19,920 --> 01:56:22,070
with us going six seven million years
ago and it was from that common ancestor

6384
01:56:22,070 --> 01:56:22,080
ago and it was from that common ancestor
 

6385
01:56:22,080 --> 01:56:24,070
ago and it was from that common ancestor
that you get the australopithecine line

6386
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:24,080
that you get the australopithecine line
 

6387
01:56:24,080 --> 01:56:26,229
that you get the australopithecine line
it's very likely therefore astrologians

6388
01:56:26,229 --> 01:56:26,239
it's very likely therefore astrologians
 

6389
01:56:26,239 --> 01:56:28,070
it's very likely therefore astrologians
were eating meat when they could get it

6390
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:28,080
were eating meat when they could get it
 

6391
01:56:28,080 --> 01:56:29,270
were eating meat when they could get it
which wouldn't be very often because

6392
01:56:29,270 --> 01:56:29,280
which wouldn't be very often because
 

6393
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:30,629
which wouldn't be very often because
they wouldn't be very

6394
01:56:30,629 --> 01:56:30,639
they wouldn't be very
 

6395
01:56:30,639 --> 01:56:32,470
they wouldn't be very
good sprinters but nevertheless they

6396
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:32,480
good sprinters but nevertheless they
 

6397
01:56:32,480 --> 01:56:33,830
good sprinters but nevertheless they
would occasionally be able to get some

6398
01:56:33,830 --> 01:56:33,840
would occasionally be able to get some
 

6399
01:56:33,840 --> 01:56:36,149
would occasionally be able to get some
meat and i bet they loved it all the

6400
01:56:36,149 --> 01:56:36,159
meat and i bet they loved it all the
 

6401
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:37,910
meat and i bet they loved it all the
time and basically all primates like

6402
01:56:37,910 --> 01:56:37,920
time and basically all primates like
 

6403
01:56:37,920 --> 01:56:39,830
time and basically all primates like
meat if they can get it almost all of

6404
01:56:39,830 --> 01:56:39,840
meat if they can get it almost all of
 

6405
01:56:39,840 --> 01:56:41,510
meat if they can get it almost all of
them

6406
01:56:41,510 --> 01:56:41,520
them
 

6407
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:43,910
them
but i think fire would have been very

6408
01:56:43,910 --> 01:56:43,920
but i think fire would have been very
 

6409
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,830
but i think fire would have been very
important um for a couple of reasons

6410
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:47,840
important um for a couple of reasons
 

6411
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,030
important um for a couple of reasons
uh one is that once you eat fire once

6412
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:51,040
uh one is that once you eat fire once
 

6413
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,350
uh one is that once you eat fire once
you eat your food cooked then you're

6414
01:56:53,350 --> 01:56:53,360
you eat your food cooked then you're
 

6415
01:56:53,360 --> 01:56:55,350
you eat your food cooked then you're
saving yourself time

6416
01:56:55,350 --> 01:56:55,360
saving yourself time
 

6417
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:57,350
saving yourself time
by saving yourself time

6418
01:56:57,350 --> 01:56:57,360
by saving yourself time
 

6419
01:56:57,360 --> 01:57:00,550
by saving yourself time
you can free up

6420
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:00,560
you can free up
 

6421
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:03,350
you can free up
the opportunity to go and hunt more

6422
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
the opportunity to go and hunt more
 

6423
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,510
the opportunity to go and hunt more
because hunting is a high risk high gain

6424
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:05,520
because hunting is a high risk high gain
 

6425
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,589
because hunting is a high risk high gain
activity

6426
01:57:07,589 --> 01:57:07,599
activity
 

6427
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:10,070
activity
there's every risk that you will get

6428
01:57:10,070 --> 01:57:10,080
there's every risk that you will get
 

6429
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:11,990
there's every risk that you will get
nothing on one particular afternoon that

6430
01:57:11,990 --> 01:57:12,000
nothing on one particular afternoon that
 

6431
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,750
nothing on one particular afternoon that
you go off

6432
01:57:13,750 --> 01:57:13,760
you go off
 

6433
01:57:13,760 --> 01:57:16,390
you go off
looking for opportunities to kill

6434
01:57:16,390 --> 01:57:16,400
looking for opportunities to kill
 

6435
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,790
looking for opportunities to kill
but it's high gain because when you do

6436
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:18,800
but it's high gain because when you do
 

6437
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:20,070
but it's high gain because when you do
get something

6438
01:57:20,070 --> 01:57:20,080
get something
 

6439
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,629
get something
you bring down a kudu then

6440
01:57:22,629 --> 01:57:22,639
you bring down a kudu then
 

6441
01:57:22,639 --> 01:57:26,470
you bring down a kudu then
you've got a serious amount of meat

6442
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:26,480

 

6443
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,510

what did

6444
01:57:27,510 --> 01:57:27,520
what did
 

6445
01:57:27,520 --> 01:57:29,109
what did
males and females do with the time they

6446
01:57:29,109 --> 01:57:29,119
males and females do with the time they
 

6447
01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:31,430
males and females do with the time they
were saving from not having to

6448
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:31,440
were saving from not having to
 

6449
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:33,830
were saving from not having to
chew their food i think that

6450
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:33,840
chew their food i think that
 

6451
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:35,430
chew their food i think that
in the case of males it's very

6452
01:57:35,430 --> 01:57:35,440
in the case of males it's very
 

6453
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:37,189
in the case of males it's very
reasonable to think they spent a greatly

6454
01:57:37,189 --> 01:57:37,199
reasonable to think they spent a greatly
 

6455
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:39,350
reasonable to think they spent a greatly
increased amount of time hunting

6456
01:57:39,350 --> 01:57:39,360
increased amount of time hunting
 

6457
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,109
increased amount of time hunting
so chimpanzees

6458
01:57:41,109 --> 01:57:41,119
so chimpanzees
 

6459
01:57:41,119 --> 01:57:42,550
so chimpanzees
they hunt

6460
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
they hunt
 

6461
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,390
they hunt
maybe two or three times a month and the

6462
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:44,400
maybe two or three times a month and the
 

6463
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:47,430
maybe two or three times a month and the
average hunt length is 20 minutes

6464
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:47,440
average hunt length is 20 minutes
 

6465
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:49,990
average hunt length is 20 minutes
with humans they're

6466
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:50,000
with humans they're
 

6467
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,030
with humans they're
hunting maybe uh 20 times a month

6468
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:53,040
hunting maybe uh 20 times a month
 

6469
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:55,189
hunting maybe uh 20 times a month
and the average hunt length is six hours

6470
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:55,199
and the average hunt length is six hours
 

6471
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:57,669
and the average hunt length is six hours
yeah so it's a huge difference yeah

6472
01:57:57,669 --> 01:57:57,679
yeah so it's a huge difference yeah
 

6473
01:57:57,679 --> 01:57:59,669
yeah so it's a huge difference yeah
so and that's possible because the time

6474
01:57:59,669 --> 01:57:59,679
so and that's possible because the time
 

6475
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,750
so and that's possible because the time
was available because they were cooking

6476
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:01,760
was available because they were cooking
 

6477
01:58:01,760 --> 01:58:05,030
was available because they were cooking
less chewing more hunting you got it

6478
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
less chewing more hunting you got it
 

6479
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,790
less chewing more hunting you got it
the other thing is

6480
01:58:06,790 --> 01:58:06,800
the other thing is
 

6481
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,709
the other thing is
that the meat

6482
01:58:08,709 --> 01:58:08,719
that the meat
 

6483
01:58:08,719 --> 01:58:10,629
that the meat
is so much nicer

6484
01:58:10,629 --> 01:58:10,639
is so much nicer
 

6485
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:13,189
is so much nicer
yeah yeah so when a chimpanzee

6486
01:58:13,189 --> 01:58:13,199
yeah yeah so when a chimpanzee
 

6487
01:58:13,199 --> 01:58:15,510
yeah yeah so when a chimpanzee
kills a monkey and i mean they are so

6488
01:58:15,510 --> 01:58:15,520
kills a monkey and i mean they are so
 

6489
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,430
kills a monkey and i mean they are so
excited about killing a monkey you know

6490
01:58:17,430 --> 01:58:17,440
excited about killing a monkey you know
 

6491
01:58:17,440 --> 01:58:19,030
excited about killing a monkey you know
they are so excited about going into the

6492
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:19,040
they are so excited about going into the
 

6493
01:58:19,040 --> 01:58:21,030
they are so excited about going into the
hunt and uh when they

6494
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:21,040
hunt and uh when they
 

6495
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:23,109
hunt and uh when they
make the kill then there's screams

6496
01:58:23,109 --> 01:58:23,119
make the kill then there's screams
 

6497
01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:26,070
make the kill then there's screams
everywhere and uh some try to

6498
01:58:26,070 --> 01:58:26,080
everywhere and uh some try to
 

6499
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,990
everywhere and uh some try to
seize it and capture it and take it away

6500
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,000
seize it and capture it and take it away
 

6501
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,470
seize it and capture it and take it away
from the others and eventually the

6502
01:58:30,470 --> 01:58:30,480
from the others and eventually the
 

6503
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:33,189
from the others and eventually the
strongest one has it and the others sit

6504
01:58:33,189 --> 01:58:33,199
strongest one has it and the others sit
 

6505
01:58:33,199 --> 01:58:34,790
strongest one has it and the others sit
around begging and trying to get some

6506
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:34,800
around begging and trying to get some
 

6507
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:36,550
around begging and trying to get some
and tear it off and so yeah they all

6508
01:58:36,550 --> 01:58:36,560
and tear it off and so yeah they all
 

6509
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:37,510
and tear it off and so yeah they all
love it

6510
01:58:37,510 --> 01:58:37,520
love it
 

6511
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,830
love it
there are others who he often goes to

6512
01:58:39,830 --> 01:58:39,840
there are others who he often goes to
 

6513
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:41,350
there are others who he often goes to
the top of a tree

6514
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:41,360
the top of a tree
 

6515
01:58:41,360 --> 01:58:42,790
the top of a tree
in order to be able to get away from all

6516
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
in order to be able to get away from all
 

6517
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,109
in order to be able to get away from all
of these beggars and scavengers and

6518
01:58:45,109 --> 01:58:45,119
of these beggars and scavengers and
 

6519
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,709
of these beggars and scavengers and
while he's there

6520
01:58:46,709 --> 01:58:46,719
while he's there
 

6521
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:49,030
while he's there
drops of blood or little scraps will

6522
01:58:49,030 --> 01:58:49,040
drops of blood or little scraps will
 

6523
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,510
drops of blood or little scraps will
fall down to the bottom and the junior

6524
01:58:51,510 --> 01:58:51,520
fall down to the bottom and the junior
 

6525
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:53,270
fall down to the bottom and the junior
members of society you know the females

6526
01:58:53,270 --> 01:58:53,280
members of society you know the females
 

6527
01:58:53,280 --> 01:58:55,589
members of society you know the females
and young and that sort of thing um they

6528
01:58:55,589 --> 01:58:55,599
and young and that sort of thing um they
 

6529
01:58:55,599 --> 01:58:57,910
and young and that sort of thing um they
they are racing through to find a

6530
01:58:57,910 --> 01:58:57,920
they are racing through to find a
 

6531
01:58:57,920 --> 01:58:59,350
they are racing through to find a
particular leaf that's got a drop of

6532
01:58:59,350 --> 01:58:59,360
particular leaf that's got a drop of
 

6533
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:00,950
particular leaf that's got a drop of
blood on it so they can lick it i mean

6534
01:59:00,950 --> 01:59:00,960
blood on it so they can lick it i mean
 

6535
01:59:00,960 --> 01:59:03,910
blood on it so they can lick it i mean
they love it

6536
01:59:03,910 --> 01:59:03,920

 

6537
01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:04,790

but

6538
01:59:04,790 --> 01:59:04,800
but
 

6539
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:05,830
but
yes

6540
01:59:05,830 --> 01:59:05,840
yes
 

6541
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:08,070
yes
it takes them a lot of time to chew it i

6542
01:59:08,070 --> 01:59:08,080
it takes them a lot of time to chew it i
 

6543
01:59:08,080 --> 01:59:10,070
it takes them a lot of time to chew it i
mean it's the same thing as for cooked

6544
01:59:10,070 --> 01:59:10,080
mean it's the same thing as for cooked
 

6545
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,430
mean it's the same thing as for cooked
food in general

6546
01:59:11,430 --> 01:59:11,440
food in general
 

6547
01:59:11,440 --> 01:59:15,350
food in general
so um they are getting meats very slowly

6548
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:15,360
so um they are getting meats very slowly
 

6549
01:59:15,360 --> 01:59:16,870
so um they are getting meats very slowly
into their bodies

6550
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
into their bodies
 

6551
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,790
into their bodies
and there sometimes comes a time when

6552
01:59:18,790 --> 01:59:18,800
and there sometimes comes a time when
 

6553
01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:20,470
and there sometimes comes a time when
they just say i've had enough of this i

6554
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
they just say i've had enough of this i
 

6555
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:23,189
they just say i've had enough of this i
need real food and they'll drop the meat

6556
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
need real food and they'll drop the meat
 

6557
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:25,189
need real food and they'll drop the meat
and go off and and eat

6558
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
and go off and and eat
 

6559
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,270
and go off and and eat
fruit again because they can get fruit

6560
01:59:27,270 --> 01:59:27,280
fruit again because they can get fruit
 

6561
01:59:27,280 --> 01:59:28,709
fruit again because they can get fruit
into their bodies so much faster than

6562
01:59:28,709 --> 01:59:28,719
into their bodies so much faster than
 

6563
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:31,189
into their bodies so much faster than
they can get meat

6564
01:59:31,189 --> 01:59:31,199
they can get meat
 

6565
01:59:31,199 --> 01:59:32,229
they can get meat
um

6566
01:59:32,229 --> 01:59:32,239
um
 

6567
01:59:32,239 --> 01:59:34,310
um
so once they're cooking that problem is

6568
01:59:34,310 --> 01:59:34,320
so once they're cooking that problem is
 

6569
01:59:34,320 --> 01:59:36,390
so once they're cooking that problem is
solved and they can eat the meat so this

6570
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:36,400
solved and they can eat the meat so this
 

6571
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,750
solved and they can eat the meat so this
is much more readily so i think that

6572
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:37,760
is much more readily so i think that
 

6573
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:40,229
is much more readily so i think that
meat eating would become important

6574
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:40,239
meat eating would become important
 

6575
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:42,310
meat eating would become important
for two reasons with cooking

6576
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:42,320
for two reasons with cooking
 

6577
01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:46,070
for two reasons with cooking
so the key uh not to oversimplify but

6578
01:59:46,070 --> 01:59:46,080
so the key uh not to oversimplify but
 

6579
01:59:46,080 --> 01:59:48,550
so the key uh not to oversimplify but
the key moments in human history

6580
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:48,560
the key moments in human history
 

6581
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:51,189
the key moments in human history
are with the homo erectus

6582
01:59:51,189 --> 01:59:51,199
are with the homo erectus
 

6583
01:59:51,199 --> 01:59:53,350
are with the homo erectus
the discovery of fire and the use of

6584
01:59:53,350 --> 01:59:53,360
the discovery of fire and the use of
 

6585
01:59:53,360 --> 01:59:55,189
the discovery of fire and the use of
fire for cooking

6586
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:55,199
fire for cooking
 

6587
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:58,870
fire for cooking
and then with uh homo sapiens the

6588
01:59:58,870 --> 01:59:58,880
and then with uh homo sapiens the
 

6589
01:59:58,880 --> 02:00:00,470
and then with uh homo sapiens the
the beta males

6590
02:00:00,470 --> 02:00:00,480
the beta males
 

6591
02:00:00,480 --> 02:00:02,390
the beta males
killing off the alpha males so that the

6592
02:00:02,390 --> 02:00:02,400
killing off the alpha males so that the
 

6593
02:00:02,400 --> 02:00:05,030
killing off the alpha males so that the
cooperation can exist and cooperation

6594
02:00:05,030 --> 02:00:05,040
cooperation can exist and cooperation
 

6595
02:00:05,040 --> 02:00:06,149
cooperation can exist and cooperation
leads to

6596
02:00:06,149 --> 02:00:06,159
leads to
 

6597
02:00:06,159 --> 02:00:08,470
leads to
communication and language and ideas the

6598
02:00:08,470 --> 02:00:08,480
communication and language and ideas the
 

6599
02:00:08,480 --> 02:00:10,629
communication and language and ideas the
sharing of ideas that kind of thing

6600
02:00:10,629 --> 02:00:10,639
sharing of ideas that kind of thing
 

6601
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:13,270
sharing of ideas that kind of thing
well yes the only thing i would modify

6602
02:00:13,270 --> 02:00:13,280
well yes the only thing i would modify
 

6603
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,910
well yes the only thing i would modify
on that is that you have to ask

6604
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:15,920
on that is that you have to ask
 

6605
02:00:15,920 --> 02:00:18,470
on that is that you have to ask
how is it that the beta males were able

6606
02:00:18,470 --> 02:00:18,480
how is it that the beta males were able
 

6607
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:20,310
how is it that the beta males were able
to kill the alpha male

6608
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:20,320
to kill the alpha male
 

6609
02:00:20,320 --> 02:00:21,109
to kill the alpha male
right

6610
02:00:21,109 --> 02:00:21,119
right
 

6611
02:00:21,119 --> 02:00:23,510
right
and we now know that although

6612
02:00:23,510 --> 02:00:23,520
and we now know that although
 

6613
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:26,149
and we now know that although
chimpanzees do kill males within their

6614
02:00:26,149 --> 02:00:26,159
chimpanzees do kill males within their
 

6615
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:29,109
chimpanzees do kill males within their
own group sometimes it's not a process

6616
02:00:29,109 --> 02:00:29,119
own group sometimes it's not a process
 

6617
02:00:29,119 --> 02:00:31,669
own group sometimes it's not a process
of killing the alpha male it's taking

6618
02:00:31,669 --> 02:00:31,679
of killing the alpha male it's taking
 

6619
02:00:31,679 --> 02:00:34,310
of killing the alpha male it's taking
advantage of opportunity when some male

6620
02:00:34,310 --> 02:00:34,320
advantage of opportunity when some male
 

6621
02:00:34,320 --> 02:00:36,870
advantage of opportunity when some male
gets into a bad position but it's not a

6622
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
gets into a bad position but it's not a
 

6623
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,390
gets into a bad position but it's not a
systematic ability to kill the alpha

6624
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:38,400
systematic ability to kill the alpha
 

6625
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,270
systematic ability to kill the alpha
male

6626

male
 

6627
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:41,270
male
and you can see see why you know because

6628
02:00:41,270 --> 02:00:41,280
and you can see see why you know because
 

6629
02:00:41,280 --> 02:00:43,270
and you can see see why you know because
they don't have language and without

they don't have language and without
 

6631
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:46,550
they don't have language and without
language it's very difficult to know

6632
02:00:46,550 --> 02:00:46,560
language it's very difficult to know
 

6633
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:48,629

his group
 

6657
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:08,950
his group
some of those allies might be willing to

6658
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:08,960
some of those allies might be willing to
 

6659
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:11,350
some of those allies might be willing to
to turn against him

to turn against him
 

6661
02:01:11,360 --> 02:01:13,030
to turn against him
some of them might be harboring deep

6662

some of them might be harboring deep
 

6663
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,189

but how does anyone else know that
 

6667
02:01:17,679 --> 02:01:19,270
but how does anyone else know that
so in other words i think that you have

6668
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:19,280
so in other words i think that you have
 

6669

so in other words i think that you have
to have

some kind of language that is pretty

6672
02:01:22,470 --> 02:01:22,480
some kind of language that is pretty
 

6673
02:01:22,480 --> 02:01:23,669
some kind of language that is pretty
good

6674
02:01:23,669 --> 02:01:23,679
good
 

6675
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:26,070
good
to solve the problems of

6676
02:01:26,070 --> 02:01:26,080
to solve the problems of
 

6677
02:01:26,080 --> 02:01:27,750
to solve the problems of
gaining confidence

6678
02:01:27,750 --> 02:01:27,760
gaining confidence
 

6679
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:29,750
gaining confidence
that

6680
02:01:29,750 --> 02:01:29,760
that
 

6681
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,990
that
five of you say you know or some some

6682
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,000
five of you say you know or some some
 

6683
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:32,950
five of you say you know or some some
number

6684
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
number
 

6685
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:33,910
number
um

6686
02:01:33,910 --> 02:01:33,920
um
 

6687
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:36,950
um
can trust each other in this final

6688
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
can trust each other in this final
 

6689
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,390
can trust each other in this final
attack

6690
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,400
attack
 

6691
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,709
attack
and you know even nowadays it's it's

6692
02:01:40,709 --> 02:01:40,719
and you know even nowadays it's it's
 

6693
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:42,709
and you know even nowadays it's it's
difficult uh you know when you mention

6694
02:01:42,709 --> 02:01:42,719
difficult uh you know when you mention
 

6695
02:01:42,719 --> 02:01:44,149
difficult uh you know when you mention
stalin

6696
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
stalin
 

6697
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:45,589
stalin
it's like

6698
02:01:45,589 --> 02:01:45,599
it's like
 

6699
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:48,310
it's like
why was everybody terrified

6700
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:48,320
why was everybody terrified
 

6701
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:51,270
why was everybody terrified
any dictator that takes control why is

6702
02:01:51,270 --> 02:01:51,280
any dictator that takes control why is
 

6703
02:01:51,280 --> 02:01:53,270
any dictator that takes control why is
all of us as individuals terrified when

6704
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
all of us as individuals terrified when
 

6705
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,910
all of us as individuals terrified when
you know there's millions of us

6706
02:01:55,910 --> 02:01:55,920
you know there's millions of us
 

6707
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:58,790
you know there's millions of us
that's right and so like that we lack

6708
02:01:58,790 --> 02:01:58,800
that's right and so like that we lack
 

6709
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:01,510
that's right and so like that we lack
the language because our basic

6710
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:01,520
the language because our basic
 

6711
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:04,790
the language because our basic
psychology of fear overtakes us like who

6712
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:04,800
psychology of fear overtakes us like who
 

6713
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:07,109
psychology of fear overtakes us like who
can we talk to who can we talk to and

6714
02:02:07,109 --> 02:02:07,119
can we talk to who can we talk to and
 

6715
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:09,830
can we talk to who can we talk to and
not get killed ourselves exactly that's

6716
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:09,840
not get killed ourselves exactly that's
 

6717
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:12,149
not get killed ourselves exactly that's
right but you're yeah do you have this

6718
02:02:12,149 --> 02:02:12,159
right but you're yeah do you have this
 

6719
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:14,870
right but you're yeah do you have this
intuition that some kind of language was

6720
02:02:14,870 --> 02:02:14,880
intuition that some kind of language was
 

6721
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:16,470
intuition that some kind of language was
developing

6722
02:02:16,470 --> 02:02:16,480
developing
 

6723
02:02:16,480 --> 02:02:18,550
developing
along with this process

6724
02:02:18,550 --> 02:02:18,560
along with this process
 

6725
02:02:18,560 --> 02:02:21,510
along with this process
of beta males taking over yes yes i mean

6726
02:02:21,510 --> 02:02:21,520
of beta males taking over yes yes i mean
 

6727
02:02:21,520 --> 02:02:23,910
of beta males taking over yes yes i mean
once you have sufficient language to be

6728
02:02:23,910 --> 02:02:23,920
once you have sufficient language to be
 

6729
02:02:23,920 --> 02:02:25,669
once you have sufficient language to be
able to have the beta males conspiring

6730
02:02:25,669 --> 02:02:25,679
able to have the beta males conspiring
 

6731
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:27,990
able to have the beta males conspiring
to kill the alpha male

6732
02:02:27,990 --> 02:02:28,000
to kill the alpha male
 

6733
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:31,510
to kill the alpha male
then you have selection uh in favor of

6734
02:02:31,510 --> 02:02:31,520
then you have selection uh in favor of
 

6735
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:33,189
then you have selection uh in favor of
cooperation and tolerance as we spoke

6736
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:33,199
cooperation and tolerance as we spoke
 

6737
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:37,270
cooperation and tolerance as we spoke
about and at that point there will be uh

6738
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,280
about and at that point there will be uh
 

6739
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:38,950
about and at that point there will be uh
increased ability to communicate and the

6740
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
increased ability to communicate and the
 

6741
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:40,629
increased ability to communicate and the
language will get richer and better and

6742
02:02:40,629 --> 02:02:40,639
language will get richer and better and
 

6743
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:41,589
language will get richer and better and
better

6744
02:02:41,589 --> 02:02:41,599
better
 

6745
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,229
better
so yes absolutely positive feedback loop

6746
02:02:44,229 --> 02:02:44,239
so yes absolutely positive feedback loop
 

6747
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:48,149
so yes absolutely positive feedback loop
once you get the situation started

6748
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
once you get the situation started
 

6749
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:51,669
once you get the situation started
can you maybe comment on um

6750
02:02:51,669 --> 02:02:51,679
can you maybe comment on um

02:02:51,679 --> 02:02:53,589
can you maybe comment on um
the full complexity and richness of the

the full complexity and richness of the

wanting to say is that
 

6885

there is a world of

evolves in response
 

6893
02:05:22,480 --> 02:05:25,510
evolves in response
to these platforms that are put there

6894
02:05:25,510 --> 02:05:25,520
to these platforms that are put there
 

6895
02:05:25,520 --> 02:05:27,589
to these platforms that are put there
you know the platform of

6896
02:05:27,589 --> 02:05:27,599
you know the platform of
 

6897
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:29,030
you know the platform of
increasing brain size and therefore

6898
02:05:29,030 --> 02:05:29,040
increasing brain size and therefore
 

6899
02:05:29,040 --> 02:05:31,830
increasing brain size and therefore
cognitive ability made possible by

6900
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:31,840
cognitive ability made possible by
 

6901
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:34,950
cognitive ability made possible by
uh increased energy supply the platform

6902
02:05:34,950 --> 02:05:34,960
uh increased energy supply the platform
 

6903
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:35,750
uh increased energy supply the platform
of

02:05:37,910 --> 02:05:37,920
uh cooperation and
 

6907
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:40,629
uh cooperation and
tolerance in a world in which there

tolerance in a world in which there
 

6909
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:42,790

and therefore a need to respond to the

and therefore a need to respond to the
 

6913
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:48,069
and therefore a need to respond to the
conflict and manipulate your allies

6914

6944
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
um them wanting to
 

6945
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,030
um them wanting to
very poetry

6946
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:15,040
very poetry
 

6947
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,510
very poetry
well yes you know show off yeah

6948
02:06:17,510 --> 02:06:17,520
well yes you know show off yeah
 

6949
02:06:17,520 --> 02:06:18,870
well yes you know show off yeah
in all the different ways so all of

6950
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:18,880
in all the different ways so all of
 

6951
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,589
in all the different ways so all of
these are natural consequences of uh

6952
02:06:21,589 --> 02:06:21,599
these are natural consequences of uh
 

6953
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:23,830
these are natural consequences of uh
just coming up with strategies of how to

6954
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840
just coming up with strategies of how to
 

6955
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,589
just coming up with strategies of how to
cooperate and

6956
02:06:25,589 --> 02:06:25,599
cooperate and
 

6957
02:06:25,599 --> 02:06:27,430
cooperate and
how to achieve certain ends so that's

6958
02:06:27,430 --> 02:06:27,440
how to achieve certain ends so that's
 

6959
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:30,069
how to achieve certain ends so that's
just like a natural

6960
02:06:30,069 --> 02:06:30,079
just like a natural
 

6961
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:31,430
just like a natural
i mean we haven't spoken about sexual

6962
02:06:31,430 --> 02:06:31,440
i mean we haven't spoken about sexual
 

6963
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:33,030
i mean we haven't spoken about sexual
selection but but that is a really

6964
02:06:33,030 --> 02:06:33,040
selection but but that is a really
 

6965
02:06:33,040 --> 02:06:35,589
selection but but that is a really
important part of it you know they

6966
02:06:35,589 --> 02:06:35,599
important part of it you know they
 

6967
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:38,069
important part of it you know they
trying to out-compete each other in

6968
02:06:38,069 --> 02:06:38,079
trying to out-compete each other in
 

6969
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:39,350
trying to out-compete each other in
um

6970
02:06:39,350 --> 02:06:39,360
um
 

6971
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:42,390
um
normally without any physical conflict

6972
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:42,400
normally without any physical conflict
 

6973
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:44,950
normally without any physical conflict
uh just in order to be able to be chosen

6974
02:06:44,950 --> 02:06:44,960
uh just in order to be able to be chosen
 

6975
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:47,430
uh just in order to be able to be chosen
by mates of the opposite sex and and

6976
02:06:47,430 --> 02:06:47,440
by mates of the opposite sex and and
 

6977
02:06:47,440 --> 02:06:50,229
by mates of the opposite sex and and
that that is certainly a major source of

6978
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:50,239
that that is certainly a major source of
 

6979
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:53,270
that that is certainly a major source of
creativity

6980
02:06:53,270 --> 02:06:53,280

 

6981
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:54,229

so

6982
02:06:54,229 --> 02:06:54,239
so
 

6983
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:57,430
so
you've studied chimps you also all the

6984
02:06:57,430 --> 02:06:57,440
you've studied chimps you also all the
 

6985
02:06:57,440 --> 02:06:59,510
you've studied chimps you also all the
other relatives gorillas what do you

6986
02:06:59,510 --> 02:06:59,520
other relatives gorillas what do you
 

6987
02:06:59,520 --> 02:07:01,430
other relatives gorillas what do you
find beautiful and fascinating about

6988
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:01,440
find beautiful and fascinating about
 

6989
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,910
find beautiful and fascinating about
chimps about gorillas about humans maybe

6990
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:03,920
chimps about gorillas about humans maybe
 

6991
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:05,589
chimps about gorillas about humans maybe
you can paint the the whole picture of

6992
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
you can paint the the whole picture of
 

6993
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:07,990
you can paint the the whole picture of
that evolutionary that little local

6994
02:07:07,990 --> 02:07:08,000
that evolutionary that little local
 

6995
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,790
that evolutionary that little local
pocket of the evolutionary tree

6996
02:07:10,790 --> 02:07:10,800
pocket of the evolutionary tree
 

6997
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:12,950
pocket of the evolutionary tree
how are we related what is the common

6998
02:07:12,950 --> 02:07:12,960
how are we related what is the common
 

6999
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,870
how are we related what is the common
ancestor what are the interesting

7000
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:14,880
ancestor what are the interesting
 

7001
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:16,790
ancestor what are the interesting
differences i know i'm asking a million

7002
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:16,800
differences i know i'm asking a million
 

7003
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,149
differences i know i'm asking a million
questions but

7004
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
questions but
 

7005
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:18,950
questions but
um

7006
02:07:18,950 --> 02:07:18,960
um
 

7007
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:21,669
um
can you paint a map of

7008
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
can you paint a map of
 

7009
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:23,669
can you paint a map of
what are chimps gorillas and humans like

7010
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:23,679
what are chimps gorillas and humans like
 

7011
02:07:23,679 --> 02:07:25,750
what are chimps gorillas and humans like
how we're related and what you find

7012
02:07:25,750 --> 02:07:25,760
how we're related and what you find
 

7013
02:07:25,760 --> 02:07:29,189
how we're related and what you find
fascinating about each

7014
02:07:29,189 --> 02:07:29,199

 

7015
02:07:29,199 --> 02:07:31,109

in africa

7016
02:07:31,109 --> 02:07:31,119
in africa
 

7017
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:33,669
in africa
straddling the equator

7018
02:07:33,669 --> 02:07:33,679
straddling the equator
 

7019
02:07:33,679 --> 02:07:37,270
straddling the equator
there is a strip of rainforest

7020
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,280
there is a strip of rainforest
 

7021
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,390
there is a strip of rainforest
that

7022
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,400
that
 

7023
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:41,510
that
relies on the combination of

7024
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:41,520
relies on the combination of
 

7025
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,669
relies on the combination of
high temperatures and rainfall that you

7026
02:07:43,669 --> 02:07:43,679
high temperatures and rainfall that you
 

7027
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:46,629
high temperatures and rainfall that you
get around the equator

7028
02:07:46,629 --> 02:07:46,639
get around the equator
 

7029
02:07:46,639 --> 02:07:49,430
get around the equator
that rainforest goes into about

7030
02:07:49,430 --> 02:07:49,440
that rainforest goes into about
 

7031
02:07:49,440 --> 02:07:51,750
that rainforest goes into about
22 countries

7032
02:07:51,750 --> 02:07:51,760
22 countries
 

7033
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:53,750
22 countries
and throughout those countries uh you

7034
02:07:53,750 --> 02:07:53,760
and throughout those countries uh you
 

7035
02:07:53,760 --> 02:07:55,669
and throughout those countries uh you
have chimpanzees although they've gone

7036
02:07:55,669 --> 02:07:55,679
have chimpanzees although they've gone
 

7037
02:07:55,679 --> 02:07:57,910
have chimpanzees although they've gone
extinct in two of them

7038
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:57,920
extinct in two of them
 

7039
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:58,870
extinct in two of them
i

7040
02:07:58,870 --> 02:07:58,880
i
 

7041
02:07:58,880 --> 02:07:59,830
i
in

uh
 

7045
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:03,189
uh
just a fraction of them but i was at

7046
02:08:03,189 --> 02:08:03,199
just a fraction of them but i was at
 

7047
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:06,790
just a fraction of them but i was at
sorry five countries uh you've got

7048
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:06,800
sorry five countries uh you've got
 

7049
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,390
sorry five countries uh you've got
gorillas

7050
02:08:08,390 --> 02:08:08,400
gorillas
 

7051
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:10,229
gorillas
where there are mountains

7052
02:08:10,229 --> 02:08:10,239
where there are mountains
 

7053
02:08:10,239 --> 02:08:12,790
where there are mountains
and in one country on the left bank of

7054
02:08:12,790 --> 02:08:12,800
and in one country on the left bank of
 

7055
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,470
and in one country on the left bank of
the great congo river

7056
02:08:14,470 --> 02:08:14,480
the great congo river
 

7057
02:08:14,480 --> 02:08:17,510
the great congo river
you have bonobos

7058
02:08:17,510 --> 02:08:17,520
you have bonobos
 

7059
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:19,189
you have bonobos
so in the african forest you've got

7060
02:08:19,189 --> 02:08:19,199
so in the african forest you've got
 

7061
02:08:19,199 --> 02:08:21,109
so in the african forest you've got
these three african apes the only

7062
02:08:21,109 --> 02:08:21,119
these three african apes the only
 

7063
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:23,109
these three african apes the only
african apes

7064
02:08:23,109 --> 02:08:23,119
african apes
 

7065
02:08:23,119 --> 02:08:24,390
african apes
all of which

7066
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:24,400
all of which
 

7067
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:25,270
all of which
are

7068
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:25,280
are
 

7069
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,270
are
very similar in

7070
02:08:27,270 --> 02:08:27,280
very similar in
 

7071
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:28,629
very similar in
much of their

7072
02:08:28,629 --> 02:08:28,639
much of their
 

7073
02:08:28,639 --> 02:08:30,229
much of their
way of life

7074
02:08:30,229 --> 02:08:30,239
way of life
 

7075
02:08:30,239 --> 02:08:31,990
way of life
they walk on their knuckles

7076
02:08:31,990 --> 02:08:32,000
they walk on their knuckles
 

7077
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,669
they walk on their knuckles
through the forest looking for fruit

7078
02:08:33,669 --> 02:08:33,679
through the forest looking for fruit
 

7079
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:34,550
through the forest looking for fruit
trees

7080
02:08:34,550 --> 02:08:34,560
trees
 

7081
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:36,470
trees
and eating

7082
02:08:36,470 --> 02:08:36,480
and eating
 

7083
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:41,189
and eating
herbs when they can't find fruits

7084
02:08:41,189 --> 02:08:41,199

 

7085
02:08:41,199 --> 02:08:42,709

gorillas

7086
02:08:42,709 --> 02:08:42,719
gorillas
 

7087
02:08:42,719 --> 02:08:45,990
gorillas
represent the oldest chain

7088
02:08:45,990 --> 02:08:46,000
represent the oldest chain
 

7089
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:47,589
represent the oldest chain
so about

7090
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
so about
 

7091
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,669
so about
10 million years ago maybe as recently

7092
02:08:49,669 --> 02:08:49,679
10 million years ago maybe as recently
 

7093
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:51,669
10 million years ago maybe as recently
as 8 million years ago

7094
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:51,679
as 8 million years ago
 

7095
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:54,069
as 8 million years ago
the ancestral gorillas broke off from

7096
02:08:54,069 --> 02:08:54,079
the ancestral gorillas broke off from
 

7097
02:08:54,079 --> 02:08:55,990
the ancestral gorillas broke off from
the ancestor leading to chimps and

7098
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:56,000
the ancestor leading to chimps and
 

7099
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,229
the ancestor leading to chimps and
bonobos and humans

7100
02:08:58,229 --> 02:08:58,239
bonobos and humans
 

7101
02:08:58,239 --> 02:09:00,470
bonobos and humans
so they probably remained very similar

7102
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,480
so they probably remained very similar
 

7103
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,470
so they probably remained very similar
now to what

7104
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:02,480
now to what
 

7105
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,629
now to what
very similar to what they were then they

7106
02:09:04,629 --> 02:09:04,639
very similar to what they were then they
 

7107
02:09:04,639 --> 02:09:06,149
very similar to what they were then they
were probably

7108
02:09:06,149 --> 02:09:06,159
were probably
 

7109
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:07,030
were probably
um

7110
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
um
 

7111
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:10,229
um

02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,149
so yeah so okay so this is an ancient
branch of the evolutionary tree uh this

7280
02:12:16,149 --> 02:12:16,159
branch of the evolutionary tree uh this
 

7281
02:12:16,159 --> 02:12:19,109
branch of the evolutionary tree uh this
gorilla that led to gorillas gorillas um

7282
02:12:19,109 --> 02:12:19,119
gorilla that led to gorillas gorillas um
 

7283
02:12:19,119 --> 02:12:20,709
gorilla that led to gorillas gorillas um
so then the next thing that happened on

7284
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:20,719
so then the next thing that happened on
 

7285
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:22,550
so then the next thing that happened on
the evolutionary tree was uh six or

7286
02:12:22,550 --> 02:12:22,560
the evolutionary tree was uh six or
 

7287
02:12:22,560 --> 02:12:24,470
the evolutionary tree was uh six or
seven million years ago when

7288
02:12:24,470 --> 02:12:24,480
seven million years ago when
 

7289
02:12:24,480 --> 02:12:25,510
seven million years ago when
uh

7290
02:12:25,510 --> 02:12:25,520
uh
 

7291
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,750
uh
you have uh the line

7292
02:12:27,750 --> 02:12:27,760
you have uh the line
 

7293
02:12:27,760 --> 02:12:30,310
you have uh the line
uh between chimps and bonobos on the one

7294
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:30,320
uh between chimps and bonobos on the one
 

7295
02:12:30,320 --> 02:12:33,990
uh between chimps and bonobos on the one
hand and humans on the other splitting

7296
02:12:33,990 --> 02:12:34,000
hand and humans on the other splitting
 

7297
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:36,149
hand and humans on the other splitting
and basically what happened is that

7298
02:12:36,149 --> 02:12:36,159
and basically what happened is that
 

7299
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:38,470
and basically what happened is that
at that point a chimp-like ancestor

7300
02:12:38,470 --> 02:12:38,480
at that point a chimp-like ancestor
 

7301
02:12:38,480 --> 02:12:39,350
at that point a chimp-like ancestor
uh

7302
02:12:39,350 --> 02:12:39,360
uh
 

7303
02:12:39,360 --> 02:12:41,750
uh
leaves the forest

7304
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:41,760
leaves the forest
 

7305
02:12:41,760 --> 02:12:44,069
leaves the forest
gets isolated in an area outside the

7306
02:12:44,069 --> 02:12:44,079
gets isolated in an area outside the
 

7307
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:45,669
gets isolated in an area outside the
forest and adapts and that becomes the

7308
02:12:45,669 --> 02:12:45,679
forest and adapts and that becomes the
 

7309
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:47,270
forest and adapts and that becomes the
astrological scenes and meanwhile the

7310
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
astrological scenes and meanwhile the
 

7311
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,510
astrological scenes and meanwhile the
chimpanzees

7312
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:49,520
chimpanzees
 

7313
02:12:49,520 --> 02:12:51,430
chimpanzees
and bonobo ancestor continues in the

7314
02:12:51,430 --> 02:12:51,440
and bonobo ancestor continues in the
 

7315
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,430
and bonobo ancestor continues in the
forest

7316
02:12:53,430 --> 02:12:53,440
forest
 

7317
02:12:53,440 --> 02:12:54,629
forest
and

7318
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
and
 

7319
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:57,189
and
later what happens is that one branch of

7320
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
later what happens is that one branch of
 

7321
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:59,030
later what happens is that one branch of
that crosses the congo river and becomes

7322
02:12:59,030 --> 02:12:59,040
that crosses the congo river and becomes
 

7323
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:01,109
that crosses the congo river and becomes
the bonobos

7324
02:13:01,109 --> 02:13:01,119
the bonobos
 

7325
02:13:01,119 --> 02:13:02,550
the bonobos
that was only about two million years

7326
02:13:02,550 --> 02:13:02,560
that was only about two million years
 

7327
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:05,189
that was only about two million years
ago maybe one million years ago

7328
02:13:05,189 --> 02:13:05,199
ago maybe one million years ago
 

7329
02:13:05,199 --> 02:13:06,870
ago maybe one million years ago
now the chimps that remained in the

7330
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:06,880
now the chimps that remained in the
 

7331
02:13:06,880 --> 02:13:08,709
now the chimps that remained in the
forest throughout this time and occupied

7332
02:13:08,709 --> 02:13:08,719
forest throughout this time and occupied
 

7333
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:10,709
forest throughout this time and occupied
all the countries across uh from east

7334
02:13:10,709 --> 02:13:10,719
all the countries across uh from east
 

7335
02:13:10,719 --> 02:13:13,109
all the countries across uh from east
west to east africa now

7336
02:13:13,109 --> 02:13:13,119
west to east africa now
 

7337
02:13:13,119 --> 02:13:15,430
west to east africa now
um again we assume that they're pretty

7338
02:13:15,430 --> 02:13:15,440
um again we assume that they're pretty
 

7339
02:13:15,440 --> 02:13:18,470
um again we assume that they're pretty
similar to the ones that live nowadays

7340
02:13:18,470 --> 02:13:18,480
similar to the ones that live nowadays
 

7341
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:20,790
similar to the ones that live nowadays
whether some variation from from west to

7342
02:13:20,790 --> 02:13:20,800
whether some variation from from west to
 

7343
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:21,669
whether some variation from from west to
east

7344
02:13:21,669 --> 02:13:21,679
east
 

7345
02:13:21,679 --> 02:13:24,310
east
and these are animals that live in

7346
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,320
and these are animals that live in
 

7347
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:28,950
and these are animals that live in
social communities of between say 20 and

7348
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:28,960
social communities of between say 20 and
 

7349
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:31,430
social communities of between say 20 and
200. they have a lot of them in one

7350
02:13:31,430 --> 02:13:31,440
200. they have a lot of them in one
 

7351
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,830
200. they have a lot of them in one
group but they never come together in a

7352
02:13:33,830 --> 02:13:33,840
group but they never come together in a
 

7353
02:13:33,840 --> 02:13:35,350
group but they never come together in a
single unit

7354
02:13:35,350 --> 02:13:35,360
single unit
 

7355
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:38,709
single unit
these are they share an area a community

7356
02:13:38,709 --> 02:13:38,719
these are they share an area a community
 

7357
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:39,830
these are they share an area a community
territory

7358
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:39,840
territory
 

7359
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,069
territory
and that area is defended by males and

7360
02:13:42,069 --> 02:13:42,079
and that area is defended by males and
 

7361
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:44,069
and that area is defended by males and
within it females wander and bring up

7362
02:13:44,069 --> 02:13:44,079
within it females wander and bring up
 

7363
02:13:44,079 --> 02:13:46,069
within it females wander and bring up
their young independently

7364
02:13:46,069 --> 02:13:46,079
their young independently

and
 

7367
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:52,069
and
the females are very scared about

7368
02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079
the females are very scared about
 

7369
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:54,310
the females are very scared about
the possibility that males will be mean

7370
02:13:54,310 --> 02:13:54,320
the possibility that males will be mean
 

7371
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:56,950
the possibility that males will be mean
to their infants and in order to

7372
02:13:56,950 --> 02:13:56,960
to their infants and in order to
 

7373
02:13:56,960 --> 02:13:58,629
to their infants and in order to
avoid them doing that

7374
02:13:58,629 --> 02:13:58,639
avoid them doing that
 

7375
02:13:58,639 --> 02:14:01,910
avoid them doing that
they do their best to mate with every

7376
02:14:01,910 --> 02:14:01,920
they do their best to mate with every
 

7377
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:04,550
they do their best to mate with every
single male in the group multiple times

7378
02:14:04,550 --> 02:14:04,560
single male in the group multiple times
 

7379
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:07,430
single male in the group multiple times
as if to give a memory in that mail of

7380
02:14:07,430 --> 02:14:07,440
as if to give a memory in that mail of
 

7381
02:14:07,440 --> 02:14:09,189
as if to give a memory in that mail of
yeah yeah i remembered you so i'm not

7382

7385
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:13,430
going to be mean to your baby
so what's wonderful about gyms well you

7386
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:13,440
so what's wonderful about gyms well you
 

7387
02:14:13,440 --> 02:14:15,109
so what's wonderful about gyms well you
know as we've spoken about them yeah

7388
02:14:15,109 --> 02:14:15,119
know as we've spoken about them yeah
 

7389
02:14:15,119 --> 02:14:17,910
know as we've spoken about them yeah
they are creative and um uh and so

7390
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:17,920
they are creative and um uh and so
 

7391
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:19,990
they are creative and um uh and so
amazingly human-like

7392
02:14:19,990 --> 02:14:20,000
amazingly human-like
 

7393
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:21,750
amazingly human-like
but i love the the sort of you know the

7394
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:21,760
but i love the the sort of you know the
 

7395
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:24,790
but i love the the sort of you know the
quiet moments and and here's one

7396
02:14:24,790 --> 02:14:24,800
quiet moments and and here's one
 

7397
02:14:24,800 --> 02:14:27,109
quiet moments and and here's one
um i've got uh

7398
02:14:27,109 --> 02:14:27,119
um i've got uh
 

7399
02:14:27,119 --> 02:14:30,390
um i've got uh
uh two chimps who are uh grooming each

7400
02:14:30,390 --> 02:14:30,400
uh two chimps who are uh grooming each
 

7401
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:32,310
uh two chimps who are uh grooming each
other on a day when they are utterly

7402
02:14:32,310 --> 02:14:32,320
other on a day when they are utterly
 

7403
02:14:32,320 --> 02:14:33,589
other on a day when they are utterly
exhausted

7404
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:33,599
exhausted
 

7405
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,430
exhausted
they've walked um

7406
02:14:35,430 --> 02:14:35,440
they've walked um
 

7407
02:14:35,440 --> 02:14:38,830
they've walked um
11 kilometers the day before up and down

7408
02:14:38,830 --> 02:14:38,840
11 kilometers the day before up and down
 

7409
02:14:38,840 --> 02:14:40,629
11 kilometers the day before up and down
hills and

7410
02:14:40,629 --> 02:14:40,639
hills and
 

7411
02:14:40,639 --> 02:14:42,709
hills and
on this particular day all they do is

7412
02:14:42,709 --> 02:14:42,719
on this particular day all they do is
 

7413
02:14:42,719 --> 02:14:44,310
on this particular day all they do is
they get to one tree

7414
02:14:44,310 --> 02:14:44,320
they get to one tree
 

7415
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:45,990
they get to one tree
and they eat from that tree and other

7416
02:14:45,990 --> 02:14:46,000
and they eat from that tree and other
 

7417
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,390
and they eat from that tree and other
than that they only walk about 100 yards

7418
02:14:48,390 --> 02:14:48,400
than that they only walk about 100 yards
 

7419
02:14:48,400 --> 02:14:50,229
than that they only walk about 100 yards
and they go back to sleep in the nest in

7420
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239
and they go back to sleep in the nest in
 

7421
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:52,310
and they go back to sleep in the nest in
which they woke up

7422
02:14:52,310 --> 02:14:52,320
which they woke up
 

7423
02:14:52,320 --> 02:14:54,950
which they woke up
so they're utterly exhausted um

7424
02:14:54,950 --> 02:14:54,960
so they're utterly exhausted um
 

7425
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:56,629
so they're utterly exhausted um
and they're just eating non-stop because

7426
02:14:56,629 --> 02:14:56,639
and they're just eating non-stop because
 

7427
02:14:56,639 --> 02:14:58,229
and they're just eating non-stop because
they're trying to recover uh their

7428
02:14:58,229 --> 02:14:58,239
they're trying to recover uh their
 

7429
02:14:58,239 --> 02:14:59,750
they're trying to recover uh their
energy

7430
02:14:59,750 --> 02:14:59,760
energy
 

7431
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:03,189
energy
and this is uh hugh and charlie and we

7432
02:15:03,189 --> 02:15:03,199
and this is uh hugh and charlie and we
 

7433
02:15:03,199 --> 02:15:04,470
and this is uh hugh and charlie and we
think they were probably brothers so we

7434
02:15:04,470 --> 02:15:04,480
think they were probably brothers so we
 

7435
02:15:04,480 --> 02:15:06,709
think they were probably brothers so we
never actually got the genetic evidence

7436
02:15:06,709 --> 02:15:06,719
never actually got the genetic evidence
 

7437
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:08,470
never actually got the genetic evidence
to prove it

7438
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
to prove it
 

7439
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:10,069
to prove it
well um

so chimpanzees are the

7556
02:17:08,950 --> 02:17:08,960
so chimpanzees are the
 

7557
02:17:08,960 --> 02:17:11,349
so chimpanzees are the
species that kind of unites the rest of

7558
02:17:11,349 --> 02:17:11,359
species that kind of unites the rest of
 

7559
02:17:11,359 --> 02:17:13,830
species that kind of unites the rest of
the apes because a gorilla is in many

7560
02:17:13,830 --> 02:17:13,840
the apes because a gorilla is in many
 

7561
02:17:13,840 --> 02:17:15,750
the apes because a gorilla is in many
ways a just a big version of a

7562
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:15,760
ways a just a big version of a
 

7563
02:17:15,760 --> 02:17:18,389
ways a just a big version of a
chimpanzee if you can sort of engineer a

7564
02:17:18,389 --> 02:17:18,399
chimpanzee if you can sort of engineer a
 

7565
02:17:18,399 --> 02:17:20,389
chimpanzee if you can sort of engineer a
chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger it

7566
02:17:20,389 --> 02:17:20,399
chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger it
 

7567
02:17:20,399 --> 02:17:22,389
chimpanzee in your mind to be bigger it
basically turns into a gorilla

7568
02:17:22,389 --> 02:17:22,399
basically turns into a gorilla
 

7569
02:17:22,399 --> 02:17:24,150
basically turns into a gorilla
and then bonobos

7570
02:17:24,150 --> 02:17:24,160
and then bonobos
 

7571
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,830
and then bonobos
on the left bank of the congo river

7572
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:26,840
on the left bank of the congo river
 

7573
02:17:26,840 --> 02:17:28,469
on the left bank of the congo river
are a

7574
02:17:28,469 --> 02:17:28,479
are a
 

7575
02:17:28,479 --> 02:17:31,030
are a
like a domesticated form of

7576
02:17:31,030 --> 02:17:31,040
like a domesticated form of
 

7577
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:32,629
like a domesticated form of
of chimpanzee but obviously humans

7578
02:17:32,629 --> 02:17:32,639
of chimpanzee but obviously humans
 

7579
02:17:32,639 --> 02:17:33,750
of chimpanzee but obviously humans
didn't domesticate them so they're

7580
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:33,760
didn't domesticate them so they're
 

7581
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:35,990
didn't domesticate them so they're
self-domesticated they are less

7582
02:17:35,990 --> 02:17:36,000
self-domesticated they are less
 

7583
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,469
self-domesticated they are less
aggressive and they show all the marks

7584
02:17:38,469 --> 02:17:38,479
aggressive and they show all the marks
 

7585
02:17:38,479 --> 02:17:40,469
aggressive and they show all the marks
of domestication that domesticated

7586
02:17:40,469 --> 02:17:40,479
of domestication that domesticated
 

7587
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:43,030
of domestication that domesticated
animals do in compared to wild animals

7588
02:17:43,030 --> 02:17:43,040
animals do in compared to wild animals
 

7589
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:44,549
animals do in compared to wild animals
in their bones

7590
02:17:44,549 --> 02:17:44,559
in their bones
 

7591
02:17:44,559 --> 02:17:46,629
in their bones
so they have reduced differences between

7592
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:46,639
so they have reduced differences between
 

7593
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:48,150
so they have reduced differences between
males and females in which the males are

7594
02:17:48,150 --> 02:17:48,160
males and females in which the males are
 

7595
02:17:48,160 --> 02:17:49,669
males and females in which the males are
more like females they have smaller

7596
02:17:49,669 --> 02:17:49,679
more like females they have smaller
 

7597
02:17:49,679 --> 02:17:51,110
more like females they have smaller
brains they have

7598
02:17:51,110 --> 02:17:51,120
brains they have
 

7599
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:54,230
brains they have
shorter faces smaller teeth and smaller

7600
02:17:54,230 --> 02:17:54,240
shorter faces smaller teeth and smaller
 

7601
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:55,509
shorter faces smaller teeth and smaller
bodies

7602
02:17:55,509 --> 02:17:55,519
bodies
 

7603
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:56,950
bodies
all the things that domesticate animals

7604
02:17:56,950 --> 02:17:56,960
all the things that domesticate animals

environment in a strikingly peaceful way
compared to the chimpanzees there's no

7610
02:18:06,790 --> 02:18:06,800
compared to the chimpanzees there's no
 

7611
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:08,870
compared to the chimpanzees there's no
indication that they will have these

and enough data now to show that there's
 

7617
02:18:12,800 --> 02:18:14,070
and enough data now to show that there's
a statistical difference in the

a statistical difference in the

you have a deep love for nature
if we look at the world today

7684
02:19:29,669 --> 02:19:29,679
if we look at the world today
 

7685
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:32,309
if we look at the world today
how can we ensure that

how can we ensure that
 

7687
02:19:32,319 --> 02:19:35,669
how can we ensure that
the beautiful parts of nature

7688
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:35,679
the beautiful parts of nature
 

7689
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,830
the beautiful parts of nature
remain a big part of our lives

remain a big part of our lives
 

7691
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:39,509
remain a big part of our lives
as human beings

as human beings
 

7693
02:19:39,519 --> 02:19:41,190
as human beings
and in the way we think about it in the

7694
02:19:41,190 --> 02:19:41,200
and in the way we think about it in the
 

7695

02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:46,070
way
we also keep it around preserve it

7698
02:19:46,070 --> 02:19:46,080
we also keep it around preserve it
 

7699
02:19:46,080 --> 02:19:47,750
we also keep it around preserve it
you know we keep it part of our minds

7700
02:19:47,750 --> 02:19:47,760
you know we keep it part of our minds
 

7701
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:51,750
you know we keep it part of our minds
and part of our world

7702
02:19:51,750 --> 02:19:51,760

 

7703
02:19:51,760 --> 02:19:53,270

it's a

7704
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,280
it's a
 

7705
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:55,030
it's a
very difficult question

7706
02:19:55,030 --> 02:19:55,040
very difficult question
 

7707
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:56,550
very difficult question
because

7708
02:19:56,550 --> 02:19:56,560
because
 

7709
02:19:56,560 --> 02:19:58,950
because
every time there is a conflict between

7710
02:19:58,950 --> 02:19:58,960
every time there is a conflict between
 

7711
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:03,190
every time there is a conflict between
conservation of a natural habitat and

7712
02:20:03,190 --> 02:20:03,200
conservation of a natural habitat and
 

7713
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,950
conservation of a natural habitat and
allowing people to

7714
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:04,960
allowing people to
 

7715
02:20:04,960 --> 02:20:07,270
allowing people to
get a little bit of extra food for their

7716
02:20:07,270 --> 02:20:07,280
get a little bit of extra food for their
 

7717
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:08,309
get a little bit of extra food for their
babies

7718
02:20:08,309 --> 02:20:08,319
babies
 

7719
02:20:08,319 --> 02:20:09,270
babies
then

7720
02:20:09,270 --> 02:20:09,280
then
 

7721
02:20:09,280 --> 02:20:10,469
then
naturally

7722
02:20:10,469 --> 02:20:10,479
naturally
 

7723
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:13,910
naturally
the tendency is for the humans to win

7724
02:20:13,910 --> 02:20:13,920
the tendency is for the humans to win
 

7725
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:16,469
the tendency is for the humans to win
so we have this steady

7726
02:20:16,469 --> 02:20:16,479
so we have this steady
 

7727
02:20:16,479 --> 02:20:17,590
so we have this steady
erosion

7728
02:20:17,590 --> 02:20:17,600
erosion
 

7729
02:20:17,600 --> 02:20:19,270
erosion
in the face of

7730
02:20:19,270 --> 02:20:19,280
in the face of
 

7731
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:22,070
in the face of
tremendous efforts to conserve nature

7732
02:20:22,070 --> 02:20:22,080
tremendous efforts to conserve nature
 

7733
02:20:22,080 --> 02:20:25,190
tremendous efforts to conserve nature
we have a continuing steady erosion of

7734
02:20:25,190 --> 02:20:25,200
we have a continuing steady erosion of
 

7735
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:28,150
we have a continuing steady erosion of
habitats and all the species and the

7736
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,160
habitats and all the species and the
 

7737
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:29,990
habitats and all the species and the
numbers are always in the wrong

7738
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:30,000
numbers are always in the wrong
 

7739
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,670
numbers are always in the wrong
direction

7740
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:31,680
direction
 

7741
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,429
direction
occasionally you get sort of wonderful

7742
02:20:33,429 --> 02:20:33,439
occasionally you get sort of wonderful
 

7743
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:36,389
occasionally you get sort of wonderful
little examples of something being saved

7744
02:20:36,389 --> 02:20:36,399
little examples of something being saved
 

7745
02:20:36,399 --> 02:20:37,190
little examples of something being saved
but

7746
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:37,200
but
 

7747
02:20:37,200 --> 02:20:40,150
but
the overall trend is clear

7748
02:20:40,150 --> 02:20:40,160
the overall trend is clear
 

7749
02:20:40,160 --> 02:20:41,429
the overall trend is clear
and it's very difficult to see how one

7750
02:20:41,429 --> 02:20:41,439
and it's very difficult to see how one
 

7751
02:20:41,439 --> 02:20:44,550
and it's very difficult to see how one
can ever escape that because it's not

7752
02:20:44,550 --> 02:20:44,560
can ever escape that because it's not
 

7753
02:20:44,560 --> 02:20:45,910
can ever escape that because it's not
human

7754
02:20:45,910 --> 02:20:45,920
human
 

7755
02:20:45,920 --> 02:20:48,790
human
i know that we are essentially a single

7756
02:20:48,790 --> 02:20:48,800
i know that we are essentially a single
 

7757
02:20:48,800 --> 02:20:50,230
i know that we are essentially a single
tribe

7758
02:20:50,230 --> 02:20:50,240
tribe
 

7759
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:51,590
tribe
to

7760
02:20:51,590 --> 02:20:51,600
to
 

7761
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:54,870
to
want to save an elephant if it means

7762
02:20:54,870 --> 02:20:54,880
want to save an elephant if it means
 

7763
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:57,429
want to save an elephant if it means
killing 20 humans

7764
02:20:57,429 --> 02:20:57,439
killing 20 humans
 

7765
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:00,550
killing 20 humans
so i think the only way in which we can

7766
02:21:00,550 --> 02:21:00,560
so i think the only way in which we can
 

7767
02:21:00,560 --> 02:21:02,230
so i think the only way in which we can
really conserve

7768
02:21:02,230 --> 02:21:02,240
really conserve
 

7769
02:21:02,240 --> 02:21:03,750
really conserve
is if we

7770
02:21:03,750 --> 02:21:03,760
is if we
 

7771
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:04,950
is if we

often this will be the national parks

often this will be the national parks
 

7785
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:18,710
often this will be the national parks
that already exist

that already exist
 

7787
02:21:18,720 --> 02:21:21,349

and what we have to do is to make them
 

7789
02:21:21,359 --> 02:21:24,309

is for people in the rich countries
 

7867
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:53,590
is for people in the rich countries
to do much more investment than

7909
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:45,990

it's going to take a lot to avoid that

7910
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:46,000
it's going to take a lot to avoid that
 

7911
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:47,590

calling for
 

7915
02:23:50,479 --> 02:23:52,230
calling for
half the earth

7916
02:23:52,230 --> 02:23:52,240
half the earth
 

7917
02:23:52,240 --> 02:23:54,230
half the earth
to be devoted to nature

7918
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
to be devoted to nature
 

7919
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:55,990
to be devoted to nature
it's incredibly ambitious and incredibly

7920
02:23:55,990 --> 02:23:56,000
it's incredibly ambitious and incredibly
 

7921
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:57,429
it's incredibly ambitious and incredibly
optimistic

7922
02:23:57,429 --> 02:23:57,439
optimistic
 

7923
02:23:57,439 --> 02:23:58,790
optimistic
but unless you have

7924
02:23:58,790 --> 02:23:58,800
but unless you have
 

7925
02:23:58,800 --> 02:24:01,110
but unless you have
really exciting goals

7926
02:24:01,110 --> 02:24:01,120
really exciting goals
 

7927
02:24:01,120 --> 02:24:03,910
really exciting goals
probably nothing will be achieved

7928
02:24:03,910 --> 02:24:03,920
probably nothing will be achieved
 

7929
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:06,710
probably nothing will be achieved
yeah i mean there's something

7930
02:24:06,710 --> 02:24:06,720
yeah i mean there's something
 

7931
02:24:06,720 --> 02:24:08,469
yeah i mean there's something
to me like when i visit new york and i

7932
02:24:08,469 --> 02:24:08,479
to me like when i visit new york and i
 

7933
02:24:08,479 --> 02:24:10,950
to me like when i visit new york and i
see central park and somehow constructed

7934
02:24:10,950 --> 02:24:10,960
see central park and somehow constructed
 

7935
02:24:10,960 --> 02:24:13,349
see central park and somehow constructed
a situation where you preserve this park

7936
02:24:13,349 --> 02:24:13,359
a situation where you preserve this park
 

7937
02:24:13,359 --> 02:24:14,389
a situation where you preserve this park
in the middle

7938
02:24:14,389 --> 02:24:14,399
in the middle
 

7939
02:24:14,399 --> 02:24:16,309
in the middle

02:24:16,319 --> 02:24:17,750
probably some of the most expensive land
in the world

7942
02:24:17,750 --> 02:24:17,760
in the world
 

7943
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:19,429
in the world
the fact that that's possible gives me

7944
02:24:19,429 --> 02:24:19,439
the fact that that's possible gives me
 

7945
02:24:19,439 --> 02:24:20,950
the fact that that's possible gives me
hope that you can do this kind of

7946
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:20,960
hope that you can do this kind of
 

7947
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:23,910
hope that you can do this kind of
preservation at a global scale

7948
02:24:23,910 --> 02:24:23,920
preservation at a global scale
 

7949
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:25,910
preservation at a global scale
perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons

7950
02:24:25,910 --> 02:24:25,920
perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons
 

7951
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:28,150
perhaps for just the aesthetic reasons
of just valuing

02:24:28,150 --> 02:24:28,160
of just valuing
 

7953
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,389
of just valuing
the beauty and um

7954
02:24:30,389 --> 02:24:30,399
the beauty and um
 

7955
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:33,349
the beauty and um
just respecting our origins

7956
02:24:33,349 --> 02:24:33,359
just respecting our origins
 

7957
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:35,349
just respecting our origins
of having come from the earth

7958
02:24:35,349 --> 02:24:35,359
of having come from the earth
 

7959
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:38,710
of having come from the earth
we are so incredibly lucky to have

02:24:38,710 --> 02:24:38,720
we are so incredibly lucky to have
 

7961
02:24:38,720 --> 02:24:42,070
we are so incredibly lucky to have

don't have astrology and other species
 

7969

of homo but we're still lucky to have
those because they are incredibly

7972
02:24:51,190 --> 02:24:51,200
those because they are incredibly
 

7973
02:24:51,200 --> 02:24:53,349
those because they are incredibly
closely related to us compared to what

7974
02:24:53,349 --> 02:24:53,359
closely related to us compared to what
 

7975
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:54,790
closely related to us compared to what
most animals have you know there are

7976
02:24:54,790 --> 02:24:54,800
most animals have you know there are
 

7977
02:24:54,800 --> 02:24:56,230
most animals have you know there are
many animals that don't have any close

7978
02:24:56,230 --> 02:24:56,240
many animals that don't have any close
 

7979
02:24:56,240 --> 02:24:59,349
many animals that don't have any close
relatives to them on the earth but not

7980
02:24:59,349 --> 02:24:59,359
relatives to them on the earth but not
 

7981
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:01,190
relatives to them on the earth but not
only are they they're relatively close

7982
02:25:01,190 --> 02:25:01,200
only are they they're relatively close
 

7983
02:25:01,200 --> 02:25:02,950
only are they they're relatively close
but they teach us so much about

7984
02:25:02,950 --> 02:25:02,960
but they teach us so much about
 

7985
02:25:02,960 --> 02:25:05,830
but they teach us so much about
ourselves you know they the similarities

7986
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:05,840
ourselves you know they the similarities
 

7987
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:07,429
ourselves you know they the similarities
between them and ourselves raise

7988
02:25:07,429 --> 02:25:07,439
between them and ourselves raise
 

7989
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:09,670
between them and ourselves raise
questions that we can then test

7990
02:25:09,670 --> 02:25:09,680
questions that we can then test
 

7991
02:25:09,680 --> 02:25:10,389
questions that we can then test
about

7992
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
about
 

7993
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:12,870
about
the extent to which our own behavioral

7994
02:25:12,870 --> 02:25:12,880
the extent to which our own behavioral
 

7995
02:25:12,880 --> 02:25:15,670
the extent to which our own behavioral
propensities are derived from the same

7996
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:15,680
propensities are derived from the same
 

7997
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,910
propensities are derived from the same
evolutionary stock as in those great

7998
02:25:17,910 --> 02:25:17,920
evolutionary stock as in those great
 

7999
02:25:17,920 --> 02:25:19,110
evolutionary stock as in those great
apes

8000
02:25:19,110 --> 02:25:19,120
apes
 

8001
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:21,429
apes
well how much is that worth you know i

8002
02:25:21,429 --> 02:25:21,439
well how much is that worth you know i
 

8003
02:25:21,439 --> 02:25:23,429
well how much is that worth you know i
mean we could spend billions going to

8004
02:25:23,429 --> 02:25:23,439
mean we could spend billions going to
 

8005
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:25,750
mean we could spend billions going to
the mars to

8006
02:25:25,750 --> 02:25:25,760
the mars to
 

8007
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,030
the mars to
find

8008
02:25:27,030 --> 02:25:27,040
find
 

8009
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:29,030
find
evidence of bacteria there and that's

8010
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,040
evidence of bacteria there and that's
 

8011
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:30,550
evidence of bacteria there and that's
fascinating too

8012
02:25:30,550 --> 02:25:30,560
fascinating too
 

8013
02:25:30,560 --> 02:25:32,710
fascinating too
but we should be spending billions on

8014
02:25:32,710 --> 02:25:32,720
but we should be spending billions on
 

8015
02:25:32,720 --> 02:25:34,550
but we should be spending billions on
this earth in order to

8016
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:34,560
this earth in order to
 

8017
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:35,830
this earth in order to
make sure

8018
02:25:35,830 --> 02:25:35,840
make sure
 

8019
02:25:35,840 --> 02:25:38,630
make sure
that we have

8020
02:25:38,630 --> 02:25:38,640
that we have
 

8021
02:25:38,640 --> 02:25:40,150
that we have
i don't know how to say it you know

8022
02:25:40,150 --> 02:25:40,160
i don't know how to say it you know
 

8023
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:43,429
i don't know how to say it you know
substantial representative populations

8024
02:25:43,429 --> 02:25:43,439
substantial representative populations
 

8025
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:45,429
substantial representative populations
are these close relatives

8026
02:25:45,429 --> 02:25:45,439
are these close relatives
 

8027
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:47,590
are these close relatives
yeah that we can meet there's something

8028
02:25:47,590 --> 02:25:47,600
yeah that we can meet there's something
 

8029
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:50,469
yeah that we can meet there's something
um like space tourism when you go out

8030
02:25:50,469 --> 02:25:50,479
um like space tourism when you go out
 

8031
02:25:50,479 --> 02:25:52,150
um like space tourism when you go out
into space and you look back down on

8032
02:25:52,150 --> 02:25:52,160
into space and you look back down on
 

8033
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:53,270
into space and you look back down on
earth

8034
02:25:53,270 --> 02:25:53,280
earth
 

8035
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:55,670
earth
that's to a lot of people including

8036
02:25:55,670 --> 02:25:55,680
that's to a lot of people including
 

8037
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:58,070
that's to a lot of people including
myself is worth a lot

8038
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,080
myself is worth a lot
 

8039
02:25:58,080 --> 02:25:59,990
myself is worth a lot
but why is that worth a lot is because

8040
02:25:59,990 --> 02:26:00,000
but why is that worth a lot is because
 

8041
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:01,670
but why is that worth a lot is because
you uh

8042

it's humbling
 

8045
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,550
it's humbling
and

8046
02:26:04,550 --> 02:26:04,560
and
 

8047
02:26:04,560 --> 02:26:06,230
and
beautiful

8048
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:06,240
beautiful
 

8049
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:08,950
beautiful
in the same way that meeting our close

8050
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:08,960
in the same way that meeting our close
 

8051
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:11,830
in the same way that meeting our close
evolutionary relatives is humble and and

8052
02:26:11,830 --> 02:26:11,840
evolutionary relatives is humble and and
 

8053
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:13,510
evolutionary relatives is humble and and
beautiful

8054
02:26:13,510 --> 02:26:13,520
beautiful
 

8055
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:16,150
beautiful
just to know that this

8056
02:26:16,150 --> 02:26:16,160
just to know that this
 

8057
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:18,469
just to know that this
this is what we come from this is who we

8058
02:26:18,469 --> 02:26:18,479
this is what we come from this is who we
 

8059
02:26:18,479 --> 02:26:19,190
this is what we come from this is who we
are

8060
02:26:19,190 --> 02:26:19,200
are
 

8061
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:20,870
are
not just for the understanding or the

8062
02:26:20,870 --> 02:26:20,880
not just for the understanding or the
 

8063
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:22,469
not just for the understanding or the
science of it but just like something

8064
02:26:22,469 --> 02:26:22,479
science of it but just like something
 

8065
02:26:22,479 --> 02:26:25,510
science of it but just like something
about just the beauty of witnessing this

8066
02:26:25,510 --> 02:26:25,520
about just the beauty of witnessing this
 

8067
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,270
about just the beauty of witnessing this
um and it's again it's both humbling and

8068
02:26:29,270 --> 02:26:29,280
um and it's again it's both humbling and
 

8069
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:30,790
um and it's again it's both humbling and
empowering

8070
02:26:30,790 --> 02:26:30,800
empowering
 

8071
02:26:30,800 --> 02:26:33,110
empowering
that this place is fragile and we're

8072
02:26:33,110 --> 02:26:33,120
that this place is fragile and we're
 

8073
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,070
that this place is fragile and we're
damn lucky to be here

8074
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:36,080
damn lucky to be here
 

8075
02:26:36,080 --> 02:26:38,150
damn lucky to be here
yes unfortunately the problems are

8076
02:26:38,150 --> 02:26:38,160
yes unfortunately the problems are
 

8077
02:26:38,160 --> 02:26:39,590
yes unfortunately the problems are
incredibly difficult

8078
02:26:39,590 --> 02:26:39,600
incredibly difficult
 

8079
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:42,070
incredibly difficult
to solve and there is no one solver you

8080
02:26:42,070 --> 02:26:42,080
to solve and there is no one solver you
 

8081
02:26:42,080 --> 02:26:45,429
to solve and there is no one solver you
know it has to happen from a network of

8082
02:26:45,429 --> 02:26:45,439
know it has to happen from a network of
 

8083
02:26:45,439 --> 02:26:47,670
know it has to happen from a network of
potentially cooperating people

8084
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:47,680
potentially cooperating people
 

8085
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:49,110
potentially cooperating people
but but i mean you're so right about it

8086
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,120
but but i mean you're so right about it
 

8087
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:51,349
but but i mean you're so right about it
being daunting to to think about what it

8088
02:26:51,349 --> 02:26:51,359
being daunting to to think about what it
 

8089
02:26:51,359 --> 02:26:52,950
being daunting to to think about what it
looks like from space and i love the

8090
02:26:52,950 --> 02:26:52,960
looks like from space and i love the
 

8091
02:26:52,960 --> 02:26:56,150
looks like from space and i love the
view that herman muller expressed

8092
02:26:56,150 --> 02:26:56,160
view that herman muller expressed
 

8093
02:26:56,160 --> 02:26:57,270
view that herman muller expressed
of uh

8094
02:26:57,270 --> 02:26:57,280
of uh
 

8095
02:26:57,280 --> 02:26:59,110
of uh
being able to go out from space and he

8096
02:26:59,110 --> 02:26:59,120
being able to go out from space and he
 

8097
02:26:59,120 --> 02:27:01,190
being able to go out from space and he
said the whole of life

8098
02:27:01,190 --> 02:27:01,200
said the whole of life
 

8099
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,670
said the whole of life
uh would look like a kind of rust on the

8100
02:27:03,670 --> 02:27:03,680
uh would look like a kind of rust on the
 

8101
02:27:03,680 --> 02:27:06,389
uh would look like a kind of rust on the
planet

8102
02:27:06,389 --> 02:27:06,399

 

8103
02:27:06,399 --> 02:27:08,630

yeah so the aliens were to visit i'm not

yeah so the aliens were to visit i'm not
 

8105
02:27:08,640 --> 02:27:10,230
yeah so the aliens were to visit i'm not
sure they would notice the life they

8106
02:27:10,230 --> 02:27:10,240
sure they would notice the life they
 

8107
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:12,150
sure they would notice the life they
would probably notice the

8108
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:12,160
would probably notice the
 

8109
02:27:12,160 --> 02:27:13,910
would probably notice the
trees or

8110
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:13,920
trees or
 

8111
02:27:13,920 --> 02:27:15,429
trees or
ocean

it's it's a kind of rust but let me ask

8114
02:27:18,070 --> 02:27:18,080
it's it's a kind of rust but let me ask
 

8115
02:27:18,080 --> 02:27:20,309
it's it's a kind of rust but let me ask
the big ridiculous philosophical

8116
02:27:20,309 --> 02:27:20,319
the big ridiculous philosophical
 

8117
02:27:20,319 --> 02:27:21,270
the big ridiculous philosophical
question

8118
02:27:21,270 --> 02:27:21,280
question
 

8119
02:27:21,280 --> 02:27:23,510
question
of what is the meaning of this rust

8120
02:27:23,510 --> 02:27:23,520
of what is the meaning of this rust
 

8121
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,870
of what is the meaning of this rust
what do you think is the meaning of life

8122
02:27:24,870 --> 02:27:24,880
what do you think is the meaning of life
 

8123
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,070
what do you think is the meaning of life
on earth

8124
02:27:26,070 --> 02:27:26,080
on earth
 

8125
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:27,750
on earth
what is the meaning of our human

8126
02:27:27,750 --> 02:27:27,760
what is the meaning of our human
 

8127
02:27:27,760 --> 02:27:30,950
what is the meaning of our human
intelligent life

8128
02:27:30,950 --> 02:27:30,960
intelligent life
 

8129
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:33,349
intelligent life
well i think it's very clear that um

8130
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:33,359
well i think it's very clear that um
 

8131
02:27:33,359 --> 02:27:36,550
well i think it's very clear that um
we have an evolutionary story uh that

8132
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:36,560
we have an evolutionary story uh that
 

8133
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:37,510
we have an evolutionary story uh that
uh

8134
02:27:37,510 --> 02:27:37,520
uh
 

8135
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:38,870
uh
is only getting

8136
02:27:38,870 --> 02:27:38,880
is only getting
 

8137
02:27:38,880 --> 02:27:41,270
is only getting
challenged around the edges you know we

8138
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:41,280
challenged around the edges you know we
 

8139
02:27:41,280 --> 02:27:43,110
challenged around the edges you know we
we have a very clear understanding of

8140
02:27:43,110 --> 02:27:43,120
we have a very clear understanding of
 

8141
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:44,710
we have a very clear understanding of
the evolution of life

8142
02:27:44,710 --> 02:27:44,720
the evolution of life
 

8143
02:27:44,720 --> 02:27:45,910
the evolution of life
and

8144
02:27:45,910 --> 02:27:45,920
and
 

8145
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:48,710
and
the meaning is you know we are here

8146
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:48,720
the meaning is you know we are here
 

8147
02:27:48,720 --> 02:27:51,670
the meaning is you know we are here
as a consequence of

8148
02:27:51,670 --> 02:27:51,680
as a consequence of
 

8149
02:27:51,680 --> 02:27:54,230
as a consequence of
materialistic processes

8150
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:54,240
materialistic processes
 

8151
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:56,550

uh
 

8179
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:27,349
uh
the word random is the wrong word to use

8180
02:28:27,349 --> 02:28:27,359
the word random is the wrong word to use
 

8181
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:29,590
the word random is the wrong word to use
unless you understand what it means

8182
02:28:29,590 --> 02:28:29,600
unless you understand what it means
 

8183
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,429
unless you understand what it means
you know

8184
02:28:31,429 --> 02:28:31,439
you know
 

8185
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:32,710
you know
it didn't happen

8186
02:28:32,710 --> 02:28:32,720
it didn't happen
 

8187
02:28:32,720 --> 02:28:35,030
it didn't happen
by chance but a lot of random events had

8188
02:28:35,030 --> 02:28:35,040
by chance but a lot of random events had
 

8189
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,429
by chance but a lot of random events had
to happen to make this possible

8190
02:28:37,429 --> 02:28:37,439
to happen to make this possible
 

8191
02:28:37,439 --> 02:28:39,270
to happen to make this possible
and those random events of course

8192
02:28:39,270 --> 02:28:39,280
and those random events of course
 

8193
02:28:39,280 --> 02:28:41,349
and those random events of course
are the production of uh appropriate

8194
02:28:41,349 --> 02:28:41,359
are the production of uh appropriate
 

8195
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:43,110
are the production of uh appropriate
mutations

8196
02:28:43,110 --> 02:28:43,120
mutations
 

8197
02:28:43,120 --> 02:28:45,990
mutations
but the um you know the meaning of life

8198
02:28:45,990 --> 02:28:46,000
but the um you know the meaning of life
 

8199
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:47,750
but the um you know the meaning of life
is

8200
02:28:47,750 --> 02:28:47,760
is
 

8201
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:49,270
is
there is no meaning

8202
02:28:49,270 --> 02:28:49,280
there is no meaning
 

8203
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:51,990
there is no meaning
it's the you know the really big mystery

8204
02:28:51,990 --> 02:28:52,000
it's the you know the really big mystery
 

8205
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,030
it's the you know the really big mystery
of life is why is there a universe

8206
02:28:55,030 --> 02:28:55,040
of life is why is there a universe
 

8207
02:28:55,040 --> 02:28:57,590
of life is why is there a universe
and that same y propagates itself

8208
02:28:57,590 --> 02:28:57,600
and that same y propagates itself
 

8209
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,190
and that same y propagates itself
through the whole of it

8210

and uh some of the clever fish

8226
02:29:19,510 --> 02:29:19,520
and uh some of the clever fish
 

8227
02:29:19,520 --> 02:29:22,550
and uh some of the clever fish
crawling out onto the land and and the

8228
02:29:22,550 --> 02:29:22,560
crawling out onto the land and and the
 

8229
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:24,469
crawling out onto the land and and the
whole of it and then there's fire some

8230
02:29:24,469 --> 02:29:24,479
whole of it and then there's fire some
 

8231
02:29:24,479 --> 02:29:25,750
whole of it and then there's fire some
some clever

8232
02:29:25,750 --> 02:29:25,760
some clever
 

8233
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:28,309
some clever
uh clever guy or lady invented fire and

8234
02:29:28,309 --> 02:29:28,319
uh clever guy or lady invented fire and
 

8235
02:29:28,319 --> 02:29:30,389
uh clever guy or lady invented fire and
then now here we are

8236
02:29:30,389 --> 02:29:30,399
then now here we are
 

8237
02:29:30,399 --> 02:29:33,030
then now here we are
uh it just does seem

8238
02:29:33,030 --> 02:29:33,040
uh it just does seem
 

8239
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:35,190
uh it just does seem
speaking as a human kind of special they

8240
02:29:35,190 --> 02:29:35,200
speaking as a human kind of special they
 

8241
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,349
speaking as a human kind of special they
were able to reflect on the whole thing

8242
02:29:37,349 --> 02:29:37,359
were able to reflect on the whole thing
 

8243
02:29:37,359 --> 02:29:39,030
were able to reflect on the whole thing
where the whole wonderful story is so

8244
02:29:39,030 --> 02:29:39,040
where the whole wonderful story is so
 

8245
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:40,710
where the whole wonderful story is so
much more interesting than the stories

8246
02:29:40,710 --> 02:29:40,720
much more interesting than the stories
 

8247
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:42,790
much more interesting than the stories
produced by religion

8248
02:29:42,790 --> 02:29:42,800
produced by religion
 

8249
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,710
produced by religion
yeah it is it is beautiful but it just

8250
02:29:44,710 --> 02:29:44,720
yeah it is it is beautiful but it just
 

8251
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,349
yeah it is it is beautiful but it just
seems special that us humans are able to

8252
02:29:47,349 --> 02:29:47,359
seems special that us humans are able to
 

8253
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:49,590
seems special that us humans are able to
write religions and

8254
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:49,600
write religions and
 

8255
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:52,469
write religions and
construct stories yeah and and also do

8256
02:29:52,469 --> 02:29:52,479
construct stories yeah and and also do
 

8257
02:29:52,479 --> 02:29:53,990
construct stories yeah and and also do
science

8258
02:29:53,990 --> 02:29:54,000
science
 

8259
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,630
science
that seems uh

8260
02:29:56,630 --> 02:29:56,640
that seems uh
 

8261
02:29:56,640 --> 02:29:59,750
that seems uh
that seems kind of amazing it seems like

8262
02:29:59,750 --> 02:29:59,760
that seems kind of amazing it seems like
 

8263
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:02,469
that seems kind of amazing it seems like
the universe

8264
02:30:02,469 --> 02:30:02,479
the universe
 

8265
02:30:02,479 --> 02:30:03,750
the universe
is such

8266
02:30:03,750 --> 02:30:03,760
is such
 

8267
02:30:03,760 --> 02:30:06,870
is such
that it it um it creates

8268
02:30:06,870 --> 02:30:06,880
that it it um it creates
 

8269
02:30:06,880 --> 02:30:08,950
that it it um it creates
beings like us that are able to

8270
02:30:08,950 --> 02:30:08,960
beings like us that are able to
 

8271
02:30:08,960 --> 02:30:10,389
beings like us that are able to
investigate

8272
02:30:10,389 --> 02:30:10,399
investigate
 

8273
02:30:10,399 --> 02:30:12,550
investigate
it

8274
02:30:12,550 --> 02:30:12,560
it
 

8275
02:30:12,560 --> 02:30:14,389
it
and that and that that's why there's

8276
02:30:14,389 --> 02:30:14,399
and that and that that's why there's
 

8277
02:30:14,399 --> 02:30:16,550
and that and that that's why there's
this longing for why

8278
02:30:16,550 --> 02:30:16,560
this longing for why
 

8279
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:18,790
this longing for why
it's just uh

8280
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:18,800
it's just uh
 

8281
02:30:18,800 --> 02:30:20,870
it's just uh
such a beautiful little pocket of

8282
02:30:20,870 --> 02:30:20,880
such a beautiful little pocket of
 

8283
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:23,349
such a beautiful little pocket of
complexity created by the universe it

8284
02:30:23,349 --> 02:30:23,359
complexity created by the universe it
 

8285
02:30:23,359 --> 02:30:25,590
complexity created by the universe it
seems like um

8286
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
seems like um
 

8287
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:27,429
seems like um
it seems like there should be a y but

8288
02:30:27,429 --> 02:30:27,439
it seems like there should be a y but
 

8289
02:30:27,439 --> 02:30:28,950
it seems like there should be a y but
maybe there's just an infinite number of

8290
02:30:28,950 --> 02:30:28,960
maybe there's just an infinite number of
 

8291
02:30:28,960 --> 02:30:31,110
maybe there's just an infinite number of
universes and this is the one

8292
02:30:31,110 --> 02:30:31,120
universes and this is the one
 

8293
02:30:31,120 --> 02:30:32,550
universes and this is the one
that uh

8294
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:32,560
that uh
 

8295
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:34,630
that uh
led to this particular set of humans

8296
02:30:34,630 --> 02:30:34,640
led to this particular set of humans
 

8297
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:35,830
led to this particular set of humans
even without an infinite number of

8298
02:30:35,830 --> 02:30:35,840
even without an infinite number of
 

8299
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:37,110
even without an infinite number of
universes i bet there's an infinite

8300
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,120
universes i bet there's an infinite
 

8301
02:30:37,120 --> 02:30:39,270
universes i bet there's an infinite
number of intelligent beings throughout

8302
02:30:39,270 --> 02:30:39,280
number of intelligent beings throughout
 

8303
02:30:39,280 --> 02:30:41,510
number of intelligent beings throughout
this universe yeah now that we know how

8304
02:30:41,510 --> 02:30:41,520
this universe yeah now that we know how
 

8305
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:43,110
this universe yeah now that we know how
many planets are

8306
02:30:43,110 --> 02:30:43,120
many planets are
 

8307
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,030
many planets are
have the right sort of conditions

8308
02:30:45,030 --> 02:30:45,040
have the right sort of conditions
 

8309
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:47,110
have the right sort of conditions
you know which is what i can't remember

8310
02:30:47,110 --> 02:30:47,120
you know which is what i can't remember
 

8311
02:30:47,120 --> 02:30:49,030
you know which is what i can't remember
a lot you know it's some significant

8312
02:30:49,030 --> 02:30:49,040
a lot you know it's some significant
 

8313
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:50,950
a lot you know it's some significant
percentage of all planets

8314
02:30:50,950 --> 02:30:50,960
percentage of all planets
 

8315
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:52,630
percentage of all planets
um then

8316
02:30:52,630 --> 02:30:52,640
um then
 

8317
02:30:52,640 --> 02:30:54,469
um then
then there are apparently billions of

8318
02:30:54,469 --> 02:30:54,479
then there are apparently billions of
 

8319
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:55,429
then there are apparently billions of
planets

8320
02:30:55,429 --> 02:30:55,439
planets
 

8321
02:30:55,439 --> 02:30:57,030
planets
and

8322
02:30:57,030 --> 02:30:57,040
and
 

8323
02:30:57,040 --> 02:30:59,349
and
there's every i mean things happen so

8324
02:30:59,349 --> 02:30:59,359
there's every i mean things happen so
 

8325
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:00,630
there's every i mean things happen so
quickly on earth you know once you've

8326
02:31:00,630 --> 02:31:00,640
quickly on earth you know once you've
 

8327
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:05,670
quickly on earth you know once you've
got water then uh you've got life and um

8328
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:05,680
got water then uh you've got life and um
 

8329
02:31:05,680 --> 02:31:07,750
got water then uh you've got life and um
it did not take long for for life to

8330
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:07,760
it did not take long for for life to
 

8331
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:09,910
it did not take long for for life to
evolve in in the big scheme of things

8332
02:31:09,910 --> 02:31:09,920
evolve in in the big scheme of things
 

8333
02:31:09,920 --> 02:31:12,150
evolve in in the big scheme of things
and if you think you look out there

8334
02:31:12,150 --> 02:31:12,160
and if you think you look out there
 

8335
02:31:12,160 --> 02:31:14,630
and if you think you look out there
say there's a nearly infinite number of

8336
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640
say there's a nearly infinite number of
 

8337
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,550
say there's a nearly infinite number of
intelligent civilizations

8338
02:31:16,550 --> 02:31:16,560
intelligent civilizations
 

8339
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:19,510
intelligent civilizations
one dimension you could look at is the

8340
02:31:19,510 --> 02:31:19,520
one dimension you could look at is the
 

8341
02:31:19,520 --> 02:31:21,910
one dimension you could look at is the
proclivity to violence they have it's

8342
02:31:21,910 --> 02:31:21,920
proclivity to violence they have it's
 

8343
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:23,910
proclivity to violence they have it's
interesting to think

8344
02:31:23,910 --> 02:31:23,920
interesting to think
 

8345
02:31:23,920 --> 02:31:27,190
interesting to think
what level of violence is useful

8346
02:31:27,190 --> 02:31:27,200
what level of violence is useful
 

8347
02:31:27,200 --> 02:31:28,550
what level of violence is useful
for

8348
02:31:28,550 --> 02:31:28,560
for
 

8349
02:31:28,560 --> 02:31:31,110
for
extending the life of a civilization so

8350
02:31:31,110 --> 02:31:31,120
extending the life of a civilization so
 

8351
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:32,790
extending the life of a civilization so
we have a particular set of violence in

8352
02:31:32,790 --> 02:31:32,800
we have a particular set of violence in
 

8353
02:31:32,800 --> 02:31:33,910
we have a particular set of violence in
our history

8354
02:31:33,910 --> 02:31:33,920
our history
 

8355
02:31:33,920 --> 02:31:36,230
our history
maybe being too peaceful is a problem in

8356
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,240
maybe being too peaceful is a problem in
 

8357
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:37,830
maybe being too peaceful is a problem in
the early days

8358
02:31:37,830 --> 02:31:37,840
the early days
 

8359
02:31:37,840 --> 02:31:39,750
the early days
uh maybe being too violent quite

8360
02:31:39,750 --> 02:31:39,760
uh maybe being too violent quite
 

8361
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:42,630
uh maybe being too violent quite
obviously is as a problem so you look at

8362
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:42,640
obviously is as a problem so you look at
 

8363
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:45,429
obviously is as a problem so you look at
viruses what kind of viruses on earth

8364
02:31:45,429 --> 02:31:45,439
viruses what kind of viruses on earth
 

8365
02:31:45,439 --> 02:31:47,670
viruses what kind of viruses on earth
propagate and succeed if you're too

8366
02:31:47,670 --> 02:31:47,680
propagate and succeed if you're too
 

8367
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:49,590
propagate and succeed if you're too
deadly that's a big problem

8368
02:31:49,590 --> 02:31:49,600
deadly that's a big problem
 

8369
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,349
deadly that's a big problem
uh if you're not deadly enough that's

8370
02:31:51,349 --> 02:31:51,359
uh if you're not deadly enough that's
 

8371
02:31:51,359 --> 02:31:52,630
uh if you're not deadly enough that's
also a problem

8372
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:52,640
also a problem
 

8373
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:53,429
also a problem
so

8374
02:31:53,429 --> 02:31:53,439
so
 

8375
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:56,070
so
so that is a fascinating exploration of

8376
02:31:56,070 --> 02:31:56,080
so that is a fascinating exploration of
 

8377
02:31:56,080 --> 02:31:58,469
so that is a fascinating exploration of
i don't see any evidence i don't see

8378
02:31:58,469 --> 02:31:58,479
i don't see any evidence i don't see
 

8379
02:31:58,479 --> 02:31:59,590
i don't see any evidence i don't see
where you're coming from when you say

8380
02:31:59,590 --> 02:31:59,600
where you're coming from when you say
 

8381
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,070
where you're coming from when you say
that being too peaceful is a problem

8382
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:02,080
that being too peaceful is a problem
 

8383
02:32:02,080 --> 02:32:03,270
that being too peaceful is a problem
well because

8384
02:32:03,270 --> 02:32:03,280
well because
 

8385
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,150
well because
so i'll say it this way

8386
02:32:06,150 --> 02:32:06,160
so i'll say it this way
 

8387
02:32:06,160 --> 02:32:07,830
so i'll say it this way
death

8388
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
death
 

8389
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:09,270
death
is a way

8390
02:32:09,270 --> 02:32:09,280
is a way
 

8391
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:12,630
is a way
to get rid of suboptimal solutions

8392
02:32:12,630 --> 02:32:12,640
to get rid of suboptimal solutions
 

8393
02:32:12,640 --> 02:32:14,950
to get rid of suboptimal solutions
so violence but there's lots of ways to

8394
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:14,960
so violence but there's lots of ways to
 

8395
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:16,950
so violence but there's lots of ways to
die without violence right

8396
02:32:16,950 --> 02:32:16,960
die without violence right
 

8397
02:32:16,960 --> 02:32:19,510
die without violence right
to me death in itself is violence

8398
02:32:19,510 --> 02:32:19,520
to me death in itself is violence
 

8399
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:21,110
to me death in itself is violence
and

8400
02:32:21,110 --> 02:32:21,120
and
 

8401
02:32:21,120 --> 02:32:22,710
and
you you can i mean a lot of people that

8402
02:32:22,710 --> 02:32:22,720
you you can i mean a lot of people that
 

8403
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:25,190
you you can i mean a lot of people that
talk about for example longevity and and

8404
02:32:25,190 --> 02:32:25,200
talk about for example longevity and and
 

8405
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:26,790
talk about for example longevity and and
disease and all that kind of stuff they

8406
02:32:26,790 --> 02:32:26,800
disease and all that kind of stuff they
 

8407
02:32:26,800 --> 02:32:29,510
disease and all that kind of stuff they
see death is uh

8408
02:32:29,510 --> 02:32:29,520
see death is uh
 

8409
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:31,270
see death is uh
this is the way they they talk about it

8410
02:32:31,270 --> 02:32:31,280
this is the way they they talk about it
 

8411
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:32,870
this is the way they they talk about it
and it's interesting to philosophically

8412
02:32:32,870 --> 02:32:32,880
and it's interesting to philosophically
 

8413
02:32:32,880 --> 02:32:34,230
and it's interesting to philosophically
think of it that way

8414
02:32:34,230 --> 02:32:34,240
think of it that way
 

8415
02:32:34,240 --> 02:32:35,349
think of it that way
death is

8416
02:32:35,349 --> 02:32:35,359
death is
 

8417
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:37,590
death is
it's like mass murder that's happening

8418
02:32:37,590 --> 02:32:37,600
it's like mass murder that's happening
 

8419
02:32:37,600 --> 02:32:39,990
it's like mass murder that's happening
it's like people that try to from a

8420
02:32:39,990 --> 02:32:40,000
it's like people that try to from a
 

8421
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,870
it's like people that try to from a
biological perspective help extend life

8422
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:42,880
biological perspective help extend life
 

8423
02:32:42,880 --> 02:32:44,870
biological perspective help extend life
they see that you're

8424
02:32:44,870 --> 02:32:44,880
they see that you're
 

8425
02:32:44,880 --> 02:32:46,790
they see that you're
you're helping

8426
02:32:46,790 --> 02:32:46,800
you're helping
 

8427
02:32:46,800 --> 02:32:47,830
you're helping
the most

8428
02:32:47,830 --> 02:32:47,840
the most
 

8429
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:49,830
the most
the biggest atrocity in the history of

8430
02:32:49,830 --> 02:32:49,840
the biggest atrocity in the history of
 

8431
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:51,349
the biggest atrocity in the history of
human civilization from their

8432
02:32:51,349 --> 02:32:51,359

human civilization from their
perspective

8434
02:32:52,630 --> 02:32:52,640
perspective
 

8435
02:32:52,640 --> 02:32:53,750
perspective
is

8436
02:32:53,750 --> 02:32:53,760
is
 

8437
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:55,030
is
not

8438
02:32:55,030 --> 02:32:55,040
not
 

8439
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:57,429
not
allocating all our resources to solving

8440
02:32:57,429 --> 02:32:57,439
allocating all our resources to solving
 

8441
02:32:57,439 --> 02:32:58,870
allocating all our resources to solving
death

8442
02:32:58,870 --> 02:32:58,880
death
 

8443
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,429
death
right because death is a kind of

8444
02:33:01,429 --> 02:33:01,439
right because death is a kind of
 

8445
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:03,110
right because death is a kind of
violence it is the kind of murder that

8446
02:33:03,110 --> 02:33:03,120
violence it is the kind of murder that
 

8447
02:33:03,120 --> 02:33:04,630
violence it is the kind of murder that
we're allowing

8448
02:33:04,630 --> 02:33:04,640
we're allowing
 

8449
02:33:04,640 --> 02:33:08,230
we're allowing
to be committed on us by nature and so

8450
02:33:08,230 --> 02:33:08,240
to be committed on us by nature and so
 

8451
02:33:08,240 --> 02:33:10,550
to be committed on us by nature and so
so the flip side of that is death makes

8452
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:10,560
so the flip side of that is death makes
 

8453
02:33:10,560 --> 02:33:12,309
so the flip side of that is death makes
way for new life

8454
02:33:12,309 --> 02:33:12,319
way for new life
 

8455
02:33:12,319 --> 02:33:13,990
way for new life
for new ideas

8456
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:14,000
for new ideas
 

8457
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,150
for new ideas
and so that's but but that's got nothing

8458
02:33:16,150 --> 02:33:16,160
and so that's but but that's got nothing
 

8459
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:18,790
and so that's but but that's got nothing
to do with with peace versus war

8460
02:33:18,790 --> 02:33:18,800
to do with with peace versus war
 

8461
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:20,230
to do with with peace versus war
