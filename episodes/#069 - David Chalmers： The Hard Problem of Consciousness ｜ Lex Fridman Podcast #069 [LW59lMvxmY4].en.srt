well enough it'll be indistinguishable

132
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:36,940
well enough it'll be indistinguishable
 

133
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,530
well enough it'll be indistinguishable
from a non simulated reality and

134
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:39,540
from a non simulated reality and
 

135
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,720
from a non simulated reality and
although we could keep searching for

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:42,730
although we could keep searching for
 

137
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,110

evidence that were not in a simulation

138
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,120
evidence that were not in a simulation
 

139
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,880
evidence that were not in a simulation
any of that evidence in principle could

140
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:47,890
any of that evidence in principle could
 

141
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,920
any of that evidence in principle could
be simulated so I think it's a

142
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:49,930
be simulated so I think it's a
 

143
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:51,450
be simulated so I think it's a
possibility but do you think the thought

144
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:51,460
possibility but do you think the thought
 

145
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,470
possibility but do you think the thought
experiment is interesting or useful to

146
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
experiment is interesting or useful to
 

147
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,330

149
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,790

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,100
it to shed light on a whole bunch of
philosophical questions so you know the

philosophical questions so you know the
 

161
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,170
philosophical questions so you know the
big one is how do we know anything about

162
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,180
big one is how do we know anything about

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,090
the external world Descartes said you
know maybe you're being fooled by an

166
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:18,100
know maybe you're being fooled by an
 

167
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,640
know maybe you're being fooled by an
evil demon who's stimulating your brain

168
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:20,650
evil demon who's stimulating your brain
 

169
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:24,210
evil demon who's stimulating your brain
and thinking all this stuff is real when

170
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:24,220
and thinking all this stuff is real when
 

171
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,250
and thinking all this stuff is real when
in fact it's all made up well the modern

172
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,260
in fact it's all made up well the modern
 

173
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,410
in fact it's all made up well the modern
the modern version of that is how do you

174
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:28,420
the modern version of that is how do you
 

175
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,050
the modern version of that is how do you
know you're not in a simulation then the

176
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,060
know you're not in a simulation then the
 

177
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,000
know you're not in a simulation then the
thought is if you're in a simulation

178
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,010
thought is if you're in a simulation
 

179
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,620
thought is if you're in a simulation
none of this is real

180
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:34,630
none of this is real
 

181
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,760
none of this is real
so that's teaching you something to give

182
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:35,770
so that's teaching you something to give
 

183
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,979
so that's teaching you something to give
out about knowledge how do you know

184
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:37,989
out about knowledge how do you know
 

185
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:39,810
out about knowledge how do you know
about the external world I think there's

186
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:39,820
about the external world I think there's
 

187
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,370
about the external world I think there's
also really interesting questions about

188
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:41,380
also really interesting questions about
 

189
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,770
also really interesting questions about
the nature of reality right here I mean

190
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:43,780
the nature of reality right here I mean
 

191
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,170
the nature of reality right here I mean
if we are in a simulation is all this

192
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:46,180
if we are in a simulation is all this
 

193
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,650
if we are in a simulation is all this
real

194
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:46,660
real
 

195
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,360
real
is there really a table here is it

196
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,370
is there really a table here is it
 

197
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,860
is there really a table here is it
really a microphone do I really have a

198
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:49,870
really a microphone do I really have a
 

199
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,910
really a microphone do I really have a
body the standard view would be no we

200
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:53,920
body the standard view would be no we
 

201
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,979
body the standard view would be no we
don't none of this would be real my view

202
00:03:55,979 --> 00:03:55,989
don't none of this would be real my view
 

203
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,300
don't none of this would be real my view
is actually that's wrong and even if we

204
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:57,310
is actually that's wrong and even if we
 

205
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,229
is actually that's wrong and even if we
are in a simulation

206
00:03:58,229 --> 00:03:58,239
are in a simulation
 

207
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,910
are in a simulation
all of this is real that's why I called

208
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
all of this is real that's why I called
 

209
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,220
all of this is real that's why I called
this reality 2.0 new version of reality

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:02,230
this reality 2.0 new version of reality
 

211
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,380
this reality 2.0 new version of reality
different version of reality still

reality so what's the difference between

214
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,140
reality so what's the difference between
 

215
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,890

what's going on underneath we already

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,340
what's going on underneath we already
know that from just thinking about

00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,350
know that from just thinking about
 

243
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,140
know that from just thinking about
science you know you don't see too many

obviously quantum mechanical effects and

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,670
obviously quantum mechanical effects and
what we what we perceive but we still

what we what we perceive but we still

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,070
what we what we perceive but we still
know quantum mechanics is going on under

know quantum mechanics is going on under
 

251
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,240
know quantum mechanics is going on under
all things so I like to think the world

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,250
all things so I like to think the world

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,020
all things so I like to think the world
we perceive is this very kind of

there's a that's what the philosopher

there's a that's what the philosopher

Wilfrid Sellars called the manifest
image the world as it seems to us we

underlying stuff of reality science
 

293
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,990
underlying stuff of reality science
could help tell us about that maybe

294
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,000
could help tell us about that maybe
 

295
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,910
could help tell us about that maybe
philosophy could help tell us about that

philosophy could help tell us about that

what is the nature of the thing and
 

317
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,180
what is the nature of the thing and
itself well I think of the simulation

of the thing in itself it turns out if
we're in a simulation the thing in

324
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:21,040
we're in a simulation the thing in
 

325
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,130
we're in a simulation the thing in
itself nature of this glass okay it's

326
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:23,140
itself nature of this glass okay it's
 

327
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,900
itself nature of this glass okay it's
actually a bunch of data structures

328
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:24,910
actually a bunch of data structures
 

329
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,030
actually a bunch of data structures
running on a on a computer in the next

330
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,040
running on a on a computer in the next
 

331
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,970
running on a on a computer in the next
universe up yeah that's what people tend

332
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:29,980
universe up yeah that's what people tend
 

333
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,470
universe up yeah that's what people tend
to do and they think about simulation

334
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:31,480
to do and they think about simulation
 

335
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,900
to do and they think about simulation
they think about our modern computers

336
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:33,910
they think about our modern computers
 

337
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:37,800
they think about our modern computers
and somehow trivially crudely just

338
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:37,810
and somehow trivially crudely just
 

339
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,629
and somehow trivially crudely just
scaled up and

340
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:39,639
scaled up and
 

341
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,910
scaled up and
but do you think the simulation I mean

342
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:44,920
but do you think the simulation I mean
 

343
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,879
but do you think the simulation I mean
in order to actually simulate something

344
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:47,889
in order to actually simulate something
 

345
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,520
in order to actually simulate something
as complicated as our universe that's

346
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,530
as complicated as our universe that's
 

347
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,159
as complicated as our universe that's
made up of molecules and atoms and

348
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:53,169
made up of molecules and atoms and
 

349
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:55,890
made up of molecules and atoms and
particles and quarks and maybe even

350
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:55,900
particles and quarks and maybe even
 

351
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,980
particles and quarks and maybe even
strings all of that requires something

352
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:58,990
strings all of that requires something
 

353
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:01,740
strings all of that requires something
just infinitely many orders of magnitude

354
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:01,750
just infinitely many orders of magnitude
 

355
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:08,010
just infinitely many orders of magnitude
more of scale and complexity do you

356
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,020
more of scale and complexity do you
 

357
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,310
more of scale and complexity do you
think we're even able to even like

358
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:11,320
think we're even able to even like
 

359
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,050
think we're even able to even like
conceptualize what it would take to

360
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,060
conceptualize what it would take to
 

361
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:16,730
conceptualize what it would take to
simulate our universe or does it just

362
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:16,740
simulate our universe or does it just
 

363
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,800
simulate our universe or does it just
slip into this idea that you basically

364
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:19,810
slip into this idea that you basically
 

365
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,470
slip into this idea that you basically
have to build a universe something so

366
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:22,480
have to build a universe something so
 

367
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,560
have to build a universe something so
big to simulate it is that it just get

368
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:25,570
big to simulate it is that it just get
 

369
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,300
big to simulate it is that it just get
this into this fuzzy area that's not

370
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:27,310
this into this fuzzy area that's not
 

371
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,090
this into this fuzzy area that's not
useful at all yeah well obviously I mean

372
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,100
useful at all yeah well obviously I mean
 

373
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,940
useful at all yeah well obviously I mean
our universe is obviously incredibly

374
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:31,950
our universe is obviously incredibly
 

375
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,950
our universe is obviously incredibly
complicated and for us within our

376
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:34,960
complicated and for us within our
 

377
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,890
complicated and for us within our
universe to build a simulation of a

378
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:37,900
universe to build a simulation of a
 

379
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,920
universe to build a simulation of a
universe as complicated as ours is gonna

380
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:40,930
universe as complicated as ours is gonna
 

381
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:42,540
universe as complicated as ours is gonna
have obvious problems here if the

382
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,550
have obvious problems here if the
 

383
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,670
have obvious problems here if the
universe is finite there's just no way

384
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:44,680
universe is finite there's just no way
 

385
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,469
universe is finite there's just no way
that's gonna work maybe there's some

386
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:46,479
that's gonna work maybe there's some
 

387
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,630
that's gonna work maybe there's some
cute way to make it work if the universe

388
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:48,640
cute way to make it work if the universe
 

389
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,780
cute way to make it work if the universe
is a is a is infinite maybe an infinite

390
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:51,790
is a is a is infinite maybe an infinite
 

391
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,940
is a is a is infinite maybe an infinite
universe could somehow simulate a copy

392
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:53,950
universe could somehow simulate a copy
 

393
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,610
universe could somehow simulate a copy
of itself but that's a that's gonna be

394
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:56,620
of itself but that's a that's gonna be
 

395
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:56,940
of itself but that's a that's gonna be
hard

396
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:56,950
hard
 

397
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,980
hard
nonetheless just that we are in a

398
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:58,990
nonetheless just that we are in a
 

399
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:00,420
nonetheless just that we are in a
simulation I think there's no particular

400
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,430
simulation I think there's no particular
 

401
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,430
simulation I think there's no particular
reason why we have to think the

402
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:02,440
reason why we have to think the
 

403
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,590
reason why we have to think the
simulating universe has to be anything

404
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:04,600
simulating universe has to be anything
 

405
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,070
simulating universe has to be anything
like ours you've said before that it

406
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:08,080
like ours you've said before that it
 

407
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,760
like ours you've said before that it
might be so you can think of it and

408
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:11,770
might be so you can think of it and
 

409
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,350
might be so you can think of it and
Turtles all the way down you could think

410
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:13,360
Turtles all the way down you could think
 

411
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,230
Turtles all the way down you could think
of the simulating universe different

412
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,240
of the simulating universe different
 

413
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,120
of the simulating universe different
than ours but we ourselves could also

414
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,130
than ours but we ourselves could also
 

415
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,370
than ours but we ourselves could also
create another simulating universe so

416
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:20,380
create another simulating universe so
 

417
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,020
create another simulating universe so
you said there could be these kind of

418
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,030
you said there could be these kind of
 

419
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,779
you said there could be these kind of
levels of universes and you've also

420
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:24,789
levels of universes and you've also
 

421
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:27,300
levels of universes and you've also
mentioned this hilarious idea maybe

422
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:27,310
mentioned this hilarious idea maybe
 

423
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,270
mentioned this hilarious idea maybe
tongue-in-cheek maybe not that there may

424
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,280
tongue-in-cheek maybe not that there may
 

425
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,740
tongue-in-cheek maybe not that there may
be simulations within simulations

426
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:31,750
be simulations within simulations
 

427
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,200
be simulations within simulations
arbitrarily stacked levels and that

428
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:34,210
arbitrarily stacked levels and that
 

429
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,140
arbitrarily stacked levels and that
there may be that we may be in level 42

430
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:37,150
there may be that we may be in level 42
 

431
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,870
there may be that we may be in level 42
oh yeah along those stacks referencing

00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:39,880
oh yeah along those stacks referencing

00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:48,829
we're indeed in a simulation within a
simulation at level 42 what do you think

438
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:48,839
simulation at level 42 what do you think
 

439
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,230
simulation at level 42 what do you think
level zero looks like there right would

440
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
level zero looks like there right would
 

441
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,040
level zero looks like there right would
expect that

442
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,050
expect that
 

443
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,970
expect that
zero is truly enormous I mean not just

444
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:55,980
zero is truly enormous I mean not just
 

445
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,450
zero is truly enormous I mean not just
if it's finite it's some extraordinarily

446
00:08:59,450 --> 00:08:59,460
if it's finite it's some extraordinarily
 

447
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:02,610
if it's finite it's some extraordinarily
large finite capacity much more likely

448
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:02,620
large finite capacity much more likely
 

449
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,650
large finite capacity much more likely
its infinite maybe it's a maybe it's got

450
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:04,660
its infinite maybe it's a maybe it's got
 

451
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,910
its infinite maybe it's a maybe it's got
something very high etcetera to

452
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:05,920
something very high etcetera to
 

453
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,340
something very high etcetera to
cardinalities that enables it to support

454
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:08,350
cardinalities that enables it to support
 

455
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,620
cardinalities that enables it to support
just any number of any number of

456
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:10,630
just any number of any number of
 

457
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,440
just any number of any number of
simulations so high degree of infinity

458
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,450
simulations so high degree of infinity
 

459
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,690
simulations so high degree of infinity
at level zero slight little slightly

460
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:15,700
at level zero slight little slightly
 

461
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,540
at level zero slight little slightly
smaller degree of infinity at at level

462
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:18,550
smaller degree of infinity at at level
 

463
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,550
smaller degree of infinity at at level
one so by the time you get down to us at

464
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:20,560
one so by the time you get down to us at
 

465
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,700
one so by the time you get down to us at
level 42 maybe plenty of room for lots

466
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:23,710
level 42 maybe plenty of room for lots
 

467
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,730
level 42 maybe plenty of room for lots
of simulations of finite capacity if the

468
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:29,740
of simulations of finite capacity if the
 

469
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:33,420
of simulations of finite capacity if the
top universe is only a small finite

470
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,430
top universe is only a small finite
 

471
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,220
top universe is only a small finite
capacity then obviously that's going to

472
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,230
capacity then obviously that's going to
 

473
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:37,290
capacity then obviously that's going to
put very very serious limits on how many

474
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:37,300
put very very serious limits on how many
 

475
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,720
put very very serious limits on how many
simulations are going to be able to be

476
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:39,730
simulations are going to be able to be
 

477
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,580
simulations are going to be able to be
able to get running so I think we can

478
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:41,590
able to get running so I think we can
 

479
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,320
able to get running so I think we can
certainly confidently say that if we

480
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:43,330
certainly confidently say that if we
 

481
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,840
certainly confidently say that if we
hurt level 42 then the top level is

482
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:45,850

science and literature and engineering
and culture and and so on so we had just

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,050
and culture and and so on so we had just
 

585
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:46,660
and culture and and so on so we had just
at the beginning of that on the

00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:46,670
at the beginning of that on the
 

587
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,160
at the beginning of that on the

589
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:50,020
evolutionary threshold it's kind of like
we just got there you know who knows a

00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,030
we just got there you know who knows a

few thousands or tens of thousands of

few thousands or tens of thousands of
 

593
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,480
few thousands or tens of thousands of
years ago so we're probably just at the

594
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:55,490
years ago so we're probably just at the
 

595
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,610
years ago so we're probably just at the
very beginning for what's possible there

596
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:57,620
very beginning for what's possible there
 

597
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,760
very beginning for what's possible there
so I'm inclined to think among the scale

598
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:00,770
so I'm inclined to think among the scale
 

599
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,860
so I'm inclined to think among the scale
of intelligent beings we're somewhere

600
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:02,870
of intelligent beings we're somewhere
 

601
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,830
of intelligent beings we're somewhere
very near the bottom I would expect that

602
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:05,840
very near the bottom I would expect that
 

603
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,110
very near the bottom I would expect that
for example if we're in a if we're in a

604
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:08,120
for example if we're in a if we're in a
 

605
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,150
for example if we're in a if we're in a
simulation then the simulators who

606
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
simulation then the simulators who
 

607
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,790
simulation then the simulators who
created a sir got the capacity to be far

608
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:12,800
created a sir got the capacity to be far
 

609
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,490
created a sir got the capacity to be far
more sophisticated for at level 42 who

610
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:15,500
more sophisticated for at level 42 who
 

611
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,270
more sophisticated for at level 42 who
knows what the ones at level zero I like

612
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,280
knows what the ones at level zero I like
 

613
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,180
knows what the ones at level zero I like
it's also possible that this is the

614
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,190
it's also possible that this is the
 

615
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,920
it's also possible that this is the
epitome of what is possible to achieve

616
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:23,930
epitome of what is possible to achieve
 

617
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:26,200
epitome of what is possible to achieve
so we as human beings see ourselves

618
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:26,210
so we as human beings see ourselves
 

619
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,300
so we as human beings see ourselves
maybe as flawed see all the constraints

620
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:28,310
maybe as flawed see all the constraints
 

621
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,460
maybe as flawed see all the constraints
all the limitations but maybe that's the

622
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,470
all the limitations but maybe that's the
 

623
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:31,870
all the limitations but maybe that's the
magical the beautiful thing

624
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:31,880
magical the beautiful thing
 

625
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,150
magical the beautiful thing
maybe those limitations are the

626
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,160
maybe those limitations are the
 

627
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,090
maybe those limitations are the
essential elements for an interesting

628
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:37,100
essential elements for an interesting
 

629
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,100
essential elements for an interesting
sort of that edge of chaos that

630
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,110
sort of that edge of chaos that
 

631
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,920
sort of that edge of chaos that
interesting existence that if you make

632
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:41,930
interesting existence that if you make
 

633
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,670
interesting existence that if you make
us much more intelligent if if you make

634
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
us much more intelligent if if you make
 

635
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,970
us much more intelligent if if you make
us much more powerful in any kind of

636
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:47,980
us much more powerful in any kind of
 

637
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,070
us much more powerful in any kind of
dimension of performance maybe you lose

638
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,080
dimension of performance maybe you lose
 

639
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,350

something fundamental that makes life

640
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:53,360
something fundamental that makes life
 

641
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,290
something fundamental that makes life
worth living so you kind of have this

642
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:56,300
worth living so you kind of have this
 

643
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,410
worth living so you kind of have this
optimistic view of where this little

00:12:59,410 --> 00:12:59,420
optimistic view of where this little
 

645
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,990
optimistic view of where this little
baby that and there's so much growth and

646
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
baby that and there's so much growth and
 

647
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,010
baby that and there's so much growth and
potential but this could also be it well

648
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:06,020
potential but this could also be it well
 

649
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,920
potential but this could also be it well
this is the most amazing thing is us

650
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:08,930
this is the most amazing thing is us
 

651
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,230
this is the most amazing thing is us
maybe what you're saying is consistent

652
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:11,240
maybe what you're saying is consistent
 

653
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,550
maybe what you're saying is consistent
with what I'm saying I mean we can still

654
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:12,560
with what I'm saying I mean we can still
 

655
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,950
with what I'm saying I mean we can still
have levels of intelligence far beyond

656
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:14,960
have levels of intelligence far beyond
 

657
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,450
have levels of intelligence far beyond
us but maybe those levels of

658
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:16,460
us but maybe those levels of
 

659
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,160
us but maybe those levels of
intelligence on your view would be kind

660
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,170
intelligence on your view would be kind
 

661
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,150
intelligence on your view would be kind
of boring and

662
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:19,160
of boring and
 

663
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,980
of boring and
you know we get kind of get so good at

664
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:20,990
you know we get kind of get so good at
 

665
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,840
you know we get kind of get so good at
everything that life suddenly becomes

666
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:22,850
everything that life suddenly becomes
 

667
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,830
everything that life suddenly becomes
uni-dimensional

668
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:23,840
uni-dimensional
 

669
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,810
uni-dimensional
so we're just in happening in happening

670
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:25,820
so we're just in happening in happening
 

671
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,150
so we're just in happening in happening
this once part of like maximal

672
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
this once part of like maximal
 

673
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,430
this once part of like maximal
romanticism and history of evolution yes

674
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:30,440
romanticism and history of evolution yes
 

675
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,230
romanticism and history of evolution yes
you get to humans and it's like yeah and

676
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:32,240
you get to humans and it's like yeah and
 

677
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,330
you get to humans and it's like yeah and
then years to come our super intelligent

678
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,340
then years to come our super intelligent
 

679
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,220
then years to come our super intelligent
descendents are gonna look back at us

680
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,230
descendents are gonna look back at us
 

681
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,980
descendents are gonna look back at us
and say those were the days when and

682
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:38,990
and say those were the days when and
 

683
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,660
and say those were the days when and
they just hit the point of inflection

684
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:40,670
they just hit the point of inflection
 

685
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,940
they just hit the point of inflection
and life was interesting I am an

686
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:42,950
and life was interesting I am an
 

687
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,010
and life was interesting I am an
optimist so I'd like to think that you

688
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,020
optimist so I'd like to think that you
 

689
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,990
optimist so I'd like to think that you
know if there is super intelligence

690
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,000
know if there is super intelligence
 

691
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,540
know if there is super intelligence
somewhere in the in the future they'll

692
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:49,550
somewhere in the in the future they'll
 

693
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,130
somewhere in the in the future they'll
figure out how to make life super

694
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,140
figure out how to make life super
 

695
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,170
figure out how to make life super
interesting and super romantic when you

696
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:53,180
interesting and super romantic when you
 

697
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,850
interesting and super romantic when you
know what they're gonna do it so what

698
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:54,860
know what they're gonna do it so what
 

699
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,500
know what they're gonna do it so what
they're gonna do is they realize how

700
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:56,510
they're gonna do is they realize how
 

701
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,640
they're gonna do is they realize how
boring life is when you're super

702
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:57,650
boring life is when you're super
 

703
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,700
boring life is when you're super
intelligent so they created a new level

704
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:00,710
intelligent so they created a new level
 

705
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,970
intelligent so they created a new level
of a simulation and sort of live through

706
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:03,980
of a simulation and sort of live through
 

707
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,070
of a simulation and sort of live through
the things they've created by watching

708
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:06,080
the things they've created by watching
 

709
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,940
the things they've created by watching
them stumble about in their flawed ways

710
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:09,950
them stumble about in their flawed ways
 

711
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,640
them stumble about in their flawed ways
so maybe that's so you create a new

712
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:12,650
so maybe that's so you create a new
 

713
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,710
so maybe that's so you create a new
level of a simulation every time you get

714
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:14,720
level of a simulation every time you get
 

715
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,950
level of a simulation every time you get
really bored with how smart and this

716
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:17,960
really bored with how smart and this
 

717
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,240
really bored with how smart and this
would be kind of sad though because it

718
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,250
would be kind of sad though because it
 

719
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,650
would be kind of sad though because it
would show the peak of their existence

720
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:20,660
would show the peak of their existence
 

721
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,300
would show the peak of their existence
would be like watching simulations for

722
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:22,310
would be like watching simulations for
 

723
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,310
would be like watching simulations for
entertainment by saying the peak of our

724
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
entertainment by saying the peak of our
 

725
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,130
entertainment by saying the peak of our
existence now is Netflix know it's

726
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:27,140
existence now is Netflix know it's
 

727
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,530
existence now is Netflix know it's
alright a flipside of that could be the

728
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:29,540
alright a flipside of that could be the
 

729
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,930
alright a flipside of that could be the
peak of our existence for many people

730
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:31,940
peak of our existence for many people
 

731
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,730
peak of our existence for many people
having children and watching them grow

732
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,740
having children and watching them grow
 

733
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,650
having children and watching them grow
hmm that becomes very meaningful

734
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:35,660
hmm that becomes very meaningful
 

735
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,390
hmm that becomes very meaningful
okay so create a simulation it's like

736
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,400
okay so create a simulation it's like
 

737
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,910
okay so create a simulation it's like
creating a family creating like well any

738
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:39,920
creating a family creating like well any
 

739
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,460
creating a family creating like well any
kind of creation is uh it's kind of a

740
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:42,470
kind of creation is uh it's kind of a
 

741
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,710
kind of creation is uh it's kind of a
powerful act dealing is easier to

742
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:44,720
powerful act dealing is easier to
 

743
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,860
powerful act dealing is easier to
simulate the mind or the universe so

744
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:47,870
simulate the mind or the universe so
 

745
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,980
simulate the mind or the universe so
I've heard several people including Nick

746
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:50,990
I've heard several people including Nick
 

747
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,860
I've heard several people including Nick
Bostrom think about ideas of you know

748
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:53,870
Bostrom think about ideas of you know
 

749
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,210
Bostrom think about ideas of you know
maybe you don't need to simulate the

750
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:55,220
maybe you don't need to simulate the
 

751
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,950
maybe you don't need to simulate the
universe you can just simulate the human

752
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:56,960
universe you can just simulate the human
 

753
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,220
universe you can just simulate the human
mind or in general just the distinction

754
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:00,230
mind or in general just the distinction
 

755
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:02,290
mind or in general just the distinction
between simulating this the entirety of

756
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:02,300
between simulating this the entirety of
 

757
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
between simulating this the entirety of
it the entirety the physical world or

758
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,310
it the entirety the physical world or
 

759
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,080
it the entirety the physical world or
just simulating the mind which one do

760
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,090
just simulating the mind which one do
 

761
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,060
just simulating the mind which one do
you see is more challenging well I think

762
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,070
you see is more challenging well I think
 

763
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,010
you see is more challenging well I think
in some sense the answer is is obvious

764
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,020
in some sense the answer is is obvious
 

765
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,140
in some sense the answer is is obvious
it has to be simpler to simply simulate

766
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:14,150
it has to be simpler to simply simulate
 

767
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,790
it has to be simpler to simply simulate
the mind than to simulate the universe

768
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:15,800
the mind than to simulate the universe
 

769
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,010
the mind than to simulate the universe
because the mind is part of the universe

770
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:18,020
because the mind is part of the universe
 

771
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,750
because the mind is part of the universe
and in order to fully simulate the

772
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:19,760
and in order to fully simulate the
 

773
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,280
and in order to fully simulate the
universe you're gonna have to simulate

774
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:21,290
universe you're gonna have to simulate
 

775
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,410
universe you're gonna have to simulate
the mind's eye just by talking about

776
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:23,420
the mind's eye just by talking about
 

777
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,840
the mind's eye just by talking about
partial simulations and I guess the

778
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:25,850
partial simulations and I guess the
 

779
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,000
partial simulations and I guess the
question is which comes first there's a

780
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,010
question is which comes first there's a
 

781
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,130
question is which comes first there's a
mind come before the universe or does

782
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:30,140
mind come before the universe or does
 

783
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,140
mind come before the universe or does
the universe come before the mind

784
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,150
the universe come before the mind
 

785
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,370
the universe come before the mind
so the mind could just be an emergent

786
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:35,380
so the mind could just be an emergent
 

787
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,550
so the mind could just be an emergent
phenomena in this universe so simulation

788
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:39,560
phenomena in this universe so simulation
 

789
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,610
phenomena in this universe so simulation
is a is an interesting thing that you

790
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:42,620
is a is an interesting thing that you
 

791
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,120
is a is an interesting thing that you
know it's it's not like creating a

792
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,130
know it's it's not like creating a
 

793
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,390
know it's it's not like creating a
simulation perhaps requires you to

794
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:48,400
simulation perhaps requires you to
 

795
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,920
simulation perhaps requires you to
program every single thing that happens

796
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:50,930
program every single thing that happens
 

797
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,370
program every single thing that happens
in it

798
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:51,380
in it
 

799
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,230
in it
it's just defining a set of initial

800
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,240
it's just defining a set of initial
 

801
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,860
it's just defining a set of initial
conditions and rules based on which

802
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:55,870
conditions and rules based on which
 

803

we're now in a little bit of a crazy lab
 

809
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,329
we're now in a little bit of a crazy lab
but it requires you to understand the

but it requires you to understand the
 

811
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:12,340
but it requires you to understand the
fundamentals of cognition perhaps of

00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,050
the fundamentals of the mind how about
 

825
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,750
the fundamentals of the mind how about
if we said to simulate the brain the

826
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:31,760
if we said to simulate the brain the
 

827
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,610
if we said to simulate the brain the
brain rather than rather than the mind

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,960
the brain is just a big physical system
the universe is a giant physical system

the universe is a giant physical system
 

833
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,790
the universe is a giant physical system
I simulate the universe at the very

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:39,800
I simulate the universe at the very
 

835
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,750
I simulate the universe at the very
least you're going to have to simulate

836
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:40,760
least you're going to have to simulate
 

837
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,329
least you're going to have to simulate
the brains as well as all the other

838
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:43,339
the brains as well as all the other
 

839
00:16:43,339 --> 00:16:47,380
the brains as well as all the other
physical systems within it and you know

840
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,390
physical systems within it and you know
 

841
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,900
physical systems within it and you know
it's not obvious there's that the

842
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:49,910
it's not obvious there's that the
 

843
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,000
it's not obvious there's that the
problems are any worse for the for the

problems are any worse for the for the
 

845
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,730
problems are any worse for the for the
brain than for its particularly complex

brain than for its particularly complex
 

847
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,650
brain than for its particularly complex
physical system but if we can simulate

848
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:56,660
physical system but if we can simulate
 

849
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,840
physical system but if we can simulate
arbitrary physical systems we can

850
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:58,850
arbitrary physical systems we can
 

851
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,519
arbitrary physical systems we can
simulate brains there is this further

852
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:00,529
simulate brains there is this further
 

853
00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:02,890
simulate brains there is this further
question of whether when you simulate a

854
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:02,900
question of whether when you simulate a
 

855
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,410
question of whether when you simulate a
brain will that bring along all the

brain will that bring along all the
 

857
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,660
brain will that bring along all the
features of the mind with it like will

858
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:07,670
features of the mind with it like will
 

859
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,340
features of the mind with it like will
you get my consciousness will you get

860
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:09,350
you get my consciousness will you get
 

861
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:12,280
you get my consciousness will you get
thinking will you get free will and so

862
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,290
thinking will you get free will and so
 

863
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,600
thinking will you get free will and so
on and that's that's something

864
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:13,610
on and that's that's something
 

865
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:16,419
on and that's that's something
philosophers ever have argued over for

866
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:16,429
philosophers ever have argued over for
 

867
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,309
philosophers ever have argued over for
four years my own view is if you see if

868
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:18,319
four years my own view is if you see if
 

869
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,199
four years my own view is if you see if
you simulate the brain well enough that

870
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:20,209
you simulate the brain well enough that
 

871
00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,049
you simulate the brain well enough that
will also simulate the mind but yeah

872
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:23,059
will also simulate the mind but yeah
 

873
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,069
will also simulate the mind but yeah
there's plenty of people who would say

874
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:24,079
there's plenty of people who would say
 

875
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,100
there's plenty of people who would say
no you'd merely get like a zombie system

876
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,110
no you'd merely get like a zombie system
 

877
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,430
no you'd merely get like a zombie system
a simulation of a brain without any true

878
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:30,440
a simulation of a brain without any true
 

879
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
a simulation of a brain without any true
consciousness but for you you put

880
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:32,450
consciousness but for you you put
 

881
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,570
consciousness but for you you put
together a brain the consciousness comes

882
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:34,580
together a brain the consciousness comes
 

883
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,840
together a brain the consciousness comes
with it arise yeah I don't think it's

884
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:37,850
with it arise yeah I don't think it's
 

885
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,240
with it arise yeah I don't think it's
obvious that's your intuition my view is

886
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:40,250
obvious that's your intuition my view is
 

887
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,310
obvious that's your intuition my view is
roughly that yeah what is responsible

888
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:42,320
roughly that yeah what is responsible
 

889
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,100
roughly that yeah what is responsible
for consciousness it's in the patents of

890
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,110
for consciousness it's in the patents of
 

891
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,110
for consciousness it's in the patents of
information processing and so on rather

892
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,120
information processing and so on rather
 

893
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,320
information processing and so on rather
than say the biology that it's made of

894
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:50,330
than say the biology that it's made of
 

895
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,490
than say the biology that it's made of
there's certainly plenty of people out

896
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:51,500
there's certainly plenty of people out
 

897
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,990
there's certainly plenty of people out
there who think consciousness has to be

898
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,000
there who think consciousness has to be
 

899
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,060
there who think consciousness has to be
say biological so if you merely

900
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,070
say biological so if you merely
 

901
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,890
say biological so if you merely
replicate the patterns of information

902
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:56,900

905
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,600

you'll miss what's crucial for

906
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:01,610
you'll miss what's crucial for
 

907
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:03,220
you'll miss what's crucial for

think there's any particular reason to
 

911
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,450
think there's any particular reason to
think that biology is special here you

912
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:07,460
think that biology is special here you
 

913
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,820
think that biology is special here you
can imagine substituting the biology for

914
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:09,830
can imagine substituting the biology for

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,790

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,350

921
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,450

and you know I think just the key about

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:19,460
and you know I think just the key about
 

923
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,730
and you know I think just the key about
what is the true I when I think about

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:21,740
what is the true I when I think about

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,800
what is the true I when I think about

931
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:29,290

processing not specific biology so I at

934
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:32,690
processing not specific biology so I at
 

935
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,510

least adopted as my working hypothesis

936
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:34,520
least adopted as my working hypothesis
 

937
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,640
least adopted as my working hypothesis
that basically it's the computation and

938
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:36,650
that basically it's the computation and
 

939
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,590
that basically it's the computation and
the information that matters for

940
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:38,600
the information that matters for
 

941
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,780
the information that matters for
consciousness the same time we don't

942
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:40,790
consciousness the same time we don't
 

943
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:43,060
consciousness the same time we don't
understand consciousness it should be

944
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,070
understand consciousness it should be
 

945
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,780
understand consciousness it should be
wrong so the computation the flow the

946
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:46,790
wrong so the computation the flow the
 

947
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:49,950
wrong so the computation the flow the
processing manipulation of information

948
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:49,960

949
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,930

the the process is where the

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:52,940
the the process is where the

patterns of information processing at
 

959
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
patterns of information processing at
least in the in the hardware which we

least in the in the hardware which we
 

961
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:06,100
least in the in the hardware which we
could view as as software it may not be

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,110
could view as as software it may not be
 

963
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,260
could view as as software it may not be
some of you just like program and load

964
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:08,270
some of you just like program and load
 

965
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:11,260
some of you just like program and load
and erase and so on and the way we can

966
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,270
and erase and so on and the way we can
 

967
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:13,180
and erase and so on and the way we can
with ordinary software but it's

968
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,190
with ordinary software but it's
 

969
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,530
with ordinary software but it's
something at the level of information

970
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:14,540
something at the level of information
 

971
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,300
something at the level of information
processing rather than have a level of

processing rather than have a level of
 

973
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:19,600
processing rather than have a level of
implementation so on that what do you

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:19,610
implementation so on that what do you
 

975
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,780
implementation so on that what do you
think of the experience of self just the

976
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:22,790
think of the experience of self just the
 

977
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:25,240
think of the experience of self just the
experience of the world in a virtual

00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,250
experience of the world in a virtual
 

979
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,570
experience of the world in a virtual
world in virtual reality is it possible

980
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:28,580
world in virtual reality is it possible
 

981
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:34,390
world in virtual reality is it possible
that we can create sort of offsprings of

982
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,400
that we can create sort of offsprings of
 

983
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,910
that we can create sort of offsprings of
our consciousness by existing in a

our consciousness by existing in a
 

985
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,990
our consciousness by existing in a
virtual world long enough so yeah ok can

00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:41,000
virtual world long enough so yeah ok can
 

987
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,560

these are in these virtual worlds that

00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,730
of AI and then non-player characters to

make them to make them them smarter but

00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:42,460
make them to make them them smarter but
for now inside virtual world the actual

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:42,470
for now inside virtual world the actual

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:45,490
for now inside virtual world the actual
thinking is interestingly distinct from

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:45,500
thinking is interestingly distinct from
 

1041
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,350
thinking is interestingly distinct from
the physics of those virtual worlds in a

1042
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
the physics of those virtual worlds in a
 

1043
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,640
the physics of those virtual worlds in a
way actually I like to think this is

1044
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:48,650
way actually I like to think this is
 

1045
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,870
way actually I like to think this is
kind of reminiscent of the way that

1046
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:49,880
kind of reminiscent of the way that
 

1047
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,520
kind of reminiscent of the way that
Descartes thought our physical world was

1048
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:51,530
Descartes thought our physical world was
 

1049
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:54,220
Descartes thought our physical world was
there's physics and there's the mind and

1050
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,230
there's physics and there's the mind and
 

1051
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:56,170
there's physics and there's the mind and
they're separate now we now we think the

1052
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:56,180
they're separate now we now we think the
 

1053
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,960
they're separate now we now we think the
mind is somehow somehow connected to

1054
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:58,970
mind is somehow somehow connected to
 

1055
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,250
mind is somehow somehow connected to
physics pretty deeply but in these

1056
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:00,260
physics pretty deeply but in these
 

1057
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,870
physics pretty deeply but in these
virtual worlds there's a physics of a

1058
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:01,880
virtual worlds there's a physics of a
 

1059
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,580
virtual worlds there's a physics of a
virtual world and then there's this

1060
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:03,590
virtual world and then there's this
 

1061
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:05,170
virtual world and then there's this
brain which is totally outside the

1062
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,180
brain which is totally outside the
 

1063
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,790
brain which is totally outside the
virtual world that controls it and

exercises agency in a video game and you

1068
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:11,480
exercises agency in a video game and you
 

1069
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,520
exercises agency in a video game and you
know that's actually somebody outside

1070
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:12,530
know that's actually somebody outside

00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,610
know that's actually somebody outside

inside the virtual world so right now in

1076
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:19,040
inside the virtual world so right now in
 

1077
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,280
inside the virtual world so right now in
virtual worlds the mind is somehow

1078
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,290
virtual worlds the mind is somehow
 

1079
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,870
virtual worlds the mind is somehow
outside the world but you could imagine

1080
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
outside the world but you could imagine
 

1081
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,440
outside the world but you could imagine
in the future once we get once we have

1082
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:26,450
in the future once we get once we have
 

1083
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:29,650
in the future once we get once we have
developed serious AI artificial general

1084
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:29,660
developed serious AI artificial general
 

1085
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,350
developed serious AI artificial general
intelligence and so on then we could

1086
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:32,360
intelligence and so on then we could
 

1087
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,930
intelligence and so on then we could
come to virtual worlds which have enough

1088
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:34,940
come to virtual worlds which have enough
 

1089
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,220
come to virtual worlds which have enough
sophistication you could actually

1090
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:36,230
sophistication you could actually
 

1091
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,780
sophistication you could actually
simulate a brain or have a genuine AGI

1092
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:40,790
simulate a brain or have a genuine AGI
 

1093
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,300
simulate a brain or have a genuine AGI
which were then presumably be able to

1094
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:43,310
which were then presumably be able to
 

1095
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,000
which were then presumably be able to
act in equally sophisticated ways maybe

1096
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,010
act in equally sophisticated ways maybe
 

1097
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,340
act in equally sophisticated ways maybe
even more sophisticated ways inside the

1098
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,350
even more sophisticated ways inside the
 

1099
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:50,890
even more sophisticated ways inside the
virtual world to how it might in the

1100
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:50,900
virtual world to how it might in the
 

1101
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,360
virtual world to how it might in the
physical world and then the question is

1102
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:52,370
physical world and then the question is
 

1103
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:53,800
physical world and then the question is
going to come along that would be kind

1104
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:53,810
going to come along that would be kind
 

1105
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,930
going to come along that would be kind
of a VR into a virtual world internal

1106
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:57,940
of a VR into a virtual world internal
 

1107
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,280
of a VR into a virtual world internal
intelligence and then the question is

1108
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,290
intelligence and then the question is
 

1109
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:02,250
intelligence and then the question is
could they have consciousness experience

1110
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:02,260
could they have consciousness experience
 

1111
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,960
could they have consciousness experience
intelligence free will yes all the

1112
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:04,970
intelligence free will yes all the
 

1113
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,940
intelligence free will yes all the
things that we have and again my view is

1114
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:06,950
things that we have and again my view is
 

1115
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,260
things that we have and again my view is
I don't see why not

1116
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:08,270
I don't see why not
 

1117
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:10,649
I don't see why not
to linger in a little bit

1118
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:10,659
to linger in a little bit
 

1119
00:22:10,659 --> 00:22:13,830
to linger in a little bit
I find virtual reality really incredibly

1120
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:13,840
I find virtual reality really incredibly
 

1121
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,570
I find virtual reality really incredibly

so that degree of emotion absolutely but
we still have the capacity to remember

00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:19,500
we still have the capacity to remember

00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,680
we still have the capacity to remember
it to completely forget the external

it to completely forget the external
 

1265
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,790
it to completely forget the external
world I'm thinking that would probably

1266
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:22,800
world I'm thinking that would probably

serious drugs or something to make your
 

1271
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:27,710
serious drugs or something to make your

s but it's to make your brain do that
 

1273
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,770
s but it's to make your brain do that
possible so I mean I guess I'm getting

1274
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:30,780
possible so I mean I guess I'm getting
 

1275
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,240
possible so I mean I guess I'm getting
at is consciousness a truly a property

1345
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,460

different histories and then you know
 

1347
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:00,680

you just put yourself into 10 different

00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,090

it's fundamentally you see it as a

it's fundamentally you see it as a
 

1369
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,260
it's fundamentally you see it as a

1373
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,810

which are not it's still connected to

1379
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,930

joint conscious system yeah or at least

1380
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:38,940
joint conscious system yeah or at least
 

1381
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,240

color Senna famously synesthete so we're

this is funny um I didn't paint much

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:02,250
this is funny um I didn't paint much

this is funny um I didn't paint much
attention to this at the time but I've

1400
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:04,230
attention to this at the time but I've
 

1401
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,810
attention to this at the time but I've
listened to a piece of music and I'd get

1402
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:05,820
listened to a piece of music and I'd get
 

1403
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,070
listened to a piece of music and I'd get
some kind of imagery of a of a kind of a

some kind of imagery of a of a kind of a

they were okay murky dark greens and

1408
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:17,280
they were okay murky dark greens and
 

1409
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,020
they were okay murky dark greens and
olive browns and the colors went all

1410
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:21,030
olive browns and the colors went all
 

1411
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,010
olive browns and the colors went all
that interesting I don't know what the

1412
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:22,020
that interesting I don't know what the
 

1413
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,140
that interesting I don't know what the
reason is I mean my theory is that maybe

1414
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,150
reason is I mean my theory is that maybe
 

1415
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,850
reason is I mean my theory is that maybe
it's like different cords and tones

1416
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:25,860
it's like different cords and tones
 

1417
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,040
it's like different cords and tones
provided different colors and the old

1418
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,050
provided different colors and the old
 

1419
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,070
provided different colors and the old
tended to get mixed together into these

1420
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,080
tended to get mixed together into these
 

1421
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,050
tended to get mixed together into these
somewhat uninteresting browns and greens

1422
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:33,060
somewhat uninteresting browns and greens
 

1423
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,180
somewhat uninteresting browns and greens
but every now and then there'd be

1424
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:35,190
but every now and then there'd be
 

1425
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:37,220
but every now and then there'd be
something that had a really pure color

1426

something that had a really pure color
 

1427
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,320
something that had a really pure color
so this just a few that I did I remember

1428
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,330
so this just a few that I did I remember
 

1429
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,780
so this just a few that I did I remember
it was a here there and everywhere by

the Beatles was bright red and has this

the Beatles was bright red and has this
 

1433
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,280
the Beatles was bright red and has this

1453
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:09,799
about 20 this synesthesia often goes
away so is it purely just the perception

away so is it purely just the perception
 

1455
00:29:09,809 --> 00:29:11,869
away so is it purely just the perception
of a particular color or was there a

positive or negative experience with it
like was blue associate with a positive

1460

like was blue associate with a positive
 

1461
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,769
like was blue associate with a positive
and red with a negative or is it simply

about this phenomenon called synesthesia
 

1493
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:54,169
about this phenomenon called synesthesia
it's like hey that's what I had and now

I occasionally talk about it in my
 

1497
00:29:55,649 --> 00:29:57,739
I occasionally talk about it in my
classes in intro class and still happens

what happened what happened yeah I was
 

1513
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,830
what happened what happened yeah I was
definitely sad that it was gone in

visiting a new country and experiencing
 

1535
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,159
visiting a new country and experiencing
new environments I guess for me when I

1536
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:46,169
new environments I guess for me when I
 

1537
00:30:46,169 --> 00:30:48,320
new environments I guess for me when I
had these experiences they were somewhat

1538
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,330
had these experiences they were somewhat
 

1539
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,789
had these experiences they were somewhat
marginal they were like a little bonus

1540
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:49,799
marginal they were like a little bonus
 

1541
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,100

00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:55,249
kind of experience I know there are
people have much more serious forms of

1544
00:30:55,249 --> 00:30:55,259
people have much more serious forms of
 

1545
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:57,440
people have much more serious forms of
synesthesia than this for whom it's

1546
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,450
synesthesia than this for whom it's
 

1547
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,509
synesthesia than this for whom it's
absolutely central to their lives I know

1548
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
absolutely central to their lives I know
 

1549
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,310
absolutely central to their lives I know
people who when they experience new

1550
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,320
people who when they experience new
 

1551
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,080
people who when they experience new
people they have colors maybe they have

1552
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,090
people they have colors maybe they have

tastes
 

1555
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,260
tastes
and so on every time they see writing it

1556
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:06,270
and so on every time they see writing it
 

1557
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,870

certain really rich color pattern and

1562
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:14,580
certain really rich color pattern and
 

1563
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,039
certain really rich color pattern and
you know for some synesthetes it's

1564
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:16,049
you know for some synesthetes it's
 

1565
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,049
you know for some synesthetes it's
absolutely central I think if they lost

1566
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:18,059
absolutely central I think if they lost
 

1567
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,049
absolutely central I think if they lost
it they'd be devastated again for me it

1568
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:21,059
it they'd be devastated again for me it
 

1569
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:24,380
it they'd be devastated again for me it
was a very very mild form of synesthesia

1570
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:24,390
was a very very mild form of synesthesia
 

1571
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,909
was a very very mild form of synesthesia
it's like yeah it's like those

1572
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:25,919
it's like yeah it's like those
 

1573
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,390
it's like yeah it's like those
interesting experiences yeah you know

1574
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:29,400
interesting experiences yeah you know
 

1575
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,280
interesting experiences yeah you know
you might get under different altered

00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,290
you might get under different altered
 

1577
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,110
you might get under different altered
states of consciousness and and so on

1578
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,120
states of consciousness and and so on
 

1579
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,600
states of consciousness and and so on
it's kind of cool but you know not

1580
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:35,610
it's kind of cool but you know not
 

1581
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,520
it's kind of cool but you know not
necessarily the single most important

1582
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:37,530
necessarily the single most important
 

1583
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,180
necessarily the single most important
experiences in your life so let's try to

1584

experiences in your life so let's try to
 

1585
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:43,970
experiences in your life so let's try to
go to the very simplest question the

go to the very simplest question the
 

1587
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,470
go to the very simplest question the
events are bring you time but perhaps

1588
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:45,480

events are bring you time but perhaps
the simplest things can help us reveal

1590
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
the simplest things can help us reveal
 

1591
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,270
the simplest things can help us reveal
even in time some some new ideas so what

1592
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,280
even in time some some new ideas so what
 

1593
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,909
even in time some some new ideas so what
in your view is consciousness what is

of thinking is not obviously qualia it's
 

1665
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,729
of thinking is not obviously qualia it's
not like specific qualities like redness

not like specific qualities like redness
 

1667
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:27,169
not like specific qualities like redness
or greenness but still I'm thinking

what I'm gonna do later on maybe there's
 

1673
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,769
what I'm gonna do later on maybe there's
still something running through my my

head which is subjective experience
 

1677
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,469
head which is subjective experience
maybe it goes beyond those qualities or

1678
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:38,479
maybe it goes beyond those qualities or
 

1679
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:41,060
maybe it goes beyond those qualities or
qualia philosophers sometimes use the

00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,070
qualia philosophers sometimes use the
 

1681
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,159
qualia philosophers sometimes use the
word phenomenal consciousness for

1682
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:43,169
word phenomenal consciousness for
 

1683
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:44,899
word phenomenal consciousness for
consciousness in this sense I mean

1684
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:44,909
consciousness in this sense I mean
 

1685
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:46,789
consciousness in this sense I mean
people also talk about access

1686
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
people also talk about access
 

1687
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,049
people also talk about access
consciousness being able to access

1688
00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:48,059
consciousness being able to access
 

1689
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,899

think about yourself but it looks like
the really mysterious one the one that

1696
00:33:56,239 --> 00:33:56,249
the really mysterious one the one that
 

1697
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,310
the really mysterious one the one that
really gets people going is phenomenal

1698
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
really gets people going is phenomenal
 

1699
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,680
really gets people going is phenomenal
consciousness the fact that all this the

1700
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:00,690
consciousness the fact that all this the
 

1701
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,810
consciousness the fact that all this the
fact that the subjective experience and

1702

fact that the subjective experience and
 

1703
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,180
fact that the subjective experience and
all this feels like something at all and

1704
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:05,190
all this feels like something at all and
 

1705
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:08,480
all this feels like something at all and
then the hard problem is how is it that

1706
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:08,490
then the hard problem is how is it that
 

1707
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,279
then the hard problem is how is it that
why is it that there is phenomenal

1708
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:10,289
why is it that there is phenomenal
 

1709
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,289
why is it that there is phenomenal
consciousness at all and how is it that

1710
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:12,299
consciousness at all and how is it that
 

1711
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:15,919
consciousness at all and how is it that
physical processes in a brain could give

1712
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:15,929
physical processes in a brain could give
 

1713
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:19,940
physical processes in a brain could give
you subjective experience it looks like

1714
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:19,950
you subjective experience it looks like
 

1715
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:22,309
you subjective experience it looks like
try on the face of it you have all this

1716
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:22,319
try on the face of it you have all this
 

1717
00:34:22,319 --> 00:34:24,049
try on the face of it you have all this
big complicated physical system in a

1718
00:34:24,049 --> 00:34:24,059
big complicated physical system in a
 

1719
00:34:24,059 --> 00:34:26,839
big complicated physical system in a
brain running and without a given

1720
00:34:26,839 --> 00:34:26,849
brain running and without a given
 

1721
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:28,760
brain running and without a given
subjective experience at all and yet we

1722
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:28,770
subjective experience at all and yet we
 

1723
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,980
subjective experience at all and yet we
do have subjective experience so the

1724
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:30,990
do have subjective experience so the
 

1725
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,490
do have subjective experience so the
hard problem is just explained that

1726
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:33,500
hard problem is just explained that
 

1727
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,260
hard problem is just explained that
explain how that comes about we haven't

1728
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:36,270
explain how that comes about we haven't
 

1729
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:39,019
explain how that comes about we haven't
been able to build machines work a red

1730
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:39,029
been able to build machines work a red
 

1731
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:40,700
been able to build machines work a red
light goes on that says it's not

1732
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:40,710
light goes on that says it's not
 

1733
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:44,419
light goes on that says it's not
conscious so how does how do we actually

1734
00:34:44,419 --> 00:34:44,429
conscious so how does how do we actually
 

1735
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,419
conscious so how does how do we actually
create that or how do humans do it and

1736
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:47,429
create that or how do humans do it and
 

1737
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:49,430
create that or how do humans do it and
how do we ourselves do it we do every

1738
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:49,440
how do we ourselves do it we do every
 

1739
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,260
how do we ourselves do it we do every
now and then create machines that can do

1740
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:51,270
now and then create machines that can do
 

1741
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,629
now and then create machines that can do
this you know we create babies yes that

1742
00:34:53,629 --> 00:34:53,639
this you know we create babies yes that
 

1743
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,940
this you know we create babies yes that
our that our conscious take out these

1744
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:55,950
our that our conscious take out these
 

1745
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:57,680
our that our conscious take out these

1748
00:34:59,420 --> 00:34:59,430
consciousness but even me even though we
 

1749
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,160
consciousness but even me even though we
can't create it we still don't

1750
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,170
can't create it we still don't
 

1751
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,140
can't create it we still don't
understand when it happens maybe

1752
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,150
understand when it happens maybe
 

1753
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,460
understand when it happens maybe
eventually we'll be able to create

1754
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:04,470
eventually we'll be able to create
 

1755
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,160
eventually we'll be able to create

1761
00:35:10,799 --> 00:35:14,059

than it does with babies because we

00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:15,720
than it does with babies because we
 

1765
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,880
than it does with babies because we
still want to know how and why is it

still want to know how and why is it

00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:23,299
realize for a second maybe it's a
 

1773
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:27,230
realize for a second maybe it's a
totally dumb realization but

1774
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,240
totally dumb realization but
 

1775
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,950
totally dumb realization but
nevertheless that it's a useful way to

1776
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:30,960
nevertheless that it's a useful way to
 

1777
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,790
nevertheless that it's a useful way to
think about

1778
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:31,800
think about
 

1779
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,370
think about
the creation consciousness is looking at

1780
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:34,380
the creation consciousness is looking at
 

1781
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,540
the creation consciousness is looking at
a baby so that there's a certain point

1782
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,550
a baby so that there's a certain point
 

1783
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,280
a baby so that there's a certain point
at which that baby is not conscious

1784
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:40,290
at which that baby is not conscious
 

1785
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:45,170
at which that baby is not conscious
mm-hmm something sort of the baby starts

1786
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:45,180
mm-hmm something sort of the baby starts
 

1787
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,450
mm-hmm something sort of the baby starts
from maybe I don't I don't know from a

00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:47,460
from maybe I don't I don't know from a

from maybe I don't I don't know from a
few cells right there's a certain point

1790
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:50,370
few cells right there's a certain point
 

1791
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,400
few cells right there's a certain point
at which it becomes consciousness

1792
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:52,410
at which it becomes consciousness
 

1793
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,340
at which it becomes consciousness
arrives it's conscious of course we

1794
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,350
arrives it's conscious of course we
 

1795
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,020
arrives it's conscious of course we
can't know exactly that line but that's

1796
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:57,030
can't know exactly that line but that's
 

1797
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:59,960
can't know exactly that line but that's
a useful idea that we do we do create

1798
00:35:59,960 --> 00:35:59,970
a useful idea that we do we do create
 

1799
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,320
a useful idea that we do we do create
consciousness again a really dumb thing

1800
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:03,330
consciousness again a really dumb thing
 

1801
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,050
consciousness again a really dumb thing
for me to say but it not until now that

1802
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:06,060
for me to say but it not until now that
 

1803
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,140
for me to say but it not until now that
I realized we do engineer consciousness

1804
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,150
I realized we do engineer consciousness
 

1805
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:12,320
I realized we do engineer consciousness
we we get to watch the process happen we

1806
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:12,330
we we get to watch the process happen we
 

1807
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,440
we we get to watch the process happen we
don't know which point it happens or

1808
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:15,450
don't know which point it happens or
 

1809
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:17,720
don't know which point it happens or
where it is but you know we do see the

1810
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:17,730
where it is but you know we do see the
 

1811
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,730
where it is but you know we do see the
birth of consciousness yeah I mean

1812
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:19,740
birth of consciousness yeah I mean
 

1813
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,500
birth of consciousness yeah I mean
there's a question of course is whether

1814
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:21,510
there's a question of course is whether
 

1815
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,560
there's a question of course is whether
babies are conscious when they're born

1816
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:24,570
babies are conscious when they're born
 

1817
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:26,720
babies are conscious when they're born
and it used to be it seems at least some

1818
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:26,730
and it used to be it seems at least some
 

1819
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:28,640
and it used to be it seems at least some
people thought they weren't which is why

1820
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:28,650
people thought they weren't which is why
 

1821
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,010
people thought they weren't which is why
they didn't give anesthetics to newborn

1822
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:31,020
they didn't give anesthetics to newborn
 

1823
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,530
they didn't give anesthetics to newborn
babies when they circumcised them and so

1824
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:33,540
babies when they circumcised them and so
 

1825
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,150
babies when they circumcised them and so
now people think oh that's you know be

1826
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:35,160
now people think oh that's you know be
 

1827
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,430
now people think oh that's you know be
incredibly cruel yeah of course of

1828
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:37,440
incredibly cruel yeah of course of
 

1829
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,990
incredibly cruel yeah of course of
course babies feel pain and now the

1830
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,000
course babies feel pain and now the
 

1831
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,570
course babies feel pain and now the
dominant view is that the babies can

1832
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:41,580
dominant view is that the babies can
 

1833
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:42,830
dominant view is that the babies can
feel pain I actually my partner of

1834
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:42,840
feel pain I actually my partner of

Claudia works on this whole issue of

1836
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:45,840
Claudia works on this whole issue of
 

1837
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,990
Claudia works on this whole issue of
whether there's consciousness and babies

1838
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
whether there's consciousness and babies
 

1839
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,090
whether there's consciousness and babies
and of what kind and she certainly

1840
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:50,100
and of what kind and she certainly
 

1841
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,390
and of what kind and she certainly
thinks that newborn babies you know come

1842
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:53,400
thinks that newborn babies you know come
 

1843
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,470
thinks that newborn babies you know come
into the world with some degree of

into the world with some degree of
 

1845
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,940
into the world with some degree of
consciousness because then you could

1846
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:55,950
consciousness because then you could
 

1847
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,440
consciousness because then you could
just extend the question backwards to

just extend the question backwards to
 

1849

just extend the question backwards to

1852
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:02,970
controversial exactly territory but you
 

1853
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,210
controversial exactly territory but you
know there the question also arises in

know there the question also arises in
 

1855
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,070
know there the question also arises in
the animal kingdom you know what where

1856
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:07,080
the animal kingdom you know what where
 

1857
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,720
the animal kingdom you know what where
does consciousness start or stop is

1858
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:08,730
does consciousness start or stop is
 

1859
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,140
does consciousness start or stop is
there a line in the animal kingdom where

1860
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:12,150
there a line in the animal kingdom where
 

1861
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,030
there a line in the animal kingdom where
you know the first conscious organisms

1862
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,040
you know the first conscious organisms
 

1863
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,000
you know the first conscious organisms
aren't it's interesting over time people

people used to think maybe only mammals

1870
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:23,160
people used to think maybe only mammals
 

1871
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,340
people used to think maybe only mammals
could be conscious now most people seem

1872
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:25,350
could be conscious now most people seem
 

1873
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:27,530
could be conscious now most people seem
to think show a fish are conscious they

to think show a fish are conscious they
 

1875
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,570
to think show a fish are conscious they

00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,220
say plants have some degree of
consciousness so you know who knows

00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,230
consciousness so you know who knows
 

1883
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,540
consciousness so you know who knows
where it's gonna end the far end of this

you know I take that view I mean that's
 

1893
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,319
you know I take that view I mean that's
a fascinating way to view reality so you

1894
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:51,329
a fascinating way to view reality so you
 

1895
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:53,720
a fascinating way to view reality so you
could talk about if you can linger on

what does that mean to you how do we

1906
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:07,770
what does that mean to you how do we
 

1907
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,109
what does that mean to you how do we
supposed to think about that

1908
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
supposed to think about that
 

1909
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,270
supposed to think about that
well we're used to the idea that some

00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:11,280
well we're used to the idea that some
 

1911
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,099
well we're used to the idea that some
things in the world are fundamental

things in the world are fundamental
 

1913
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:16,010
things in the world are fundamental
right in physics like why we take things

right in physics like why we take things
 

1915
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,980
right in physics like why we take things

that was the best way to explain it so I

1950
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:00,510
that was the best way to explain it so I
 

1951
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,359
that was the best way to explain it so I
at least take seriously the possibility

1952

at least take seriously the possibility

at least take seriously the possibility
something like that could happen with

tell us how things are going to behave

1984
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:38,780
tell us how things are going to behave
 

1985
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,740
tell us how things are going to behave
what kind of observable behavior they're

1986
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:42,750
what kind of observable behavior they're
 

1987
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,329
what kind of observable behavior they're
produced which is great for the problems

of explaining how we walk and how we
 

1991
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,099

1993
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:51,020
talk and so on those are the easy
problems of consciousness but the hard

1994
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,030
problems of consciousness but the hard
 

1995
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,760
problems of consciousness but the hard
problem was this problem about

1996

problem was this problem about

1999
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,390
subjective experience just doesn't look
like that kind of problem about

2000
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
like that kind of problem about
 

2001
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,130
like that kind of problem about

so it's hard to see

2004
00:39:59,730 --> 00:39:59,740
so it's hard to see

view where you get consciousness with

view where you get consciousness with
the degree of information processing or

the degree of information processing or

00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:30,019

so he ends up with some degree of

2366
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:34,049
so he ends up with some degree of

00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:36,739
so he ends up with some degree of

consciousness now that's very
 

2377
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:46,279
consciousness now that's very
controversial I think it's very very

2378
00:47:46,279 --> 00:47:46,289
controversial I think it's very very
 

2379
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:47,420
controversial I think it's very very
early days in the science of

early days in the science of
 

2381
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,400
early days in the science of
consciousness it's interesting the it's

not just philosophy that might lead you

2384
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:51,960
not just philosophy that might lead you
 

2385
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,299
not just philosophy that might lead you
in this direction but there are ways of

2386
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:53,309
in this direction but there are ways of
 

2387
00:47:53,309 --> 00:47:55,549
in this direction but there are ways of
thinking quasi scientifically that leads

2388
00:47:55,549 --> 00:47:55,559
thinking quasi scientifically that leads
 

2389
00:47:55,559 --> 00:47:56,620
thinking quasi scientifically that leads
you there too

you there too

what do you think so Allen Watts has

2394
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:03,180
what do you think so Allen Watts has

what do you think so Allen Watts has
this quote I'd like to ask you about the

2396
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:07,049
this quote I'd like to ask you about the
 

2397
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:10,819
this quote I'd like to ask you about the
quote is through our eyes the universe

universe is listening to its harmonies

2402
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
universe is listening to its harmonies
 

2403
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,420

we are the witnesses to which the

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:17,430
we are the witnesses to which the
 

2405
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,489
we are the witnesses to which the
universe becomes conscious of his glory

2406

universe becomes conscious of his glory
 

2407
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:23,420
universe becomes conscious of his glory
of its magnificence so that's not pants

2408
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,430
of its magnificence so that's not pants
 

2409
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:26,890

psychism do you think that we are

2410
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:26,900
psychism do you think that we are

universe created to be conscious of
 

2415
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,579
universe created to be conscious of

00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:39,620

course if you went for the giant cosmic
 

2419
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:41,420
course if you went for the giant cosmic
mind view then the universe was

2420
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:41,430
mind view then the universe was
 

2421
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,819
mind view then the universe was
conscious all along it didn't need us

2422
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:43,829
conscious all along it didn't need us
 

2423
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,849
conscious all along it didn't need us
we're just little components of the

2424
00:48:45,849 --> 00:48:45,859
we're just little components of the
 

2425
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,799
we're just little components of the
universal consciousness likewise if you

2426
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:48,809
universal consciousness likewise if you
 

2427
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:50,690
universal consciousness likewise if you
believe in penstock ism

2428
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:50,700
believe in penstock ism
 

2429
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,250
believe in penstock ism
then there was some little degree of

2430
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:52,260
then there was some little degree of
 

2431
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,140
then there was some little degree of
consciousness at the bottom level all

2432
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,150
consciousness at the bottom level all
 

2433
00:48:54,150 --> 00:48:56,780
consciousness at the bottom level all
along and we were just more complex form

2434
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:56,790
along and we were just more complex form
 

2435
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:58,970
along and we were just more complex form
of consciousness so I think maybe the

2436
00:48:58,970 --> 00:48:58,980
of consciousness so I think maybe the
 

2437
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,120
of consciousness so I think maybe the

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:09,020
Cosmo Sarkis do you think consciousness
just exists at this at this intermediate

2444

just exists at this at this intermediate
 

2445
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,360
just exists at this at this intermediate
level and of course that's the Orthodox

2446
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:11,370
level and of course that's the Orthodox
 

2447
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,120
level and of course that's the Orthodox
view that you would say is the the

00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,130
view that you would say is the the
 

2449
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,520

psychism a rarer view I think it's

00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:20,550
psychism a rarer view I think it's
 

2453
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:22,570
psychism a rarer view I think it's
generally regarded certainly as a

are not pants artists there's been a bit

2464
00:49:35,030 --> 00:49:35,040
are not pants artists there's been a bit
 

2465
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,500
are not pants artists there's been a bit
of a movement in that direction the last

2466
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:36,510
of a movement in that direction the last
 

2467
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:38,480
of a movement in that direction the last
10 years or so it seems to be quite

2468
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:38,490
10 years or so it seems to be quite
 

2469
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,850
10 years or so it seems to be quite
popular especially among the younger

2470
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:40,860
popular especially among the younger
 

2471
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,020
popular especially among the younger
generation but it's still very

2472
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,030
generation but it's still very
 

2473
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:44,420
generation but it's still very
definitely a minority view many people

2474
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:44,430
definitely a minority view many people
 

2475
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:47,300
definitely a minority view many people
think is totally batshit crazy to use

2476
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:47,310

so the Orthodox view I think is still

2480
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:52,740
so the Orthodox view I think is still
 

2481
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,680
so the Orthodox view I think is still
consciousness is something that humans

2482
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:54,690
consciousness is something that humans
 

2483
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,620
consciousness is something that humans
have and some good number of non-human

2484
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:57,630
have and some good number of non-human
 

2485
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,380
have and some good number of non-human
animals have and maybe a eyes might have

2486
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:00,390
animals have and maybe a eyes might have
 

2487
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,230
animals have and maybe a eyes might have
one day but it's restricted on that view

2488
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:03,240
one day but it's restricted on that view
 

2489
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,580
one day but it's restricted on that view
then there was no consciousness at the

2490
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:04,590
then there was no consciousness at the
 

2491
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,530
then there was no consciousness at the
start of universe there may be none at

2492
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:06,540
start of universe there may be none at
 

2493
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,030
start of universe there may be none at
the end but it is this thing which

2494
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:08,040
the end but it is this thing which
 

2495
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:10,460
the end but it is this thing which
happened at some point in the history of

2496
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:10,470
happened at some point in the history of
 

2497
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:12,970
happened at some point in the history of
the universe consciousness developed and

2498
00:50:12,970 --> 00:50:12,980
the universe consciousness developed and
 

2499
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,310
the universe consciousness developed and
yes it's on that's a very amazing event

2500
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:16,320
yes it's on that's a very amazing event
 

2501
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,890
yes it's on that's a very amazing event
on this view because many people are

2502
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:18,900
on this view because many people are
 

2503
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,570
on this view because many people are
inclined to think consciousness is what

2504
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:20,580
inclined to think consciousness is what
 

2505
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:22,940
inclined to think consciousness is what
somehow gives meaning to our lives

2506
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:22,950
somehow gives meaning to our lives
 

2507
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,080
somehow gives meaning to our lives
without consciousness

2508
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,090
without consciousness
 

2509
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:27,440
without consciousness
there'd be no meaning no true value no

2510
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,450
there'd be no meaning no true value no
 

2511
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:30,110
there'd be no meaning no true value no
good versus bad and so on so with the

00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:30,120
good versus bad and so on so with the
 

2513
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,750
good versus bad and so on so with the
advent of consciousness suddenly the

2514
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:32,760
advent of consciousness suddenly the
 

2515
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,140
advent of consciousness suddenly the
universe went from meaningless to

2516
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:36,150
universe went from meaningless to
 

2517
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:39,860
universe went from meaningless to
somehow meaningful why did this happen I

2518
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:39,870
somehow meaningful why did this happen I
 

2519
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,780
somehow meaningful why did this happen I
guess the quote you mentioned was

2520
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:41,790
guess the quote you mentioned was
 

2521
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,970
guess the quote you mentioned was
somehow this was somehow destined to

2522
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:43,980
somehow this was somehow destined to
 

2523
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,520
somehow this was somehow destined to
happen because the universe needed to

2524
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:46,530
happen because the universe needed to
 

2525
00:50:46,530 --> 00:50:48,080
happen because the universe needed to
have consciousness within it to have

2526
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:48,090
have consciousness within it to have
 

2527
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:50,540
have consciousness within it to have
value and have meaning and maybe you

2528
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:50,550
value and have meaning and maybe you
 

2529
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,490
value and have meaning and maybe you
could combine that with a theistic view

2530
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:52,500
could combine that with a theistic view
 

2531
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,250
could combine that with a theistic view

00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,269
what do you think that experience is
it's so common at least throughout the

it's so common at least throughout the
 

2587
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:12,680
it's so common at least throughout the

00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:12,690
history of civilization that it seems
 

2589
00:52:12,690 --> 00:52:17,359
history of civilization that it seems
like we seek that at the very least it's

2590
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:17,369
like we seek that at the very least it's
 

2591
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:19,010
like we seek that at the very least it's
an interesting conscious experience that

2592
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:19,020
an interesting conscious experience that
 

2593
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,410
an interesting conscious experience that
people have when they experience

2594
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:20,420
people have when they experience

neuroscientists have tried to examine

2598
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:27,750
neuroscientists have tried to examine
 

2599
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,470
neuroscientists have tried to examine
what bits of the brain are active and so

2600
00:52:30,470 --> 00:52:30,480
what bits of the brain are active and so
 

2601
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,630
what bits of the brain are active and so
on but yeah that is this deeper question

2602
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,640
on but yeah that is this deeper question
 

2603
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,039
on but yeah that is this deeper question
of what is what are people looking for

2604
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:34,049
of what is what are people looking for
 

2605
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:36,980
of what is what are people looking for
when they're doing this and like I said

2606
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:36,990
when they're doing this and like I said
 

2607
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,200
when they're doing this and like I said
but no real expertise on this but it

2608
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:39,210
but no real expertise on this but it
 

2609
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,420
but no real expertise on this but it
does seem the one thing people are after

2610
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:41,430
does seem the one thing people are after
 

2611
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,150
does seem the one thing people are after
is a sense of meaning and value a sense

2612
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,160
is a sense of meaning and value a sense
 

2613
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,359
is a sense of meaning and value a sense
of connection to something greater than

2614
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:47,369
of connection to something greater than
 

2615
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:49,519
of connection to something greater than
themselves that will give their lives

2616
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:49,529
themselves that will give their lives
 

2617
00:52:49,529 --> 00:52:51,410
themselves that will give their lives
meaning and value and maybe the thought

2618
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:51,420
meaning and value and maybe the thought
 

2619
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,349
meaning and value and maybe the thought
is if there is a God and God somehow is

2620
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:54,359
is if there is a God and God somehow is
 

2621
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:56,390
is if there is a God and God somehow is
a universal consciousness who has

2622
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
a universal consciousness who has
 

2623
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,609
a universal consciousness who has
invested this universe with meaning and

2624
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:00,619
invested this universe with meaning and
 

2625
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:03,440
invested this universe with meaning and
some our connection to God might give

2626
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:03,450
some our connection to God might give
 

2627
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:08,029
some our connection to God might give
your life meaning I got so I can kind of

2628
00:53:08,029 --> 00:53:08,039
your life meaning I got so I can kind of
 

2629
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:09,980
your life meaning I got so I can kind of
see the see the attractions of that but

2630
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:09,990
see the see the attractions of that but
 

2631
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,500
see the see the attractions of that but
it still makes me wonder why is it

2632
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:12,510
it still makes me wonder why is it
 

2633
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,269
it still makes me wonder why is it
exactly that a universal consciousness

2634
00:53:14,269 --> 00:53:14,279
exactly that a universal consciousness
 

2635
00:53:14,279 --> 00:53:17,120
exactly that a universal consciousness
you know God would be needed to give the

2636
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:17,130
you know God would be needed to give the
 

2637
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,260
you know God would be needed to give the
lot to give the world

2638
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:18,270
lot to give the world
 

2639
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:20,420
lot to give the world
if I mean if universal consciousness can

2640
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:20,430
if I mean if universal consciousness can
 

2641
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,410
if I mean if universal consciousness can
give the world meaning

2642
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:21,420
give the world meaning
 

2643
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:23,900
give the world meaning
why can't local consciousness give the

2644
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:23,910
why can't local consciousness give the
 

2645
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,820
why can't local consciousness give the
world meaning to so I think my

2646
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:25,830
world meaning to so I think my
 

2647
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:27,950
world meaning to so I think my
consciousness gives my world is the

2648
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:27,960
consciousness gives my world is the
 

2649
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,380
consciousness gives my world is the
meaning is the origin of meaning vary

2650
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:30,390
meaning is the origin of meaning vary
 

2651
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:32,420
meaning is the origin of meaning vary
your world yeah I experience things as

2652
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:32,430
your world yeah I experience things as
 

2653
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:36,500
your world yeah I experience things as
good or bad happy sad interesting

2654
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:36,510
good or bad happy sad interesting
 

2655
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:38,990
good or bad happy sad interesting
important so my consciousness invests

2656
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,000
important so my consciousness invests
 

2657
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,970
important so my consciousness invests
this world with meaning without any

2658
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:40,980
this world with meaning without any
 

2659
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,090
this world with meaning without any
consciousness maybe it would be a bleak

2660
00:53:43,090 --> 00:53:43,100
consciousness maybe it would be a bleak
 

2661
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:45,859
consciousness maybe it would be a bleak
meaningless universe but I don't see why

2662
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:45,869
meaningless universe but I don't see why
 

2663
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:47,750
meaningless universe but I don't see why
I need someone else's consciousness or

2664
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:47,760
I need someone else's consciousness or
 

2665
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,090
I need someone else's consciousness or
even God's consciousness to give this

2666
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:50,100
even God's consciousness to give this
 

2667
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,640
even God's consciousness to give this
this universe meaning here we are local

2668
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:52,650
this universe meaning here we are local
 

2669
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,140
this universe meaning here we are local
creatures with our own subjective

2670
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:54,150
creatures with our own subjective
 

2671
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,690
creatures with our own subjective
experiences I think we can give the

2672
00:53:56,690 --> 00:53:56,700
experiences I think we can give the
 

2673
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,120
experiences I think we can give the
universe meaning ourselves so I mean

2674
00:53:59,120 --> 00:53:59,130
universe meaning ourselves so I mean
 

2675
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:00,200
universe meaning ourselves so I mean
maybe just some people that feels

2676
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:00,210
maybe just some people that feels
 

2677
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,910
maybe just some people that feels
inadequate yeah

2678
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
inadequate yeah
 

2679
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,770
inadequate yeah
our own local consciousness is somehow

2680
00:54:03,770 --> 00:54:03,780
our own local consciousness is somehow
 

2681
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,890
our own local consciousness is somehow
too puny and insignificant to invest any

2682
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:06,900
too puny and insignificant to invest any
 

2683
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:09,440
too puny and insignificant to invest any
of this with cosmic significance and

2684
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:09,450
of this with cosmic significance and
 

2685
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,840
of this with cosmic significance and
maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic

2686
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:11,850
maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic
 

2687
00:54:11,850 --> 00:54:14,510
maybe God gives you a sense of cosmic
significance but I'm just speculating

2688
00:54:14,510 --> 00:54:14,520
significance but I'm just speculating
 

2689
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:18,560
significance but I'm just speculating
here so the you know it's a really

2690
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:18,570
here so the you know it's a really
 

2691
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,510
here so the you know it's a really
interesting idea that consciousness is

2692
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:20,520
interesting idea that consciousness is
 

2693
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:24,710
interesting idea that consciousness is
the thing that makes life meaningful if

2694
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:24,720
the thing that makes life meaningful if
 

2695
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,420
the thing that makes life meaningful if
you could maybe just just briefly

2696
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:28,430
you could maybe just just briefly
 

2697
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:31,400
you could maybe just just briefly
explore that for a second so I suspect

2698
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:31,410
explore that for a second so I suspect
 

2699
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:34,099
explore that for a second so I suspect
just from listening to you know you mean

2700
00:54:34,099 --> 00:54:34,109
just from listening to you know you mean
 

2701
00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:37,849
just from listening to you know you mean
in an almost trivial sense just the

2702
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:37,859
in an almost trivial sense just the
 

2703
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,780
in an almost trivial sense just the
day-to-day experiences of life have

2704
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:41,790
day-to-day experiences of life have
 

2705
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:45,770
day-to-day experiences of life have
because of you attached identity to it

2706
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780
because of you attached identity to it
 

2707
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,640
because of you attached identity to it
mm-hmm

2708
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:46,650
mm-hmm
 

2709
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:53,410
mm-hmm
they become oh I guess I want to ask

2710
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:53,420
they become oh I guess I want to ask
 

2711
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,630
they become oh I guess I want to ask
something I I would always wanted to ask

2712
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:56,640
something I I would always wanted to ask
 

2713
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,400
something I I would always wanted to ask

philosopher what is the meaning of life

2716
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:04,340
philosopher what is the meaning of life
 

2717
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,560
philosopher what is the meaning of life
but I suspect you don't mean

2718
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:06,570
but I suspect you don't mean
 

2719
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,020
but I suspect you don't mean
consciousness gives any kind of greater

2720
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,030
consciousness gives any kind of greater
 

2721
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:11,840
consciousness gives any kind of greater
meaning to it all yeah and more to

2722
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:11,850
meaning to it all yeah and more to
 

2723
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,570
meaning to it all yeah and more to
day-to-day but is there greater meaning

2724
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:14,580
day-to-day but is there greater meaning
 

2725
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:18,140
day-to-day but is there greater meaning
to it all I think life has meaning for

2726
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:18,150
to it all I think life has meaning for
 

2727
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,960
to it all I think life has meaning for
us because we are conscious

2728
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:20,970
us because we are conscious
 

2729
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:23,740
us because we are conscious
so without consciousness no meaning

2730
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:23,750
so without consciousness no meaning
 

2731
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,960
so without consciousness no meaning
consciousness invests our life with

2732
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:26,970
consciousness invests our life with
 

2733
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:28,580
consciousness invests our life with
meaning so consciousness is the source

2734
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:28,590
meaning so consciousness is the source
 

2735
00:55:28,590 --> 00:55:30,980
meaning so consciousness is the source
of my view of the meaning of life but I

2736
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:30,990
of my view of the meaning of life but I
 

2737
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,150
of my view of the meaning of life but I
wouldn't say consciousness

2738
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
wouldn't say consciousness
 

2739
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,059
wouldn't say consciousness
self is the meaning of life I'd say

2740
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:35,069
self is the meaning of life I'd say
 

2741
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,460
self is the meaning of life I'd say
what's meaningful in life is basically

2742
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:37,470
what's meaningful in life is basically
 

2743
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:40,250
what's meaningful in life is basically
what we find meaningful what we

2744
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:40,260
what we find meaningful what we
 

2745
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,190
what we find meaningful what we
experience as meaningful so if you find

2746
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,200
experience as meaningful so if you find
 

2747
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,430
experience as meaningful so if you find
meaning and fulfillment and value and

2748
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:46,440
meaning and fulfillment and value and
 

2749
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,980
meaning and fulfillment and value and
say intellectual work like understanding

2750
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:48,990
say intellectual work like understanding
 

2751
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,049
say intellectual work like understanding
then that's your that's a very

2752
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:51,059
then that's your that's a very
 

2753
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,400
then that's your that's a very
significant part of the meaning of life

2754
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:52,410
significant part of the meaning of life
 

2755
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,260
significant part of the meaning of life
for you if you find it in social

2756
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:54,270
for you if you find it in social
 

2757
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:57,470
for you if you find it in social
connections or in raising a family and

2758
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,480
connections or in raising a family and
 

2759
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,059
connections or in raising a family and
that's the meaning of life for you the

2760
00:55:59,059 --> 00:55:59,069
that's the meaning of life for you the
 

2761
00:55:59,069 --> 00:56:01,099
that's the meaning of life for you the
meaning kind of comes from what you

2762
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:01,109
meaning kind of comes from what you
 

2763
00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:04,250
meaning kind of comes from what you
value as a conscious creature so I think

2764
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:04,260
value as a conscious creature so I think
 

2765
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,510
value as a conscious creature so I think
there's no you on this view there's no

2766
00:56:05,510 --> 00:56:05,520
there's no you on this view there's no
 

2767
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,510
there's no you on this view there's no

you know Universal answer to the

2770
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839
you know Universal answer to the
 

2771
00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:11,569
you know Universal answer to the
question what is the meaning of life the

2772
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:11,579
question what is the meaning of life the
 

2773
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:13,130
question what is the meaning of life the
meaning of life is where you find it as

2774
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,140
meaning of life is where you find it as
 

2775
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,809
meaning of life is where you find it as
a conscious creature but it's

2776
00:56:14,809 --> 00:56:14,819
a conscious creature but it's
 

2777
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,990
a conscious creature but it's
consciousness that somehow makes value

2778
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:17,000
consciousness that somehow makes value
 

2779
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,339
consciousness that somehow makes value
possible experiencing some things as

2780
00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:19,349
possible experiencing some things as
 

2781
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,940
possible experiencing some things as
good or as bad or as meaningful

2782
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:21,950
good or as bad or as meaningful
 

2783
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:23,660
good or as bad or as meaningful
something comes from within

2784
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:23,670
something comes from within
 

2785
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:26,029
something comes from within
consciousness so you think consciousness

2786
00:56:26,029 --> 00:56:26,039
consciousness so you think consciousness
 

2787
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:29,680
consciousness so you think consciousness
is a crucial component ingredient of

2788
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:29,690
is a crucial component ingredient of
 

2789
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:32,690
is a crucial component ingredient of
having given assigning value to things I

2790
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:32,700
having given assigning value to things I
 

2791
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,510
having given assigning value to things I
mean it's kind of a fairly strong

2792
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:35,520
mean it's kind of a fairly strong
 

2793
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:36,890
mean it's kind of a fairly strong
intuition that without consciousness

2794
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:36,900
intuition that without consciousness
 

2795
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,010
intuition that without consciousness
there wouldn't really be any value if we

2796
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:40,020
there wouldn't really be any value if we
 

2797
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:42,529
there wouldn't really be any value if we
just had a purely a universe of

2798
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:42,539
just had a purely a universe of
 

2799
00:56:42,539 --> 00:56:45,109
just had a purely a universe of
unconscious creatures would anything be

2800
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
unconscious creatures would anything be
 

2801
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,569
unconscious creatures would anything be
better or worse than anything else

2802
00:56:47,569 --> 00:56:47,579
better or worse than anything else
 

2803
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:49,059
better or worse than anything else
certainly when it comes to ethical

2804
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:49,069
certainly when it comes to ethical
 

2805
00:56:49,069 --> 00:56:50,930
certainly when it comes to ethical
dilemmas you know you know about the

2806
00:56:50,930 --> 00:56:50,940
dilemmas you know you know about the
 

2807
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,349
dilemmas you know you know about the
older the old trolley problem do you you

2808
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:54,359
older the old trolley problem do you you
 

2809
00:56:54,359 --> 00:56:56,960
older the old trolley problem do you you
kill one person or do you switch to the

2810
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:56,970
kill one person or do you switch to the
 

2811
00:56:56,970 --> 00:57:00,950
kill one person or do you switch to the
other track to kill kill Fievel I got a

2812
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:00,960
other track to kill kill Fievel I got a
 

2813
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,359
other track to kill kill Fievel I got a
variant on this their zombie trolley

2814
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:02,369
variant on this their zombie trolley
 

2815
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:04,880
variant on this their zombie trolley
problem where there's one conscious

2816
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:04,890
problem where there's one conscious
 

2817
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:08,660
problem where there's one conscious
being on on one track and five humanoid

2818
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:08,670
being on on one track and five humanoid
 

2819
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:10,700
being on on one track and five humanoid
zombies let's make them robots yeah who

2820
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:10,710
zombies let's make them robots yeah who
 

2821
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:13,880
zombies let's make them robots yeah who
are not who are not conscious on the on

2822
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:13,890
are not who are not conscious on the on
 

2823
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:16,490
are not who are not conscious on the on
the other track do you given that choice

2824
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:16,500
the other track do you given that choice
 

2825
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,109
the other track do you given that choice
you kill the one conscious being or the

2826
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:18,119
you kill the one conscious being or the
 

2827
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:21,500
you kill the one conscious being or the
five unconscious robots most people have

2828
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:21,510
five unconscious robots most people have
 

2829
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:23,480
five unconscious robots most people have
a fairly clear intuition here yeah kill

2830
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:23,490
a fairly clear intuition here yeah kill
 

2831
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:25,609
a fairly clear intuition here yeah kill
the kill the unconscious beings because

2832
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:25,619
the kill the unconscious beings because
 

2833
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,710
the kill the unconscious beings because
they basically they don't have a

2834
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:27,720
they basically they don't have a
 

2835
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,230
they basically they don't have a
meaningful life they're not really

2836
00:57:29,230 --> 00:57:29,240
meaningful life they're not really
 

2837
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,920
meaningful life they're not really
persons conscious beings of course we

2838
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:33,930
persons conscious beings of course we
 

2839
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,019
persons conscious beings of course we
don't have good intuition about

2840
00:57:38,019 --> 00:57:38,029
don't have good intuition about
 

2841
00:57:38,029 --> 00:57:42,200
don't have good intuition about
something like an unconscious being so

2842
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:42,210
something like an unconscious being so
 

2843
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:45,289
something like an unconscious being so
in philosophical terms you refer to as

2844
00:57:45,289 --> 00:57:45,299
in philosophical terms you refer to as
 

2845
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:45,799
in philosophical terms you refer to as
Azzam

2846
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:45,809
Azzam
 

2847
00:57:45,809 --> 00:57:50,239
Azzam

then I stipulate that I mean we've cost

there's this tricky question of how you

00:59:21,829 --> 00:59:21,839
there's this tricky question of how you
 

2923
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:23,719
there's this tricky question of how you
would know whether they're conscious but

2924
00:59:23,719 --> 00:59:23,729
would know whether they're conscious but
 

2925
00:59:23,729 --> 00:59:24,949
would know whether they're conscious but
let's say we've somehow solved that and

00:59:24,949 --> 00:59:24,959
let's say we've somehow solved that and
 

2927
00:59:24,959 --> 00:59:26,419
let's say we've somehow solved that and
we know that these high-functioning

2928
00:59:26,419 --> 00:59:26,429
we know that these high-functioning
 

2929
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:28,130
we know that these high-functioning
robots aren't conscious then the

2930
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:28,140
robots aren't conscious then the
 

2931
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,319
robots aren't conscious then the
question is do they have moral status

2932
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:29,329
question is do they have moral status
 

2933
00:59:29,329 --> 00:59:33,469
question is do they have moral status
does it matter how we treat them like

2934
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:33,479
does it matter how we treat them like
 

2935
00:59:33,479 --> 00:59:35,599
does it matter how we treat them like
what is moral status means does

2936
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:35,609
what is moral status means does
 

2937
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:37,809
what is moral status means does
basically society can they suffer

2938
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:37,819
basically society can they suffer
 

2939
00:59:37,819 --> 00:59:40,759
basically society can they suffer
doesn't matter how we treat them I would

2940
00:59:40,759 --> 00:59:40,769
doesn't matter how we treat them I would
 

2941
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:44,059
doesn't matter how we treat them I would
for example if we if I mistreat this

2942
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:44,069
for example if we if I mistreat this
 

2943
00:59:44,069 --> 00:59:47,599
for example if we if I mistreat this
glass this cup by uh by shattering it

then that's bad well why is it bad that

2946
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:50,369
then that's bad well why is it bad that
 

2947

then that's bad well why is it bad that

it's not bad for the cup no one would

it's not bad for the cup no one would
 

2953
00:59:56,339 --> 00:59:59,480
it's not bad for the cup no one would

2957
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:07,220
hey you you heard the cup and that's
that's doing it a moral harm

that's doing it a moral harm

the movie her Samantha I guess she was

2988
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:45,960
the movie her Samantha I guess she was
 

2989
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,750
the movie her Samantha I guess she was
kind of presented as conscious and then

2990
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:47,760
kind of presented as conscious and then
 

2991
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,880
kind of presented as conscious and then
if you if you destroyed her you'd

2992
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:49,890
if you if you destroyed her you'd
 

2993
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,590
if you if you destroyed her you'd
certainly be committing a serious harm

so I think how strong senses if a being

2996
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:54,450
so I think how strong senses if a being
 

2997
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,330
so I think how strong senses if a being
is conscious and can undergo subjective

2998
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:56,340
is conscious and can undergo subjective
 

2999
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:59,510
is conscious and can undergo subjective
experiences that are matters morally how

3000
01:00:59,510 --> 01:00:59,520
experiences that are matters morally how
 

3001
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,150
experiences that are matters morally how
we treat them so if a robot is conscious

3002
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
we treat them so if a robot is conscious
 

3003
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,860
we treat them so if a robot is conscious
it matters but if a robot is not

3004
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:03,870
it matters but if a robot is not
 

3005
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,380
it matters but if a robot is not
conscious then they basically just meet

3006
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:06,390
conscious then they basically just meet
 

3007
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:09,770
conscious then they basically just meet
or a machine and it and it and it

3008
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:09,780
or a machine and it and it and it
 

3009
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,720
or a machine and it and it and it
doesn't matter so I think at least maybe

3010
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:11,730
doesn't matter so I think at least maybe
 

3011
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:13,070
doesn't matter so I think at least maybe
how we think about this stuff is

3012
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,080
how we think about this stuff is
 

3013
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,140
how we think about this stuff is
fundamentally wrong but I think a lot of

3014
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:15,150
fundamentally wrong but I think a lot of
 

3015
01:01:15,150 --> 01:01:16,280
fundamentally wrong but I think a lot of
people to think about this stuff

3016
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,290
people to think about this stuff
 

3017
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,050
people to think about this stuff
seriously including people to think

3018
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:18,060
seriously including people to think
 

3019
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,580
seriously including people to think
about say the moral treatment of animals

3020
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:19,590
about say the moral treatment of animals
 

3021
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:21,800
about say the moral treatment of animals
and so on come to the view that

3022
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:21,810
and so on come to the view that
 

3023
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,410
and so on come to the view that
consciousness is ultimately kind of the

3024
01:01:24,410 --> 01:01:24,420
consciousness is ultimately kind of the
 

3025
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:27,710
consciousness is ultimately kind of the
line between systems that where we have

3026
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:27,720
line between systems that where we have
 

3027
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,770
line between systems that where we have
to take them into account in thinking

3028
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:29,780
to take them into account in thinking
 

3029
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,020
to take them into account in thinking
morally about how we act and systems for

3030
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:33,030
morally about how we act and systems for
 

3031
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:36,200
morally about how we act and systems for
which we don't and I think I've seen you

3032
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:36,210
which we don't and I think I've seen you
 

3033
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,660
which we don't and I think I've seen you
the writer talked about the

3034
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:38,670
the writer talked about the
 

3035
01:01:38,670 --> 01:01:41,000
the writer talked about the
demonstration of consciousness from a

3036
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:41,010
demonstration of consciousness from a
 

3037
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:43,580
demonstration of consciousness from a
system like that from a system like Alex

3038
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:43,590
system like that from a system like Alex
 

3039
01:01:43,590 --> 01:01:49,490
system like that from a system like Alex
or a conversational agent that is what

3040
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:49,500
or a conversational agent that is what
 

3041
01:01:49,500 --> 01:01:52,400
or a conversational agent that is what
you would be looking for it's kind of at

3042
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:52,410
you would be looking for it's kind of at
 

3043
01:01:52,410 --> 01:01:56,350
you would be looking for it's kind of at
the very basic level for the system to

3044
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:56,360
the very basic level for the system to
 

3045
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,970
the very basic level for the system to
have an awareness that I'm just a

3046
01:01:58,970 --> 01:01:58,980
have an awareness that I'm just a
 

3047
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,160
have an awareness that I'm just a
program and yet why do I experience this

3048
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:03,170
program and yet why do I experience this
 

3049
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:06,320
program and yet why do I experience this
or not to have that experience but to

3050
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:06,330
or not to have that experience but to
 

3051
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,420
or not to have that experience but to
communicate that to you so that's what

3052
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:08,430
communicate that to you so that's what
 

3053
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:11,360
communicate that to you so that's what
us humans would sound like if you all of

3054
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:11,370
us humans would sound like if you all of
 

3055
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,009
us humans would sound like if you all of
a sudden woke up one day

3056
01:02:13,009 --> 01:02:13,019
a sudden woke up one day
 

3057
01:02:13,019 --> 01:02:15,199
a sudden woke up one day
like Kafka right in the body of a bug or

3058
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:15,209
like Kafka right in the body of a bug or
 

3059
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,479
like Kafka right in the body of a bug or
something but in a computer you all

3060
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:17,489
something but in a computer you all
 

3061
01:02:17,489 --> 01:02:19,370
something but in a computer you all
sudden realize you don't have a body and

3062
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:19,380
sudden realize you don't have a body and
 

3063
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:22,039
sudden realize you don't have a body and
yet you would feel what you're feeling

3064
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:22,049
yet you would feel what you're feeling
 

3065
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:24,499
yet you would feel what you're feeling
you would probably say those kinds of

3066
01:02:24,499 --> 01:02:24,509
you would probably say those kinds of
 

3067
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:25,459
you would probably say those kinds of
things mm-hmm

3068
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:25,469
things mm-hmm
 

3069
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:27,649
things mm-hmm
so do you think a system essentially

3070
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:27,659
so do you think a system essentially
 

3071
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:32,120
so do you think a system essentially
becomes conscious by convincing us that

3072
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:32,130
becomes conscious by convincing us that
 

3073
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,919
becomes conscious by convincing us that
it's conscious hmm

3074
01:02:33,919 --> 01:02:33,929
it's conscious hmm
 

3075
01:02:33,929 --> 01:02:35,689
it's conscious hmm
through the words that I just mentioned

3076
01:02:35,689 --> 01:02:35,699
through the words that I just mentioned
 

3077
01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:40,809
through the words that I just mentioned
so by being confused about the fact that

3078
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:40,819
so by being confused about the fact that
 

3079
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:44,809
so by being confused about the fact that
why am I having these experiences well

3080
01:02:44,809 --> 01:02:44,819
why am I having these experiences well
 

3081
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:46,399
why am I having these experiences well
so basically I don't think this is what

3082
01:02:46,399 --> 01:02:46,409
so basically I don't think this is what
 

3083
01:02:46,409 --> 01:02:48,499
so basically I don't think this is what
makes your conscious but I do think

3084
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:48,509
makes your conscious but I do think
 

3085
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:50,359
makes your conscious but I do think
being puzzled about consciousness is a

3086
01:02:50,359 --> 01:02:50,369
being puzzled about consciousness is a
 

3087
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:52,819
being puzzled about consciousness is a
very good sign that a system is

3088
01:02:52,819 --> 01:02:52,829
very good sign that a system is
 

3089
01:02:52,829 --> 01:02:54,729
very good sign that a system is
conscious so if I encountered a robot

3090
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:54,739
conscious so if I encountered a robot
 

3091
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,929
conscious so if I encountered a robot
that actually seemed to be genuinely

3092
01:02:56,929 --> 01:02:56,939
that actually seemed to be genuinely
 

3093
01:02:56,939 --> 01:03:00,739
that actually seemed to be genuinely
puzzled by its own mental states and

3094
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:00,749
puzzled by its own mental states and
 

3095
01:03:00,749 --> 01:03:02,870
puzzled by its own mental states and
saying yeah I have all these weird

3096
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
saying yeah I have all these weird
 

3097
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,509
saying yeah I have all these weird
experiences and I don't see how to

3098
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:05,519
experiences and I don't see how to
 

3099
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,579
experiences and I don't see how to
explain them I know I'm a just a set of

3100
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:07,589
explain them I know I'm a just a set of
 

3101
01:03:07,589 --> 01:03:09,979
explain them I know I'm a just a set of
silicon circuits but I don't see how

3102
01:03:09,979 --> 01:03:09,989
silicon circuits but I don't see how
 

3103
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:11,449
silicon circuits but I don't see how
that would give you my consciousness I

3104
01:03:11,449 --> 01:03:11,459
that would give you my consciousness I
 

3105
01:03:11,459 --> 01:03:12,829
that would give you my consciousness I
would at least take that as some

3106
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:12,839
would at least take that as some
 

3107
01:03:12,839 --> 01:03:15,189
would at least take that as some
evidence that there's some consciousness

3108
01:03:15,189 --> 01:03:15,199
evidence that there's some consciousness
 

3109
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,299
evidence that there's some consciousness
going on there I don't think a system

3110
01:03:17,299 --> 01:03:17,309
going on there I don't think a system
 

3111
01:03:17,309 --> 01:03:20,239
going on there I don't think a system
needs to be puzzled about consciousness

3112
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:20,249
needs to be puzzled about consciousness
 

3113
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:22,819
needs to be puzzled about consciousness
to be conscious many people are puzzled

3114
01:03:22,819 --> 01:03:22,829
to be conscious many people are puzzled
 

3115
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:25,189
to be conscious many people are puzzled
by their consciousness animals don't

3116
01:03:25,189 --> 01:03:25,199
by their consciousness animals don't
 

3117
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:26,809
by their consciousness animals don't
seem to be puzzled at all I still think

3118
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:26,819
seem to be puzzled at all I still think
 

3119
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:28,579
seem to be puzzled at all I still think
they're conscious but I think that's a

3120
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:28,589
they're conscious but I think that's a
 

3121
01:03:28,589 --> 01:03:30,889
they're conscious but I think that's a
requirement on consciousness but I do

3122
01:03:30,889 --> 01:03:30,899
requirement on consciousness but I do
 

3123
01:03:30,899 --> 01:03:33,589
requirement on consciousness but I do
think if we're looking for signs for

3124
01:03:33,589 --> 01:03:33,599
think if we're looking for signs for
 

3125
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,219
think if we're looking for signs for
consciousness say in AI systems one of

3126
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:37,229
consciousness say in AI systems one of
 

3127
01:03:37,229 --> 01:03:39,319
consciousness say in AI systems one of
the things will help convince me that an

3128
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:39,329
the things will help convince me that an
 

3129
01:03:39,329 --> 01:03:41,870
the things will help convince me that an
AI system is consciousness if it shows

3130
01:03:41,870 --> 01:03:41,880
AI system is consciousness if it shows
 

3131
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:45,019
AI system is consciousness if it shows
signs of it if it shows signs of

3132
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:45,029
signs of it if it shows signs of
 

3133
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,639
signs of it if it shows signs of
introspectively recognizing something

3134
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:46,649
introspectively recognizing something
 

3135
01:03:46,649 --> 01:03:49,809
introspectively recognizing something
like consciousness and finding this

3136
01:03:49,809 --> 01:03:49,819
like consciousness and finding this
 

3137
01:03:49,819 --> 01:03:51,589
like consciousness and finding this
philosophically puzzling and the way

3138
01:03:51,589 --> 01:03:51,599
philosophically puzzling and the way
 

3139
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,379
philosophically puzzling and the way
that the way that that we do the

3140
01:03:54,379 --> 01:03:54,389
that the way that that we do the
 

3141
01:03:54,389 --> 01:03:55,879
that the way that that we do the
incision interesting thought though

3142
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:55,889
incision interesting thought though
 

3143
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:57,979
incision interesting thought though
because a lot of people sort of would at

3144
01:03:57,979 --> 01:03:57,989
because a lot of people sort of would at
 

3145
01:03:57,989 --> 01:04:00,079
because a lot of people sort of would at
the shower level criticize the Turing

3146
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:00,089
the shower level criticize the Turing
 

3147
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:03,669
the shower level criticize the Turing
test for language that it's essentially

3148
01:04:03,669 --> 01:04:03,679
test for language that it's essentially
 

3149
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:08,059
test for language that it's essentially
what I heard like Dan Dennett criticized

3150
01:04:08,059 --> 01:04:08,069
what I heard like Dan Dennett criticized
 

3151
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:10,339
what I heard like Dan Dennett criticized
it in this kind of way which is it's

3152
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:10,349
it in this kind of way which is it's
 

3153
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:12,679
it in this kind of way which is it's
really puts a lot of emphasis on lying

3154
01:04:12,679 --> 01:04:12,689
really puts a lot of emphasis on lying
 

3155
01:04:12,689 --> 01:04:16,399
really puts a lot of emphasis on lying
yeah and being able to being able to

3156
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:16,409
yeah and being able to being able to
 

3157
01:04:16,409 --> 01:04:18,620
yeah and being able to being able to
imitate human beings yeah there's this a

3158
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:18,630
imitate human beings yeah there's this a
 

3159
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:21,379
imitate human beings yeah there's this a
there's this cartoon of the AI system

3160
01:04:21,379 --> 01:04:21,389
there's this cartoon of the AI system
 

3161
01:04:21,389 --> 01:04:23,509
there's this cartoon of the AI system
studying for the Turing test it's gotta

3162
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:23,519
studying for the Turing test it's gotta
 

3163
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:26,620
studying for the Turing test it's gotta
be this book called talk like a human

3164
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:26,630
be this book called talk like a human
 

3165
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,059
be this book called talk like a human
like man I don't have to waste my time

3166
01:04:28,059 --> 01:04:28,069
like man I don't have to waste my time
 

3167
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:30,190
like man I don't have to waste my time
learning how to imitate humans

3168
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:30,200
learning how to imitate humans
 

3169
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:31,779
learning how to imitate humans
maybe the AI system is gonna be way

3170
01:04:31,779 --> 01:04:31,789
maybe the AI system is gonna be way
 

3171
01:04:31,789 --> 01:04:33,279
maybe the AI system is gonna be way
beyond the hard problem of consciousness

3172
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:33,289
beyond the hard problem of consciousness
 

3173
01:04:33,289 --> 01:04:35,049
beyond the hard problem of consciousness
and it's gotta be this thing why do I

3174
01:04:35,049 --> 01:04:35,059
and it's gotta be this thing why do I
 

3175
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:36,519
and it's gotta be this thing why do I
need to waste my time pretending that I

3176
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:36,529
need to waste my time pretending that I
 

3177
01:04:36,529 --> 01:04:37,720
need to waste my time pretending that I
recognize the hard problem of

3178
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:37,730
recognize the hard problem of
 

3179
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:40,749
recognize the hard problem of
consciousness - in order for people to

3180
01:04:40,749 --> 01:04:40,759
consciousness - in order for people to
 

3181
01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:42,819
consciousness - in order for people to
recognize me as conscious yeah it just

3182
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:42,829
recognize me as conscious yeah it just
 

3183
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:45,190
recognize me as conscious yeah it just
feels like I guess the question is do

3184
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:45,200
feels like I guess the question is do
 

3185
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,829
feels like I guess the question is do
you think there's a we can never really

3186
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:47,839
you think there's a we can never really
 

3187
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:49,720
you think there's a we can never really
create a test for consciousness because

3188
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:49,730
create a test for consciousness because
 

3189
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,140
create a test for consciousness because
it feels like we're very human centric

3190
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:53,150
it feels like we're very human centric
 

3191
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:55,900
it feels like we're very human centric
and so the only way we would be

3192
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:55,910
and so the only way we would be
 

3193
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:58,329
and so the only way we would be
convinced that something is

3194
01:04:58,329 --> 01:04:58,339
convinced that something is
 

3195
01:04:58,339 --> 01:05:01,769
convinced that something is
consciousness but is basically the thing

3196
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:01,779
consciousness but is basically the thing
 

3197
01:05:01,779 --> 01:05:04,509
consciousness but is basically the thing
demonstrates the illusion of

3198
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:04,519
demonstrates the illusion of
 

3199
01:05:04,519 --> 01:05:07,329
demonstrates the illusion of
consciousness that we can never really

3200
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:07,339
consciousness that we can never really
 

3201
01:05:07,339 --> 01:05:10,420
consciousness that we can never really
know whether it's conscious or not and

3202
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:10,430
know whether it's conscious or not and
 

3203
01:05:10,430 --> 01:05:13,390
know whether it's conscious or not and
in fact that almost feels like it

3204
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:13,400
in fact that almost feels like it
 

3205
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,400
in fact that almost feels like it
doesn't matter them or does it still

3206
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:15,410
doesn't matter them or does it still
 

3207
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:17,380
doesn't matter them or does it still
matter to you that something is

3208
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:17,390
matter to you that something is
 

3209
01:05:17,390 --> 01:05:19,420
matter to you that something is
conscious or it demonstrates

3210
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:19,430
conscious or it demonstrates
 

3211
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:21,490
conscious or it demonstrates
consciousness you still see that

3212
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:21,500
consciousness you still see that
 

3213
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,829
consciousness you still see that
fundamental distinction I think a lot of

3214
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:23,839
fundamental distinction I think a lot of
 

3215
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,039
fundamental distinction I think a lot of
people whether our system is conscious

3216
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,049
people whether our system is conscious
 

3217
01:05:27,049 --> 01:05:28,690
people whether our system is conscious
or not matters hugely for many things

3218
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:28,700
or not matters hugely for many things
 

3219
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:31,180
or not matters hugely for many things
like how we treat it cannot suffer and

3220
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:31,190
like how we treat it cannot suffer and
 

3221
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:34,569
like how we treat it cannot suffer and
so on but still that leaves open the

3222
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:34,579
so on but still that leaves open the
 

3223
01:05:34,579 --> 01:05:37,210
so on but still that leaves open the
question how can we ever know and it's

3224
01:05:37,210 --> 01:05:37,220
question how can we ever know and it's
 

3225
01:05:37,220 --> 01:05:38,799
question how can we ever know and it's
true that it's awfully hard to see how

3226
01:05:38,799 --> 01:05:38,809
true that it's awfully hard to see how
 

3227
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:39,730
true that it's awfully hard to see how
we can know for sure

3228
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:39,740
we can know for sure
 

3229
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:42,940
we can know for sure
whether a system is conscious I suspect

3230
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:42,950
whether a system is conscious I suspect
 

3231
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:45,370
whether a system is conscious I suspect
that sociologically the thing that's

3232
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:45,380
that sociologically the thing that's
 

3233
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:47,130
that sociologically the thing that's
going to convince us that the system is

3234
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:47,140
going to convince us that the system is
 

3235
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:51,039
going to convince us that the system is
conscious is in part things like social

3236
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:51,049
conscious is in part things like social
 

3237
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:54,009
conscious is in part things like social
interaction conversation and so on where

3238
01:05:54,009 --> 01:05:54,019
interaction conversation and so on where
 

3239
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:56,410
interaction conversation and so on where
they seem to be conscious they talk

3240
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:56,420
they seem to be conscious they talk
 

3241
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,880
they seem to be conscious they talk
about their conscious state so I just

3242
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:57,890
about their conscious state so I just
 

3243
01:05:57,890 --> 01:05:59,769
about their conscious state so I just
talked about being happy or sad or

3244
01:05:59,769 --> 01:05:59,779
talked about being happy or sad or
 

3245
01:05:59,779 --> 01:06:01,839
talked about being happy or sad or
finding things meaningful or being in

3246
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:01,849
finding things meaningful or being in
 

3247
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:05,349
finding things meaningful or being in
pain that will tend to convince us if we

3248
01:06:05,349 --> 01:06:05,359
pain that will tend to convince us if we
 

3249
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,930
pain that will tend to convince us if we
don't the system genuinely seems to be

3250
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:07,940
don't the system genuinely seems to be
 

3251
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:09,339
don't the system genuinely seems to be
conscious we don't treat it as such

3252
01:06:09,339 --> 01:06:09,349
conscious we don't treat it as such
 

3253
01:06:09,349 --> 01:06:11,200
conscious we don't treat it as such
eventually it's gonna seem like a

3254
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:11,210
eventually it's gonna seem like a
 

3255
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,839
eventually it's gonna seem like a
strange form of racism or speciesism or

3256
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:13,849
strange form of racism or speciesism or
 

3257
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:16,359
strange form of racism or speciesism or
somehow not to acknowledge them and

3258
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:16,369
somehow not to acknowledge them and
 

3259
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:17,759
somehow not to acknowledge them and
actually we believe that by the way I

3260
01:06:17,759 --> 01:06:17,769
actually we believe that by the way I
 

3261
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:20,609
actually we believe that by the way I
believe that there is going to be

3262
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:20,619
believe that there is going to be
 

3263
01:06:20,619 --> 01:06:22,749
believe that there is going to be
something akin to the civil rights

3264
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:22,759
something akin to the civil rights
 

3265
01:06:22,759 --> 01:06:25,210
something akin to the civil rights
movement but for robots mm-hmm

3266
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:25,220
movement but for robots mm-hmm
 

3267
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,220
movement but for robots mm-hmm
I think the moment you have a Roomba say

3268
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:29,230
I think the moment you have a Roomba say
 

3269
01:06:29,230 --> 01:06:32,470
I think the moment you have a Roomba say
please don't kick me that hurts just say

3270
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:32,480
please don't kick me that hurts just say
 

3271
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,749
please don't kick me that hurts just say
it yeah I think they will fundamentally

3272
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:34,759
it yeah I think they will fundamentally
 

3273
01:06:34,759 --> 01:06:38,870
it yeah I think they will fundamentally
change the fabric

3274
01:06:38,870 --> 01:06:38,880
change the fabric
 

3275
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:40,759
change the fabric
of our society I think you're probably

3276
01:06:40,759 --> 01:06:40,769
of our society I think you're probably
 

3277
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:42,019
of our society I think you're probably
right although it's gonna be very tricky

3278
01:06:42,019 --> 01:06:42,029
right although it's gonna be very tricky
 

3279
01:06:42,029 --> 01:06:44,329
right although it's gonna be very tricky
because just say where we've got the

3280
01:06:44,329 --> 01:06:44,339
because just say where we've got the
 

3281
01:06:44,339 --> 01:06:45,859
because just say where we've got the
technology where these conscious beings

3282
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:45,869
technology where these conscious beings
 

3283
01:06:45,869 --> 01:06:48,620
technology where these conscious beings
can just be moderated and multiplied by

3284
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:48,630
can just be moderated and multiplied by
 

3285
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:52,849
can just be moderated and multiplied by
the thousands by flicking a switch so

3286
01:06:52,849 --> 01:06:52,859
the thousands by flicking a switch so
 

3287
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:55,519
the thousands by flicking a switch so
and the legal status is gonna be

3288
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:55,529
and the legal status is gonna be
 

3289
01:06:55,529 --> 01:06:56,749
and the legal status is gonna be
different but ultimately the moral

3290
01:06:56,749 --> 01:06:56,759
different but ultimately the moral
 

3291
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:59,329
different but ultimately the moral
status ought to be the same and yeah the

3292
01:06:59,329 --> 01:06:59,339
status ought to be the same and yeah the
 

3293
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:02,059
status ought to be the same and yeah the
civil rights issue is gonna be a huge

3294
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:02,069
civil rights issue is gonna be a huge
 

3295
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:06,910
civil rights issue is gonna be a huge
mess so if one day somebody clones you

3296
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:06,920
mess so if one day somebody clones you
 

3297
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:12,230
mess so if one day somebody clones you
another very real possibility in fact I

3298
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:12,240
another very real possibility in fact I
 

3299
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,289
another very real possibility in fact I
find the conversation between two copies

3300
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:15,299
find the conversation between two copies
 

3301
01:07:15,299 --> 01:07:20,529
find the conversation between two copies
of David Chalmers quite interesting

3302
01:07:20,529 --> 01:07:20,539
of David Chalmers quite interesting
 

3303
01:07:20,539 --> 01:07:25,910
of David Chalmers quite interesting
every thought he's not making any sense

3304
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
every thought he's not making any sense
 

3305
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,990
every thought he's not making any sense
so what do you think he would be

3306
01:07:29,990 --> 01:07:30,000
so what do you think he would be
 

3307
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,170
so what do you think he would be
cautious I do think he would be

3308
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:33,180
cautious I do think he would be
 

3309
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:35,660
cautious I do think he would be
conscious I do think in some sense not

3310
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:35,670
conscious I do think in some sense not
 

3311
01:07:35,670 --> 01:07:37,490
conscious I do think in some sense not
sure would be me there would be two

3312
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:37,500
sure would be me there would be two
 

3313
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,279
sure would be me there would be two
different beings at this point I think

3314
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:40,289
different beings at this point I think
 

3315
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:41,599
different beings at this point I think
they both be conscious and they both

3316
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:41,609
they both be conscious and they both
 

3317
01:07:41,609 --> 01:07:45,200
they both be conscious and they both
have many of the same mental properties

3318
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:45,210
have many of the same mental properties
 

3319
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:47,599
have many of the same mental properties
I think they both you know way have the

3320
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:47,609
I think they both you know way have the
 

3321
01:07:47,609 --> 01:07:50,509
I think they both you know way have the
same moral status it'll be wrong to hurt

3322
01:07:50,509 --> 01:07:50,519
same moral status it'll be wrong to hurt
 

3323
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:53,480
same moral status it'll be wrong to hurt
either of them or they kill them and so

3324
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:53,490
either of them or they kill them and so
 

3325
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:55,670
either of them or they kill them and so
on still there's some sense in which

3326
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:55,680
on still there's some sense in which
 

3327
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:57,950
on still there's some sense in which
probably their legal status would have

3328
01:07:57,950 --> 01:07:57,960
probably their legal status would have
 

3329
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,660
probably their legal status would have
to be different if I am the original and

3330
01:07:59,660 --> 01:07:59,670
to be different if I am the original and
 

3331
01:07:59,670 --> 01:08:02,390
to be different if I am the original and
that one's just a clone then you're

3332
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:02,400
that one's just a clone then you're
 

3333
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,890
that one's just a clone then you're
creating a clone of me presumably the

3334
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:03,900
creating a clone of me presumably the
 

3335
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,480
creating a clone of me presumably the
clone doesn't for example automatically

3336
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:05,490
clone doesn't for example automatically
 

3337
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:11,589
clone doesn't for example automatically
own the stuff that I own or you know

3338
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:11,599
own the stuff that I own or you know
 

3339
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,509
own the stuff that I own or you know
I've got a you know certain connect the

3340
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:14,519
I've got a you know certain connect the
 

3341
01:08:14,519 --> 01:08:16,070
I've got a you know certain connect the
things that the people I interact with

3342
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:16,080
things that the people I interact with
 

3343
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,220
things that the people I interact with
my family my partner and so on and I'm

3344
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:19,230
my family my partner and so on and I'm
 

3345
01:08:19,230 --> 01:08:21,260
my family my partner and so on and I'm
gonna somehow be connected to them in a

3346
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:21,270
gonna somehow be connected to them in a
 

3347
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,829
gonna somehow be connected to them in a
way in which the clone isn't so because

3348
01:08:24,829 --> 01:08:24,839
way in which the clone isn't so because
 

3349
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:27,019
way in which the clone isn't so because
you came slightly first yeah but this

3350
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:27,029
you came slightly first yeah but this
 

3351
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:32,120
you came slightly first yeah but this
alone would argue yeah they have really

3352
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:32,130
alone would argue yeah they have really
 

3353
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,010
alone would argue yeah they have really
as much of a connection they have all

3354
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:34,020
as much of a connection they have all
 

3355
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,720
as much of a connection they have all
the memories of that connection then

3356
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:35,730
the memories of that connection then
 

3357
01:08:35,730 --> 01:08:37,099
the memories of that connection then
away you might say it's kind of unfair

3358
01:08:37,099 --> 01:08:37,109
away you might say it's kind of unfair
 

3359
01:08:37,109 --> 01:08:39,200
away you might say it's kind of unfair
to discriminate against them but say

3360
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:39,210
to discriminate against them but say
 

3361
01:08:39,210 --> 01:08:40,490
to discriminate against them but say
you've got an apartment that only one

3362
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:40,500
you've got an apartment that only one
 

3363
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,979
you've got an apartment that only one
person can live in or a partner who only

3364
01:08:42,979 --> 01:08:42,989
person can live in or a partner who only
 

3365
01:08:42,989 --> 01:08:44,959
person can live in or a partner who only
one person or why she didn't leave you

3366
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:44,969
one person or why she didn't leave you
 

3367
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:47,870
one person or why she didn't leave you
that's the original it's an interesting

3368
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:47,880
that's the original it's an interesting
 

3369
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,610
that's the original it's an interesting
philosophical question but you might say

3370
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:49,620
philosophical question but you might say
 

3371
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:52,769
philosophical question but you might say
because I actually have this history

3372
01:08:52,769 --> 01:08:52,779
because I actually have this history
 

3373
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:55,860
because I actually have this history
if I am the same person there's a one

3374
01:08:55,860 --> 01:08:55,870
if I am the same person there's a one
 

3375
01:08:55,870 --> 01:08:57,870
if I am the same person there's a one
that came before and the clone is not

3376
01:08:57,870 --> 01:08:57,880
that came before and the clone is not
 

3377
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,269
that came before and the clone is not
that I have this history that the clone

3378
01:09:00,269 --> 01:09:00,279
that I have this history that the clone
 

3379
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:01,680
that I have this history that the clone
doesn't because there's also the

3380
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:01,690
doesn't because there's also the
 

3381
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:05,130
doesn't because there's also the
question isn't the clone the same person

3382
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:05,140
question isn't the clone the same person
 

3383
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,809
question isn't the clone the same person
- this is the question about personal

3384
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:06,819
- this is the question about personal
 

3385
01:09:06,819 --> 01:09:09,450
- this is the question about personal
identity if I continue and I create a

3386
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:09,460
identity if I continue and I create a
 

3387
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:11,519
identity if I continue and I create a
clone over there I want to say this one

3388
01:09:11,519 --> 01:09:11,529
clone over there I want to say this one
 

3389
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:13,920
clone over there I want to say this one
is me and this one is is someone else

3390
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:13,930
is me and this one is is someone else
 

3391
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:15,990
is me and this one is is someone else
but you could take the view that a clone

3392
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:16,000
but you could take the view that a clone
 

3393
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,809
but you could take the view that a clone
is equally me of course in a movie like

3394
01:09:18,809 --> 01:09:18,819
is equally me of course in a movie like
 

3395
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:20,460
is equally me of course in a movie like
Star Trek where they have a

3396
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:20,470
Star Trek where they have a
 

3397
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:21,749
Star Trek where they have a
teletransport it basically creates

3398
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:21,759
teletransport it basically creates
 

3399
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:23,849
teletransport it basically creates
clones all the time they treat the

3400
01:09:23,849 --> 01:09:23,859
clones all the time they treat the
 

3401
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,680
clones all the time they treat the
clones as if they're the original person

3402
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:25,690
clones as if they're the original person
 

3403
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,079
clones as if they're the original person
of course they destroy the original body

3404
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:28,089
of course they destroy the original body
 

3405
01:09:28,089 --> 01:09:30,480
of course they destroy the original body
in Star Trek Isis there's only one left

3406
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:30,490
in Star Trek Isis there's only one left
 

3407
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:32,010
in Star Trek Isis there's only one left
around and only very occasionally two

3408
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:32,020
around and only very occasionally two
 

3409
01:09:32,020 --> 01:09:33,300
around and only very occasionally two
things go wrong and you get two copies

3410
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:33,310
things go wrong and you get two copies
 

3411
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:36,809
things go wrong and you get two copies
of Captain Kirk it's somehow our legal

3412
01:09:36,809 --> 01:09:36,819
of Captain Kirk it's somehow our legal
 

3413
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,070
of Captain Kirk it's somehow our legal
system at the very least is gonna have

3414
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
system at the very least is gonna have
 

3415
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,710
system at the very least is gonna have
to sort out some of these issues and

3416
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:40,720
to sort out some of these issues and
 

3417
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,450
to sort out some of these issues and
that maybe that's what's moral and watch

3418
01:09:42,450 --> 01:09:42,460
that maybe that's what's moral and watch
 

3419
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,820
that maybe that's what's moral and watch
League what's legally acceptable are

3420
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:44,830
League what's legally acceptable are
 

3421
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:48,180
League what's legally acceptable are
gonna come apart what question would you

3422
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:48,190
gonna come apart what question would you
 

3423
01:09:48,190 --> 01:09:52,380
gonna come apart what question would you
ask a clone of yourself yeah is there

3424
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:52,390
ask a clone of yourself yeah is there
 

3425
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,320
ask a clone of yourself yeah is there
something useful II you can find out

3426
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:54,330
something useful II you can find out
 

3427
01:09:54,330 --> 01:09:58,890
something useful II you can find out
from him about the fundamentals of

3428
01:09:58,890 --> 01:09:58,900
from him about the fundamentals of
 

3429
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:03,150
from him about the fundamentals of
cautiousness even I mean kind of in

3430
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:03,160
cautiousness even I mean kind of in
 

3431
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:05,160
cautiousness even I mean kind of in
principle I know that if it's a perfect

3432
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:05,170
principle I know that if it's a perfect
 

3433
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:08,330
principle I know that if it's a perfect
clone it's gonna behave just like me so

3434
01:10:08,330 --> 01:10:08,340
clone it's gonna behave just like me so
 

3435
01:10:08,340 --> 01:10:11,340
clone it's gonna behave just like me so
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to I

3436
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:11,350
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to I
 

3437
01:10:11,350 --> 01:10:12,780
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to I
could discover whether it's a perfect

3438
01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:12,790
could discover whether it's a perfect
 

3439
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:14,490
could discover whether it's a perfect
clone by seeing whether it answers like

3440
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:14,500
clone by seeing whether it answers like
 

3441
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:17,130
clone by seeing whether it answers like
me but otherwise I know what I'm gonna

3442
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:17,140
me but otherwise I know what I'm gonna
 

3443
01:10:17,140 --> 01:10:18,990
me but otherwise I know what I'm gonna
find is being which is just like me

3444
01:10:18,990 --> 01:10:19,000
find is being which is just like me
 

3445
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,940
find is being which is just like me
except that it's just undergone this

3446
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:20,950
except that it's just undergone this
 

3447
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,610
except that it's just undergone this
great shock of discovering that it's a

3448
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:23,620
great shock of discovering that it's a
 

3449
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,710
great shock of discovering that it's a
clone so just so you woke me up tomorrow

3450
01:10:25,710 --> 01:10:25,720
clone so just so you woke me up tomorrow
 

3451
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:28,830
clone so just so you woke me up tomorrow
and said hey Dave sorry to tell you this

3452
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:28,840
and said hey Dave sorry to tell you this
 

3453
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,100
and said hey Dave sorry to tell you this
but you're actually the clone and you

3454
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:32,110
but you're actually the clone and you
 

3455
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:34,020
but you're actually the clone and you
provided be really convincing evidence

3456
01:10:34,020 --> 01:10:34,030
provided be really convincing evidence
 

3457
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:36,450
provided be really convincing evidence
should be the film of my being cloned

3458
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:36,460
should be the film of my being cloned
 

3459
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,260
should be the film of my being cloned
and then all wrapped here being here and

3460
01:10:40,260 --> 01:10:40,270
and then all wrapped here being here and
 

3461
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,180
and then all wrapped here being here and
and waking up so you proved to me I'm a

3462
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:42,190
and waking up so you proved to me I'm a
 

3463
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,380
and waking up so you proved to me I'm a
criminal yeah okay I would find that

3464
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:43,390
criminal yeah okay I would find that
 

3465
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:46,050
criminal yeah okay I would find that
shocking and who knows how I would react

3466
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:46,060
shocking and who knows how I would react
 

3467
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:48,360
shocking and who knows how I would react
to this so so maybe by talking to the

3468
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:48,370
to this so so maybe by talking to the
 

3469
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,620
to this so so maybe by talking to the
clone I'd find something about my own

3470
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:49,630
clone I'd find something about my own
 

3471
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,260
clone I'd find something about my own
psychology but I can't find out so

3472
01:10:52,260 --> 01:10:52,270
psychology but I can't find out so
 

3473
01:10:52,270 --> 01:10:53,730
psychology but I can't find out so
easily like how I'd react upon

3474
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:53,740
easily like how I'd react upon
 

3475
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,650
easily like how I'd react upon
discovering that I'm a clone I could

3476
01:10:55,650 --> 01:10:55,660
discovering that I'm a clone I could
 

3477
01:10:55,660 --> 01:10:56,700
discovering that I'm a clone I could
certainly ask the clone if it's

3478
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:56,710
certainly ask the clone if it's
 

3479
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,920
certainly ask the clone if it's
conscious and what his consciousness is

3480
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:58,930
conscious and what his consciousness is
 

3481
01:10:58,930 --> 01:11:00,900
conscious and what his consciousness is
like and so on but I guess I kind of

3482
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:00,910
like and so on but I guess I kind of
 

3483
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:03,030
like and so on but I guess I kind of
know if it's a perfect clone it's gonna

3484
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:03,040
know if it's a perfect clone it's gonna
 

3485
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:04,950
know if it's a perfect clone it's gonna
behave roughly like me of course at the

3486
01:11:04,950 --> 01:11:04,960
behave roughly like me of course at the
 

3487
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,629
behave roughly like me of course at the
beginning there'll be a

3488
01:11:06,629 --> 01:11:06,639
beginning there'll be a
 

3489
01:11:06,639 --> 01:11:07,830
beginning there'll be a
question about whether a perfect clone

3490
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:07,840
question about whether a perfect clone
 

3491
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:09,959
question about whether a perfect clone
is possible so I may want to ask it lots

3492
01:11:09,959 --> 01:11:09,969
is possible so I may want to ask it lots
 

3493
01:11:09,969 --> 01:11:11,699
is possible so I may want to ask it lots
of questions to see if it's

3494
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:11,709
of questions to see if it's
 

3495
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:13,109
of questions to see if it's
consciousness and the way it talks about

3496
01:11:13,109 --> 01:11:13,119
consciousness and the way it talks about
 

3497
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,689
consciousness and the way it talks about
is consciousness and the way it reacts

3498
01:11:15,689 --> 01:11:15,699
is consciousness and the way it reacts
 

3499
01:11:15,699 --> 01:11:17,850
is consciousness and the way it reacts
to things in general is like me and you

3500
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:17,860
to things in general is like me and you
 

3501
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:22,529
to things in general is like me and you
know that will occupy us for a it's a

3502
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:22,539
know that will occupy us for a it's a
 

3503
01:11:22,539 --> 01:11:24,540
know that will occupy us for a it's a
basic unit unit testing in the early

3504
01:11:24,540 --> 01:11:24,550
basic unit unit testing in the early
 

3505
01:11:24,550 --> 01:11:27,330
basic unit unit testing in the early
model yeah so you so if it's a perfect

3506
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:27,340
model yeah so you so if it's a perfect
 

3507
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:29,850
model yeah so you so if it's a perfect
clone you say there's gonna be --have

3508
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:29,860
clone you say there's gonna be --have
 

3509
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:31,500
clone you say there's gonna be --have
exactly like you so that takes us to

3510
01:11:31,500 --> 01:11:31,510
exactly like you so that takes us to
 

3511
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:36,540
exactly like you so that takes us to
freewill mmm-hmm is there a free will

3512
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:36,550
freewill mmm-hmm is there a free will
 

3513
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:39,359
freewill mmm-hmm is there a free will
are we able to make decisions that are

3514
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:39,369
are we able to make decisions that are
 

3515
01:11:39,369 --> 01:11:42,060
are we able to make decisions that are
not predetermined from the initial

3516
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:42,070
not predetermined from the initial
 

3517
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:45,060
not predetermined from the initial
conditions in the universe you know

3518
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:45,070
conditions in the universe you know
 

3519
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:46,770
conditions in the universe you know
philosophers do this annoying thing of

3520
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:46,780
philosophers do this annoying thing of
 

3521
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:49,589
philosophers do this annoying thing of
saying it depends what you mean so in

3522
01:11:49,589 --> 01:11:49,599
saying it depends what you mean so in
 

3523
01:11:49,599 --> 01:11:51,899
saying it depends what you mean so in
this case yeah really depends on what

3524
01:11:51,899 --> 01:11:51,909
this case yeah really depends on what
 

3525
01:11:51,909 --> 01:11:54,270
this case yeah really depends on what
you mean by by freewill

3526
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:54,280
you mean by by freewill
 

3527
01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:55,799
you mean by by freewill
if you mean something which was not

3528
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:55,809
if you mean something which was not
 

3529
01:11:55,809 --> 01:11:59,189
if you mean something which was not
determined in advance could never have

3530
01:11:59,189 --> 01:11:59,199
determined in advance could never have
 

3531
01:11:59,199 --> 01:12:01,560
determined in advance could never have
been determined then I don't know we

3532
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:01,570
been determined then I don't know we
 

3533
01:12:01,570 --> 01:12:02,219
been determined then I don't know we
have freewill

3534
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:02,229
have freewill
 

3535
01:12:02,229 --> 01:12:03,750
have freewill
I mean there's quantum mechanics and

3536
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:03,760
I mean there's quantum mechanics and
 

3537
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,969
I mean there's quantum mechanics and
who's to say if that opens up some room

3538
01:12:05,969 --> 01:12:05,979
who's to say if that opens up some room
 

3539
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:08,069
who's to say if that opens up some room
but I'm not sure we have freewill in

3540
01:12:08,069 --> 01:12:08,079
but I'm not sure we have freewill in
 

3541
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:10,770
but I'm not sure we have freewill in
that sense I'm also not sure that's the

3542
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:10,780
that sense I'm also not sure that's the
 

3543
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,919
that sense I'm also not sure that's the
kind of freewill that really matters you

3544
01:12:13,919 --> 01:12:13,929
kind of freewill that really matters you
 

3545
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,109
kind of freewill that really matters you
know what matters to us is being able to

3546
01:12:16,109 --> 01:12:16,119
know what matters to us is being able to
 

3547
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,500
know what matters to us is being able to
do what we want and to create our own

3548
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:18,510
do what we want and to create our own
 

3549
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:20,669
do what we want and to create our own
futures we've got this distinction

3550
01:12:20,669 --> 01:12:20,679
futures we've got this distinction
 

3551
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:21,989
futures we've got this distinction
between having our lives be under our

3552
01:12:21,989 --> 01:12:21,999
between having our lives be under our
 

3553
01:12:21,999 --> 01:12:25,250
between having our lives be under our
control and under someone else's control

3554
01:12:25,250 --> 01:12:25,260
control and under someone else's control
 

3555
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,109
control and under someone else's control
method we've got the sense of actions

3556
01:12:28,109 --> 01:12:28,119
method we've got the sense of actions
 

3557
01:12:28,119 --> 01:12:29,909
method we've got the sense of actions
that we are responsible for versus ones

3558
01:12:29,909 --> 01:12:29,919
that we are responsible for versus ones
 

3559
01:12:29,919 --> 01:12:32,069
that we are responsible for versus ones
that were not I think you can make those

3560
01:12:32,069 --> 01:12:32,079
that were not I think you can make those
 

3561
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:34,739
that were not I think you can make those
distinctions even in a deterministic

3562
01:12:34,739 --> 01:12:34,749
distinctions even in a deterministic
 

3563
01:12:34,749 --> 01:12:37,259
distinctions even in a deterministic
universe and this is what people call

3564
01:12:37,259 --> 01:12:37,269
universe and this is what people call
 

3565
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:39,060
universe and this is what people call
the compatibilist view of freewill where

3566
01:12:39,060 --> 01:12:39,070
the compatibilist view of freewill where
 

3567
01:12:39,070 --> 01:12:41,459
the compatibilist view of freewill where
it's compatible with determinism I think

3568
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:41,469
it's compatible with determinism I think
 

3569
01:12:41,469 --> 01:12:44,089
it's compatible with determinism I think
for many purposes the kind of freewill

3570
01:12:44,089 --> 01:12:44,099
for many purposes the kind of freewill
 

3571
01:12:44,099 --> 01:12:46,439
for many purposes the kind of freewill
that matters is something we can have in

3572
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:46,449
that matters is something we can have in
 

3573
01:12:46,449 --> 01:12:48,750
that matters is something we can have in
a deterministic universe and I can't see

3574
01:12:48,750 --> 01:12:48,760
a deterministic universe and I can't see
 

3575
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,239
a deterministic universe and I can't see
any reason in principle why an AI system

3576
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:51,249
any reason in principle why an AI system
 

3577
01:12:51,249 --> 01:12:52,739
any reason in principle why an AI system
couldn't have freewill

3578
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:52,749
couldn't have freewill
 

3579
01:12:52,749 --> 01:12:55,350
couldn't have freewill
of that kind if you mean super-duper

3580
01:12:55,350 --> 01:12:55,360
of that kind if you mean super-duper
 

3581
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,029
of that kind if you mean super-duper
freewill the ability to violate the laws

3582
01:12:57,029 --> 01:12:57,039
freewill the ability to violate the laws
 

3583
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,279
freewill the ability to violate the laws
of physics and doing things that

3584
01:12:59,279 --> 01:12:59,289
of physics and doing things that
 

3585
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:01,350
of physics and doing things that
imprints of all could not be predicted I

3586
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:01,360
imprints of all could not be predicted I
 

3587
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:03,299
imprints of all could not be predicted I
don't know maybe no one has that kind of

3588
01:13:03,299 --> 01:13:03,309
don't know maybe no one has that kind of
 

3589
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:06,120
don't know maybe no one has that kind of
freewill what's the connection between

3590
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:06,130
freewill what's the connection between
 

3591
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:10,529
freewill what's the connection between
the the reality of freewill and the

3592
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:10,539
the the reality of freewill and the
 

3593
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:11,969
the the reality of freewill and the
experience of it the subjective

3594
01:13:11,969 --> 01:13:11,979
experience of it the subjective
 

3595
01:13:11,979 --> 01:13:15,810
experience of it the subjective
experience in your view so how does

3596
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:15,820
experience in your view so how does
 

3597
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:18,810
experience in your view so how does
consciousness connect to this to the

3598
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:18,820
consciousness connect to this to the
 

3599
01:13:18,820 --> 01:13:19,650

01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:26,130
feels certainly true that when we make
decisions and when we choose and so on

3606
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:26,140
decisions and when we choose and so on
 

3607
01:13:26,140 --> 01:13:28,230
decisions and when we choose and so on
we feel like we have an open future yes

3608
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:28,240
we feel like we have an open future yes
 

3609
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:31,380
we feel like we have an open future yes
feel like I could do this I could go

3610
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:31,390
feel like I could do this I could go
 

3611
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:33,930
feel like I could do this I could go
into philosophy or I could go into math

3612
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:33,940
into philosophy or I could go into math
 

3613
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:36,510
into philosophy or I could go into math
I could go to a movie tonight I could go

3614
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:36,520
I could go to a movie tonight I could go
 

3615
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:40,140
I could go to a movie tonight I could go
to restaurant so we experience these

3616
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:40,150
to restaurant so we experience these
 

3617
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:42,690
to restaurant so we experience these
things as if the future is open and

3618
01:13:42,690 --> 01:13:42,700
things as if the future is open and
 

3619
01:13:42,700 --> 01:13:45,290
things as if the future is open and
maybe we experience ourselves as

3620
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,300
maybe we experience ourselves as
 

3621
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:49,740
maybe we experience ourselves as
exerting a kind of effect on the future

3622
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:49,750
exerting a kind of effect on the future
 

3623
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,780
exerting a kind of effect on the future
that somehow picking out one path from

3624
01:13:51,780 --> 01:13:51,790
that somehow picking out one path from
 

3625
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:55,080
that somehow picking out one path from
many paths were previously open and you

3626
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:55,090
many paths were previously open and you
 

3627
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:56,340
many paths were previously open and you
might think that actually if we're in a

3628
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:56,350
might think that actually if we're in a
 

3629
01:13:56,350 --> 01:13:58,500
might think that actually if we're in a
deterministic universe there's a sense

3630
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:58,510
deterministic universe there's a sense
 

3631
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:00,750
deterministic universe there's a sense
in which objectively those paths weren't

3632
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:00,760
in which objectively those paths weren't
 

3633
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:04,320
in which objectively those paths weren't
really open all along but subjectively

3634
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:04,330
really open all along but subjectively
 

3635
01:14:04,330 --> 01:14:06,390
really open all along but subjectively
they were open and that's I think that's

3636
01:14:06,390 --> 01:14:06,400
they were open and that's I think that's
 

3637
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,860
they were open and that's I think that's
what really matters in making a

3638
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:07,870
what really matters in making a
 

3639
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,750
what really matters in making a
decisions were our experience of making

3640
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:09,760
decisions were our experience of making
 

3641
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,140
decisions were our experience of making
a decision as choosing a path for for

3642
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:13,150
a decision as choosing a path for for
 

3643
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,540
a decision as choosing a path for for
ourselves I mean in general our

3644
01:14:15,540 --> 01:14:15,550
ourselves I mean in general our
 

3645
01:14:15,550 --> 01:14:18,210
ourselves I mean in general our
introspective models of the mind I think

3646
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:18,220
introspective models of the mind I think
 

3647
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,530
introspective models of the mind I think
are generally very distorted

3648
01:14:19,530 --> 01:14:19,540
are generally very distorted
 

3649
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:21,930
are generally very distorted
representations of the mind so it may

3650
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:21,940
representations of the mind so it may
 

3651
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,150
representations of the mind so it may
well be that our experience of our self

3652
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:24,160
well be that our experience of our self
 

3653
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,670
well be that our experience of our self
in making a decision experience of

3654
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:26,680
in making a decision experience of
 

3655
01:14:26,680 --> 01:14:28,500
in making a decision experience of
what's going on doesn't terribly well

3656
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:28,510
what's going on doesn't terribly well
 

3657
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:31,200
what's going on doesn't terribly well
mirror what's uh what's going on I mean

3658
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:31,210
mirror what's uh what's going on I mean
 

3659
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,550
mirror what's uh what's going on I mean
you know maybe there are antecedents in

3660
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:32,560
you know maybe there are antecedents in
 

3661
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,290
you know maybe there are antecedents in
the brain way before anything came into

3662
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:34,300
the brain way before anything came into
 

3663
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:38,670
the brain way before anything came into
consciousness and and and so on

3664
01:14:38,670 --> 01:14:38,680
consciousness and and and so on
 

3665
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,370
consciousness and and and so on
those aren't represented in our

3666
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:40,380
those aren't represented in our
 

3667
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:43,110
those aren't represented in our
introspective models so in general our

3668
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:43,120
introspective models so in general our
 

3669
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:45,060
introspective models so in general our
experience of our experience of

3670
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:45,070
experience of our experience of
 

3671
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:49,380
experience of our experience of
perception yes I experienced perceptual

3672
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:49,390
perception yes I experienced perceptual
 

3673
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:50,820
perception yes I experienced perceptual
image of the external world it's not a

3674
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:50,830
image of the external world it's not a
 

3675
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:52,200
image of the external world it's not a
terribly good model of what's actually

3676
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:52,210
terribly good model of what's actually
 

3677
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:55,020
terribly good model of what's actually
going on in the in my visual cortex and

3678
01:14:55,020 --> 01:14:55,030
going on in the in my visual cortex and
 

3679
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:56,910
going on in the in my visual cortex and
so on which has all these layers and so

3680
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:56,920
so on which has all these layers and so
 

3681
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,010
so on which has all these layers and so
on it's just one little snapshot of of

3682
01:14:59,010 --> 01:14:59,020
on it's just one little snapshot of of
 

3683
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:01,440
on it's just one little snapshot of of
one bit of that so in general yeah

3684
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:01,450
one bit of that so in general yeah
 

3685
01:15:01,450 --> 01:15:04,080
one bit of that so in general yeah
introspective models are very over

3686
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:04,090
introspective models are very over
 

3687
01:15:04,090 --> 01:15:06,080
introspective models are very over
oversimplified and it wouldn't be

3688
01:15:06,080 --> 01:15:06,090
oversimplified and it wouldn't be
 

3689
01:15:06,090 --> 01:15:08,220
oversimplified and it wouldn't be
surprising if that was true of free will

3690
01:15:08,220 --> 01:15:08,230
surprising if that was true of free will
 

3691
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:08,880
surprising if that was true of free will
as well

3692
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:08,890
as well
 

3693
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:11,070
as well
this also incidentally can be applied to

3694
01:15:11,070 --> 01:15:11,080
this also incidentally can be applied to
 

3695
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,230
this also incidentally can be applied to
consciousness itself there is this very

3696
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:13,240
consciousness itself there is this very
 

3697
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,940
consciousness itself there is this very
interesting view that consciousness

3698
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:14,950
interesting view that consciousness
 

3699
01:15:14,950 --> 01:15:16,980
interesting view that consciousness
itself is an introspective illusion in

3700
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:16,990
itself is an introspective illusion in
 

3701
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:21,000
itself is an introspective illusion in
fact we're not conscious but we but

3702
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:21,010
fact we're not conscious but we but
 

3703
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:22,890
fact we're not conscious but we but
weeks the brain just has these

3704
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:22,900
weeks the brain just has these
 

3705
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:24,420
weeks the brain just has these
introspective models of itself or

3706
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:24,430
introspective models of itself or
 

3707
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:26,760
introspective models of itself or
oversimplifies everything and represents

3708
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:26,770
oversimplifies everything and represents
 

3709
01:15:26,770 --> 01:15:27,930
oversimplifies everything and represents
itself as having these special

3710
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:27,940
itself as having these special
 

3711
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:31,290
itself as having these special
properties of consciousness thing it's a

3712
01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:31,300
properties of consciousness thing it's a
 

3713
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:32,610
properties of consciousness thing it's a
really simple way to kind of keep track

3714
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:32,620
really simple way to kind of keep track
 

3715
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:33,240
really simple way to kind of keep track
of it so

3716
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:33,250
of it so
 

3717
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:36,150
of it so
and so on and then on The Illusionist

3718
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,160
and so on and then on The Illusionist
 

3719
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:38,820
and so on and then on The Illusionist
view yeah that's just a that's just an

3720
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:38,830
view yeah that's just a that's just an
 

3721
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:41,460
view yeah that's just a that's just an
illusion it was I find this view I find

3722
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:41,470
illusion it was I find this view I find
 

3723
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,810
illusion it was I find this view I find
it implausible I do find it very

3724
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:42,820
it implausible I do find it very
 

3725
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,450
it implausible I do find it very
attractive in some ways because it's

3726
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:45,460
attractive in some ways because it's
 

3727
01:15:45,460 --> 01:15:46,980
attractive in some ways because it's
easy to tell some story about how the

3728
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:46,990
easy to tell some story about how the
 

3729
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,980
easy to tell some story about how the
brain would create introspective models

3730
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:49,990
brain would create introspective models
 

3731
01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:52,650
brain would create introspective models
of its own consciousness of its own free

3732
01:15:52,650 --> 01:15:52,660
of its own consciousness of its own free
 

3733
01:15:52,660 --> 01:15:55,500
of its own consciousness of its own free
will as a way of simplifying yourself I

3734
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:55,510
will as a way of simplifying yourself I
 

3735
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:57,000
will as a way of simplifying yourself I
mean it's similar way when we perceive

3736
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:57,010
mean it's similar way when we perceive
 

3737
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,010
mean it's similar way when we perceive
the external world we perceive it as

3738
01:15:59,010 --> 01:15:59,020
the external world we perceive it as
 

3739
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:01,350
the external world we perceive it as
having these colors that maybe it

3740
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
having these colors that maybe it
 

3741
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,420
having these colors that maybe it
doesn't really have because that's a

3742
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:03,430
doesn't really have because that's a
 

3743
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,430
doesn't really have because that's a
really useful way of keeping tracks of

3744
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:05,440
really useful way of keeping tracks of
 

3745
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,650
really useful way of keeping tracks of
keeping track did you say that you find

3746
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:07,660
keeping track did you say that you find
 

3747
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:09,360
keeping track did you say that you find
it not very plausible because I I

3748
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:09,370
it not very plausible because I I
 

3749
01:16:09,370 --> 01:16:12,440
it not very plausible because I I
thought I find it both plausible and

3750
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:12,450
thought I find it both plausible and
 

3751
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,950
thought I find it both plausible and
attractive in some sense because it I

3752
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:15,960
attractive in some sense because it I
 

3753
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:19,910
attractive in some sense because it I
mean that's that kind of view is one

3754
01:16:19,910 --> 01:16:19,920
mean that's that kind of view is one
 

3755
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,310
mean that's that kind of view is one
that has the minimum amount of mystery

3756
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:23,320
that has the minimum amount of mystery
 

3757
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,540
that has the minimum amount of mystery
around it

3758
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:24,550
around it
 

3759
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:28,050
around it
you can kind of understand that kind of

3760
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:28,060
you can kind of understand that kind of
 

3761
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:31,290
you can kind of understand that kind of
view everything else says we don't

3762
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:31,300
view everything else says we don't
 

3763
01:16:31,300 --> 01:16:33,480
view everything else says we don't
understand so much of this picture you

3764
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:33,490
understand so much of this picture you
 

3765
01:16:33,490 --> 01:16:35,460
understand so much of this picture you
know it is four it is very attractive I

3766
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:35,470
know it is four it is very attractive I
 

3767
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:37,740
know it is four it is very attractive I
recently wrote an article all about this

3768
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:37,750
recently wrote an article all about this
 

3769
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:39,870
recently wrote an article all about this
kind of issue called the meta problem of

3770
01:16:39,870 --> 01:16:39,880
kind of issue called the meta problem of
 

3771
01:16:39,880 --> 01:16:42,660
kind of issue called the meta problem of
consciousness the hard problem is how

3772
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:42,670
consciousness the hard problem is how
 

3773
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:43,950
consciousness the hard problem is how
does the brain give you consciousness

3774
01:16:43,950 --> 01:16:43,960
does the brain give you consciousness
 

3775
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:45,860
does the brain give you consciousness
the meta problem is why are we puzzled

3776
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:45,870
the meta problem is why are we puzzled
 

3777
01:16:45,870 --> 01:16:49,200
the meta problem is why are we puzzled
by the hard problem of consciousness and

3778
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:49,210
by the hard problem of consciousness and
 

3779
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,790
by the hard problem of consciousness and
because you know I'll being puzzled by

3780
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:50,800
because you know I'll being puzzled by
 

3781
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,260
because you know I'll being puzzled by
it that's ultimately a bit of behavior

3782
01:16:52,260 --> 01:16:52,270
it that's ultimately a bit of behavior
 

3783
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:54,360
it that's ultimately a bit of behavior
we might be able to explain that bit of

3784
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:54,370
we might be able to explain that bit of
 

3785
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,510
we might be able to explain that bit of
behavior as one of the easy problems

3786
01:16:56,510 --> 01:16:56,520
behavior as one of the easy problems
 

3787
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:58,740
behavior as one of the easy problems
consciousness so maybe there'll be some

3788
01:16:58,740 --> 01:16:58,750
consciousness so maybe there'll be some
 

3789
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,500
consciousness so maybe there'll be some
computational model that explains why

3790
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:01,510
computational model that explains why
 

3791
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:03,720
computational model that explains why
we're puzzled by consciousness the meta

3792
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:03,730
we're puzzled by consciousness the meta
 

3793
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:05,880
we're puzzled by consciousness the meta
problem has come up with that model and

3794
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:05,890
problem has come up with that model and
 

3795
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:07,440
problem has come up with that model and
I've been thinking about that a lot

3796
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:07,450
I've been thinking about that a lot
 

3797
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,760
I've been thinking about that a lot
lately there's some interesting stories

3798
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:08,770
lately there's some interesting stories
 

3799
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:12,030
lately there's some interesting stories
you can tell about why the right kind of

3800
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:12,040
you can tell about why the right kind of
 

3801
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:15,390
you can tell about why the right kind of
computational system might develop these

3802
01:17:15,390 --> 01:17:15,400
computational system might develop these
 

3803
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,790
computational system might develop these
introspective models of itself that are

3804
01:17:17,790 --> 01:17:17,800
introspective models of itself that are
 

3805
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:19,890
introspective models of itself that are
attributed itself these special

01:17:19,890 --> 01:17:19,900
attributed itself these special
 

3807
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,710
attributed itself these special
properties so that that meta problem is

3808
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:22,720
properties so that that meta problem is
 

3809
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,750
properties so that that meta problem is
a resource fasten gram program for

3810
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:24,760
a resource fasten gram program for
 

3811
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:25,940
a resource fasten gram program for
everyone and then if you've got

3812
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:25,950
everyone and then if you've got
 

3813
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:28,830
everyone and then if you've got
attraction to sort of simple views

3814
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:28,840
attraction to sort of simple views
 

3815
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,680
attraction to sort of simple views
desert landscapes and so on then you can

3816
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:31,690
desert landscapes and so on then you can
 

3817
01:17:31,690 --> 01:17:33,030
desert landscapes and so on then you can
go all the way with what people call

3818
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:33,040
go all the way with what people call
 

3819
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:35,270
go all the way with what people call
illusionism and say in fact

3820
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
illusionism and say in fact
 

3821
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,920
illusionism and say in fact
consciousness itself is not real what

3822
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:37,930
consciousness itself is not real what
 

3823
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:40,490
consciousness itself is not real what
Israel is just these these these

introspective models we have that tell

3826
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:43,150
introspective models we have that tell
 

3827
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:46,859
introspective models we have that tell
us that we're conscious so the view is

01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:46,869
us that we're conscious so the view is
 

3829
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:48,540
us that we're conscious so the view is
very simple very attractive very

01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:48,550
very simple very attractive very

very simple very attractive very
powerful the trouble is of course it has

3832
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:50,860
powerful the trouble is of course it has
 

3833
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:54,239
powerful the trouble is of course it has
to say that deep down consciousness is

3834
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:54,249
to say that deep down consciousness is
 

3835
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:57,239
to say that deep down consciousness is
not real we're not actually experiencing

not real we're not actually experiencing
 

3837
01:17:57,249 --> 01:17:59,279
not real we're not actually experiencing
right now and it looks like it's just

3838
01:17:59,279 --> 01:17:59,289
right now and it looks like it's just
 

3839
01:17:59,289 --> 01:18:01,589
right now and it looks like it's just
contradicting a fundamental datum of our

3840
01:18:01,589 --> 01:18:01,599
contradicting a fundamental datum of our
 

3841
01:18:01,599 --> 01:18:03,290
contradicting a fundamental datum of our
existence and this is why most people

3842
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:03,300
existence and this is why most people
 

3843
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:06,689
existence and this is why most people
find this view crazy just as they find

3844
01:18:06,689 --> 01:18:06,699
find this view crazy just as they find
 

3845
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:08,879
find this view crazy just as they find
Pam sake as I'm crazy in one way people

3846
01:18:08,879 --> 01:18:08,889
Pam sake as I'm crazy in one way people
 

3847
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:12,779
Pam sake as I'm crazy in one way people
find illusionism crazy in another way

3848
01:18:12,779 --> 01:18:12,789
find illusionism crazy in another way
 

3849
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:17,639
find illusionism crazy in another way
but it's I mean but it so yes it has to

3850
01:18:17,639 --> 01:18:17,649
but it's I mean but it so yes it has to
 

3851
01:18:17,649 --> 01:18:20,040
but it's I mean but it so yes it has to
deny this fundamental datum of our

3852
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:20,050
deny this fundamental datum of our
 

3853
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:22,949
deny this fundamental datum of our
existence now and the view that makes

3854
01:18:22,949 --> 01:18:22,959
existence now and the view that makes
 

3855
01:18:22,959 --> 01:18:24,839
existence now and the view that makes
the view soar frankly unbelievable for

3856
01:18:24,839 --> 01:18:24,849
the view soar frankly unbelievable for
 

3857
01:18:24,849 --> 01:18:27,029
the view soar frankly unbelievable for
most people on the other hand the view

3858
01:18:27,029 --> 01:18:27,039
most people on the other hand the view
 

3859
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:29,159
most people on the other hand the view
develop right might be able to explain

3860
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:29,169
develop right might be able to explain
 

3861
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:30,779
develop right might be able to explain
why we find it unbelievable

3862
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:30,789
why we find it unbelievable
 

3863
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,209
why we find it unbelievable
because these modal's are so deeply hop

3864
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:33,219
because these modal's are so deeply hop
 

3865
01:18:33,219 --> 01:18:34,709
because these modal's are so deeply hop
right into our head and they're all

right into our head and they're all
 

3867
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:36,719
right into our head and they're all
integrated so it's not you can't escape

01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:36,729
integrated so it's not you can't escape
 

3869
01:18:36,729 --> 01:18:39,270
integrated so it's not you can't escape
that the the illusion and as the crazy

today are not real in in that sense
 

3881
01:18:54,249 --> 01:18:56,580

they're all part of an illusion inside

of Dave Chalmers whose head I think all

3884
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:00,249
of Dave Chalmers whose head I think all

01:19:00,249 --> 01:19:03,149

this could be a simulation no but not

3886
01:19:03,149 --> 01:19:03,159
this could be a simulation no but not
 

3887
01:19:03,159 --> 01:19:05,189
this could be a simulation no but not
just a simulation yeah because the

3888
01:19:05,189 --> 01:19:05,199
just a simulation yeah because the
 

3889
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:08,819
just a simulation yeah because the
simulation kind of is outside of you I

3890
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:08,829
simulation kind of is outside of you I
 

3891
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:12,119
simulation kind of is outside of you I
mean what if it's all an illusion they

3892
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:12,129
mean what if it's all an illusion they
 

3893
01:19:12,129 --> 01:19:14,310
mean what if it's all an illusion they
yes a dream that you are experiencing

3894
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
yes a dream that you are experiencing
 

3895
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,040
yes a dream that you are experiencing
that's it's all in your mind

3896
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,050
that's it's all in your mind
 

3897
01:19:17,050 --> 01:19:20,669
that's it's all in your mind
right thank you is that can you take

3898
01:19:20,669 --> 01:19:20,679
right thank you is that can you take
 

3899
01:19:20,679 --> 01:19:24,689
right thank you is that can you take
illusionism that far well there's

3900
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:24,699
illusionism that far well there's
 

3901
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:26,879
illusionism that far well there's
illusionism about the external world and

3902
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:26,889
illusionism about the external world and
 

3903
01:19:26,889 --> 01:19:28,500
illusionism about the external world and
illusionism about consciousness and

3904
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:28,510
illusionism about consciousness and
 

3905
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:30,149
illusionism about consciousness and
these might go in respective different

3906
01:19:30,149 --> 01:19:30,159
these might go in respective different
 

3907
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:31,709
these might go in respective different
illusionism about the external world

3908
01:19:31,709 --> 01:19:31,719
illusionism about the external world
 

3909
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:33,649
illusionism about the external world
kind of takes you back to Descartes and

3910
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:33,659
kind of takes you back to Descartes and
 

3911
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:36,179
kind of takes you back to Descartes and
yet could all this be produced by an

3912
01:19:36,179 --> 01:19:36,189
yet could all this be produced by an
 

3913
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:38,520
yet could all this be produced by an
evil demon they caught himself also had

3914
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:38,530
evil demon they caught himself also had
 

3915
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:39,989
evil demon they caught himself also had
the dream argument he said how do you

3916
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:39,999
the dream argument he said how do you
 

3917
01:19:39,999 --> 01:19:42,149
the dream argument he said how do you
know you're not dreaming right now how

3918
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
know you're not dreaming right now how
 

3919
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,589
know you're not dreaming right now how
do you know this is not an amazing dream

3920
01:19:43,589 --> 01:19:43,599
do you know this is not an amazing dream
 

3921
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:46,169
do you know this is not an amazing dream
and it's at least a possibility that

3922
01:19:46,169 --> 01:19:46,179
and it's at least a possibility that
 

3923
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:47,899
and it's at least a possibility that
yeah this could be some super duper

3924
01:19:47,899 --> 01:19:47,909
yeah this could be some super duper
 

3925
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:51,270
yeah this could be some super duper
complex dream in the next universe up I

3926
01:19:51,270 --> 01:19:51,280
complex dream in the next universe up I
 

3927
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:56,299
complex dream in the next universe up I
guess so my attitude is that just as

3928
01:19:56,299 --> 01:19:56,309
guess so my attitude is that just as
 

3929
01:19:56,309 --> 01:19:57,780
guess so my attitude is that just as
when a car

3930
01:19:57,780 --> 01:19:57,790
when a car
 

3931
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:00,360
when a car
thought that if the evil demon was doing

3932
01:20:00,360 --> 01:20:00,370
thought that if the evil demon was doing
 

3933
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,040
thought that if the evil demon was doing
it it's not real a lot of people these

3934
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:02,050
it it's not real a lot of people these
 

3935
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:03,750
it it's not real a lot of people these
days say if a simulation is doing it

3936
01:20:03,750 --> 01:20:03,760
days say if a simulation is doing it
 

3937
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,300
days say if a simulation is doing it
it's not real as I was saying before I

3938
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:06,310
it's not real as I was saying before I
 

3939
01:20:06,310 --> 01:20:08,130
it's not real as I was saying before I
think even if it's a simulation that

3940
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,140
think even if it's a simulation that
 

3941
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,600
think even if it's a simulation that
doesn't stop this is being real it just

3942
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:09,610
doesn't stop this is being real it just
 

3943
01:20:09,610 --> 01:20:11,670
doesn't stop this is being real it just
tells us what the world is made of black

3944
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:11,680
tells us what the world is made of black
 

3945
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,800
tells us what the world is made of black
white if it's a dream it could turn out

3946
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:13,810
white if it's a dream it could turn out
 

3947
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,170
white if it's a dream it could turn out
that all this is like my dream created

3948
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:16,180
that all this is like my dream created
 

3949
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:19,200
that all this is like my dream created
by my brain and the next universe up my

3950
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,210
by my brain and the next universe up my
 

3951
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,400
by my brain and the next universe up my
own view is that wouldn't stop this

3952
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:20,410
own view is that wouldn't stop this
 

3953
01:20:20,410 --> 01:20:22,830
own view is that wouldn't stop this
physical world from being real would

3954
01:20:22,830 --> 01:20:22,840
physical world from being real would
 

3955
01:20:22,840 --> 01:20:24,810
physical world from being real would
turn out this Cup at the most

3956
01:20:24,810 --> 01:20:24,820
turn out this Cup at the most
 

3957
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,880
turn out this Cup at the most
fundamental level was made of a bit of

3958
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:26,890
fundamental level was made of a bit of
 

3959
01:20:26,890 --> 01:20:29,460
fundamental level was made of a bit of
say my consciousness in the Dreaming

3960
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:29,470
say my consciousness in the Dreaming
 

3961
01:20:29,470 --> 01:20:32,280
say my consciousness in the Dreaming
mind at the next level up maybe that

3962
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:32,290
mind at the next level up maybe that
 

3963
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:34,050
mind at the next level up maybe that
would give you a kind of weird kind of

3964
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:34,060
would give you a kind of weird kind of
 

3965
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:36,690
would give you a kind of weird kind of
pants sarcasm about reality but it

3966
01:20:36,690 --> 01:20:36,700
pants sarcasm about reality but it
 

3967
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:39,240
pants sarcasm about reality but it
wouldn't show that the cup isn't real

3968
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:39,250
wouldn't show that the cup isn't real
 

3969
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:40,890
wouldn't show that the cup isn't real
but just tell us it's ultimately made of

3970
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:40,900
but just tell us it's ultimately made of
 

3971
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:43,380
but just tell us it's ultimately made of
processes in my dreaming mind so I'd

3972
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:43,390
processes in my dreaming mind so I'd
 

3973
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:46,200
processes in my dreaming mind so I'd
resist the idea that if the physical

3974
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:46,210
resist the idea that if the physical
 

3975
01:20:46,210 --> 01:20:50,220
resist the idea that if the physical
world is a dream then it's an illusion

3976
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:50,230
world is a dream then it's an illusion
 

3977
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:54,030
world is a dream then it's an illusion
then it's right by the way perhaps you

3978
01:20:54,030 --> 01:20:54,040
then it's right by the way perhaps you
 

3979
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:55,650
then it's right by the way perhaps you
have an interesting thought about it why

3980
01:20:55,650 --> 01:20:55,660
have an interesting thought about it why
 

3981
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:59,010
have an interesting thought about it why
is there cards demon or genius

3982
01:20:59,010 --> 01:20:59,020
is there cards demon or genius
 

3983
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,970
is there cards demon or genius
considered evil what couldn't have been

3984
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:02,980
considered evil what couldn't have been
 

3985
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,610
considered evil what couldn't have been
a benevolent one I had the same powers

3986
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:05,620
a benevolent one I had the same powers
 

3987
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:08,970
a benevolent one I had the same powers
yeah I mean Dakota the Malheur genie the

3988
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:08,980
yeah I mean Dakota the Malheur genie the
 

3989
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:13,110
yeah I mean Dakota the Malheur genie the
evil genie or evil genius malign I guess

3990
01:21:13,110 --> 01:21:13,120
evil genie or evil genius malign I guess
 

3991
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:15,510
evil genie or evil genius malign I guess
was the word but it's interesting

3992
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
was the word but it's interesting
 

3993
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:18,120
was the word but it's interesting
question I mean a later philosophy

3994
01:21:18,120 --> 01:21:18,130
question I mean a later philosophy
 

3995
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:23,760
question I mean a later philosophy
Berkeley said no in fact all this is

3996
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:23,770
Berkeley said no in fact all this is
 

3997
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:27,030
Berkeley said no in fact all this is
done by God God actually supply supplies

3998
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
done by God God actually supply supplies
 

3999
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,220
done by God God actually supply supplies
you all of these all of these

4000
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:29,230
you all of these all of these
 

4001
01:21:29,230 --> 01:21:31,320
you all of these all of these
perceptions and ideas and that's how

4002
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:31,330
perceptions and ideas and that's how
 

4003
01:21:31,330 --> 01:21:33,570
perceptions and ideas and that's how
physical reality is sustained

4004
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:33,580
physical reality is sustained
 

4005
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:36,570
physical reality is sustained
interestingly Barclays God is doing

4006
01:21:36,570 --> 01:21:36,580
interestingly Barclays God is doing
 

4007
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,010
interestingly Barclays God is doing
something that doesn't look so different

4008
01:21:38,010 --> 01:21:38,020
something that doesn't look so different
 

4009
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:40,980
something that doesn't look so different
from what des cartes evil demon was

4010
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:40,990
from what des cartes evil demon was
 

4011
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:42,300
from what des cartes evil demon was
doing it's just that they can't thought

4012
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:42,310
doing it's just that they can't thought
 

4013
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,940
doing it's just that they can't thought
it was deception and Berkeley thought it

4014
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:44,950
it was deception and Berkeley thought it
 

4015
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:47,610
it was deception and Berkeley thought it
was not and I'm I'm actually most

4016
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:47,620
was not and I'm I'm actually most
 

4017
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:51,330
was not and I'm I'm actually most
sympathetic to Berkeley here yeah this

4018
01:21:51,330 --> 01:21:51,340
sympathetic to Berkeley here yeah this
 

4019
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:54,750
sympathetic to Berkeley here yeah this
evil demon may be trying to deceive you

4020
01:21:54,750 --> 01:21:54,760
evil demon may be trying to deceive you
 

4021
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,000
evil demon may be trying to deceive you
but I think okay well the evil demon may

4022
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:57,010
but I think okay well the evil demon may
 

4023
01:21:57,010 --> 01:21:59,370
but I think okay well the evil demon may
just be under the working under a false

4024
01:21:59,370 --> 01:21:59,380
just be under the working under a false
 

4025
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:02,190
just be under the working under a false
philosophical theory is deceiving you

4026
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:02,200
philosophical theory is deceiving you
 

4027
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:03,780
philosophical theory is deceiving you
it's wrong it's like there's machines on

4028
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:03,790
it's wrong it's like there's machines on
 

4029
01:22:03,790 --> 01:22:04,940
it's wrong it's like there's machines on
the matrix they thought they were

4030
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:04,950
the matrix they thought they were
 

4031
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,840
the matrix they thought they were
deceiving you that all this stuff is

4032
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:06,850
deceiving you that all this stuff is
 

4033
01:22:06,850 --> 01:22:07,980
deceiving you that all this stuff is
real I think know if we're in a matrix

4034
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:07,990
real I think know if we're in a matrix
 

4035
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:11,400
real I think know if we're in a matrix
it's all still it's all still real

4036
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:11,410
it's all still it's all still real
 

4037
01:22:11,410 --> 01:22:13,800
it's all still it's all still real
yeah the the philosopher ok booster I

4038
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:13,810
yeah the the philosopher ok booster I
 

4039
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:16,350
yeah the the philosopher ok booster I
had a nice story about this about 50

4040
01:22:16,350 --> 01:22:16,360
had a nice story about this about 50
 

4041
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,690
had a nice story about this about 50
years ago about dick Hart's evil demon

4042
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:18,700
years ago about dick Hart's evil demon
 

4043
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:21,030
years ago about dick Hart's evil demon
where he said this demon spends all its

4044
01:22:21,030 --> 01:22:21,040
where he said this demon spends all its
 

4045
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,850
where he said this demon spends all its
time trying to fool people but fails

4046
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:23,860
time trying to fool people but fails
 

4047
01:22:23,860 --> 01:22:26,430
time trying to fool people but fails
because I'm how old demon ends up doing

4048
01:22:26,430 --> 01:22:26,440
because I'm how old demon ends up doing
 

4049
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:30,030
because I'm how old demon ends up doing
is constructing realities for 4 people

4050
01:22:30,030 --> 01:22:30,040
is constructing realities for 4 people
 

4051
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,220
is constructing realities for 4 people
so yeah I think that maybe if it's a

4052
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:32,230
so yeah I think that maybe if it's a
 

4053
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:33,990
so yeah I think that maybe if it's a
very natural to take this view that if

4054
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,000
very natural to take this view that if
 

4055
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,650
very natural to take this view that if
we're in a simulation or or evil demon

4056
01:22:37,650 --> 01:22:37,660
we're in a simulation or or evil demon
 

4057
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:39,350
we're in a simulation or or evil demon
scenario or something then none of this

4058
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:39,360
scenario or something then none of this
 

4059
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,940
scenario or something then none of this
is real but I think it may be ultimately

4060
01:22:41,940 --> 01:22:41,950
is real but I think it may be ultimately
 

4061
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:44,370
is real but I think it may be ultimately
a philosophical mistake especially if

4062
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:44,380
a philosophical mistake especially if
 

4063
01:22:44,380 --> 01:22:46,200
a philosophical mistake especially if
you take on board sort of the view of

4064
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,210
you take on board sort of the view of
 

4065
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:48,360
you take on board sort of the view of
reality well what matters to reality is

4066
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:48,370
reality well what matters to reality is
 

4067
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,640
reality well what matters to reality is
really its structure something like its

4068
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:50,650
really its structure something like its
 

4069
01:22:50,650 --> 01:22:52,950
really its structure something like its
mathematical structure and so on which

4070
01:22:52,950 --> 01:22:52,960
mathematical structure and so on which
 

4071
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,210
mathematical structure and so on which
seems to be the view that a lot of

4072
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:54,220
seems to be the view that a lot of
 

4073
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:55,620
seems to be the view that a lot of
people take from contemporary physics

4074
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:55,630
people take from contemporary physics
 

4075
01:22:55,630 --> 01:22:58,320
people take from contemporary physics
and looks like you can find all that

4076
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:58,330
and looks like you can find all that
 

4077
01:22:58,330 --> 01:23:00,590
and looks like you can find all that
mathematical structure in a simulation

4078
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:00,600
mathematical structure in a simulation
 

4079
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:03,750
mathematical structure in a simulation
maybe even in a dream and so on so as

4080
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:03,760
maybe even in a dream and so on so as
 

4081
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:05,640
maybe even in a dream and so on so as
long as that structure is real I would

4082
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:05,650
long as that structure is real I would
 

4083
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:07,680
long as that structure is real I would
say that's enough for the physical world

4084
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:07,690
say that's enough for the physical world
 

4085
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:09,780
say that's enough for the physical world
to be real yeah the physical world may

4086

01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,300
to be real yeah the physical world may
turn out to be somewhat more intangible

turn out to be somewhat more intangible
 

4089
01:23:11,310 --> 01:23:13,440

than we had thought and have a

than we had thought and have a

01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:14,820

surprising nature of it
 

4093
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,410

we're already gotten very used to that

4094
01:23:16,410 --> 01:23:16,420
we're already gotten very used to that
 

4095
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,700
we're already gotten very used to that
from for modern science see you've kind

4096
01:23:20,700 --> 01:23:20,710
from for modern science see you've kind
 

4097
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:22,140
from for modern science see you've kind
of looted that you don't have to have

superhuman level intelligence you've
 

4109
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,200
superhuman level intelligence you've
talked about that it you feel like that

4110
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:37,210
talked about that it you feel like that
 

4111
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:40,430
talked about that it you feel like that
kind of thing might be very far away but

4112
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:40,440
kind of thing might be very far away but
 

4113
01:23:40,440 --> 01:23:42,840
kind of thing might be very far away but
nevertheless one we reached that point

4114
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:42,850
nevertheless one we reached that point
 

4115
01:23:42,850 --> 01:23:46,380
nevertheless one we reached that point
do you think consciousness from an

4116
01:23:46,380 --> 01:23:46,390
do you think consciousness from an
 

4117
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:49,680
do you think consciousness from an
engineering perspective is needed or at

4118
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:49,690
engineering perspective is needed or at
 

4119
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:52,170

4123
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,930

consciousness is for functionally so

4124

right now there's no specific thing we

01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:00,340
right now there's no specific thing we
 

4127
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:02,100
right now there's no specific thing we
can point to and say you need

can point to and say you need
 

4129
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:05,520

where in collapsing wave functions it's

that would be how the conscious mind

this would have some impact on the

then we have to find we did we have to

then we have to find we did we have to

then we have to find we did we have to
find some way to either get

4244
01:26:22,590 --> 01:26:22,600
find some way to either get
 

4245
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,180
find some way to either get
consciousness in the system to play that

4246
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:24,190
consciousness in the system to play that
 

4247
01:26:24,190 --> 01:26:27,240
consciousness in the system to play that
role or to simulate it if we can isolate

4248
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:27,250
role or to simulate it if we can isolate
 

4249
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:29,190
role or to simulate it if we can isolate
a particular role to consciousness of

4250
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:29,200
a particular role to consciousness of
 

4251
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:32,430
a particular role to consciousness of
course that's incredibly seems like an

4252
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:32,440
course that's incredibly seems like an
 

4253
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:35,360
course that's incredibly seems like an
incredibly difficult thing whatever

4254
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:35,370
incredibly difficult thing whatever
 

4255
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:38,490
incredibly difficult thing whatever
worries about X

4256
01:26:38,490 --> 01:26:38,500
worries about X
 

4257
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:43,410
worries about X
sensual threats of conscious intelligent

4258
01:26:43,410 --> 01:26:43,420
sensual threats of conscious intelligent
 

4259
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:46,410
sensual threats of conscious intelligent
beings that are not us though so

4260
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:46,420
beings that are not us though so
 

4261
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:48,630
beings that are not us though so
certainly I'm sure you're worried about

4262
01:26:48,630 --> 01:26:48,640
certainly I'm sure you're worried about
 

4263
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,540
certainly I'm sure you're worried about
us yeah from an existential threat

4264
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:51,550
us yeah from an existential threat
 

4265
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:54,990
us yeah from an existential threat
perspective but outside of us AI systems

4266
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:55,000
perspective but outside of us AI systems
 

4267
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,520
perspective but outside of us AI systems
there's a couple of different kinds of

4268
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:56,530
there's a couple of different kinds of
 

4269
01:26:56,530 --> 01:26:58,620
there's a couple of different kinds of
existential threats here one is an

4270
01:26:58,620 --> 01:26:58,630
existential threats here one is an
 

4271
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,200
existential threats here one is an
existential threat to consciousness

4272
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:00,210
existential threat to consciousness
 

4273
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:02,970
existential threat to consciousness
generally I mean yes I care about humans

4274
01:27:02,970 --> 01:27:02,980
generally I mean yes I care about humans
 

4275
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:06,060
generally I mean yes I care about humans
and the survival of humans and so on but

4276
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:06,070
and the survival of humans and so on but
 

4277
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:08,940
and the survival of humans and so on but
just say it turns out that that

4278
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:08,950
just say it turns out that that
 

4279
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,710
just say it turns out that that
eventually we're replaced by some

4280
01:27:10,710 --> 01:27:10,720
eventually we're replaced by some
 

4281
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:12,900
eventually we're replaced by some
artificial beings around humans but are

4282
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:12,910
artificial beings around humans but are
 

4283
01:27:12,910 --> 01:27:15,960
artificial beings around humans but are
somehow our successes they still have

4284
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:15,970
somehow our successes they still have
 

4285
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:18,360
somehow our successes they still have
good lives they still do interesting and

4286
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:18,370
good lives they still do interesting and
 

4287
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:19,980
good lives they still do interesting and
wonderful things with the universe I

4288
01:27:19,980 --> 01:27:19,990
wonderful things with the universe I
 

4289
01:27:19,990 --> 01:27:23,190
wonderful things with the universe I
don't think that's that's not so bad

4290
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:23,200
don't think that's that's not so bad
 

4291
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,960
don't think that's that's not so bad
that's just our successors we were one

4292
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:24,970
that's just our successors we were one
 

4293
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:27,570
that's just our successors we were one
stage in evolution something different

4294
01:27:27,570 --> 01:27:27,580
stage in evolution something different
 

4295
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:30,210
stage in evolution something different
maybe better came next if on the other

4296
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:30,220
maybe better came next if on the other
 

4297
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:32,640
maybe better came next if on the other
hand all of consciousness was wiped out

4298
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:32,650
hand all of consciousness was wiped out
 

4299
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:35,430
hand all of consciousness was wiped out
that would be a very serious moral

4300
01:27:35,430 --> 01:27:35,440
that would be a very serious moral
 

4301
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:38,970
that would be a very serious moral
disaster one way that could happen is by

4302
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:38,980
disaster one way that could happen is by
 

4303
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,150
disaster one way that could happen is by
all intelligent life being wiped out and

4304
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:42,160
all intelligent life being wiped out and
 

4305
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:43,740
all intelligent life being wiped out and
many people think that yeah once you get

4306
01:27:43,740 --> 01:27:43,750
many people think that yeah once you get
 

4307
01:27:43,750 --> 01:27:46,800
many people think that yeah once you get
to humans and AI is an amazing

4308
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:46,810
to humans and AI is an amazing
 

4309
01:27:46,810 --> 01:27:48,450
to humans and AI is an amazing
sophistication where everyone has got

4310
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:48,460
sophistication where everyone has got
 

4311
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:51,060
sophistication where everyone has got
the the ability to create weapons that

4312
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:51,070
the the ability to create weapons that
 

4313
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,760
the the ability to create weapons that
can destroy the whole universe just by

4314
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:53,770
can destroy the whole universe just by
 

4315
01:27:53,770 --> 01:27:56,490
can destroy the whole universe just by
just by pressing a button then maybe

4316
01:27:56,490 --> 01:27:56,500
just by pressing a button then maybe
 

4317
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,130
just by pressing a button then maybe
it's inevitable all intelligent life

4318
01:27:58,130 --> 01:27:58,140
it's inevitable all intelligent life
 

4319
01:27:58,140 --> 01:28:02,190
it's inevitable all intelligent life
will will die out that would be a that

4320
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:02,200
will will die out that would be a that
 

4321
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:03,840
will will die out that would be a that
would certainly be a disaster and we've

4322
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:03,850
would certainly be a disaster and we've
 

4323
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:04,980
would certainly be a disaster and we've
got to think very hard about how to

4324
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:04,990
got to think very hard about how to
 

4325
01:28:04,990 --> 01:28:07,020
got to think very hard about how to
avoid that but yeah another interesting

4326
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:07,030
avoid that but yeah another interesting
 

4327
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:09,060
avoid that but yeah another interesting
kind of disaster is that may be

4328
01:28:09,060 --> 01:28:09,070
kind of disaster is that may be
 

4329
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:12,240
kind of disaster is that may be
intelligent life is not wiped out but

4330
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:12,250
intelligent life is not wiped out but
 

4331
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,180
intelligent life is not wiped out but
all consciousness is wiped out so just

4332
01:28:15,180 --> 01:28:15,190
all consciousness is wiped out so just
 

4333
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,310
all consciousness is wiped out so just
say you thought unlike what I was saying

4334
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:17,320
say you thought unlike what I was saying
 

4335
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:19,200
say you thought unlike what I was saying
a moment ago that there are two

4336
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,210
a moment ago that there are two
 

4337
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,910
a moment ago that there are two
different kinds of intelligent systems

4338
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:20,920
different kinds of intelligent systems
 

4339
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:23,580
different kinds of intelligent systems
some which are conscious and some which

4340
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:23,590
some which are conscious and some which
 

4341
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,860
some which are conscious and some which
are some which are not and just say it

4342
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:25,870
are some which are not and just say it
 

4343
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:29,340
are some which are not and just say it
turns out that we create AGI with with

4344
01:28:29,340 --> 01:28:29,350
turns out that we create AGI with with
 

4345
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:30,930
turns out that we create AGI with with
higher degree of intelligence meaning

4346
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:30,940
higher degree of intelligence meaning
 

4347
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:32,730
higher degree of intelligence meaning
higher degree of sophistication and

4348
01:28:32,730 --> 01:28:32,740
higher degree of sophistication and
 

4349
01:28:32,740 --> 01:28:34,500
higher degree of sophistication and
that's behavior but with no

4350
01:28:34,500 --> 01:28:34,510
that's behavior but with no
 

4351
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,920
that's behavior but with no
consciousness at all that AGI could take

4352
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:37,930
consciousness at all that AGI could take
 

4353
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,170
consciousness at all that AGI could take
over the world maybe but then there be

4354
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:40,180
over the world maybe but then there be
 

4355
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:42,150
over the world maybe but then there be
but let there be no consciousness in

4356
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:42,160
but let there be no consciousness in
 

4357
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:43,530
but let there be no consciousness in
this world this would be a world of

4358
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:43,540
this world this would be a world of
 

4359
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:45,960
this world this would be a world of
zombies some people have called this the

4360
01:28:45,960 --> 01:28:45,970
zombies some people have called this the
 

4361
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:48,890
zombies some people have called this the
zombie apocalypse because it's

4362
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:48,900
zombie apocalypse because it's
 

4363
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:51,030
zombie apocalypse because it's
consciousness consciousness is gone

4364
01:28:51,030 --> 01:28:51,040
consciousness consciousness is gone
 

4365
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:52,320
consciousness consciousness is gone
you've merely got this

4366
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:52,330
you've merely got this
 

4367
01:28:52,330 --> 01:28:54,750
you've merely got this
/ intelligent non-conscious robots and I

4368
01:28:54,750 --> 01:28:54,760
/ intelligent non-conscious robots and I
 

4369
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,000
/ intelligent non-conscious robots and I
would say that's a moral disaster in the

4370
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:57,010
would say that's a moral disaster in the
 

4371
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:59,550
would say that's a moral disaster in the
same way in almost the same way that the

4372
01:28:59,550 --> 01:28:59,560
same way in almost the same way that the
 

4373
01:28:59,560 --> 01:29:01,320
same way in almost the same way that the
world with no intelligent life is a

4374
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:01,330
world with no intelligent life is a
 

4375
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:04,170
world with no intelligent life is a
moral disaster all value and meaning may

4376
01:29:04,170 --> 01:29:04,180
moral disaster all value and meaning may
 

4377
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:07,290
moral disaster all value and meaning may
be gone from from that world so these

4378
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:07,300
be gone from from that world so these
 

4379
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:09,210
be gone from from that world so these
are both threats to watch out for now my

4380
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:09,220
are both threats to watch out for now my
 

4381
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,830
are both threats to watch out for now my
own view is if you get super

4382
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:10,840
own view is if you get super
 

4383
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,360
own view is if you get super
intelligence you're almost certainly

4384
01:29:12,360 --> 01:29:12,370
intelligence you're almost certainly
 

4385
01:29:12,370 --> 01:29:13,830
intelligence you're almost certainly
going to bring consciousness with it so

4386
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:13,840
going to bring consciousness with it so
 

4387
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,050
going to bring consciousness with it so
I hope that's not gonna happen but of

4388
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:16,060
I hope that's not gonna happen but of
 

4389
01:29:16,060 --> 01:29:18,060
I hope that's not gonna happen but of
course I don't understand consciousness

4390
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:18,070
course I don't understand consciousness
 

4391
01:29:18,070 --> 01:29:20,430
course I don't understand consciousness
no one understands consciousness this is

4392
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:20,440
no one understands consciousness this is
 

4393
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,440
no one understands consciousness this is
one reason for this is one reason at

4394
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:22,450
one reason for this is one reason at
 

4395
01:29:22,450 --> 01:29:23,910
one reason for this is one reason at
least among many for thinking very

4396
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:23,920
least among many for thinking very
 

4397
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:25,620
least among many for thinking very
seriously about consciousness and

4398
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:25,630
seriously about consciousness and
 

4399
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:27,600
seriously about consciousness and
thinking about the kind of future we

4400
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:27,610
thinking about the kind of future we
 

4401
01:29:27,610 --> 01:29:30,270
thinking about the kind of future we

01:33:41,330 --> 01:33:41,340
right so maybe put me in a room with
 

4615

Descartes and Princess Elizabeth and we
 

4617
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:48,750

can all argue it out what kind of

can all argue it out what kind of
 

4619
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:52,080
can all argue it out what kind of
feature so we talked about was zombies a

concerning future but what kind of
 

4623
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,850
concerning future but what kind of
future excites you what do you think if

4624
01:33:56,850 --> 01:33:56,860
future excites you what do you think if
 

4625
01:33:56,860 --> 01:34:00,899
future excites you what do you think if
we look forward sort of we're at the

4626
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:00,909
we look forward sort of we're at the
 

4627
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:02,399
we look forward sort of we're at the
very early stages of understanding

4628
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:02,409
very early stages of understanding
 

4629
01:34:02,409 --> 01:34:05,370
very early stages of understanding
consciousness and we're now at the early

4630
01:34:05,370 --> 01:34:05,380
consciousness and we're now at the early
 

4631
01:34:05,380 --> 01:34:08,790

01:34:08,790 --> 01:34:08,800
stages of being able to engineer complex

01:34:10,799 --> 01:34:10,809
interesting systems that have degrees of
 

4635
01:34:10,809 --> 01:34:12,390
interesting systems that have degrees of
intelligence maybe one day we'll have

4636
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:12,400
intelligence maybe one day we'll have
 

4637
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,819
intelligence maybe one day we'll have
degrees of consciousness maybe be able

4638
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:14,829
degrees of consciousness maybe be able
 

4639
01:34:14,829 --> 01:34:17,939
degrees of consciousness maybe be able
to upload brains all those possibilities

4640
01:34:17,939 --> 01:34:17,949
to upload brains all those possibilities
 

4641

virtual reality what is there a

4642
01:34:20,279 --> 01:34:20,289
virtual reality what is there a
 

4643
01:34:20,289 --> 01:34:22,439

particular aspect of this future world
 

4645
01:34:22,449 --> 01:34:25,229
particular aspect of this future world
that just excites you I think there are

4646
01:34:25,229 --> 01:34:25,239
that just excites you I think there are
 

4647
01:34:25,239 --> 01:34:27,120
that just excites you I think there are
lots of different aspects I mean frankly

4648
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:27,130
lots of different aspects I mean frankly
 

4649
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:29,640
lots of different aspects I mean frankly
I want it to hurry up and half us like

4650
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:29,650
I want it to hurry up and half us like
 

4651
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:31,529
I want it to hurry up and half us like
yeah we've had some progress lately an

4652
01:34:31,529 --> 01:34:31,539
yeah we've had some progress lately an
 

4653
01:34:31,539 --> 01:34:33,899
yeah we've had some progress lately an
AI and VR but in the grand scheme of

4654
01:34:33,899 --> 01:34:33,909
AI and VR but in the grand scheme of
 

4655
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:36,000
AI and VR but in the grand scheme of
things it's still kind of slow the

4656
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,010
things it's still kind of slow the
 

4657
01:34:36,010 --> 01:34:38,250
things it's still kind of slow the
changes are not yet transformative and

4658
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:38,260
changes are not yet transformative and
 

4659
01:34:38,260 --> 01:34:40,709
changes are not yet transformative and
you know I'm in my 50s I've only got so

4660
01:34:40,709 --> 01:34:40,719
you know I'm in my 50s I've only got so
 

4661
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:43,259
you know I'm in my 50s I've only got so
long left I'd like I'd like to see

4662
01:34:43,259 --> 01:34:43,269
long left I'd like I'd like to see
 

4663
01:34:43,269 --> 01:34:45,779
long left I'd like I'd like to see
really serious AI in my lifetime and

4664
01:34:45,779 --> 01:34:45,789
really serious AI in my lifetime and
 

4665
01:34:45,789 --> 01:34:48,359
really serious AI in my lifetime and
really serious virtual worlds because

4666
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:48,369
really serious virtual worlds because
 

4667
01:34:48,369 --> 01:34:50,220
really serious virtual worlds because
yeah once people are I would like to be

4668
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:50,230
yeah once people are I would like to be
 

4669
01:34:50,230 --> 01:34:51,959
yeah once people are I would like to be
able to hang out in a virtual reality

4670
01:34:51,959 --> 01:34:51,969
able to hang out in a virtual reality
 

4671
01:34:51,969 --> 01:34:55,709
able to hang out in a virtual reality
which is richer then then then this

4672
01:34:55,709 --> 01:34:55,719
which is richer then then then this
 

4673
01:34:55,719 --> 01:34:58,109
which is richer then then then this
reality to really get to inhabit

4674
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:58,119
reality to really get to inhabit
 

4675
01:34:58,119 --> 01:35:01,649
reality to really get to inhabit
fundamentally different kinds of spaces

4676
01:35:01,649 --> 01:35:01,659
fundamentally different kinds of spaces
 

4677
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:03,419
fundamentally different kinds of spaces
well I would very much like to be able

4678
01:35:03,419 --> 01:35:03,429
well I would very much like to be able
 

4679
01:35:03,429 --> 01:35:07,229
well I would very much like to be able
to upload my mind onto a onto a computer

4680
01:35:07,229 --> 01:35:07,239
to upload my mind onto a onto a computer
 

4681
01:35:07,239 --> 01:35:11,790
to upload my mind onto a onto a computer
so maybe I don't have to die if this is

4682
01:35:11,790 --> 01:35:11,800
so maybe I don't have to die if this is
 

4683
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,600
so maybe I don't have to die if this is
maybe gradually replace my neurons with

4684
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:14,610
maybe gradually replace my neurons with
 

4685
01:35:14,610 --> 01:35:17,279
maybe gradually replace my neurons with
silicon chips and I'd have it like a few

4686
01:35:17,279 --> 01:35:17,289
silicon chips and I'd have it like a few
 

4687
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:18,779
silicon chips and I'd have it like a few
selfishly that would be that would be

4688
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:18,789
selfishly that would be that would be
 

4689
01:35:18,789 --> 01:35:20,189
selfishly that would be that would be
wonderful I suspect I'm not going to

4690
01:35:20,189 --> 01:35:20,199
wonderful I suspect I'm not going to
 

4691
01:35:20,199 --> 01:35:24,479
wonderful I suspect I'm not going to
quite get there in a in my lifetime but

4692
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:24,489
quite get there in a in my lifetime but
 

4693
01:35:24,489 --> 01:35:26,910
quite get there in a in my lifetime but
once that's possible then you've got the

4694
01:35:26,910 --> 01:35:26,920
once that's possible then you've got the
 

4695
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,080
once that's possible then you've got the
possibility of transforming your

4696
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:28,090
possibility of transforming your
 

4697
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:29,910
possibility of transforming your
consciousness in remarkable ways or

4698
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
consciousness in remarkable ways or
 

4699
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,709
consciousness in remarkable ways or
renting it enhancing it

4700
01:35:32,709 --> 01:35:32,719
renting it enhancing it
 

4701
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,070
renting it enhancing it
so let me ask them if such a system is a

4702
01:35:36,070 --> 01:35:36,080
so let me ask them if such a system is a
 

4703
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:39,880
so let me ask them if such a system is a
possibility within your lifetime and you

4704
01:35:39,880 --> 01:35:39,890
possibility within your lifetime and you
 

4705
01:35:39,890 --> 01:35:41,380
possibility within your lifetime and you
were given the opportunity to become

4706
01:35:41,380 --> 01:35:41,390
were given the opportunity to become
 

4707
01:35:41,390 --> 01:35:47,340
were given the opportunity to become
immortal in this kind of way would you

4708
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:47,350
immortal in this kind of way would you
 

4709
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:51,910
immortal in this kind of way would you
choose to be immortal yes I totally

4710
01:35:51,910 --> 01:35:51,920
choose to be immortal yes I totally
 

4711
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:53,740
choose to be immortal yes I totally
would I know some people say they

4712
01:35:53,740 --> 01:35:53,750
would I know some people say they
 

4713
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,120
would I know some people say they
couldn't it would be awful to be a to be

4714
01:35:57,120 --> 01:35:57,130
couldn't it would be awful to be a to be
 

4715
01:35:57,130 --> 01:35:59,920
couldn't it would be awful to be a to be
immortal be so boring or something I

4716
01:35:59,920 --> 01:35:59,930
immortal be so boring or something I
 

4717
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:03,340
immortal be so boring or something I
don't see I really don't see a don't see

4718
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:03,350
don't see I really don't see a don't see
 

4719
01:36:03,350 --> 01:36:05,380
don't see I really don't see a don't see
why this might be I mean even if it's

4720
01:36:05,380 --> 01:36:05,390
why this might be I mean even if it's
 

4721
01:36:05,390 --> 01:36:06,939
why this might be I mean even if it's
just ordinary life that continues

4722
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:06,949
just ordinary life that continues
 

4723
01:36:06,949 --> 01:36:09,390
just ordinary life that continues
ordinary life is not so bad but

4724
01:36:09,390 --> 01:36:09,400
ordinary life is not so bad but
 

4725
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:12,670
ordinary life is not so bad but
furthermore I kind of suspect that you

4726
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:12,680
furthermore I kind of suspect that you
 

4727
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,530
furthermore I kind of suspect that you
know if the universe is gonna go on

4728
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:14,540
know if the universe is gonna go on
 

4729
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:16,479
know if the universe is gonna go on
forever or indefinitely it's going to

4730
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:16,489
forever or indefinitely it's going to
 

4731
01:36:16,489 --> 01:36:19,479
forever or indefinitely it's going to
continue to be interesting it I don't

4732
01:36:19,479 --> 01:36:19,489
continue to be interesting it I don't
 

4733
01:36:19,489 --> 01:36:21,850
continue to be interesting it I don't
think yeah your view was that we just

4734
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:21,860
think yeah your view was that we just
 

4735
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,800
think yeah your view was that we just
hit this one romantic point of interest

4736
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:23,810
hit this one romantic point of interest
 

4737
01:36:23,810 --> 01:36:25,330
hit this one romantic point of interest
now and afterwards it's all gonna be

4738
01:36:25,330 --> 01:36:25,340
now and afterwards it's all gonna be
 

4739
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:28,660
now and afterwards it's all gonna be
boring super-intelligent stasis I guess

4740
01:36:28,660 --> 01:36:28,670
boring super-intelligent stasis I guess
 

4741
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:30,370
boring super-intelligent stasis I guess
my vision is more like no it's gonna

4742
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:30,380
my vision is more like no it's gonna
 

4743
01:36:30,380 --> 01:36:31,900
my vision is more like no it's gonna
continue to be infinitely interesting

4744
01:36:31,900 --> 01:36:31,910
continue to be infinitely interesting
 

4745
01:36:31,910 --> 01:36:34,479
