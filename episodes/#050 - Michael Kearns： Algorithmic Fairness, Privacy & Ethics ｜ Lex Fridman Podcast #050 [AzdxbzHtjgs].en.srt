then realized that an English major

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:34,330
then realized that an English major

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:04,750
Rawls II in fairness what do you think
and I thought I was asking a yes-or-no

then you might conclude this and that's

about things like fairness you know from

about things like fairness you know from
sort of a humanitarian perspective and

sort of a humanitarian perspective and

solving like the biggest problems and

you know we discussed in the book the

fact that really we are there's a sense
in which we're kind of looking where the

326
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:28,790
in which we're kind of looking where the
 

327
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,560
in which we're kind of looking where the
light is in that you know for example if

328
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:32,570
light is in that you know for example if
 

329
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,220
light is in that you know for example if
police are racist in who they decide to

330
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:36,230
police are racist in who they decide to
 

331
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,860
police are racist in who they decide to
stop and frisk and that goes into the

332
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:38,870
stop and frisk and that goes into the
 

333
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,720
stop and frisk and that goes into the
data there's sort of no undoing that

334
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:40,730
data there's sort of no undoing that
 

335
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:41,370
data there's sort of no undoing that

by kind of clever algorithmic methods

by kind of clever algorithmic methods
and I think especially in fairness I

340
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:47,650
and I think especially in fairness I
 

341
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:50,220
and I think especially in fairness I
mean I think less so in privacy where we

342
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,230
mean I think less so in privacy where we
 

343
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,350
mean I think less so in privacy where we
feel like the community kind of really

344
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:52,360
feel like the community kind of really
 

345
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,150
feel like the community kind of really
has settled on the right definition

346
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
has settled on the right definition
 

347
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,700
has settled on the right definition
which is differential privacy if you

348
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:56,710
which is differential privacy if you
 

349
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,530
which is differential privacy if you
just look at the algorithmic fairness

350
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:58,540
just look at the algorithmic fairness
 

351
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,850
just look at the algorithmic fairness
literature already you can see it's

352
00:06:59,850 --> 00:06:59,860
literature already you can see it's
 

353
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,980
literature already you can see it's
gonna be much more of a mess and you

354
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:01,990
gonna be much more of a mess and you
 

355
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:03,360
gonna be much more of a mess and you
know you've got these theorems saying

356
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:03,370
know you've got these theorems saying
 

357
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,100
know you've got these theorems saying
here are three entirely reasonable

358
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,110
here are three entirely reasonable
 

359
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,800
here are three entirely reasonable
desirable notions of fairness and you

360
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:10,810
desirable notions of fairness and you
 

361
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,240
desirable notions of fairness and you
know here's a proof that you cannot

362
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,250
know here's a proof that you cannot
 

363
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,580
know here's a proof that you cannot
simultaneously have all three of them so

364
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:14,590
simultaneously have all three of them so
 

365
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,150
simultaneously have all three of them so
I think we know that algorithmic

366
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
I think we know that algorithmic
 

367
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,890
I think we know that algorithmic
fairness compared to algorithmic privacy

368
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:19,900
fairness compared to algorithmic privacy
 

369
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
fairness compared to algorithmic privacy
is gonna be kind of a harder problem and

370
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:21,910
is gonna be kind of a harder problem and
 

371
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,300
is gonna be kind of a harder problem and
it will have to revisit I think things

372
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:24,310
it will have to revisit I think things
 

373
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,820
it will have to revisit I think things
that have been thought about by you know

374
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:26,830
that have been thought about by you know
 

375
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:29,270
that have been thought about by you know
many generations of scholars before us

376
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:29,280
many generations of scholars before us
 

377
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,130
many generations of scholars before us
so it's very early days for fairness I

378
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:32,140
so it's very early days for fairness I
 

379
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,650
so it's very early days for fairness I
think so before we get into the details

380
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:34,660
think so before we get into the details
 

381
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,270
think so before we get into the details
of differential privacy and then the

382
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:36,280
of differential privacy and then the
 

383
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,050
of differential privacy and then the
fairness side

384
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:37,060
fairness side
 

385
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,720
fairness side
I mean linger on the philosophy but do

386
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:39,730
I mean linger on the philosophy but do
 

387
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,610
I mean linger on the philosophy but do
you think most people are fundamentally

388
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:41,620
you think most people are fundamentally
 

389
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,140
you think most people are fundamentally
good or do most of us have both the

390
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,150
good or do most of us have both the
 

391
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,630
good or do most of us have both the
capacity for good and evil within us I

392
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:48,640
capacity for good and evil within us I
 

393
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,120
capacity for good and evil within us I
mean I'm an optimist I tend to think

394
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,130
mean I'm an optimist I tend to think
 

395
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,880
mean I'm an optimist I tend to think
that most people are good and want to do

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:53,890
that most people are good and want to do
 

397
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,720
that most people are good and want to do
to do right and that deviations from

00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:57,730
to do right and that deviations from
 

399
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,340
to do right and that deviations from
that or you know kind of usually due to

400
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,350
that or you know kind of usually due to
 

401
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:02,700
that or you know kind of usually due to

markets do you think the distribution

412
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,080
markets do you think the distribution
 

413
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,250
markets do you think the distribution
there is also most people are good and

there is also most people are good and
 

415
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,220
there is also most people are good and
have good intent yeah I do I mean my

416
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,230
have good intent yeah I do I mean my
 

417
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:26,760
have good intent yeah I do I mean my
statement wasn't qualified to people not

statement wasn't qualified to people not

statement wasn't qualified to people not
in positions of power I mean I think

420
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,020
in positions of power I mean I think
 

421
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,270
in positions of power I mean I think
what happens in a lot of the you know

422
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:30,280
what happens in a lot of the you know
 

423
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,700
what happens in a lot of the you know
the the cliche about absolute power

424
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:32,710
the the cliche about absolute power
 

425
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,640
the the cliche about absolute power
corrupts absolutely I mean you know I

426
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:35,650
corrupts absolutely I mean you know I
 

427
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,339
corrupts absolutely I mean you know I
think even short of that you know having

428
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:38,349
think even short of that you know having
 

429
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:40,310
think even short of that you know having
spent a lot of time on Wall Street and

430
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
spent a lot of time on Wall Street and
 

431
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,709
spent a lot of time on Wall Street and
also in arenas very very different from

432
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:43,719
also in arenas very very different from
 

433
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,530
also in arenas very very different from
Wall Street like academia you know one

434
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:46,540
Wall Street like academia you know one
 

435
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:49,590
Wall Street like academia you know one
of the things I think I've benefited

436
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:49,600
of the things I think I've benefited
 

437
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,420
of the things I think I've benefited
from by moving between two very

438
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:51,430
from by moving between two very
 

439
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,610
from by moving between two very
different worlds is you you become aware

440
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:53,620
different worlds is you you become aware
 

441
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,560
different worlds is you you become aware
that you know these were

442
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:55,570
that you know these were
 

443
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,840
that you know these were
it's kind of developed their own social

444
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:57,850
it's kind of developed their own social
 

445
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,310
it's kind of developed their own social
norms and they develop their own

446
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,320
norms and they develop their own
 

447
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,939
norms and they develop their own
rationales for you know behavior for

448
00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:02,949
rationales for you know behavior for
 

449
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:04,680
rationales for you know behavior for
instance that might look unusual to

450
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:04,690
instance that might look unusual to
 

451
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,930
instance that might look unusual to
outsiders but when you're in that world

452
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:06,940
outsiders but when you're in that world
 

453
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,960
outsiders but when you're in that world
it doesn't feel unusual at all and I

454
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:09,970
it doesn't feel unusual at all and I
 

455
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,999
it doesn't feel unusual at all and I
think this is true of a lot of you know

456
00:09:11,999 --> 00:09:12,009
think this is true of a lot of you know
 

457
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:15,030
think this is true of a lot of you know
professional cultures for instance and

458
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
professional cultures for instance and
 

459
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,639
professional cultures for instance and
and you know so then you're maybe

460
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:17,649
and you know so then you're maybe
 

461
00:09:17,649 --> 00:09:19,499
and you know so then you're maybe
slippery slope is too strong of a word

462
00:09:19,499 --> 00:09:19,509
slippery slope is too strong of a word
 

463
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,300
slippery slope is too strong of a word
but you know you're in some world where

464
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:21,310
but you know you're in some world where
 

465
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,490
but you know you're in some world where
you're mainly around other people with

466
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:23,500
you're mainly around other people with
 

467
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,410
you're mainly around other people with
the same kind of viewpoints and training

468
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:25,420
the same kind of viewpoints and training
 

469
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,800
the same kind of viewpoints and training
and worldview as you and I think that's

470
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:28,810
and worldview as you and I think that's
 

471
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,800
and worldview as you and I think that's
more of a source of you know kind of

472
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:31,810
more of a source of you know kind of
 

473
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:35,579
more of a source of you know kind of
abuses of power then sort of you know

474
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:35,589
abuses of power then sort of you know
 

475
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:37,410
abuses of power then sort of you know
there being good people and evil people

476
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:37,420
there being good people and evil people
 

477
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,650
there being good people and evil people
and and it's somehow the evil people are

478
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:40,660
and and it's somehow the evil people are
 

479
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,470
and and it's somehow the evil people are
the ones that somehow rise to power

480
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:42,480
the ones that somehow rise to power
 

481
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,079
the ones that somehow rise to power
that's really interesting so it's the

482
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:45,089
that's really interesting so it's the
 

483
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:47,639
that's really interesting so it's the

the word yeah I mean or nothing you
 

499
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:06,990
the word yeah I mean or nothing you
drift but even the things that don't

500
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,000
drift but even the things that don't
 

501
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,879
drift but even the things that don't
make sense to the outside world don't

502
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:08,889
make sense to the outside world don't
 

503
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:12,180
make sense to the outside world don't
seem unusual to you so it's not sort of

504
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:12,190
seem unusual to you so it's not sort of
 

505
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,980
seem unusual to you so it's not sort of
like a good or a bad thing but you know

506
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:13,990
like a good or a bad thing but you know
 

507
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,650
like a good or a bad thing but you know
like so for instance you know on on in

508
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:16,660
like so for instance you know on on in
 

509
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,689
like so for instance you know on on in
the world of finance right there's a lot

510
00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:18,699
the world of finance right there's a lot
 

511
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:21,660
the world of finance right there's a lot
of complicated types of activity that if

512
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:21,670
of complicated types of activity that if
 

513
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,129
of complicated types of activity that if
you are not immersed in that world you

514
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:23,139
you are not immersed in that world you
 

515
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:26,009
you are not immersed in that world you
cannot see why the purpose of that you

516
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:26,019
cannot see why the purpose of that you
 

517
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,600
cannot see why the purpose of that you
know that activity exists at all it just

518
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:27,610
know that activity exists at all it just
 

519
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,389
know that activity exists at all it just
seems like you know completely useless

520
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:30,399
seems like you know completely useless
 

521
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,309
seems like you know completely useless
and people just like you know pushing

522
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:32,319
and people just like you know pushing
 

523
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,079
and people just like you know pushing
money around and when you're in that

524
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,089
money around and when you're in that
 

525
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:36,389
money around and when you're in that
world right you're you and you learn

526
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:36,399
world right you're you and you learn
 

527
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,370
world right you're you and you learn
more you your view does become more

528
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:38,380
more you your view does become more
 

529
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,650
more you your view does become more
nuanced right you realize okay there is

530
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:40,660
nuanced right you realize okay there is
 

531
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,980
nuanced right you realize okay there is
actually a function to this activity and

532
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:43,990
actually a function to this activity and
 

533
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,480
actually a function to this activity and
force in some cases you would conclude

534
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,490
force in some cases you would conclude
 

535
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,790
force in some cases you would conclude
that actually if magically we could

536
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:47,800
that actually if magically we could
 

537
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,040
that actually if magically we could
eradicate this activity tomorrow it

538
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,050
eradicate this activity tomorrow it
 

539
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,199
eradicate this activity tomorrow it
would come back because it actually is

540
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:52,209
would come back because it actually is
 

541
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:54,660
would come back because it actually is
like serving some useful purpose it's

542
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:54,670
like serving some useful purpose it's
 

543
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,340
like serving some useful purpose it's
just a useful purpose that's very

544
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,350
just a useful purpose that's very
 

545
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,610
just a useful purpose that's very
difficult for outsiders to see and so I

546
00:10:59,610 --> 00:10:59,620
difficult for outsiders to see and so I
 

547
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,540
difficult for outsiders to see and so I
think you know lots of professional work

548
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:02,550
think you know lots of professional work
 

549
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,220
think you know lots of professional work
environments or cultures as I might put

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,230
environments or cultures as I might put
 

551
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,400
environments or cultures as I might put

you know domain
 

555
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,800
you know domain
sense to the outside world academia is

556
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:10,810
sense to the outside world academia is
 

557
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,240
sense to the outside world academia is
the same right I mean lots of people

558
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,250
the same right I mean lots of people
 

559
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,130
the same right I mean lots of people
look at academia and say you know what

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:14,140
look at academia and say you know what
 

561
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:16,320

the hell are all of you people doing
 

563
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:18,960
the hell are all of you people doing
why are you paid so much in some cases

00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:18,970
why are you paid so much in some cases
 

565
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,080
why are you paid so much in some cases
at taxpayer expenses to do you know to

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:25,990
know but when you're in that world you
 

571
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,200
know but when you're in that world you
come to see the value for it and but

572
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,210
come to see the value for it and but
 

573
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,610
come to see the value for it and but
even though you might not be able to

574
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:29,620
even though you might not be able to
 

575
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,590
even though you might not be able to
explain it to you know the person in the

576
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:31,600
explain it to you know the person in the
 

577
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,650
explain it to you know the person in the
street alright and in the case of the

578
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:34,660
street alright and in the case of the
 

579
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,040
street alright and in the case of the
financial sector tools like credit might

580
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:38,050
financial sector tools like credit might
 

581
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,960
financial sector tools like credit might
not make sense to people like is it's a

582
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:39,970
not make sense to people like is it's a
 

583
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,640
not make sense to people like is it's a
good example of something that does seem

584
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:41,650
good example of something that does seem
 

585
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:44,100
good example of something that does seem
to pop up and be useful or or just the

586
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:44,110
to pop up and be useful or or just the
 

587
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,800
to pop up and be useful or or just the
power of markets and just in general

588
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:45,810
power of markets and just in general
 

589
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,450
power of markets and just in general
capitalism yeah and Finance I think the

590
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:48,460
capitalism yeah and Finance I think the
 

591
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,490
capitalism yeah and Finance I think the
primary example I would give is leverage

592
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:50,500
primary example I would give is leverage
 

593
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,780
primary example I would give is leverage
right so being allowed to borrow to sort

594
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:54,790
right so being allowed to borrow to sort
 

595
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,300
right so being allowed to borrow to sort
of use ten times as much money as you've

596
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,310
of use ten times as much money as you've
 

597
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,040
of use ten times as much money as you've
actually borrowed right so so that's an

598
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,050
actually borrowed right so so that's an
 

599
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,720
actually borrowed right so so that's an
example of something that before I had

600
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:00,730
example of something that before I had
 

601
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,490
example of something that before I had
any experience in financial markets I

602
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:02,500
any experience in financial markets I
 

603
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,440
any experience in financial markets I
might have looked at and said well what

604
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:04,450
might have looked at and said well what
 

605
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,970
might have looked at and said well what
is the purpose of that that just seems

606
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:05,980
is the purpose of that that just seems
 

607
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,610
is the purpose of that that just seems
very dangerous and it is dangerous and

608
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:08,620
very dangerous and it is dangerous and
 

609
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,730
very dangerous and it is dangerous and
it has proven dangerous but you know if

610
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:11,740
it has proven dangerous but you know if
 

611
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,560
it has proven dangerous but you know if
the fact of the matter is that you know

612
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:13,570
the fact of the matter is that you know
 

613
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:15,900
the fact of the matter is that you know
sort of on some particular time scale

614
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:15,910
sort of on some particular time scale
 

615
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,860
sort of on some particular time scale
you are holding positions that are you

616
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:19,870
you are holding positions that are you
 

617
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,610
you are holding positions that are you
know very unlikely to you know loo you

618
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:23,620
know very unlikely to you know loo you
 

619
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:25,620
know very unlikely to you know loo you
know they're you know that your value at

620
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,630
know they're you know that your value at
 

621
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,780
know they're you know that your value at
risk their variance is like 1 or 5

622
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:27,790
risk their variance is like 1 or 5
 

623
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,600
risk their variance is like 1 or 5
percent then it kind of makes sense that

624
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:30,610
percent then it kind of makes sense that
 

625
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,010
percent then it kind of makes sense that
you would be allowed to use a little bit

626
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:32,020
you would be allowed to use a little bit
 

627
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:35,040
you would be allowed to use a little bit
more than you have because you have you

628
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,050
more than you have because you have you
 

629
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,350
more than you have because you have you
know some confidence that you're not

630
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
know some confidence that you're not
 

631
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,110
know some confidence that you're not
going to lose it all in a single day

632
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,120
going to lose it all in a single day
 

633
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,990
going to lose it all in a single day
now of course when that happens we've

634
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:43,000
now of course when that happens we've
 

635
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,390
now of course when that happens we've
seen what happens you know not not too

636
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:45,400
seen what happens you know not not too
 

637
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,790
seen what happens you know not not too
long ago but but you know but the idea

638
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:47,800
long ago but but you know but the idea
 

639
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,940
long ago but but you know but the idea
that it serves no useful economic

640
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:50,950

ok you know what's an example of an
 

689
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:59,379
ok you know what's an example of an
algorithm or an algorithmic problem

00:13:59,379 --> 00:13:59,389
algorithm or an algorithmic problem

first of all I could sorting right yeah

692
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,040
first of all I could sorting right yeah
 

693
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,710
first of all I could sorting right yeah
I'm a bunch of index cards with numbers

694
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
I'm a bunch of index cards with numbers
 

695
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I'm a bunch of index cards with numbers
on them and you want to sort them and we

696
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:04,730
on them and you want to sort them and we
 

697
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:06,269
on them and you want to sort them and we
describe you know an algorithm that

698
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:06,279
describe you know an algorithm that
 

699
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,860
describe you know an algorithm that
sweeps all the way through finds the the

700
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:08,870
sweeps all the way through finds the the
 

701
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,360
sweeps all the way through finds the the
smallest number puts it at the front

702
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:10,370
smallest number puts it at the front
 

703
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,309
smallest number puts it at the front
then sweeps through again finds the

704
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:12,319
then sweeps through again finds the
 

705
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,679
then sweeps through again finds the
second smallest number so we make the

706
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:14,689
second smallest number so we make the
 

707
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,600
second smallest number so we make the
point that this is an algorithm and it's

708
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:16,610
point that this is an algorithm and it's
 

709
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,759
point that this is an algorithm and it's
also a bad algorithm in the sense that

710
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:18,769
also a bad algorithm in the sense that
 

711
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,489
also a bad algorithm in the sense that
you know it's quadratic rather than n

712
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:21,499
you know it's quadratic rather than n
 

713
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:24,220
you know it's quadratic rather than n
log n which we know is optimal for

714
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,230
log n which we know is optimal for
 

715
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,679
log n which we know is optimal for
sorting and we make the point that sort

716
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:26,689
sorting and we make the point that sort
 

717
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,230
sorting and we make the point that sort
of like you know so even within the

718
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,240
of like you know so even within the
 

719
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,929
of like you know so even within the
confines of a very precisely specified

720
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:31,939
confines of a very precisely specified
 

721
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,900
confines of a very precisely specified
problem there's you know there might be

722
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:34,910
problem there's you know there might be
 

723
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,999
problem there's you know there might be
many many different algorithms for the

724
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:37,009
many many different algorithms for the
 

725
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,590
many many different algorithms for the
same problem with different properties

726
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:38,600
same problem with different properties
 

727
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,230
same problem with different properties
like some might be faster in terms of

728
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:41,240
like some might be faster in terms of
 

729
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,600
like some might be faster in terms of
running time some I use less memory some

730
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,610
running time some I use less memory some
 

731
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,090
running time some I use less memory some
might have you know better distributed

732
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,100
might have you know better distributed
 

733
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,150
might have you know better distributed
implementations and and so the point is

734
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,160
implementations and and so the point is
 

735
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,850
implementations and and so the point is
is that already we're used to you know

736
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:51,860
is that already we're used to you know
 

737
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,879
is that already we're used to you know
in computer science thinking about

738
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:53,889
in computer science thinking about
 

739
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,499
in computer science thinking about
trade-offs between different types of

740
00:14:56,499 --> 00:14:56,509
trade-offs between different types of
 

741
00:14:56,509 --> 00:14:59,019
trade-offs between different types of
quantities and resources and there being

742
00:14:59,019 --> 00:14:59,029
quantities and resources and there being
 

743
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,769
quantities and resources and there being
you know better and worse algorithms and

744
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:01,779
you know better and worse algorithms and
 

745
00:15:01,779 --> 00:15:07,829
you know better and worse algorithms and
and our book is about that part of

746
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:07,839
and our book is about that part of
 

747
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,139
and our book is about that part of
algorithmic ethics that we know how to

748
00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:11,149
algorithmic ethics that we know how to
 

749
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:13,269
algorithmic ethics that we know how to
kind of put on that same kind of

750
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:13,279
kind of put on that same kind of
 

751
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,879
kind of put on that same kind of
quantitative footing right now so you

752
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:15,889
quantitative footing right now so you
 

753
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,189
quantitative footing right now so you
know just to say something that our book

754
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:18,199
know just to say something that our book
 

755
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:20,439
know just to say something that our book
is not about our book is not about kind

756
00:15:20,439 --> 00:15:20,449
is not about our book is not about kind
 

757
00:15:20,449 --> 00:15:24,100
is not about our book is not about kind
of broad fuzzy notions of fairness it's

758
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,110
of broad fuzzy notions of fairness it's
 

759
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:26,699
of broad fuzzy notions of fairness it's
about very specific notions of fairness

760
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:26,709
about very specific notions of fairness
 

761
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:29,889
about very specific notions of fairness
there's more than one of them there are

762
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:29,899
there's more than one of them there are
 

763
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:33,039
there's more than one of them there are
tensions between them right but if you

764
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:33,049
tensions between them right but if you
 

765
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:36,340
tensions between them right but if you
pick one of them you can do something

766
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:36,350
pick one of them you can do something
 

767
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:37,390
pick one of them you can do something
akin to saying

768
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:37,400
akin to saying
 

769
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,990
akin to saying
this algorithm is 97% ethical you can

770
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:41,000
this algorithm is 97% ethical you can
 

771
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,350
this algorithm is 97% ethical you can
say for instance the you know for this

772
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,360
say for instance the you know for this
 

773
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,990
say for instance the you know for this
lending model the false rejection rate

774
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:47,000
lending model the false rejection rate
 

775
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,070
lending model the false rejection rate
on black people and white people is

776
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,080
on black people and white people is
 

777
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,320
on black people and white people is
within 3 percent right so we might call

778
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:53,330
within 3 percent right so we might call
 

779
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,230
within 3 percent right so we might call
that to a 97% ethical algorithm in a

780
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
that to a 97% ethical algorithm in a
 

781
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,990
that to a 97% ethical algorithm in a
100% ethical algorithm would mean that

782
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,000
100% ethical algorithm would mean that
 

783
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,930
100% ethical algorithm would mean that
that difference is 0% in that case

784
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:01,940
that difference is 0% in that case
 

785
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:05,260
that difference is 0% in that case
fairness is specified when two groups

786
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:05,270
fairness is specified when two groups
 

787
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,200
fairness is specified when two groups
however they're defined are given to you

788
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:07,210
however they're defined are given to you
 

789
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,210
however they're defined are given to you
that's right so the and and then you can

790
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:10,220
that's right so the and and then you can
 

791
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,740
that's right so the and and then you can
sort of mathematically start describing

sort of mathematically start describing
 

793
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,920
sort of mathematically start describing
the algorithm but nevertheless the the

the algorithm but nevertheless the the
 

795
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:19,810
the algorithm but nevertheless the the

00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,840
you I mean unlike running time you know
we don't in a computer science talk

800
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:25,850
we don't in a computer science talk
 

801
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,960
we don't in a computer science talk
about how fast an algorithm feels like

802
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:28,970
about how fast an algorithm feels like
 

803
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,530
about how fast an algorithm feels like
when it runs true we measure an ethical

804
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:32,540
when it runs true we measure an ethical
 

805
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,930
when it runs true we measure an ethical
starts getting into feelings so for

806
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:34,940
starts getting into feelings so for
 

807
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:38,740
starts getting into feelings so for
example an algorithm runs you know if it

808
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:38,750
example an algorithm runs you know if it
 

809
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,850
example an algorithm runs you know if it
runs in the background it doesn't

810
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:39,860
runs in the background it doesn't
 

811
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,890
runs in the background it doesn't
disturb the performance of my system

812
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:41,900
disturb the performance of my system
 

813
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,320
disturb the performance of my system
it'll feel nice I'll be okay with it but

814
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,330
it'll feel nice I'll be okay with it but
 

815
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:46,210
it'll feel nice I'll be okay with it but
if it overloads the system will feel

816
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,220
if it overloads the system will feel
 

817
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,449
if it overloads the system will feel
unpleasant so in that same way ethics

818
00:16:48,449 --> 00:16:48,459
unpleasant so in that same way ethics
 

819
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:51,010
unpleasant so in that same way ethics
there's a feeling of how socially

820
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:51,020
there's a feeling of how socially
 

821
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,220
there's a feeling of how socially
acceptable it is how does it represent

822
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,230
acceptable it is how does it represent
 

823
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,440
acceptable it is how does it represent
the moral standards of our society today

824
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:56,450
the moral standards of our society today
 

825
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:59,079
the moral standards of our society today
so in that sense and sorry to linger on

826
00:16:59,079 --> 00:16:59,089
so in that sense and sorry to linger on
 

827
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:01,449
so in that sense and sorry to linger on
that for some high low philosophical

828
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:01,459
that for some high low philosophical
 

829
00:17:01,459 --> 00:17:03,280
that for some high low philosophical
question is do you have a sense we'll be

830
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:03,290
question is do you have a sense we'll be
 

831
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,860
question is do you have a sense we'll be
able to measure how ethical and

832
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:05,870
able to measure how ethical and
 

833
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:08,319
able to measure how ethical and
algorithm is first of all I didn't

834
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:08,329
algorithm is first of all I didn't
 

835
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,549
algorithm is first of all I didn't
certainly didn't mean to give the

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:09,559
certainly didn't mean to give the
 

837
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,470
certainly didn't mean to give the
impression that you can kind of measure

838
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:11,480
impression that you can kind of measure
 

839
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,140
impression that you can kind of measure
you know memory speed trade-offs you

840
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,150
you know memory speed trade-offs you
 

841
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:17,049
you know memory speed trade-offs you
know and and that there's a complete you

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:17,059
know and and that there's a complete you
 

843
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:19,059
know and and that there's a complete you
know mapping from that on to kind of

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:19,069
know mapping from that on to kind of
 

845
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:22,140
know mapping from that on to kind of
fairness for instance or ethics and and

of them for instance is deciding who it
 

863
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,020
of them for instance is deciding who it
is that you're worried about protecting

864
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,030
is that you're worried about protecting
 

865
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,690
is that you're worried about protecting
who you're worried about being harmed by

866
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:49,700
who you're worried about being harmed by
 

867
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,590
who you're worried about being harmed by
for instance

868
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:50,600
for instance
 

869
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,090
for instance
some notion of discrimination or

870
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:52,100
some notion of discrimination or
 

871
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,700
some notion of discrimination or
unfairness and then you need to also

872
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:54,710
unfairness and then you need to also
 

873
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,490
unfairness and then you need to also
decide what constitutes harm so for

874
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:57,500
decide what constitutes harm so for
 

875
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:00,460
decide what constitutes harm so for
instance in a lending application maybe

876
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,470
instance in a lending application maybe
 

877
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,070
instance in a lending application maybe
you decide that you know falsely

878
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,080
you decide that you know falsely
 

879
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,370
you decide that you know falsely
rejecting a credit worthy individual you

880
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:06,380
rejecting a credit worthy individual you
 

881
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,039
rejecting a credit worthy individual you
know sort of a false negative is the

882
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:09,049
know sort of a false negative is the
 

883
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:11,200
know sort of a false negative is the
real harm and that false positives ie

884
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,210
real harm and that false positives ie
 

885
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,600
real harm and that false positives ie
people that are not credit worthy or are

886
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:13,610
people that are not credit worthy or are
 

887
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,700
people that are not credit worthy or are
not going to repay your loan to get a

888
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:15,710
not going to repay your loan to get a
 

889
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,760
not going to repay your loan to get a
loan you might think of them as lucky

890
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:17,770
loan you might think of them as lucky
 

891
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,080
loan you might think of them as lucky
and so that's not a harm although it's

892
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,090
and so that's not a harm although it's
 

893
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,899
and so that's not a harm although it's
not clear that if you are don't have the

894
00:18:22,899 --> 00:18:22,909
not clear that if you are don't have the
 

895
00:18:22,909 --> 00:18:24,850
not clear that if you are don't have the
means to repay a loan that being given a

896
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:24,860
means to repay a loan that being given a
 

897
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:29,169
means to repay a loan that being given a
loan is not also a harm so you know you

898
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:29,179
loan is not also a harm so you know you
 

899
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,930
loan is not also a harm so you know you
know the literature is sort of so far

900
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:31,940
know the literature is sort of so far
 

901
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,450
know the literature is sort of so far
quite limited in that you sort of need

902
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:34,460
quite limited in that you sort of need
 

903
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,980
quite limited in that you sort of need
to say who do you want to protect and

904
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:35,990
to say who do you want to protect and
 

905
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
to say who do you want to protect and
what would constitute harm to that group

906
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:38,000
what would constitute harm to that group
 

907
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,860
what would constitute harm to that group
and when you ask questions like will

908
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:40,870
and when you ask questions like will
 

909
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:44,110
and when you ask questions like will
algorithms feel ethical one way in which

910
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:44,120
algorithms feel ethical one way in which
 

911
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,820
algorithms feel ethical one way in which
they won't under the definitions that

912
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:45,830
they won't under the definitions that
 

913
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:48,549
they won't under the definitions that
I'm describing is if you know if you are

914
00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:48,559
I'm describing is if you know if you are
 

915
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,159
I'm describing is if you know if you are
an individual who is falsely denied

916
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:51,169
an individual who is falsely denied
 

917
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:54,370
an individual who is falsely denied
alone incorrectly denied a loan all of

918
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:54,380
alone incorrectly denied a loan all of
 

919
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,230
alone incorrectly denied a loan all of
these definitions basically say like

920
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:56,240
these definitions basically say like
 

921
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,840
these definitions basically say like
well you know your compensation is the

922
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:58,850
well you know your compensation is the
 

923
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,880
well you know your compensation is the
knowledge that we are we are also

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:00,890
knowledge that we are we are also
 

925
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,279
knowledge that we are we are also
falsely denying loans to other people

926
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:03,289
falsely denying loans to other people
 

927
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:05,500
falsely denying loans to other people
you know other groups at the same rate

928
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:05,510
you know other groups at the same rate
 

929
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,230
you know other groups at the same rate
that we're doing it's to you and and you

930
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
that we're doing it's to you and and you
 

931
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,810
that we're doing it's to you and and you
know there and so there is actually this

932
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:09,820
know there and so there is actually this
 

933
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,850
know there and so there is actually this

to looking at the worst violation of
fairness for an individual is important

960
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,210
fairness for an individual is important
 

961
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,149
fairness for an individual is important
to minimize that one individual so like

962
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:49,159
to minimize that one individual so like
 

963

to minimize that one individual so like
worst case analysis is that something

964
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:51,890
worst case analysis is that something
 

965
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:54,100
worst case analysis is that something
you think about or I mean I think we're

966
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:54,110
you think about or I mean I think we're
 

967
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,960
you think about or I mean I think we're
not even at the point where we can

968
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:55,970
not even at the point where we can
 

969
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,450
not even at the point where we can
sensibly think about that so first of

970
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:58,460
sensibly think about that so first of
 

971
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,060
sensibly think about that so first of
all you know we're talking here both

972
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,070
all you know we're talking here both
 

973
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:03,490
all you know we're talking here both
about fairness applied at the group

974
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:03,500
about fairness applied at the group
 

975
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,960
about fairness applied at the group
level which is

976
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:04,970
level which is
 

977
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,839
level which is
a relatively weak thing but it's better

978
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:07,849
a relatively weak thing but it's better
 

979
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:10,509
a relatively weak thing but it's better
than nothing and also the more ambitious

980
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:10,519
than nothing and also the more ambitious
 

981
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:13,719
than nothing and also the more ambitious
thing of trying to give some individual

982
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:13,729
thing of trying to give some individual
 

983
00:20:13,729 --> 00:20:16,629
thing of trying to give some individual
promises but even that doesn't

984
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:16,639
promises but even that doesn't
 

985
00:20:16,639 --> 00:20:17,859
promises but even that doesn't
incorporate I think something that

986
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:17,869
incorporate I think something that
 

987
00:20:17,869 --> 00:20:19,149
incorporate I think something that
you're hinting at here is what a chime

988
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:19,159
you're hinting at here is what a chime
 

989
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:21,099
you're hinting at here is what a chime
I'll call subjective fairness right

990
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:21,109
I'll call subjective fairness right
 

991
00:20:21,109 --> 00:20:23,649
I'll call subjective fairness right
right so a lot of the definitions I mean

992
00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:23,659
right so a lot of the definitions I mean
 

993
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,180
right so a lot of the definitions I mean
all of the definitions in the

994
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,190
all of the definitions in the
 

995
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:26,830
all of the definitions in the
algorithmic fairness literature are what

996
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:26,840
algorithmic fairness literature are what
 

997
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,210
algorithmic fairness literature are what
I would kind of call received wisdom

998
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:28,220
I would kind of call received wisdom
 

999
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,039
I would kind of call received wisdom
definitions it's sort of you know

1000
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:30,049
definitions it's sort of you know
 

1001
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:33,039
definitions it's sort of you know
somebody like me sits around and things

1002
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:33,049
somebody like me sits around and things
 

1003
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:34,450
somebody like me sits around and things
like okay you know I think here's a

1004
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:34,460
like okay you know I think here's a
 

1005
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,249
like okay you know I think here's a
technical definition of fairness that I

1006
00:20:36,249 --> 00:20:36,259
technical definition of fairness that I
 

1007
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,409
technical definition of fairness that I
think people should want or that they

1008
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:38,419
think people should want or that they
 

1009
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:40,690
think people should want or that they
should you know think of as some notion

1010
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:40,700
should you know think of as some notion
 

1011
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,399
should you know think of as some notion
of fairness maybe not the only one maybe

1012
00:20:42,399 --> 00:20:42,409
of fairness maybe not the only one maybe
 

1013
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,379
of fairness maybe not the only one maybe
not the best one maybe not the last one

1014
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:44,389
not the best one maybe not the last one
 

1015
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:49,810
not the best one maybe not the last one
but we really actually don't know from a

1016
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:49,820
but we really actually don't know from a
 

1017
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,749
but we really actually don't know from a
subjective standpoint like what people

1018
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:52,759
subjective standpoint like what people
 

1019
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:54,690
subjective standpoint like what people
really think is fair there's you know

1020
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:54,700
really think is fair there's you know
 

1021
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,190
really think is fair there's you know
we've we've just started doing a little

1022
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
we've we've just started doing a little
 

1023
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,190
we've we've just started doing a little
bit of work in in our group that

1024
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:00,200
bit of work in in our group that
 

1025
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,669
bit of work in in our group that
actually doing kind of human subject

1026
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:02,679
actually doing kind of human subject
 

1027
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,159
actually doing kind of human subject
experiments in which we you know ask

1028
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,169
experiments in which we you know ask
 

1029
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,399
experiments in which we you know ask
people about you know we ask them

1030
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:09,409
people about you know we ask them
 

1031
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,739
people about you know we ask them
questions about fairness we survey them

1032
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:11,749
questions about fairness we survey them
 

1033
00:21:11,749 --> 00:21:14,440
questions about fairness we survey them
we you know we show them pairs of

1034
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:14,450
we you know we show them pairs of
 

1035
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,239
we you know we show them pairs of
individuals in let's say a criminal

1036
00:21:16,239 --> 00:21:16,249
individuals in let's say a criminal
 

1037
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,849
individuals in let's say a criminal
recidivism prediction setting and we ask

1038
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:18,859
recidivism prediction setting and we ask
 

1039
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:21,129
recidivism prediction setting and we ask
them do you think these two individuals

1040
00:21:21,129 --> 00:21:21,139
them do you think these two individuals
 

1041
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,619
them do you think these two individuals
should be treated the same as a matter

1042
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:23,629
should be treated the same as a matter
 

1043
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:26,289
should be treated the same as a matter
of fairness and to my knowledge there's

1044
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:26,299
of fairness and to my knowledge there's
 

1045
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:29,769
of fairness and to my knowledge there's
not a large literature in which ordinary

1046
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:29,779
not a large literature in which ordinary
 

1047
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:33,219
not a large literature in which ordinary
people are asked about you know they

1048
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:33,229
people are asked about you know they
 

1049
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,139
people are asked about you know they
they have sort of notions of their

1050
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:35,149
they have sort of notions of their
 

1051
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:38,049
they have sort of notions of their
subjective fairness elicited from them

1052
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:38,059
subjective fairness elicited from them
 

1053
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:41,259
subjective fairness elicited from them
it's mainly you know kind of scholars

1054
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:41,269
it's mainly you know kind of scholars
 

1055
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:43,330
it's mainly you know kind of scholars
who think about fairness no right and

1056
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:43,340
who think about fairness no right and
 

1057
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,529
who think about fairness no right and
I'm making up their own definitions and

1058
00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:44,539
I'm making up their own definitions and
 

1059
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,389
I'm making up their own definitions and
I think I think this needs to change

1060
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:46,399
I think I think this needs to change
 

1061
00:21:46,399 --> 00:21:49,029
I think I think this needs to change
actually for many social norms not just

1062
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
actually for many social norms not just
 

1063
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,229
actually for many social norms not just
for fairness right so there's a lot of

1064
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:52,239
for fairness right so there's a lot of
 

1065
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:54,070
for fairness right so there's a lot of
discussion these days in the AI

1066
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:54,080
discussion these days in the AI
 

1067
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,739
discussion these days in the AI
community about interpretable AI or

1068
00:21:56,739 --> 00:21:56,749
community about interpretable AI or
 

1069
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:59,950
community about interpretable AI or
understandable AI and as far as I can

1070
00:21:59,950 --> 00:21:59,960
understandable AI and as far as I can
 

1071
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,460
understandable AI and as far as I can
tell everybody agrees that deep learning

1072
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:03,470
tell everybody agrees that deep learning
 

1073
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:05,469
tell everybody agrees that deep learning
or at least the outputs of deep learning

1074
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:05,479
or at least the outputs of deep learning
 

1075
00:22:05,479 --> 00:22:09,549
or at least the outputs of deep learning
are not very understandable and people

1076
00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:09,559
are not very understandable and people
 

1077
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:12,249
are not very understandable and people
might agree that sparse linear models

1078
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:12,259
might agree that sparse linear models
 

1079
00:22:12,259 --> 00:22:14,229
might agree that sparse linear models
with integer coefficients are more

1080
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:14,239
with integer coefficients are more
 

1081
00:22:14,239 --> 00:22:16,749
with integer coefficients are more
understandable but nobody's really asked

1082
00:22:16,749 --> 00:22:16,759
understandable but nobody's really asked
 

1083
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:18,370
understandable but nobody's really asked
people you know there's very little

1084
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:18,380
people you know there's very little
 

1085
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,200
people you know there's very little
literature on you know sort of showing

1086
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,210
literature on you know sort of showing
 

1087
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,630
literature on you know sort of showing
people models and asking them do they

1088
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:22,640
people models and asking them do they
 

1089
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,630
people models and asking them do they
understand what the model is doing and I

1090
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:25,640
understand what the model is doing and I
 

1091
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,500
understand what the model is doing and I
think that in all these topics as these

1092
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:29,510
think that in all these topics as these
 

1093
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:31,930
think that in all these topics as these
fields mature we need to start doing

1094
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:31,940
fields mature we need to start doing
 

1095
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,620
fields mature we need to start doing
more behavioral work yeah which is so

1096
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:35,630
more behavioral work yeah which is so
 

1097
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,810
more behavioral work yeah which is so
one of my deep passions of psychology

1098
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:37,820
one of my deep passions of psychology
 

1099
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,420
one of my deep passions of psychology
and I always thought computer scientists

1100
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:40,430
and I always thought computer scientists
 

1101
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:41,950
and I always thought computer scientists
will be the the best future

1102
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:41,960
will be the the best future
 

1103
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,580
will be the the best future
psychologists in a sense that data is

1104
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,590

 

1105
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:49,960

especially in this modern world the data

1106
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:49,970
especially in this modern world the data
 

1107
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,580
especially in this modern world the data
is a really powerful way to understand

1108
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:51,590
is a really powerful way to understand
 

1109
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,740
is a really powerful way to understand
and study human behavior and you've

1110
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:53,750
and study human behavior and you've
 

1111
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,870
and study human behavior and you've
explored that with your game theory side

1112
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:55,880
explored that with your game theory side
 

1113
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,510
explored that with your game theory side
of work as well yeah I'd like to think

1114
00:22:58,510 --> 00:22:58,520
of work as well yeah I'd like to think
 

1115
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,370
of work as well yeah I'd like to think
that what you say is true about computer

1116

experiments we have a great deal to

1122
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:08,690
experiments we have a great deal to
 

1123
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,810
experiments we have a great deal to
learn not just computer science but AI

1124
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:10,820
learn not just computer science but AI
 

1125
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,610
learn not just computer science but AI
and machine learning more specifically I

1126

kind of think of as imperialist research

1128
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:15,710
kind of think of as imperialist research

kind of think of as imperialist research
communities in that you know kind of

1130
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,240
communities in that you know kind of
 

1131
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,250
communities in that you know kind of
like physicists in an earlier generation

1132
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:20,260
like physicists in an earlier generation
 

1133
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,390
like physicists in an earlier generation
computer scientists kind of don't think

1134
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:22,400
computer scientists kind of don't think
 

1135
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,360
computer scientists kind of don't think
of any scientific topic as off limits to

areas that others have been thinking

1140
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:30,020
areas that others have been thinking
 

1141
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,860
areas that others have been thinking
about for decades or longer and you know

1142
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:32,870
about for decades or longer and you know
 

1143
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,430
about for decades or longer and you know
we usually tend to embarrass ourselves

1144
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:36,440
we usually tend to embarrass ourselves
 

1145
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,830
we usually tend to embarrass ourselves
yes in those efforts for for some amount

1146
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:38,840
yes in those efforts for for some amount
 

1147
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,060
yes in those efforts for for some amount
of time like you know I think

1148
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,070
of time like you know I think
 

1149
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:42,130

reinforcement learning is a good example

1150
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,140
reinforcement learning is a good example
 

1151
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,190
reinforcement learning is a good example
right so a lot of the early work in

1152
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
right so a lot of the early work in
 

1153
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,560
right so a lot of the early work in
reinforcement learning I have complete

1154
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:47,570
reinforcement learning I have complete
 

1155
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,230
reinforcement learning I have complete
sympathy for the control theorist that

1156
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:50,240
sympathy for the control theorist that
 

1157
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,420
sympathy for the control theorist that
looked at this and said like okay you

1158
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:52,430
looked at this and said like okay you
 

1159
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,640
looked at this and said like okay you
are reinventing stuff that we've known

1160
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:54,650
are reinventing stuff that we've known
 

1161
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,880
are reinventing stuff that we've known
since like the 40s right but you know in

1162
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:57,890
since like the 40s right but you know in
 

1163
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,460
since like the 40s right but you know in
my view eventually this sort of you know

1164
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,470
my view eventually this sort of you know
 

1165
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,860
my view eventually this sort of you know
computer scientists have made

1166
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:02,870
computer scientists have made
 

1167
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,020
computer scientists have made
significant contributions to that field

1168
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,030
significant contributions to that field
 

1169
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,300
significant contributions to that field
even though we kind of embarrassed

1170
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:07,310
even though we kind of embarrassed
 

1171
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,310
even though we kind of embarrassed
ourselves for the first decade so I

1172
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,320
ourselves for the first decade so I
 

1173
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,750
ourselves for the first decade so I
think if computer scientists are gonna

1174
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:10,760
think if computer scientists are gonna
 

1175
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,700
think if computer scientists are gonna
start engaging in kind of psychology

1176
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:12,710
start engaging in kind of psychology
 

1177
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,480
start engaging in kind of psychology
human subjects type of research we

1178
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:16,490
human subjects type of research we
 

1179
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,070
human subjects type of research we
should expect to be embarrassing

1180
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
should expect to be embarrassing
 

1181
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,470
should expect to be embarrassing
ourselves for a good ten years or so and

1182
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:20,480
ourselves for a good ten years or so and
 

1183
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,770
ourselves for a good ten years or so and
then hope that it turns out as well as

1184
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:23,780
then hope that it turns out as well as
 

1185
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,270
then hope that it turns out as well as
you know some other areas that we've

1186
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:25,280
you know some other areas that we've
 

1187
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,000
you know some other areas that we've
waded into so you kind of mentioned this

1188
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,010
waded into so you kind of mentioned this
 

1189
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,740
waded into so you kind of mentioned this
just the linger on the idea of an

1190
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:29,750
just the linger on the idea of an
 

1191
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,320
just the linger on the idea of an
ethical algorithm of idea of group

1192
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:32,330
ethical algorithm of idea of group
 

1193
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:34,750
ethical algorithm of idea of group
sort of group thinking an individual

1194
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:34,760
sort of group thinking an individual
 

1195
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:35,890
sort of group thinking an individual
thinking and we're struggling that

1196
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:35,900
thinking and we're struggling that
 

1197
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,660
thinking and we're struggling that
there's one of the amazing things about

1198
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:37,670
there's one of the amazing things about
 

1199
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,850
there's one of the amazing things about
algorithms and your book and just this

1200
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:39,860
algorithms and your book and just this
 

1201
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:43,120
algorithms and your book and just this
field of study is it gets us to ask like

1202
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,130
field of study is it gets us to ask like
 

1203
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:47,200
field of study is it gets us to ask like
forcing machines converting these ideas

1204
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,210
forcing machines converting these ideas
 

1205
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,880
forcing machines converting these ideas
into algorithms is forcing us to ask

1206
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:48,890
into algorithms is forcing us to ask
 

1207
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,650
into algorithms is forcing us to ask
questions of ourselves as a human

1208
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:50,660
questions of ourselves as a human
 

1209
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:53,290
questions of ourselves as a human
civilization so there's a lot of people

1210
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:53,300
civilization so there's a lot of people
 

1211
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,770
civilization so there's a lot of people
now in public discourse doing sort of

1212
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:56,780
now in public discourse doing sort of
 

1213
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,100
now in public discourse doing sort of
group thinking thinking like there's

1214
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,110
group thinking thinking like there's
 

1215
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,930
group thinking thinking like there's
particular sets of groups that we don't

1216
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:01,940
particular sets of groups that we don't
 

1217
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,340
particular sets of groups that we don't
want to discriminate against and so on

1218
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,350
want to discriminate against and so on
 

1219
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,900
want to discriminate against and so on
and then there is individuals sort of in

1220
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:07,910
and then there is individuals sort of in
 

1221
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,880
and then there is individuals sort of in
the individual life stories the

1222
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:09,890
the individual life stories the
 

1223
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,200
the individual life stories the
struggles they went through and so on

1224
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,210
struggles they went through and so on
 

1225
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,350
struggles they went through and so on
now like in philosophy it's easier to do

1226
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:14,360
now like in philosophy it's easier to do
 

1227
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,440
now like in philosophy it's easier to do
group thinking because you don't you

1228
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,450
group thinking because you don't you
 

1229
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,640
group thinking because you don't you
know it's very hard to think about

1230
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:18,650
know it's very hard to think about
 

1231
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,190
know it's very hard to think about
individuals there's so much variability

1232
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:21,200
individuals there's so much variability
 

1233
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,490
individuals there's so much variability
but with data you can start to actually

1234
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:24,500
but with data you can start to actually
 

1235
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,130
but with data you can start to actually
say you know what group thinking is too

1236
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:27,140
say you know what group thinking is too
 

1237
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,530
say you know what group thinking is too
crude you're actually doing more

1238
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:29,540
crude you're actually doing more
 

1239
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,360
crude you're actually doing more
discrimination by thinking in terms of

1240
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:31,370
discrimination by thinking in terms of
 

1241
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,460
discrimination by thinking in terms of
groups and individuals can you linger on

1242
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:33,470
groups and individuals can you linger on
 

1243
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,040
groups and individuals can you linger on
that kind of idea of group versus

1244
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,050
that kind of idea of group versus
 

1245
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,730
that kind of idea of group versus
individual and ethics and and is it good

1246
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:39,740
individual and ethics and and is it good
 

1247
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,740
individual and ethics and and is it good
to continue thinking in terms of groups

1248
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:41,750
to continue thinking in terms of groups
 

1249
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,640
to continue thinking in terms of groups
in in algorithms so let me start by

1250
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:45,650
in in algorithms so let me start by
 

1251
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,980
in in algorithms so let me start by
answering a very good high level

1252
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:47,990
answering a very good high level
 

1253
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,100
answering a very good high level
question with a slightly narrow

1254
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,110
question with a slightly narrow
 

1255
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,500
question with a slightly narrow
technical response which is these group

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:53,510
technical response which is these group
 

1257
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,180
technical response which is these group
definitions of fairness like here's a

1258
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,190
definitions of fairness like here's a
 

1259
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:57,160
definitions of fairness like here's a
few groups like different racial groups

1260
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,170
few groups like different racial groups
 

1261
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:59,160
few groups like different racial groups
may be gender groups may be age

1262
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,170
may be gender groups may be age
 

1263
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,470
may be gender groups may be age
what-have-you and let's make sure that

1264
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:02,480
what-have-you and let's make sure that
 

1265
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,460
what-have-you and let's make sure that
you know from none of these groups do we

1266
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:05,470
you know from none of these groups do we
 

1267
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,080
you know from none of these groups do we
you know have a false negative rate

1268
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,090
you know have a false negative rate
 

1269
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,760
you know have a false negative rate
which is much higher than any other one

1270
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:09,770
which is much higher than any other one
 

1271
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,770
which is much higher than any other one
of these groups okay so these are kind

1272
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:11,780
of these groups okay so these are kind
 

1273
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,900
of these groups okay so these are kind
of classic group aggregate notions of

1274
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:13,910
of classic group aggregate notions of
 

1275
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,360
of classic group aggregate notions of
fairness and you know but at the end of

1276
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:16,370
fairness and you know but at the end of
 

1277
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,160
fairness and you know but at the end of
the day an individual you can think of

1278
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:18,170
the day an individual you can think of
 

1279
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,960
the day an individual you can think of
as a combination of all of their

1280
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:19,970
as a combination of all of their
 

1281
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,490
as a combination of all of their
attributes right they're a member of a

1282
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:21,500
attributes right they're a member of a
 

1283
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,210
attributes right they're a member of a
racial group they're they have a gender

1284
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:24,220
racial group they're they have a gender
 

1285
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,520
racial group they're they have a gender
they have an age you know and many other

1286
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:27,530
they have an age you know and many other
 

1287
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,620
they have an age you know and many other
you know demographic properties that are

1288
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:29,630
you know demographic properties that are
 

1289
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:32,380
you know demographic properties that are
not biological but that you know are are

1290
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:32,390
not biological but that you know are are
 

1291
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:35,080
not biological but that you know are are
still you know very strong determinants

1292
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,090
still you know very strong determinants
 

1293
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,680
still you know very strong determinants
of outcome and personality in the light

1294
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:37,690
of outcome and personality in the light
 

1295
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:41,320
of outcome and personality in the light
so one I think useful spectrum is to

1296
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,330
so one I think useful spectrum is to
 

1297
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:44,620
so one I think useful spectrum is to
sort of think about that array between

1298
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:44,630
sort of think about that array between
 

1299
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:45,560
sort of think about that array between
the group and this

1300
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:45,570
the group and this
 

1301
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,290
the group and this
individual and to realize that in some

1302
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:48,300
individual and to realize that in some
 

1303
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,870
individual and to realize that in some
ways asking for fairness at the

1304
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
ways asking for fairness at the
 

1305
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,570
ways asking for fairness at the
individual level is to sort of ask for

1306
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:53,580
individual level is to sort of ask for
 

1307
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,320
individual level is to sort of ask for
group fairness simultaneously for all

1308
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,330
group fairness simultaneously for all
 

1309
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,270
group fairness simultaneously for all
possible combinations of groups so in

1310
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,280
possible combinations of groups so in
 

1311
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
possible combinations of groups so in
particular so in particular yes

1312
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:01,290
particular so in particular yes
 

1313
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:04,690
particular so in particular yes
you know if I build a predictive model

1314
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:04,700
you know if I build a predictive model
 

1315
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,130
you know if I build a predictive model
that meets some definition of fairness

1316
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:07,140
that meets some definition of fairness
 

1317
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,940
that meets some definition of fairness
by race by gender by age by

what-have-you marginally to get a

00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,310
what-have-you marginally to get a
 

1321
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,160
what-have-you marginally to get a
slightly technical sort of independently

1322
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,170
slightly technical sort of independently
 

1323
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:19,790
slightly technical sort of independently
I shouldn't expect that model to not to

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:19,800
I shouldn't expect that model to not to
 

1325
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,850
I shouldn't expect that model to not to
discriminate against disabled Hispanic

1326
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:22,860
discriminate against disabled Hispanic
 

1327
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,550
discriminate against disabled Hispanic
women over age 55 making less than fifty

1328
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:25,560
women over age 55 making less than fifty
 

1329
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
women over age 55 making less than fifty
thousand dollars a year or annually even

1330
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:27,570
thousand dollars a year or annually even
 

1331
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,180
thousand dollars a year or annually even
though I might have protected each one

1332
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,190
though I might have protected each one
 

1333
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,780
though I might have protected each one
of those attributes marginally so the

1334
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:32,790
of those attributes marginally so the
 

1335
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,280
of those attributes marginally so the
optimization actually that's a

1336
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:34,290
optimization actually that's a
 

1337
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,450
optimization actually that's a
fascinating way to put it

1338
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:35,460
fascinating way to put it
 

1339
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,080
fascinating way to put it
so you're just optimizing the one way to

1340
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,090
so you're just optimizing the one way to
 

1341
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,720
so you're just optimizing the one way to
achieve the optimizing fairness for

1342
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:41,730
achieve the optimizing fairness for
 

1343
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,910
achieve the optimizing fairness for
individuals just to add more and more

1344
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:43,920
individuals just to add more and more
 

1345
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,590
individuals just to add more and more
definitions of groups at each and it's

1346
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:45,600
definitions of groups at each and it's
 

1347
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,210
definitions of groups at each and it's
right along so you know at the end of

1348
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:47,220
right along so you know at the end of
 

1349
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,620
right along so you know at the end of
the day we could think of all of

1350
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:48,630
the day we could think of all of
 

1351
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,140
the day we could think of all of
ourselves as groups of size one because

1352
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,150
ourselves as groups of size one because
 

1353
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,060
ourselves as groups of size one because
eventually there's some attribute that

1354
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:53,070
eventually there's some attribute that
 

1355
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,860
eventually there's some attribute that
separates you from me and everybody from

1356
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:54,870
separates you from me and everybody from
 

1357
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,610
separates you from me and everybody from
everybody else in the world okay and so

1358
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:57,620
everybody else in the world okay and so
 

1359
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,220
everybody else in the world okay and so
it is possible to put you know these

1360
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,230
it is possible to put you know these
 

1361
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,110
it is possible to put you know these
incredibly coarse ways of thinking about

1362
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,120
incredibly coarse ways of thinking about
 

1363
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,940
incredibly coarse ways of thinking about
their nests and these very very

1364
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:04,950
their nests and these very very
 

1365
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,310
their nests and these very very
individualistic specific ways on a

1366
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,320
individualistic specific ways on a
 

1367
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,120
individualistic specific ways on a
common scale and you know one of the

1368
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,130
common scale and you know one of the
 

1369
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,530
common scale and you know one of the
things we've worked on from a research

1370
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:12,540
things we've worked on from a research
 

1371
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,600
things we've worked on from a research
perspective is you know so we sort of

1373
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,330

know how to you know we in relative

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:17,340
know how to you know we in relative
 

1375
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,040
know how to you know we in relative

1383
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,210
of sensible tractable realistic fairness
guarantees at the individual level but

1384
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:29,220
guarantees at the individual level but
 

1385
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,580
guarantees at the individual level but
maybe we could start creeping towards

1386
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:31,590
maybe we could start creeping towards
 

1387
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,950
maybe we could start creeping towards
that by dealing with more you know

1388
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:33,960
that by dealing with more you know
 

1389
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,290
that by dealing with more you know
refined subgroups I mean we we gave a

1390
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:36,300
refined subgroups I mean we we gave a
 

1391
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,420
refined subgroups I mean we we gave a

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,550
you protect you you you enforce some
definite definition of fairness for a

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:43,560
definite definition of fairness for a

bunch of marginal attributes or features

1398
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:45,470
bunch of marginal attributes or features
 

1399
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:47,230
bunch of marginal attributes or features
but then you find yourself

1400
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:47,240
but then you find yourself
 

1401
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,760
but then you find yourself
discriminating against a combination of

discriminating against a combination of
 

1403
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:50,600
discriminating against a combination of
them we call that fairness

1404
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:50,610
them we call that fairness
 

1405
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:53,450
them we call that fairness
gerrymandering because like political

1406
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:53,460
gerrymandering because like political
 

1407
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:55,820
gerrymandering because like political
gerrymandering you know you're giving

1408
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:55,830
gerrymandering you know you're giving
 

1409
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,500
gerrymandering you know you're giving
some guarantee at the aggregate level

1410
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:57,510
some guarantee at the aggregate level
 

1411
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,700
some guarantee at the aggregate level
yes

1412
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:58,710
yes
 

1413
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,769
yes
but that when you kind of look in a more

1414
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:00,779
but that when you kind of look in a more
 

1415
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:03,080
but that when you kind of look in a more
granular way at what's going on you

1416
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,090
granular way at what's going on you
 

1417
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,250
granular way at what's going on you
realize that you're achieving that

1418
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:04,260
realize that you're achieving that
 

1419
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,130
realize that you're achieving that
aggregate guarantee by sort of favoring

1420
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:07,140
aggregate guarantee by sort of favoring
 

1421
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,810
aggregate guarantee by sort of favoring
some groups in discriminating against

1422
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:08,820
some groups in discriminating against
 

1423
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:12,230
some groups in discriminating against
other ones and and so there are you know

1424
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:12,240
other ones and and so there are you know
 

1425
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,970
other ones and and so there are you know
it's early days but there are

1426
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:13,980
it's early days but there are
 

1427
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,310
it's early days but there are
algorithmic approaches that let you

1428
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:16,320
algorithmic approaches that let you
 

1429
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,789
algorithmic approaches that let you
start creep and creeping towards that

1430
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
start creep and creeping towards that
 

1431
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,799
start creep and creeping towards that
you know individual end of the spectrum

it's interesting to be a researcher
trying to do for the most part technical

00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:15,170
trying to do for the most part technical
algorithmic work but Aaron and I both

algorithmic work but Aaron and I both

quickly learned you cannot do that and

1594
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:17,460
quickly learned you cannot do that and
 

1595
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,190
quickly learned you cannot do that and
then go out and talk about and expect

1596
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:19,200
then go out and talk about and expect
 

1597
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,450
then go out and talk about and expect
people to take it seriously if you're

1598
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,460
people to take it seriously if you're
 

1599
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,090
people to take it seriously if you're

debates that are
 

1603
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:27,539
debates that are
entirely extra algorithmic right there

00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:27,549
entirely extra algorithmic right there
 

1605
00:33:27,549 --> 00:33:30,060
entirely extra algorithmic right there
they're not about you know algorithms

1606

they're not about you know algorithms
 

1607
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,230
they're not about you know algorithms
and making algorithms better they're

1608
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:31,240
and making algorithms better they're
 

1609
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,820

00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,230
like what should society be protecting
in the first place when you discuss the

1614
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:37,240
in the first place when you discuss the
 

1615
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,169
in the first place when you discuss the
fairness an algorithm that uh that

1616

fairness an algorithm that uh that
 

1617
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:41,700
fairness an algorithm that uh that
achieves fairness whether in the

achieves fairness whether in the
 

1619
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,580
achieves fairness whether in the
constraints and the objective function

00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:49,650
there's an immediate kind of analysis
you can perform which is saying if you

00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:49,660
you can perform which is saying if you
 

1625

you can perform which is saying if you
care about fairness in gender this is

1626
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:53,410
care about fairness in gender this is
 

1627
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:56,820
care about fairness in gender this is
the amount that you have to pay for in

1628
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:56,830
the amount that you have to pay for in
 

1629
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,320
the amount that you have to pay for in
terms of the performance of the system

like do you is there a role for the

1632
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:00,940
like do you is there a role for the
 

1633
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,880
like do you is there a role for the
statements like that in a table and a

1634
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:02,890
statements like that in a table and a
 

1635
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,060
statements like that in a table and a
paper or do you want to really not touch

1636
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:06,070
paper or do you want to really not touch
 

1637
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,580
paper or do you want to really not touch
that like you know we want to touch that

1638
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:08,590
that like you know we want to touch that
 

1639
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:10,770
that like you know we want to touch that
and we do touch it so I mean just just

1640
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:10,780
and we do touch it so I mean just just
 

1641
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,500
and we do touch it so I mean just just
again to make sure I'm not promising

1642
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:13,510
again to make sure I'm not promising
 

1643
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:16,710
again to make sure I'm not promising
your your viewers more than we know how

1644
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:16,720
your your viewers more than we know how
 

1645
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,780
your your viewers more than we know how
to provide but if you pick a definition

1646
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:18,790
to provide but if you pick a definition
 

1647
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,310
to provide but if you pick a definition
of fairness like I'm worried about

1648
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
of fairness like I'm worried about
 

1649
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,290
of fairness like I'm worried about
gender discrimination and you pick a

1650
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:22,300
gender discrimination and you pick a
 

1651
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,290
gender discrimination and you pick a
notion of harm like false rejection for

1652
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:25,300
notion of harm like false rejection for
 

1653
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,540
notion of harm like false rejection for
a loan for example and you give me a

1654
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:27,550
a loan for example and you give me a
 

1655
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,820
a loan for example and you give me a
model I can definitely first of all go

1656
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:29,830
model I can definitely first of all go
 

1657
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,740
model I can definitely first of all go
on at that model it's easy for me to go

1658
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:31,750
on at that model it's easy for me to go
 

1659
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,159
on at that model it's easy for me to go
you know from data to kind of say like

1660
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:35,169
you know from data to kind of say like
 

1661
00:34:35,169 --> 00:34:37,830
you know from data to kind of say like
okay your false rejection rate on women

1662
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:37,840
okay your false rejection rate on women
 

1663
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,139
okay your false rejection rate on women
is this much higher than it is on men

1664
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:40,149
is this much higher than it is on men
 

1665
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:44,550
is this much higher than it is on men
okay but you know once you also put the

1666
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:44,560
okay but you know once you also put the
 

1667
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,349
okay but you know once you also put the
fairness in to your objective function I

1668
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:46,359
fairness in to your objective function I
 

1669
00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:47,520
fairness in to your objective function I
mean I think the table that you're

1670
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:47,530
mean I think the table that you're
 

1671
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:49,500
mean I think the table that you're
talking about is you know what we would

talking about is you know what we would
 

1673
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,810
talking about is you know what we would
call the Pareto curve right you can

00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:51,820
call the Pareto curve right you can
 

1675
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:55,290
call the Pareto curve right you can
literally trace out and we give examples

I want to go from 17 percent error down

1722
00:35:54,539 --> 00:35:54,549
I want to go from 17 percent error down
 

1723
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,180
I want to go from 17 percent error down
to 16 percent error what will be the

1724
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,190
to 16 percent error what will be the
 

1725
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,029
to 16 percent error what will be the
increase in unfairness that I've

1726
00:35:59,029 --> 00:35:59,039
increase in unfairness that I've
 

1727
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,339
increase in unfairness that I've
experienced as a result of that and and

1728
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:02,349
experienced as a result of that and and
 

1729
00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,120
experienced as a result of that and and
so this curve kind of specifies the you

1730
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,130
so this curve kind of specifies the you
 

1731
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,479
so this curve kind of specifies the you
know kind of undaunted models models

1732
00:36:09,479 --> 00:36:09,489
know kind of undaunted models models
 

1733
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:12,089
know kind of undaunted models models
that are off that curve are you know can

1734
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:12,099
that are off that curve are you know can
 

1735
00:36:12,099 --> 00:36:13,650
that are off that curve are you know can
be strictly improved in one or both

1736
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:13,660
be strictly improved in one or both
 

1737
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,450
be strictly improved in one or both
dimensions you can you know either make

1738
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:15,460
dimensions you can you know either make
 

1739
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,769
dimensions you can you know either make
the error better or the unfairness

1740
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:16,779
the error better or the unfairness
 

1741
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,769
the error better or the unfairness
better or both and I think our view is

1742
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:19,779
better or both and I think our view is
 

1743
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:24,059
better or both and I think our view is
that not only are are these objects

1744
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:24,069
that not only are are these objects
 

1745
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:25,589
that not only are are these objects
these Pareto curves

1746
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
these Pareto curves
 

1747
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,299
these Pareto curves
you know there's efficient frontiers as

1748
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:27,309
you know there's efficient frontiers as
 

1749
00:36:27,309 --> 00:36:31,759
you know there's efficient frontiers as
you might call them not only are they

1750
00:36:31,759 --> 00:36:31,769
you might call them not only are they
 

1751
00:36:31,769 --> 00:36:35,339
you might call them not only are they
valuable scientific objects I actually

1752
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:35,349
valuable scientific objects I actually
 

1753
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:38,460
valuable scientific objects I actually
think that they in the near term might

1754
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:38,470
think that they in the near term might
 

1755
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,089
think that they in the near term might
need to be the interface between

researchers working in the field and and
 

1759
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:46,289
researchers working in the field and and
stakeholders and given problems so you

1760
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:46,299
stakeholders and given problems so you
 

1761
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:51,349
stakeholders and given problems so you
know you could really imagine telling a

1762
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:51,359
know you could really imagine telling a
 

1763
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,930
know you could really imagine telling a
criminal jurisdiction look if you're

1764
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:54,940
criminal jurisdiction look if you're
 

1765
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,940
criminal jurisdiction look if you're
concerned about racial fairness but

1766
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:56,950
concerned about racial fairness but
 

1767
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:58,859
concerned about racial fairness but
you're also concerned about accuracy you

1768
00:36:58,859 --> 00:36:58,869
you're also concerned about accuracy you
 

1769
00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:02,700
you're also concerned about accuracy you
want to you know you want to release on

1770
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:02,710
want to you know you want to release on
 

1771
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,470
want to you know you want to release on
parole people that are not going to

1772
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:04,480
parole people that are not going to
 

1773
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,420
parole people that are not going to
recommit a violent crime and you don't

1774
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,430
recommit a violent crime and you don't
 

1775
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,910
recommit a violent crime and you don't
want to release the ones who are so you

1776
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:08,920
want to release the ones who are so you
 

1777
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,069
want to release the ones who are so you
know that's accuracy but if you also

1778
00:37:11,069 --> 00:37:11,079
know that's accuracy but if you also
 

1779
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,049
know that's accuracy but if you also
care about those you know the mistakes

1780
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:13,059
care about those you know the mistakes
 

1781
00:37:13,059 --> 00:37:15,180

you make not being disproportionately on

you make not being disproportionately on
 

1783
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,940
you make not being disproportionately on
one racial group or another you can you

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:17,950
one racial group or another you can you
 

1785
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,950
one racial group or another you can you
can show this curve I'm hoping that in

1786
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:19,960
can show this curve I'm hoping that in
 

1787
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,809
can show this curve I'm hoping that in
the near future it'll be possible to

1788
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:21,819
the near future it'll be possible to
 

1789
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,390
the near future it'll be possible to
explain these curves to non-technical

1790
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:24,400
explain these curves to non-technical
 

1791
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,150
explain these curves to non-technical
people that have that are the ones that

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:27,160
people that have that are the ones that
 

1793
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,249
people that have that are the ones that
have to make the decision where do we

1794
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:29,259
have to make the decision where do we
 

1795
00:37:29,259 --> 00:37:30,900
have to make the decision where do we
want to be on this curve like what are

1796
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:30,910
want to be on this curve like what are
 

1797
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:35,130
want to be on this curve like what are
the relative merits or value of having

the relative merits or value of having
 

1799
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,430
the relative merits or value of having
lower error versus lower unfairness you

1800
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:38,440
lower error versus lower unfairness you
 

1801
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,749
lower error versus lower unfairness you
know that's not something computer

1802
00:37:39,749 --> 00:37:39,759
know that's not something computer
 

1803
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:42,509
know that's not something computer
scientists should be deciding for

1804
00:37:42,509 --> 00:37:42,519

1811
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:51,520
policymakers the regulator's that's who
should be making these decisions

1812
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,530
should be making these decisions
 

1813
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:53,680
should be making these decisions
but I think and hope that they can be

1814
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:53,690
but I think and hope that they can be
 

1815
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,650
but I think and hope that they can be
made to understand that these trade-offs

1816
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:55,660
made to understand that these trade-offs
 

1817
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,680
made to understand that these trade-offs
generally exist and that you need to

1818
00:37:59,680 --> 00:37:59,690
generally exist and that you need to
 

1819
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,200
generally exist and that you need to
pick a point and like and ignoring the

1820
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,210
pick a point and like and ignoring the
 

1821
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,820
pick a point and like and ignoring the
trade-off you know you're implicitly

1822
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:03,830
trade-off you know you're implicitly
 

1823
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:06,790
trade-off you know you're implicitly
picking a point anyway right right you

1824
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:06,800
picking a point anyway right right you
 

1825
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,780
picking a point anyway right right you
just don't know it and you're not

1826
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:07,790
just don't know it and you're not
 

1827
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:09,970
just don't know it and you're not
admitting it it's just a link out on the

1828
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:09,980
admitting it it's just a link out on the
 

1829
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:11,620
admitting it it's just a link out on the
point of trade-offs I think that's a

1830
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:11,630
point of trade-offs I think that's a
 

1831
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,860
point of trade-offs I think that's a
really important thing to sort of think

1832
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:14,870
really important thing to sort of think
 

1833
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,350
really important thing to sort of think
about so you think when we start to

1834
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:17,360
about so you think when we start to
 

1835
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,590
about so you think when we start to
optimize for fairness there's almost

1836
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:20,600
optimize for fairness there's almost
 

1837
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,930
optimize for fairness there's almost

trade-offs can you like what's the

1840
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,150
trade-offs can you like what's the
 

1841
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:28,870
trade-offs can you like what's the
trade-off between just to clarify

00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:28,880
trade-off between just to clarify

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:30,770
they've been some sort of technical
 

1845
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:36,300
they've been some sort of technical
terms thrown around but a sort of a

1846
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,310
terms thrown around but a sort of a
 

1847
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,060
terms thrown around but a sort of a
perfectly fair world why is that

1848
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,070
perfectly fair world why is that
 

1849
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:42,780
perfectly fair world why is that
why will somebody be upset about that

1850
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:42,790
why will somebody be upset about that
 

1851
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,280
why will somebody be upset about that
the specific trade-off I talked about

know the probability or frequency with
 

1865
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,240
know the probability or frequency with
which you release somebody on parole who

1866
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:04,250
which you release somebody on parole who
 

1867
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,070
which you release somebody on parole who
then goes on to recommit a violent crime

1868
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:06,080
then goes on to recommit a violent crime
 

1869
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,490
then goes on to recommit a violent crime
or keep incarcerated somebody who would

1870
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:09,500
or keep incarcerated somebody who would
 

1871
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,110
or keep incarcerated somebody who would
not have recommitted a violent crime so

1872
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:11,120
not have recommitted a violent crime so
 

1873
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:15,070
not have recommitted a violent crime so
in case of awarding somebody parole or

1874
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:15,080
in case of awarding somebody parole or

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,650
in case of awarding somebody parole or
giving somebody Perl or letting them out

1876
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:17,660
giving somebody Perl or letting them out
 

1877
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,230
giving somebody Perl or letting them out
on parole you don't want them to

1878
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:20,240
on parole you don't want them to
 

1879
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,570
on parole you don't want them to
recommit a crime so it's your system

1880
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:22,580
recommit a crime so it's your system
 

1881
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,540
recommit a crime so it's your system

failed in prediction if they happen to
 

1883
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,420
failed in prediction if they happen to

1884
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:28,430
do a crime okay so that's the performer
 

1885
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,700

that's one axis right and what's the

1886
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:30,710
that's one axis right and what's the
 

1887
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,830
that's one axis right and what's the
fairness axis so then the fairness axis

1888
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:32,840
fairness axis so then the fairness axis
 

1889
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,350
fairness axis so then the fairness axis

why that's unfair
 

1909
00:40:03,019 --> 00:40:06,370
why that's unfair
why unfairness is there the the

unfairness you want to get rid of is the
in the judges mind the bias of having

the system another way that's been
 

1923
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,789
the system another way that's been
debated is equality of opportunity

1924
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:27,799
debated is equality of opportunity
 

1925
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,930
debated is equality of opportunity
versus equality of outcome and there's a

1926
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:30,940
versus equality of outcome and there's a
 

1927
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,549
versus equality of outcome and there's a
weird dance there that's really

1928
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:33,559
weird dance there that's really
 

1929
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:34,690
weird dance there that's really
difficult to get right

1930
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:34,700
difficult to get right
 

1931
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
difficult to get right
and we don't as what the firm ative

1932
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:36,710
and we don't as what the firm ative
 

1933
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,960
and we don't as what the firm ative
action is exploring that space right and

1934
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:40,970
action is exploring that space right and
 

1935
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,620
action is exploring that space right and
then we this also quickly you know

1936
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:43,630
then we this also quickly you know
 

1937
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:47,559
then we this also quickly you know
bleeds into questions like well maybe if

1938
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:47,569
bleeds into questions like well maybe if
 

1939
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:50,019
bleeds into questions like well maybe if
one group really does recommit crimes at

1940
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:50,029
one group really does recommit crimes at
 

1941
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:53,470
one group really does recommit crimes at
a higher rate the reason for that is

1942
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:53,480
a higher rate the reason for that is
 

1943
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,329
a higher rate the reason for that is
that at some earlier point in the

1944
00:40:55,329 --> 00:40:55,339
that at some earlier point in the
 

1945
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:57,400
that at some earlier point in the
pipeline or earlier in their lives they

1946
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:57,410
pipeline or earlier in their lives they
 

1947
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,529
pipeline or earlier in their lives they
didn't receive the same resources that

1948
00:40:59,529 --> 00:40:59,539
didn't receive the same resources that
 

1949
00:40:59,539 --> 00:41:02,529
didn't receive the same resources that
the other group did right and that and

1950
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:02,539
the other group did right and that and
 

1951
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,200
the other group did right and that and
so you know there's always in in kind of

1952
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:05,210
so you know there's always in in kind of
 

1953
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:06,940
so you know there's always in in kind of
fairness discussions the possibility

1954
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:06,950
fairness discussions the possibility
 

1955
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:10,180
fairness discussions the possibility
that the the real injustice came earlier

1956
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:10,190
that the the real injustice came earlier
 

1957
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:11,920
that the the real injustice came earlier
right earlier in this individuals life

1958
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:11,930
right earlier in this individuals life
 

1959
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:14,759
right earlier in this individuals life
earlier in this group's history etc etc

1960
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:14,769
earlier in this group's history etc etc
 

1961
00:41:14,769 --> 00:41:17,470
earlier in this group's history etc etc
and and so a lot of the fairness

1962
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:17,480
and and so a lot of the fairness
 

1963
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,019
and and so a lot of the fairness
discussion is almost the goal is for it

1964
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:20,029
discussion is almost the goal is for it
 

1965
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:23,109
discussion is almost the goal is for it
to be a corrective mechanism to account

1966
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:23,119
to be a corrective mechanism to account
 

1967
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,480
to be a corrective mechanism to account
for the injustice earlier in life by

1968
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:25,490
for the injustice earlier in life by
 

1969
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:27,249
for the injustice earlier in life by
some definitions of fairness or some

1970
00:41:27,249 --> 00:41:27,259
some definitions of fairness or some
 

1971
00:41:27,259 --> 00:41:29,829
some definitions of fairness or some
theories of fairness yeah others would

1972
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:29,839
theories of fairness yeah others would
 

1973
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,630
theories of fairness yeah others would
say like look it's it's you know it's

1974
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:31,640
say like look it's it's you know it's
 

1975
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,640
say like look it's it's you know it's
not to correct that injustice it's just

1976
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,650
not to correct that injustice it's just
 

1977
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:36,190
not to correct that injustice it's just
to kind of level the playing field right

1978
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,200
to kind of level the playing field right
 

1979
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,680
to kind of level the playing field right
now and Nanyan coarser a falsely

1980
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:38,690
now and Nanyan coarser a falsely

incarcerate more people of one group
 

1983
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:42,430
incarcerate more people of one group
than another group but I mean do you

1984
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:42,440
than another group but I mean do you
 

1985
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,870
than another group but I mean do you
think just it might be helpful just to

1986
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:43,880
think just it might be helpful just to
 

1987
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:48,539
think just it might be helpful just to
demystify a little bit about the diff

1988
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:48,549
demystify a little bit about the diff
 

1989
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:52,410
demystify a little bit about the diff
bias or unfairness can come into

1995
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,450

these examples before
but you know let's say I'm building a

but you know let's say I'm building a
 

2001

00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,470
of ways you could think about addressing
this one is to deliberately put into the

point is to just show that if society or

on those sorts of things there's a way

00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:45,410
on those sorts of things there's a way
 

2167
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,430
on those sorts of things there's a way
of encoding that into algorithms in many

2168
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:48,440
of encoding that into algorithms in many
 

2169
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,890
of encoding that into algorithms in many
cases not in all cases one other

cases not in all cases one other
 

2171
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,359

misconception though hopefully we

2172
00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:52,369
misconception though hopefully we
 

2173
00:45:52,369 --> 00:45:55,539
misconception though hopefully we
definitely dispel is sometimes people

read the title of the book and I think

2176
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:57,049
read the title of the book and I think
 

2177
00:45:57,049 --> 00:45:59,859
read the title of the book and I think
not unnaturally fear that what we're

2178
00:45:59,859 --> 00:45:59,869
not unnaturally fear that what we're
 

2179
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:01,509
not unnaturally fear that what we're
suggesting is that the algorithms

2180
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:01,519
suggesting is that the algorithms
 

2181
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:03,309
suggesting is that the algorithms
themselves should decide what those

2182
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:03,319
themselves should decide what those
 

2183
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:05,079
themselves should decide what those
social norms are and develop their own

2184
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:05,089
social norms are and develop their own
 

2185
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:07,180
social norms are and develop their own
notions of fairness and privacy or

2186
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:07,190
notions of fairness and privacy or
 

2187
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,890
notions of fairness and privacy or
ethics and we're definitely not

2188
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:08,900
ethics and we're definitely not
 

2189
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,989

ethical algorithm by the way and they

2192
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:12,559
ethical algorithm by the way and they
 

2193
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:14,019
ethical algorithm by the way and they
didn't think of that interpretation of

2194
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:14,029
didn't think of that interpretation of
 

2195
00:46:14,029 --> 00:46:16,089
didn't think of that interpretation of
the title that's interesting yeah yeah I

2196
00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:16,099
the title that's interesting yeah yeah I
 

2197
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:18,039
the title that's interesting yeah yeah I
mean especially these days were people

2198
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:18,049
mean especially these days were people
 

2199
00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:20,499
mean especially these days were people
are you know concerned about the robots

2200
00:46:20,499 --> 00:46:20,509
are you know concerned about the robots
 

2201
00:46:20,509 --> 00:46:22,420
are you know concerned about the robots
becoming our overlords the idea that the

becoming our overlords the idea that the
 

2203
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,939
becoming our overlords the idea that the
robots would also like sort of develop

2204
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:24,949
robots would also like sort of develop

their own social norms is you know

2206
00:46:27,069 --> 00:46:27,079
their own social norms is you know
 

2207
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:29,769
their own social norms is you know
just one step away from that but I do

2208
00:46:29,769 --> 00:46:29,779
just one step away from that but I do
 

2209
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:31,749
just one step away from that but I do
think you know obviously despite

2210
00:46:31,749 --> 00:46:31,759
think you know obviously despite

00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:34,569
think you know obviously despite
disclaimer that people like us shouldn't

2212
00:46:34,569 --> 00:46:34,579
disclaimer that people like us shouldn't
 

2213
00:46:34,579 --> 00:46:37,269
disclaimer that people like us shouldn't
be making those decisions for society we

2214
00:46:37,269 --> 00:46:37,279
be making those decisions for society we
 

2215
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:39,219
be making those decisions for society we
are kind of living in a world where in

2216
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:39,229
are kind of living in a world where in
 

2217
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,319
are kind of living in a world where in
many ways computer scientists have made

2218
00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:41,329
many ways computer scientists have made
 

2219
00:46:41,329 --> 00:46:43,719
many ways computer scientists have made
some decisions that have fundamentally

2220
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:43,729
some decisions that have fundamentally
 

2221
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:46,029
some decisions that have fundamentally
changed the nature of our society and

2222
00:46:46,029 --> 00:46:46,039
changed the nature of our society and
 

2223
00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:48,969
changed the nature of our society and
democracy and in sort of civil discourse

2224
00:46:48,969 --> 00:46:48,979
democracy and in sort of civil discourse
 

2225
00:46:48,979 --> 00:46:51,579
democracy and in sort of civil discourse
and deliberation in ways that I think

2226
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:51,589
and deliberation in ways that I think
 

2227
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:54,400
and deliberation in ways that I think
most people generally feel are bad these

2228
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:54,410
most people generally feel are bad these
 

2229
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:57,009
most people generally feel are bad these
days right so but they had to make so if

2230
00:46:57,009 --> 00:46:57,019
days right so but they had to make so if
 

2231
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:58,989
days right so but they had to make so if
we look at people at the heads of

2232
00:46:58,989 --> 00:46:58,999
we look at people at the heads of
 

2233
00:46:58,999 --> 00:47:01,420
we look at people at the heads of
companies and so on they had to make

2234
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:01,430
companies and so on they had to make
 

2235
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:03,190
companies and so on they had to make
those decisions right there has to be

2236
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:03,200
those decisions right there has to be
 

2237
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,620
those decisions right there has to be
decisions so there's there's two options

2238
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:05,630
decisions so there's there's two options
 

2239
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:08,709
decisions so there's there's two options
either you kind of put your head in the

2240
00:47:08,709 --> 00:47:08,719
either you kind of put your head in the
 

2241
00:47:08,719 --> 00:47:11,109
either you kind of put your head in the
sand and don't think about these things

2242
00:47:11,109 --> 00:47:11,119
sand and don't think about these things
 

2243
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,329
sand and don't think about these things
and just let they all go and do what it

2244
00:47:13,329 --> 00:47:13,339
and just let they all go and do what it
 

2245
00:47:13,339 --> 00:47:15,609
and just let they all go and do what it
does or you make decisions about what

2246
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:15,619
does or you make decisions about what
 

2247
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:18,190
does or you make decisions about what
you value you know open injecting moral

2248
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:18,200
you value you know open injecting moral
 

2249
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:21,309
you value you know open injecting moral
values into that with look I don't never

2250
00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:21,319
values into that with look I don't never
 

2251
00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:23,289
values into that with look I don't never
mean to be an apologist for the tech

2252
00:47:23,289 --> 00:47:23,299
mean to be an apologist for the tech
 

2253
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:26,650
mean to be an apologist for the tech
industry but I think it's it's a little

2254
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:26,660
industry but I think it's it's a little
 

2255
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,680
industry but I think it's it's a little
bit too far to sort of say that explicit

2256
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:29,690
bit too far to sort of say that explicit
 

2257
00:47:29,690 --> 00:47:31,059
bit too far to sort of say that explicit
decisions were made about these things

2258
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:31,069
decisions were made about these things
 

2259
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:33,339
decisions were made about these things
so let's for instance take social media

2260
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:33,349
so let's for instance take social media
 

2261
00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:36,489
so let's for instance take social media
platforms right so like many inventions

2262
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:36,499
platforms right so like many inventions
 

2263
00:47:36,499 --> 00:47:38,559
platforms right so like many inventions
in technology and computer science a lot

2264
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:38,569
in technology and computer science a lot
 

2265
00:47:38,569 --> 00:47:40,689
in technology and computer science a lot
of these platforms that we now use

2266
00:47:40,689 --> 00:47:40,699
of these platforms that we now use
 

2267
00:47:40,699 --> 00:47:44,559
of these platforms that we now use
regularly kind of started as curiosities

2268
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:44,569
regularly kind of started as curiosities
 

2269
00:47:44,569 --> 00:47:46,390
regularly kind of started as curiosities
right I remember when things like

2270
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:46,400
right I remember when things like
 

2271
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,400
right I remember when things like
Facebook came out in its predecessors

2272
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:48,410
Facebook came out in its predecessors
 

2273
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:49,839
Facebook came out in its predecessors
like Friendster which nobody even

2274
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:49,849
like Friendster which nobody even
 

2275
00:47:49,849 --> 00:47:53,289
like Friendster which nobody even
remembers now the people people really

2276
00:47:53,289 --> 00:47:53,299
remembers now the people people really
 

2277
00:47:53,299 --> 00:47:55,299
remembers now the people people really
wonder like what why would anybody want

2278
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:55,309
wonder like what why would anybody want
 

2279
00:47:55,309 --> 00:47:56,769
wonder like what why would anybody want
to spend time doing that you know what I

2280
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:56,779
to spend time doing that you know what I
 

2281
00:47:56,779 --> 00:47:58,630
to spend time doing that you know what I
mean even even the web when it first

2282
00:47:58,630 --> 00:47:58,640
mean even even the web when it first
 

2283
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,609
mean even even the web when it first
came out when it wasn't populated with

2284
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:00,619
came out when it wasn't populated with
 

2285
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:03,189
came out when it wasn't populated with
much content and it was largely kind of

2286
00:48:03,189 --> 00:48:03,199
much content and it was largely kind of
 

2287
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:05,289
much content and it was largely kind of
hobbyists building their own kind of

2288
00:48:05,289 --> 00:48:05,299
hobbyists building their own kind of
 

2289
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,479
hobbyists building their own kind of
ramshackle websites a lot of people

2290
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:07,489
ramshackle websites a lot of people
 

2291
00:48:07,489 --> 00:48:08,709
ramshackle websites a lot of people
looked at this this is like what is the

2292
00:48:08,709 --> 00:48:08,719
looked at this this is like what is the
 

2293
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,299
looked at this this is like what is the
purpose of this thing why is this

2294
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:10,309
purpose of this thing why is this
 

2295
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,799
purpose of this thing why is this
interesting who would want to do this

2296
00:48:11,799 --> 00:48:11,809
interesting who would want to do this
 

2297
00:48:11,809 --> 00:48:14,199
interesting who would want to do this
and so even things like Facebook and

2298
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:14,209
and so even things like Facebook and
 

2299
00:48:14,209 --> 00:48:15,489
and so even things like Facebook and
Twitter yes

2300
00:48:15,489 --> 00:48:15,499
Twitter yes
 

2301
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,170
Twitter yes
technical decisions were made by

2302
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:17,180
technical decisions were made by
 

2303
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:19,959
technical decisions were made by
engineers by scientists by executives in

2304
00:48:19,959 --> 00:48:19,969
engineers by scientists by executives in
 

2305
00:48:19,969 --> 00:48:22,719
engineers by scientists by executives in
the design of those platforms but you

2306
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:22,729
the design of those platforms but you
 

2307
00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:26,469
the design of those platforms but you
know I don't I don't think 10 years ago

2308
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:26,479
know I don't I don't think 10 years ago
 

2309
00:48:26,479 --> 00:48:30,640
know I don't I don't think 10 years ago
anyone anticipated that those platforms

2310
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:30,650
anyone anticipated that those platforms
 

2311
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:35,430
anyone anticipated that those platforms
for instance might kind of acquire undo

2312
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:35,440
for instance might kind of acquire undo
 

2313
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,380
for instance might kind of acquire undo
you know influence on political

2314
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,390
you know influence on political
 

2315
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,970
you know influence on political
discourse or on the outcomes of election

2316
00:48:40,970 --> 00:48:40,980
discourse or on the outcomes of election
 

2317
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,930
discourse or on the outcomes of election
and I think the scrutiny that these

2318
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:44,940
and I think the scrutiny that these
 

2319
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,730
and I think the scrutiny that these
companies are getting now is entirely

2320
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:46,740
companies are getting now is entirely
 

2321
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,099
companies are getting now is entirely
appropriate but I think it's a little

2322
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:49,109
appropriate but I think it's a little
 

2323
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:51,920
appropriate but I think it's a little
too harsh to kind of look at history and

2324
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:51,930
too harsh to kind of look at history and
 

2325
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:53,510
too harsh to kind of look at history and
sort of say like oh you should have been

2326
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:53,520
sort of say like oh you should have been
 

2327
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,950
sort of say like oh you should have been
able to anticipate that this would

2328
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:54,960
able to anticipate that this would
 

2329
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,020
able to anticipate that this would
happen with your platform and in this

2330
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,030
happen with your platform and in this
 

2331
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,550
happen with your platform and in this
sort of gaming chapter of the book one

2332
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:58,560
sort of gaming chapter of the book one
 

2333
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,620
sort of gaming chapter of the book one
of the points we're making is that you

2334
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:00,630
of the points we're making is that you
 

2335
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,530
of the points we're making is that you
know these platforms right they don't

2336
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:03,540
know these platforms right they don't
 

2337
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,839
know these platforms right they don't
operate in isolation so like that unlike

2338
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:05,849
operate in isolation so like that unlike
 

2339
00:49:05,849 --> 00:49:07,339
operate in isolation so like that unlike
the other topics we're discussing like

2340
00:49:07,339 --> 00:49:07,349
the other topics we're discussing like
 

2341
00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:09,380
the other topics we're discussing like
fairness and privacy like those are

2342
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:09,390
fairness and privacy like those are
 

2343
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:10,849
fairness and privacy like those are
really cases where algorithms can

2344
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:10,859
really cases where algorithms can
 

2345
00:49:10,859 --> 00:49:13,040
really cases where algorithms can
operate on your data and make decisions

2346
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:13,050
operate on your data and make decisions
 

2347
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,630
operate on your data and make decisions
about you and you're not even aware of

2348
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
about you and you're not even aware of
 

2349
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,089
about you and you're not even aware of
it okay things like Facebook and Twitter

2350
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:17,099
it okay things like Facebook and Twitter
 

2351
00:49:17,099 --> 00:49:19,490
it okay things like Facebook and Twitter
these are you know these are these are

2352
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:19,500
these are you know these are these are
 

2353
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,380
these are you know these are these are
systems right these are social systems

2354
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:21,390
systems right these are social systems
 

2355
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,980
systems right these are social systems
and their evolution even their technical

2356
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:24,990
and their evolution even their technical
 

2357
00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:26,359
and their evolution even their technical
evolution because machine learning is

2358
00:49:26,359 --> 00:49:26,369
evolution because machine learning is
 

2359
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:29,300
evolution because machine learning is
involved is driven in no small part by

2360
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,310
involved is driven in no small part by
 

2361
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:31,849
involved is driven in no small part by
the behavior of the users themselves and

2362
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:31,859
the behavior of the users themselves and
 

2363
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:33,829
the behavior of the users themselves and
how the users decide to adopt them and

2364
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
how the users decide to adopt them and
 

2365
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:37,910
how the users decide to adopt them and
how to use them and so you know you know

2366
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
how to use them and so you know you know
 

2367
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,200
how to use them and so you know you know
I'm kind of like who really knew that

2368
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:41,210
I'm kind of like who really knew that
 

2369
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:44,060
I'm kind of like who really knew that
the you know in until until we saw it

2370
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:44,070
the you know in until until we saw it
 

2371
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:45,800
the you know in until until we saw it
happen who knew that these things might

2372
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:45,810
happen who knew that these things might
 

2373
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:47,030
happen who knew that these things might
be able to influence the outcome of

2374
00:49:47,030 --> 00:49:47,040
be able to influence the outcome of
 

2375
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,599
be able to influence the outcome of
elections who knew that you know they

2376
00:49:50,599 --> 00:49:50,609
elections who knew that you know they
 

2377
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:53,150
elections who knew that you know they
might polarize political discourse

2378
00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:53,160
might polarize political discourse
 

2379
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,089
might polarize political discourse
because of the ability to you know

2380
00:49:56,089 --> 00:49:56,099
because of the ability to you know
 

2381
00:49:56,099 --> 00:49:57,890
because of the ability to you know
decide who you interact with on the

2382
00:49:57,890 --> 00:49:57,900
decide who you interact with on the
 

2383
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,430
decide who you interact with on the
platform and also with the platform

2384
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,440
platform and also with the platform
 

2385
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,569
platform and also with the platform
naturally using machine learning to

2386
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:02,579
naturally using machine learning to
 

2387
00:50:02,579 --> 00:50:04,609
naturally using machine learning to
optimize for your own interest that they

2388
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:04,619
optimize for your own interest that they
 

2389
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,380
optimize for your own interest that they
would further isolate us from each other

2390
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:06,390
would further isolate us from each other
 

2391
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,020
would further isolate us from each other
and you know like feed us all basically

2392
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:09,030
and you know like feed us all basically
 

2393
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,030
and you know like feed us all basically
just the stuff that we already agreed

2394
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
just the stuff that we already agreed
 

2395
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,910
just the stuff that we already agreed
with and I think it you know we've come

2396
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
with and I think it you know we've come
 

2397
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,099
with and I think it you know we've come
to that outcome I think largely but I

2398
00:50:16,099 --> 00:50:16,109
to that outcome I think largely but I
 

2399
00:50:16,109 --> 00:50:19,309
to that outcome I think largely but I
think it's something that we all learned

2400
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:19,319
think it's something that we all learned
 

2401
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:21,980
think it's something that we all learned

these things happen you asked like well

2404
00:50:25,359 --> 00:50:25,369
these things happen you asked like well
 

2405
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:28,790
these things happen you asked like well
are there algorithmic remedies to these

2406
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
are there algorithmic remedies to these
 

2407
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,030
are there algorithmic remedies to these
kinds of things and again these are big

2408
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:32,040
kinds of things and again these are big
 

2409
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,710
kinds of things and again these are big
problems that are not going to be solved

2410
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:33,720
problems that are not going to be solved
 

2411
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,809
problems that are not going to be solved
with you know somebody going in and

2412
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:35,819
with you know somebody going in and
 

2413
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,460
with you know somebody going in and
changing a few lines of code somewhere

2414
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,470
changing a few lines of code somewhere
 

2415
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:41,030
changing a few lines of code somewhere
in a social media platform but I do

2416
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:41,040
in a social media platform but I do
 

2417
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,370
in a social media platform but I do
think in many ways there are there are

2418
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:43,380
think in many ways there are there are
 

2419
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,750
think in many ways there are there are
definitely ways of making things better

2420
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:44,760
definitely ways of making things better
 

2421
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,579
definitely ways of making things better
I mean like an obvious recommendation

2422
00:50:46,579 --> 00:50:46,589
I mean like an obvious recommendation
 

2423
00:50:46,589 --> 00:50:48,319
I mean like an obvious recommendation
that we we make at some point in the

2424
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:48,329
that we we make at some point in the
 

2425
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:50,750
that we we make at some point in the
book is like look you know to the extent

2426
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:50,760
book is like look you know to the extent
 

2427
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,569
book is like look you know to the extent
that we think that machine learning

algorithms have models right and they
 

2441
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,740
algorithms have models right and they
kind of place people in some kind of

2442
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:12,750
kind of place people in some kind of
 

2443
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,530
kind of place people in some kind of
metric space and and they place content

2444
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:15,540
metric space and and they place content
 

2445
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,720
metric space and and they place content
in that space and they sort of know the

00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:17,730
in that space and they sort of know the
 

2447
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:20,030

particular type of content and by the
 

2451
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:24,470
particular type of content and by the
same token they also probably have that

2452
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
same token they also probably have that
 

2453
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,300
same token they also probably have that
that same model probably gives you a

00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:26,310
that same model probably gives you a
 

2455
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,970
that same model probably gives you a
good idea of the stuff I'm likely to

good idea of the stuff I'm likely to
 

2457
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,830
good idea of the stuff I'm likely to
violently disagree whether it be

00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:30,840
violently disagree whether it be

00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,190
violently disagree whether it be
offended by okay so you know in this

tune it says like instead of showing
 

2465
00:51:37,950 --> 00:51:40,640

people only what they like and what they
 

2467
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:43,310
people only what they like and what they
want let's show them some stuff that we

want let's show them some stuff that we
 

2469
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,660
want let's show them some stuff that we
think that they don't like or that's a

00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:44,670
think that they don't like or that's a
 

2471
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:47,000
think that they don't like or that's a
little bit further away and you could

little bit further away and you could
 

2473
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,730
little bit further away and you could
even imagine users being able to control

this you know just like a everybody gets

2476
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:51,990
this you know just like a everybody gets
 

2477
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:54,950
this you know just like a everybody gets
a slider and that slider says like you

2478
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
a slider and that slider says like you
 

2479
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,590
a slider and that slider says like you
know how much stuff do you want to see

2480
00:51:57,590 --> 00:51:57,600
know how much stuff do you want to see
 

2481
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,900
know how much stuff do you want to see
that's kind of you know you might

00:51:59,900 --> 00:51:59,910
that's kind of you know you might
 

2483
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,670
that's kind of you know you might
disagree with or is at least further

2484
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:01,680
disagree with or is at least further
 

2485
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,110

from your interests I can it's almost

00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:03,120
from your interests I can it's almost
 

2487
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,650
from your interests I can it's almost
like an exploration button so just get

your intuition do you think engagement

2490
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:10,710
your intuition do you think engagement
 

2491
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,650
your intuition do you think engagement
so like you staying on the platform you

2492
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:12,660
so like you staying on the platform you
 

2493
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:15,770
so like you staying on the platform you
because thing engaged do you think

2494
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:15,780
because thing engaged do you think

00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:18,990
fairness ideas of fairness won't emerge
 

2497
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:21,860
fairness ideas of fairness won't emerge
like how bad is it to just optimize for

2498
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:21,870
like how bad is it to just optimize for
 

2499
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,500
like how bad is it to just optimize for
engagement do you think we'll run into

2500
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:24,510
engagement do you think we'll run into
 

2501
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:27,620
engagement do you think we'll run into
big trouble if we're just optimizing for

2502
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:27,630
big trouble if we're just optimizing for
 

2503
00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:30,590
big trouble if we're just optimizing for
how much you love the platform well I

2504
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:30,600
how much you love the platform well I
 

2505
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,170
how much you love the platform well I
mean optimizing for engagement kind of

2506
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:33,180
mean optimizing for engagement kind of
 

2507
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:33,950
mean optimizing for engagement kind of
got us where we are

2508
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:33,960
got us where we are
 

2509
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:37,940
got us where we are
so do you one have faith that it's

2510
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:37,950
so do you one have faith that it's
 

2511
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:41,420
so do you one have faith that it's
possible to do better and two if it is

2512
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:41,430
possible to do better and two if it is
 

2513
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,570
possible to do better and two if it is
how do we do better I mean it's

2514
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:44,580
how do we do better I mean it's
 

2515
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,160
how do we do better I mean it's
definitely possible to do different

2516
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:46,170
definitely possible to do different
 

2517
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:48,920
definitely possible to do different
right and again you know it's not as if

2518
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:48,930
right and again you know it's not as if
 

2519
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:51,050
right and again you know it's not as if
I think that doing something different

2520
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:51,060
I think that doing something different
 

2521
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:52,610
I think that doing something different
than optimizing for engagement won't

2522
00:52:52,610 --> 00:52:52,620

00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,860

if I worked at these companies I'm sure
 

2533
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:07,980
if I worked at these companies I'm sure
that it

2534
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:07,990
that it
 

2535
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:09,330
that it
it would have seemed like the most

2536
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:09,340
it would have seemed like the most
 

2537
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,130
it would have seemed like the most
natural thing in the world also to want

2538
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:11,140
natural thing in the world also to want
 

2539
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,840
natural thing in the world also to want
to optimize engagement right and that's

2540
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:12,850
to optimize engagement right and that's
 

2541
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:14,820
to optimize engagement right and that's
good for users in some sense you want

2542
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:14,830
good for users in some sense you want
 

2543
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,860
good for users in some sense you want
them to be you know vested in the

00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:24,130
you know my point is is that the idea
 

2551
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,880
you know my point is is that the idea
that there is that it's sort of out of

00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:26,890
that there is that it's sort of out of
 

2553
00:53:26,890 --> 00:53:28,590
that there is that it's sort of out of
their hands as you said or that there's

2554
00:53:28,590 --> 00:53:28,600
their hands as you said or that there's
 

2555
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,810
their hands as you said or that there's
nothing to do about it

2556
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:29,820
nothing to do about it
 

2557
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:32,100
nothing to do about it
Never Say Never but that strikes me as

2558
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:32,110
Never Say Never but that strikes me as
 

2559
00:53:32,110 --> 00:53:34,260
Never Say Never but that strikes me as
implausible as a machine-learning person

2560
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:34,270
implausible as a machine-learning person
 

2561
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,150
implausible as a machine-learning person
right I mean these companies are driven

2562
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:36,160
right I mean these companies are driven
 

2563
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,380
right I mean these companies are driven
by machine learning and this

2564
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:37,390
by machine learning and this
 

2565
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,410
by machine learning and this
optimization of engagement is

2566
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
optimization of engagement is
 

2567
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,730
optimization of engagement is
essentially driven by machine learning

2568
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:41,740
essentially driven by machine learning
 

2569
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:44,310
essentially driven by machine learning
right it's driven by not just machine

2570
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:44,320
right it's driven by not just machine
 

2571
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,720
right it's driven by not just machine
learning but you know very very

2572
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:45,730

00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:03,970
point is is that anytime you know how to
 

2587
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:06,210
point is is that anytime you know how to
optimize for something you'll you you

2588
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:06,220
optimize for something you'll you you
 

2589
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,830
optimize for something you'll you you
know by def almost by definition that

2590
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:07,840
know by def almost by definition that
 

2591
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:10,050
know by def almost by definition that
solution tells you how not to optimize

2592
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:10,060
solution tells you how not to optimize
 

2593
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,320
solution tells you how not to optimize
for it or to do something different

2594
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:12,330
for it or to do something different
 

2595
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:16,800
for it or to do something different
engagement can be measured so sort of

being very difficult to measure that

2604
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:29,950
being very difficult to measure that
 

2605
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,500
being very difficult to measure that
that's right so I'm not I'm not claiming

2606
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:31,510
that's right so I'm not I'm not claiming
 

2607
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:35,780
that's right so I'm not I'm not claiming
that doing something different will

2608
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:35,790
that doing something different will
 

2609
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,520
that doing something different will
immediately make it apparent that this

00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:38,530
immediately make it apparent that this
 

2611
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:40,800
immediately make it apparent that this
is a good thing for society and in

is a good thing for society and in

these social media platforms is it you
 

2619
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,720
these social media platforms is it you
know it kind of feels a bit like we're

know it kind of feels a bit like we're
 

2621
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:51,090
know it kind of feels a bit like we're
in a bad equilibrium right that these

00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:51,100
in a bad equilibrium right that these

to see things in my newsfeed that I

let's say with respect to things like

let's say with respect to things like
you know political discourse and

could you run Facebook for me for four

2660
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:36,680
could you run Facebook for me for four
 

2661
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,700
could you run Facebook for me for four
six months what would you how I think no

2662
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:39,710
six months what would you how I think no
 

2663
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:42,690
six months what would you how I think no
thanks would be the first response but

2664
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:42,700
thanks would be the first response but
 

2665
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,760
thanks would be the first response but
there are many aspects of being the head

2666
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:45,770
there are many aspects of being the head
 

2667
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:48,460
there are many aspects of being the head
of the the entire company there are kind

2668
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:48,470
of the the entire company there are kind
 

2669
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,770
of the the entire company there are kind
of entirely exogenous to many of the

00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:50,780
of entirely exogenous to many of the
 

2671
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,270

and so I don't really think I would need
 

2675

and so I don't really think I would need
to be CEO at Facebook to kind of

another sort of related thing that you

00:59:22,050 --> 00:59:24,140
another sort of related thing that you
mentioned and that people might

00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,150
mentioned and that people might
 

2839
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:25,970
mentioned and that people might
misinterpret from the title of your book

misinterpret from the title of your book

00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:36,510
of what kind of like what what should be

00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:39,080

fair what should be fair the more you

2850
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:39,090
fair what should be fair the more you
 

2851
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:40,880
fair what should be fair the more you
know about a field the more aware you

2852
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:40,890
know about a field the more aware you
 

2853
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:44,360
know about a field the more aware you
are of its limitations and so I'm pretty

2854
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:44,370
are of its limitations and so I'm pretty
 

2855
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:47,180
are of its limitations and so I'm pretty
leery of sort of trying you know there's

2856
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,190
leery of sort of trying you know there's
 

2857
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:49,100
leery of sort of trying you know there's
there's so much we don't all we

there's so much we don't all we
 

2859
00:59:49,110 --> 00:59:52,400
there's so much we don't all we
don't know in fairness even when were

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:52,410
don't know in fairness even when were
 

2861
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:53,780
don't know in fairness even when were
the ones picking the fairness

2862
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:53,790
the ones picking the fairness
 

2863

that the idea of kind of letting the
 

2871
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:04,850
that the idea of kind of letting the
algorithm start exploring as well I

algorithm start exploring as well I
 

2873
01:00:04,860 --> 01:00:07,820
algorithm start exploring as well I
definitely think you know this is a much

01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:07,830
definitely think you know this is a much
 

2875
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,080
definitely think you know this is a much
narrower statement I definitely think

01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:09,090
narrower statement I definitely think
 

2877
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,180
narrower statement I definitely think
the kind of algorithmic auditing for

2878
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:11,190
the kind of algorithmic auditing for
 

2879
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,980
the kind of algorithmic auditing for
different types of unfairness right so

2880
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:12,990
different types of unfairness right so
 

2881
01:00:12,990 --> 01:00:15,170
different types of unfairness right so
like in this gerrymandering example

2882
01:00:15,170 --> 01:00:15,180
like in this gerrymandering example
 

2883
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,960
like in this gerrymandering example
where I might want to prevent not just

categories but against combinations of
 

2889
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:24,470
categories but against combinations of
broad categories you know you quickly

2890

broad categories you know you quickly
 

2891
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:26,480
broad categories you know you quickly
get to a point where there's a lot of a

2892
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:26,490
get to a point where there's a lot of a
 

2893
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:28,070
get to a point where there's a lot of a
lot of categories there's a lot of

2894
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:28,080
lot of categories there's a lot of
 

2895
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:31,460
lot of categories there's a lot of
combinations of n features and you know

2896
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:31,470
combinations of n features and you know
 

2897
01:00:31,470 --> 01:00:33,680
combinations of n features and you know
you can use algorithmic techniques to

01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:33,690
you can use algorithmic techniques to
 

2899
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,900
you can use algorithmic techniques to
sort of try to find the subgroups on

2900
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:35,910
sort of try to find the subgroups on
 

2901
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:37,730
sort of try to find the subgroups on
which you're discriminating the most and

01:00:37,730 --> 01:00:37,740
which you're discriminating the most and
 

2903
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:39,230
which you're discriminating the most and
try to fix that that's actually kind of

try to fix that that's actually kind of
 

2905
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,240
try to fix that that's actually kind of
the form of one of the algorithms we

01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,250
the form of one of the algorithms we
 

2907
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:42,500
the form of one of the algorithms we
developed for this fairness

2908
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:42,510
developed for this fairness
 

2909
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,430
developed for this fairness
gerrymandering problem but I'm you know

2910
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
gerrymandering problem but I'm you know
 

2911
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,770
gerrymandering problem but I'm you know
partly because of our technology our

2912
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:48,780
partly because of our technology our
 

2913
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,500
partly because of our technology our
sort of our scientific ignorance on

2914
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:51,510
sort of our scientific ignorance on
 

2915
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:54,050
sort of our scientific ignorance on
these topics right now and also partly

2916
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:54,060
these topics right now and also partly
 

2917
01:00:54,060 --> 01:00:56,240
these topics right now and also partly
just because these topics are so loaded

2918
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:56,250
just because these topics are so loaded
 

2919
01:00:56,250 --> 01:00:58,820
just because these topics are so loaded
emotionally for people that I just don't

01:00:58,820 --> 01:00:58,830
emotionally for people that I just don't
 

2921
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:01,940
emotionally for people that I just don't
see the value I mean again Never Say

2922
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:01,950
see the value I mean again Never Say
 

2923
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:03,290
see the value I mean again Never Say
Never but I just don't think we're at a

2924
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:03,300
Never but I just don't think we're at a
 

2925
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,880
Never but I just don't think we're at a
moment where it's a great time for

2926
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:04,890
moment where it's a great time for
 

2927
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:06,590
moment where it's a great time for
computer scientists to be rolling out

2928
01:01:06,590 --> 01:01:06,600
computer scientists to be rolling out
 

2929
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,930
computer scientists to be rolling out
the idea like hey you know you know not

2930
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:08,940
the idea like hey you know you know not
 

2931
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:10,910
the idea like hey you know you know not
only have we kind of figured fairness

2932
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:10,920
only have we kind of figured fairness
 

2933
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,070
only have we kind of figured fairness
out but you know we think the algorithm

2934
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:13,080
out but you know we think the algorithm
 

2935
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,200
out but you know we think the algorithm
should start deciding what's fair or

2936
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:15,210
should start deciding what's fair or
 

2937
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:17,090
should start deciding what's fair or
giving input on that decision I just

2938
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:17,100
giving input on that decision I just
 

2939
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,620
giving input on that decision I just
don't laugh it's like the the

2940
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:18,630
don't laugh it's like the the
 

2941
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:20,990
don't laugh it's like the the
cost-benefit analysis to the field of

2942
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:21,000
cost-benefit analysis to the field of
 

2943
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,580
cost-benefit analysis to the field of
kind of going there right now it just

2944
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:22,590
kind of going there right now it just
 

2945
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:24,800
kind of going there right now it just
doesn't seem worth it to me that said I

2946
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:24,810
doesn't seem worth it to me that said I
 

2947
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:26,960
doesn't seem worth it to me that said I
should say that I think computer

2948
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:26,970
should say that I think computer
 

2949
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:28,060
should say that I think computer
scientists should be more

2950
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:28,070
scientists should be more
 

2951
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:30,470
scientists should be more
philosophically like should enrich their

2952
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:30,480
philosophically like should enrich their
 

2953
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,030
philosophically like should enrich their
thinking about these kinds of things I

2954
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:32,040
thinking about these kinds of things I
 

2955
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:34,280
thinking about these kinds of things I
think it's been too often used as an

2956
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:34,290
think it's been too often used as an
 

2957
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:37,250
think it's been too often used as an
excuse for roboticists or cantatas

2958
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:37,260
excuse for roboticists or cantatas
 

2959
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,680
excuse for roboticists or cantatas
vehicles for example to not think about

2960
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:39,690
vehicles for example to not think about
 

2961
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:42,590
vehicles for example to not think about
the human factor or psychology or safety

2962
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:42,600
the human factor or psychology or safety
 

2963
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,600
the human factor or psychology or safety
in the same way like computer science

2964
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:44,610
in the same way like computer science
 

2965
01:01:44,610 --> 01:01:46,460
in the same way like computer science
design algorithms that be sort of using

2966
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:46,470
design algorithms that be sort of using
 

2967
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:48,920
design algorithms that be sort of using
is an excuse and I think it's time for

2968
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:48,930
is an excuse and I think it's time for
 

2969
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:50,840
is an excuse and I think it's time for
basically everybody to become computer

2970
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:50,850
basically everybody to become computer
 

2971
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:51,590
basically everybody to become computer
scientists

2972
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:51,600
scientists
 

2973
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,970
scientists
I was about to agree with everything you

2974
01:01:52,970 --> 01:01:52,980
I was about to agree with everything you
 

2975
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:55,040
I was about to agree with everything you
said except that last point I think that

2976
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:55,050
said except that last point I think that
 

2977
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,780
said except that last point I think that
the other way of looking at is that I

2978
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:56,790
the other way of looking at is that I
 

2979
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,720
the other way of looking at is that I
think computer scientists you know and

2980
01:01:59,720 --> 01:01:59,730
think computer scientists you know and
 

2981
01:01:59,730 --> 01:02:01,029
think computer scientists you know and
and and

2982
01:02:01,029 --> 01:02:01,039
and and
 

2983
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,689
and and
many of us are but we need to wait out

2984
01:02:04,689 --> 01:02:04,699
many of us are but we need to wait out
 

2985
01:02:04,699 --> 01:02:07,359
many of us are but we need to wait out
into the world more right I mean just

2986
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,369
into the world more right I mean just
 

2987
01:02:07,369 --> 01:02:10,299
into the world more right I mean just
the the influence that computer science

2988
01:02:10,299 --> 01:02:10,309
the the influence that computer science
 

2989
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:12,309
the the influence that computer science
and therefore computer scientists have

2990
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:12,319
and therefore computer scientists have
 

2991
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,409
and therefore computer scientists have
had on society at large just like has

2992
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:16,419
had on society at large just like has
 

2993
01:02:16,419 --> 01:02:19,479
had on society at large just like has
exponentially magnified in the last 10

2994
01:02:19,479 --> 01:02:19,489
exponentially magnified in the last 10
 

2995
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:22,870
exponentially magnified in the last 10
or 20 years or so and you know you know

2996
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:22,880
or 20 years or so and you know you know
 

2997
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:24,009
or 20 years or so and you know you know
before when we were just thinking

2998
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:24,019
before when we were just thinking
 

2999
01:02:24,019 --> 01:02:25,900
before when we were just thinking
tinkering around amongst ourselves and

3000
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:25,910
tinkering around amongst ourselves and
 

3001
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,239
tinkering around amongst ourselves and
it didn't matter that much there was no

3002
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:28,249
it didn't matter that much there was no
 

3003
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:30,459
it didn't matter that much there was no
need for sort of computer scientists to

3004
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:30,469
need for sort of computer scientists to
 

3005
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:32,349
need for sort of computer scientists to
be citizens of the world more broadly

3006
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:32,359
be citizens of the world more broadly
 

3007
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:35,380
be citizens of the world more broadly
and I think those days need to be over

3008
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:35,390
and I think those days need to be over
 

3009
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,239
and I think those days need to be over
very very fast and I'm not saying

3010
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:37,249
very very fast and I'm not saying
 

3011
01:02:37,249 --> 01:02:39,789
very very fast and I'm not saying
everybody needs to do it but to me like

3012
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:39,799
everybody needs to do it but to me like
 

3013
01:02:39,799 --> 01:02:41,289
everybody needs to do it but to me like
the right way of doing it is to not to

3014
01:02:41,289 --> 01:02:41,299
the right way of doing it is to not to
 

3015
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:42,549
the right way of doing it is to not to
sort of think that everybody else is

3016
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
sort of think that everybody else is
 

3017
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,109
sort of think that everybody else is
going to become a computer scientist but

3018
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:44,119
going to become a computer scientist but
 

3019
01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:46,779
going to become a computer scientist but
you know I think you know people are

3020
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:46,789
you know I think you know people are
 

3021
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:48,159
you know I think you know people are
becoming more sophisticated about

3022
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:48,169
becoming more sophisticated about
 

3023
01:02:48,169 --> 01:02:50,949
becoming more sophisticated about
computer science even laypeople yeah you

3024
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:50,959
computer science even laypeople yeah you
 

3025
01:02:50,959 --> 01:02:52,120
computer science even laypeople yeah you
know though I think one of the reasons

3026
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:52,130
know though I think one of the reasons
 

3027
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:54,699
know though I think one of the reasons
we decided to write this book as we

3028
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:54,709
we decided to write this book as we
 

3029
01:02:54,709 --> 01:02:55,150
we decided to write this book as we
thought

3030
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:55,160
thought
 

3031
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:57,130
thought
10 years ago I wouldn't have tried this

3032
01:02:57,130 --> 01:02:57,140
10 years ago I wouldn't have tried this
 

3033
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,799
10 years ago I wouldn't have tried this
because I I just didn't think that sort

3034
01:02:59,799 --> 01:02:59,809
because I I just didn't think that sort
 

3035
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,559
because I I just didn't think that sort
of people's awareness of algorithms and

3036
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:02,569
of people's awareness of algorithms and
 

3037
01:03:02,569 --> 01:03:05,109
of people's awareness of algorithms and
machine learning you know the general

3038
01:03:05,109 --> 01:03:05,119
machine learning you know the general
 

3039
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,819
machine learning you know the general
population would have been high and I

3040
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:06,829
population would have been high and I
 

3041
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:08,049
population would have been high and I
mean would you would have had to first

3042
01:03:08,049 --> 01:03:08,059
mean would you would have had to first
 

3043
01:03:08,059 --> 01:03:10,179
mean would you would have had to first
you know write one of the many books

3044
01:03:10,179 --> 01:03:10,189
you know write one of the many books
 

3045
01:03:10,189 --> 01:03:13,659
you know write one of the many books
kind of just explicate alais audience

3046
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:13,669
kind of just explicate alais audience
 

3047
01:03:13,669 --> 01:03:15,370
kind of just explicate alais audience
first now I think we're at the point

3048
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:15,380
first now I think we're at the point
 

3049
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,709
first now I think we're at the point
where like lots of people without any

3050
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:17,719
where like lots of people without any
 

3051
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:19,689
where like lots of people without any
technical training at all know enough

3052
01:03:19,689 --> 01:03:19,699
technical training at all know enough
 

3053
01:03:19,699 --> 01:03:21,249
technical training at all know enough
about algorithms machine learning that

3054
01:03:21,249 --> 01:03:21,259
about algorithms machine learning that
 

3055
01:03:21,259 --> 01:03:23,469
about algorithms machine learning that
you can start getting to these nuances

3056
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:23,479
you can start getting to these nuances
 

3057
01:03:23,479 --> 01:03:25,539
you can start getting to these nuances
of things like ethical algorithms I

3058
01:03:25,539 --> 01:03:25,549
of things like ethical algorithms I
 

3059
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:27,849
of things like ethical algorithms I
think we agree that there needs to be

3060
01:03:27,849 --> 01:03:27,859
think we agree that there needs to be
 

3061
01:03:27,859 --> 01:03:31,029
think we agree that there needs to be
much more mixing but I think I think a

3062
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
much more mixing but I think I think a
 

3063
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,429
much more mixing but I think I think a
lot of the onus of that mixing needs to

3064
01:03:33,429 --> 01:03:33,439
lot of the onus of that mixing needs to
 

3065
01:03:33,439 --> 01:03:35,109
lot of the onus of that mixing needs to
be on the computer science community

3066
01:03:35,109 --> 01:03:35,119
be on the computer science community
 

3067
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,899
be on the computer science community
yeah so just to linger on the

3068
01:03:37,899 --> 01:03:37,909
yeah so just to linger on the
 

3069
01:03:37,909 --> 01:03:39,699
yeah so just to linger on the
disagreement because I do disagree with

3070
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:39,709
disagreement because I do disagree with
 

3071
01:03:39,709 --> 01:03:43,659
disagreement because I do disagree with
you on the point that I think if you're

3072
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:43,669
you on the point that I think if you're
 

3073
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:47,620
you on the point that I think if you're
a biologist if you're a chemist if you

3074
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:47,630
a biologist if you're a chemist if you
 

3075
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:50,769
a biologist if you're a chemist if you
are an MBA business person all of those

3076
01:03:50,769 --> 01:03:50,779
are an MBA business person all of those
 

3077
01:03:50,779 --> 01:03:54,099
are an MBA business person all of those
things you can like if you learn to

3078
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:54,109
things you can like if you learn to
 

3079
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:56,799
things you can like if you learn to
program and not only program if you

3080
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:56,809
program and not only program if you
 

3081
01:03:56,809 --> 01:03:58,449
program and not only program if you
learn to do machine learning if you know

3082
01:03:58,449 --> 01:03:58,459
learn to do machine learning if you know
 

3083
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,579
learn to do machine learning if you know
energy data science you immediately

3084
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:00,589
energy data science you immediately
 

3085
01:04:00,589 --> 01:04:03,069
energy data science you immediately
become much more powerful the kinds of

3086
01:04:03,069 --> 01:04:03,079
become much more powerful the kinds of
 

3087
01:04:03,079 --> 01:04:04,859
become much more powerful the kinds of
things you can do and therefore

3088
01:04:04,859 --> 01:04:04,869
things you can do and therefore
 

3089
01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:07,359
things you can do and therefore
literature like the library Sciences

3090
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:07,369
literature like the library Sciences
 

3091
01:04:07,369 --> 01:04:11,289
literature like the library Sciences
like so you're speaking I think deaf I

3092
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:11,299
like so you're speaking I think deaf I
 

3093
01:04:11,299 --> 01:04:13,059
like so you're speaking I think deaf I
think it holds true well you're saying

3094
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:13,069
think it holds true well you're saying
 

3095
01:04:13,069 --> 01:04:14,830
think it holds true well you're saying
for the next two years but

3096
01:04:14,830 --> 01:04:14,840
for the next two years but
 

3097
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:18,490
for the next two years but
long term if you're interested to me if

3098
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:18,500
long term if you're interested to me if
 

3099
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,340
long term if you're interested to me if
you're interested in philosophy you

3100
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:21,350
you're interested in philosophy you
 

3101
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,320
you're interested in philosophy you
should learn to program because then you

3102
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:23,330
should learn to program because then you
 

3103
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,710
should learn to program because then you
can scrape data you can and study what

3104
01:04:26,710 --> 01:04:26,720
can scrape data you can and study what
 

3105
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,360
can scrape data you can and study what
people are thinking about on Twitter and

3106
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:28,370
people are thinking about on Twitter and
 

3107
01:04:28,370 --> 01:04:31,180
people are thinking about on Twitter and
then start making those awful

3108
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:31,190
then start making those awful
 

3109
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,620
then start making those awful
conclusions about the meaning of life

3110
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:32,630
conclusions about the meaning of life
 

3111
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:36,070
conclusions about the meaning of life
right I just I just feel like the access

3112
01:04:36,070 --> 01:04:36,080
right I just I just feel like the access
 

3113
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,130
right I just I just feel like the access
to data the digitization of whatever

3114
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:39,140
to data the digitization of whatever
 

3115
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,740
to data the digitization of whatever
problem you're trying to solve is a

3116
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:41,750
problem you're trying to solve is a
 

3117
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,630
problem you're trying to solve is a
fundamentally change what it means to be

3118
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:43,640
fundamentally change what it means to be
 

3119
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,920
fundamentally change what it means to be
a computer scientist I mean computer

3120
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:44,930
a computer scientist I mean computer
 

3121
01:04:44,930 --> 01:04:47,680
a computer scientist I mean computer
scientists in 20 30 years will go back

3122
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:47,690
scientists in 20 30 years will go back
 

3123
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:51,250
scientists in 20 30 years will go back
to being donald knuth style theoretical

3124
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:51,260
to being donald knuth style theoretical
 

3125
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:52,660
to being donald knuth style theoretical
computer science and everybody would be

3126
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:52,670
computer science and everybody would be
 

3127
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,600
computer science and everybody would be
doing basically they kind of exploring

3128
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:55,610
doing basically they kind of exploring
 

3129
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:57,310
doing basically they kind of exploring
the kinds of ideas the exploring in your

3130
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:57,320
the kinds of ideas the exploring in your
 

3131
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,900
the kinds of ideas the exploring in your
book it won't be a computer sighs yeah

3132
01:04:58,900 --> 01:04:58,910
book it won't be a computer sighs yeah
 

3133
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,480
book it won't be a computer sighs yeah
yeah I mean I don't think I disagree not

3134
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:01,490
yeah I mean I don't think I disagree not
 

3135
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:04,810
yeah I mean I don't think I disagree not
but I think that that trend of more and

3136
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:04,820
but I think that that trend of more and
 

3137
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,190
but I think that that trend of more and
more people and more and more

3138
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:06,200
more people and more and more
 

3139
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,810
more people and more and more
disciplines adopting ideas from computer

3140
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:10,820
disciplines adopting ideas from computer
 

3141
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,280
disciplines adopting ideas from computer
science learning how to code I think

3142
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:12,290
science learning how to code I think
 

3143
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,500
science learning how to code I think
that that trend seems firmly underway I

3144
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:14,510
that that trend seems firmly underway I
 

3145
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:17,710
that that trend seems firmly underway I
mean you know like an interesting

3146
01:05:17,710 --> 01:05:17,720
mean you know like an interesting
 

3147
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:19,570
mean you know like an interesting
digressive question along these lines is

3148
01:05:19,570 --> 01:05:19,580
digressive question along these lines is
 

3149
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,460
digressive question along these lines is
maybe in 50 years

3150
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:21,470
maybe in 50 years
 

3151
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,720
maybe in 50 years
there won't be computer science

3152
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:22,730
there won't be computer science
 

3153
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,560
there won't be computer science
departments anymore because the field

3154
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:26,570
departments anymore because the field
 

3155
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:28,990
departments anymore because the field
will just sort of be ambient in all of

3156
01:05:28,990 --> 01:05:29,000
will just sort of be ambient in all of
 

3157
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,060
will just sort of be ambient in all of
the different disciplines and you know

3158
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:31,070
the different disciplines and you know
 

3159
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,700
the different disciplines and you know
people will look back and you know

3160
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:33,710
people will look back and you know
 

3161
01:05:33,710 --> 01:05:35,020
people will look back and you know
having a computer science department

3162
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:35,030
having a computer science department
 

3163
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:36,460
having a computer science department
will look like having an electricity

3164
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:36,470
will look like having an electricity
 

3165
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:37,630
will look like having an electricity
department or something that's like you

3166
01:05:37,630 --> 01:05:37,640
department or something that's like you
 

3167
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,910
department or something that's like you
know everybody uses this it's just out

there I mean I do think there will

always be that kind of canoe style core

01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:41,140
personally identifiable information
and you know this is basically the most

3304
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:41,150
and you know this is basically the most
 

3305
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:45,160
and you know this is basically the most
common way of providing data privacy but

3306
01:08:45,160 --> 01:08:45,170
common way of providing data privacy but
 

3307
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:46,690
common way of providing data privacy but
that's in a way that still lets people

that's in a way that still lets people

that's in a way that still lets people

so at a slightly broader picture as you

01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:52,760
so at a slightly broader picture as you
 

3313
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,520
so at a slightly broader picture as you
talk about what does the not

you can start combining stuff together
 

3321
01:09:01,760 --> 01:09:03,970
you can start combining stuff together
so this is exactly the problem with

3322
01:09:03,970 --> 01:09:03,980
so this is exactly the problem with
 

3323
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,340
so this is exactly the problem with
these notions right is that notions of

publicly released this data so the names

01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:51,320
publicly released this data so the names
 

3363
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,620
publicly released this data so the names
from those rows were removed but what

3364
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:53,630
from those rows were removed but what
 

3365
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:55,690
from those rows were removed but what
was released is the preference or the

3366
01:09:55,690 --> 01:09:55,700

don't like and from that combined with
 

3371
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:01,660

just this phenomenon I think that we've

just this phenomenon I think that we've
all come to realize in the last decade

all come to realize in the last decade
 

3389
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:27,150
all come to realize in the last decade
or so is that just knowing a few

3390
01:10:27,150 --> 01:10:27,160
or so is that just knowing a few
 

3391
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:29,740

any kind of privacy in a world where a
 

3461
01:11:53,570 --> 01:11:58,630
any kind of privacy in a world where a
few likes can can identify you so there

3462
01:11:58,630 --> 01:11:58,640
few likes can can identify you so there
 

3463
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:00,520
few likes can can identify you so there
is differential privacy right what is

3464
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:00,530
is differential privacy right what is
 

3465
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:02,140
is differential privacy right what is
differential differential privacy

3466
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:02,150
differential differential privacy
 

3467
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:05,110
differential differential privacy
basically is a kind of alternate much

3468
01:12:05,110 --> 01:12:05,120
basically is a kind of alternate much
 

3469
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:07,330
basically is a kind of alternate much
stronger notion of privacy than these

3470
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:07,340
stronger notion of privacy than these
 

3471
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:12,160
stronger notion of privacy than these
anonymization ideas and it you know it's

3472
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:12,170
anonymization ideas and it you know it's
 

3473
01:12:12,170 --> 01:12:14,680
anonymization ideas and it you know it's
a technical definition but like the

3474
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:14,690
a technical definition but like the
 

3475
01:12:14,690 --> 01:12:18,610
a technical definition but like the
spirit of it is we we compare to to

3476
01:12:18,610 --> 01:12:18,620
spirit of it is we we compare to to
 

3477
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:21,130
spirit of it is we we compare to to
alternate worlds okay so let's suppose

3478
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:21,140
alternate worlds okay so let's suppose
 

3479
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:24,010
alternate worlds okay so let's suppose
I'm a researcher and I want to do you

3480
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:24,020
I'm a researcher and I want to do you
 

3481
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:26,170
I'm a researcher and I want to do you
know I there's a database of medical

3482
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:26,180
know I there's a database of medical
 

3483
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,360
know I there's a database of medical
records and one of them's yours and I

3484
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:28,370
records and one of them's yours and I
 

3485
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:31,000
records and one of them's yours and I
want to use that database of medical

3486
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:31,010
want to use that database of medical
 

3487
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,070
want to use that database of medical
records to build a predictive model for

3488
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:33,080
records to build a predictive model for
 

3489
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:34,660
records to build a predictive model for
some disease so based on people's

3490
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:34,670
some disease so based on people's
 

3491
01:12:34,670 --> 01:12:37,990
some disease so based on people's
symptoms and test results and the like I

3492
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,000
symptoms and test results and the like I
 

3493
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
symptoms and test results and the like I
want to you know build a Probab you know

3494
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,010
want to you know build a Probab you know
 

3495
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,470
want to you know build a Probab you know
model predicting the probability that

3496
01:12:41,470 --> 01:12:41,480
model predicting the probability that
 

3497
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,060
model predicting the probability that
people have disease so you know this is

3498
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:43,070
people have disease so you know this is
 

3499
01:12:43,070 --> 01:12:45,100
people have disease so you know this is
the type of scientific research that we

3500
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:45,110
the type of scientific research that we
 

3501
01:12:45,110 --> 01:12:47,410
the type of scientific research that we
would like to be allowed to continue and

3502
01:12:47,410 --> 01:12:47,420
would like to be allowed to continue and
 

3503
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:50,350
would like to be allowed to continue and
in differential privacy you act ask a

3504
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:50,360
in differential privacy you act ask a
 

3505
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,480
in differential privacy you act ask a
very particular counterfactual question

3506
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:52,490
very particular counterfactual question
 

3507
01:12:52,490 --> 01:12:56,460
very particular counterfactual question
we basically compare two alternatives

3508
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:56,470
we basically compare two alternatives
 

3509
01:12:56,470 --> 01:13:01,240
we basically compare two alternatives
one is when I do this I build this model

3510
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:01,250
one is when I do this I build this model
 

3511
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:03,970
one is when I do this I build this model
on the database of medical records

3512
01:13:03,970 --> 01:13:03,980
on the database of medical records
 

3513
01:13:03,980 --> 01:13:05,200
on the database of medical records
including your

3514
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:05,210
including your
 

3515
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,930
including your
medical record and the other one is

3516
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:07,940
medical record and the other one is
 

3517
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:12,490
medical record and the other one is
where I do the same exercise with the

3518
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:12,500
where I do the same exercise with the
 

3519
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,890
where I do the same exercise with the
same database with just your medical

3520
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:14,900
same database with just your medical
 

3521
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,260
same database with just your medical
record removed so basically you know

3522
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:17,270
record removed so basically you know
 

3523
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:20,650
record removed so basically you know
it's two databases one with n records in

3524
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:20,660
it's two databases one with n records in
 

3525
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:23,080
it's two databases one with n records in
it and one with n minus one records in

3526
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:23,090
it and one with n minus one records in
 

3527
01:13:23,090 --> 01:13:25,570
it and one with n minus one records in
it the N minus one records are the same

3528
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:25,580
it the N minus one records are the same
 

3529
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,670
it the N minus one records are the same
and the only one that's missing in the

3530
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:27,680
and the only one that's missing in the
 

3531
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:31,170
and the only one that's missing in the
second case is your medical record so

3532
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:31,180
second case is your medical record so
 

3533
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,690
second case is your medical record so
differential privacy basically says that

3534
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:33,700
differential privacy basically says that
 

3535
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:40,120
differential privacy basically says that
any harms that might come to you from

3536
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:40,130
any harms that might come to you from
 

3537
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,250
any harms that might come to you from
the analysis in which your data was

3538
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:42,260
the analysis in which your data was
 

3539
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,420
the analysis in which your data was
included are essentially nearly

3540
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:46,430
included are essentially nearly
 

3541
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:48,070
included are essentially nearly
identical to the harms that would have

3542
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:48,080
identical to the harms that would have
 

3543
01:13:48,080 --> 01:13:50,290
identical to the harms that would have
come to you if the same analysis had

3544
01:13:50,290 --> 01:13:50,300
come to you if the same analysis had
 

3545
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,150
come to you if the same analysis had
done been done without your medical

3546
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:52,160
done been done without your medical
 

3547
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,030
done been done without your medical
record included so in other words this

3548
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:55,040
record included so in other words this
 

3549
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,950
record included so in other words this
doesn't say that bad things cannot

3550
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:56,960
doesn't say that bad things cannot
 

3551
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,510
doesn't say that bad things cannot
happen to you as a result of data

3552
01:13:58,510 --> 01:13:58,520
happen to you as a result of data
 

3553
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:01,240
happen to you as a result of data
analysis it just says that these bad

3554
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:01,250
analysis it just says that these bad
 

3555
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:03,010
analysis it just says that these bad
things were going to happen to you

3556
01:14:03,010 --> 01:14:03,020
things were going to happen to you
 

3557
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,320
things were going to happen to you
already even if your data wasn't

3558
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:05,330
already even if your data wasn't
 

3559
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:06,820
already even if your data wasn't
included and to give a very concrete

3560
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:06,830
included and to give a very concrete
 

3561
01:14:06,830 --> 01:14:10,270
included and to give a very concrete
example right you know um you know like

3562
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:10,280
example right you know um you know like
 

3563
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,400
example right you know um you know like
we discussed at some length the the

3564
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:12,410
we discussed at some length the the
 

3565
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:14,860
we discussed at some length the the
study that you know the in the 50s that

3566
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:14,870
study that you know the in the 50s that
 

3567
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:16,360
study that you know the in the 50s that
was done that created the that

3568
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:16,370
was done that created the that
 

3569
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,340
was done that created the that
established the link between smoking and

3570
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:18,350
established the link between smoking and
 

3571
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:20,650
established the link between smoking and
lung cancer and we make the point that

3572
01:14:20,650 --> 01:14:20,660
lung cancer and we make the point that
 

3573
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,350
lung cancer and we make the point that
like well if your data was used in that

3574
01:14:23,350 --> 01:14:23,360
like well if your data was used in that
 

3575
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,110
like well if your data was used in that
analysis and you know the world kind of

3576
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:26,120
analysis and you know the world kind of
 

3577
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,000
analysis and you know the world kind of
knew that you were a smoker because you

3578
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:28,010
knew that you were a smoker because you
 

3579
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:29,770
knew that you were a smoker because you
know there was no stigma associated with

3580
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:29,780
know there was no stigma associated with
 

3581
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:33,400
know there was no stigma associated with
smoking before that those findings real

3582
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:33,410
smoking before that those findings real
 

3583
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:35,020
smoking before that those findings real
harm might have come to you as a result

3584
01:14:35,020 --> 01:14:35,030
harm might have come to you as a result
 

3585
01:14:35,030 --> 01:14:36,670
harm might have come to you as a result
of that study that your data was

3586
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:36,680
of that study that your data was
 

3587
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,980
of that study that your data was
included in in particular your insurer

3588
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:38,990
included in in particular your insurer
 

3589
01:14:38,990 --> 01:14:41,260
included in in particular your insurer
now might have a higher posterior belief

3590
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:41,270
now might have a higher posterior belief
 

3591
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:43,300
now might have a higher posterior belief
that you might have lung cancer and

3592
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:43,310
that you might have lung cancer and
 

3593
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:45,250
that you might have lung cancer and
raise your premiums so you've suffered

3594
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:45,260
raise your premiums so you've suffered
 

3595
01:14:45,260 --> 01:14:48,700
raise your premiums so you've suffered
economic damage but the point is is that

3596
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:48,710
economic damage but the point is is that
 

3597
01:14:48,710 --> 01:14:52,270
economic damage but the point is is that
if the same analysis been done without

3598
01:14:52,270 --> 01:14:52,280
if the same analysis been done without
 

3599
01:14:52,280 --> 01:14:55,360
if the same analysis been done without
with all the other n minus-1 medical

3600
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:55,370
with all the other n minus-1 medical
 

3601
01:14:55,370 --> 01:14:57,280
with all the other n minus-1 medical
records and just yours missing the

3602
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:57,290
records and just yours missing the
 

3603
01:14:57,290 --> 01:14:58,840
records and just yours missing the
outcome would have been the same your

3604
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:58,850
outcome would have been the same your
 

3605
01:14:58,850 --> 01:15:01,840
outcome would have been the same your
your data was an idiosyncratic eleum

3606
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:01,850
your data was an idiosyncratic eleum
 

3607
01:15:01,850 --> 01:15:04,690
your data was an idiosyncratic eleum
crucial to establishing the link between

3608
01:15:04,690 --> 01:15:04,700
crucial to establishing the link between
 

3609
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,640
crucial to establishing the link between
smoking and lung cancer because the link

3610
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:06,650
smoking and lung cancer because the link
 

3611
01:15:06,650 --> 01:15:08,680
smoking and lung cancer because the link
between smoking and lung cancer is like

3612
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:08,690
between smoking and lung cancer is like
 

3613
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:10,870
between smoking and lung cancer is like
a fact about the world that can be

3614
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
a fact about the world that can be
 

3615
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,910
a fact about the world that can be
discovered with any sufficiently large

3616
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:12,920
discovered with any sufficiently large
 

3617
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,160
discovered with any sufficiently large
database of medical records but that's a

3618
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:15,170
database of medical records but that's a
 

3619
01:15:15,170 --> 01:15:17,590
database of medical records but that's a
very low value of harm yeah

3620
01:15:17,590 --> 01:15:17,600
very low value of harm yeah
 

3621
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,690
very low value of harm yeah
so that's showing that very little harm

3622
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:19,700
so that's showing that very little harm
 

3623
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,180
so that's showing that very little harm
is done great but how what is the

3624
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:22,190
is done great but how what is the
 

3625
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,790
is done great but how what is the
mechanism of differential privacy so

3626
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:24,800
mechanism of differential privacy so
 

3627
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,440
mechanism of differential privacy so
that's the kind of beautiful statement

3628
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:26,450
that's the kind of beautiful statement
 

3629
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:28,510
that's the kind of beautiful statement
of it well what's the mechanism by which

3630
01:15:28,510 --> 01:15:28,520
of it well what's the mechanism by which
 

3631
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:31,420
of it well what's the mechanism by which
privacy's preserve yeah so it's it's

3632
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:31,430
privacy's preserve yeah so it's it's
 

3633
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:33,000
privacy's preserve yeah so it's it's
basically by adding noise to

3634
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,010
basically by adding noise to
 

3635
01:15:33,010 --> 01:15:35,740
basically by adding noise to
computations right so the basic idea is

3636
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:35,750
computations right so the basic idea is
 

3637
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:38,350
computations right so the basic idea is
that every differentially private

3638
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:38,360
that every differentially private
 

3639
01:15:38,360 --> 01:15:40,840
that every differentially private
algorithm first of all or every good

3640
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:40,850
algorithm first of all or every good
 

3641
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,280
algorithm first of all or every good
differentially private album every

3642
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:42,290
differentially private album every
 

3643
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:45,220
differentially private album every
useful one is a probabilistic algorithm

3644
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:45,230
useful one is a probabilistic algorithm
 

3645
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:48,460
useful one is a probabilistic algorithm
so it doesn't on a given input if you

3646
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:48,470
so it doesn't on a given input if you
 

3647
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:50,050
so it doesn't on a given input if you
gave the algorithm the same input

3648
01:15:50,050 --> 01:15:50,060
gave the algorithm the same input
 

3649
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:52,240
gave the algorithm the same input
multiple times it would give different

3650
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:52,250
multiple times it would give different
 

3651
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:54,130
multiple times it would give different
outputs each time from some distribution

3652
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:54,140
outputs each time from some distribution
 

3653
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,160
outputs each time from some distribution
and the way you achieve differential

3654
01:15:57,160 --> 01:15:57,170
and the way you achieve differential
 

3655
01:15:57,170 --> 01:15:59,110
and the way you achieve differential
privacy algorithmically is by kind of

3656
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,120
privacy algorithmically is by kind of
 

3657
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:02,230
privacy algorithmically is by kind of
carefully and tastefully adding noise to

3658
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:02,240
carefully and tastefully adding noise to
 

3659
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,230
carefully and tastefully adding noise to
a computation in the right places and

3660
01:16:05,230 --> 01:16:05,240
a computation in the right places and
 

3661
01:16:05,240 --> 01:16:06,840
a computation in the right places and
you know to give a very concrete example

3662
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:06,850
you know to give a very concrete example
 

3663
01:16:06,850 --> 01:16:09,640
you know to give a very concrete example
if I want to compute the average of a

3664
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:09,650
if I want to compute the average of a
 

3665
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,850
if I want to compute the average of a
set of numbers right the non private way

3666
01:16:12,850 --> 01:16:12,860
set of numbers right the non private way
 

3667
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,740
set of numbers right the non private way
of doing that is to take those numbers

3668
01:16:14,740 --> 01:16:14,750
of doing that is to take those numbers
 

3669
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,410
of doing that is to take those numbers
and average them and release like a

3670
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:17,420
and average them and release like a
 

3671
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:20,050
and average them and release like a
numerically precise value for the

3672
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:20,060
numerically precise value for the
 

3673
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:22,870
numerically precise value for the
average okay in differential privacy you

3674
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:22,880
average okay in differential privacy you
 

3675
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,480
average okay in differential privacy you
wouldn't do that you would first compute

3676
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:25,490
wouldn't do that you would first compute
 

3677
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:27,790
wouldn't do that you would first compute
that average to numerical Precision's

3678
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:27,800
that average to numerical Precision's
 

3679
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,800
that average to numerical Precision's
and then you'd add some noise to it

3680
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:29,810
and then you'd add some noise to it
 

3681
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,890
and then you'd add some noise to it
right you'd add some kind of zero mean

3682
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:31,900
right you'd add some kind of zero mean
 

3683
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,290
right you'd add some kind of zero mean
you know gaussian or exponential noise

3684
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:35,300
you know gaussian or exponential noise
 

3685
01:16:35,300 --> 01:16:38,230
you know gaussian or exponential noise
to it so that the actual value you

3686
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:38,240
to it so that the actual value you
 

3687
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:41,260
to it so that the actual value you
output is not the exact mean but it'll

3688
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:41,270
output is not the exact mean but it'll
 

3689
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:43,690
output is not the exact mean but it'll
be close to the mean but it'll be close

3690
01:16:43,690 --> 01:16:43,700
be close to the mean but it'll be close
 

3691
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,960
be close to the mean but it'll be close
the noise the you add will sort of prove

3692
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:45,970
the noise the you add will sort of prove
 

3693
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:49,500
the noise the you add will sort of prove
that nobody can kind of reverse engineer

3694
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:49,510
that nobody can kind of reverse engineer
 

3695
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:52,210
that nobody can kind of reverse engineer
any particular value that went into the

3696
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:52,220
any particular value that went into the
 

3697
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:56,230
any particular value that went into the
average so noise noise is the Savior how

3698
01:16:56,230 --> 01:16:56,240
average so noise noise is the Savior how
 

3699
01:16:56,240 --> 01:17:00,460
average so noise noise is the Savior how
many algorithms can be aided by making

01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:00,470
many algorithms can be aided by making
 

3701
01:17:00,470 --> 01:17:03,310
many algorithms can be aided by making
by adding noise yeah so I'm a relatively

3708
01:17:10,270 --> 01:17:10,280
Roth is you know really one of the
 

3709
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,920
Roth is you know really one of the
founders of the field and has done a

3710
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:11,930
founders of the field and has done a
 

3711
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,780
founders of the field and has done a
great deal of work and I've learned a

3712
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:13,790
great deal of work and I've learned a
 

3713
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:15,420
great deal of work and I've learned a
tremendous amount working with him on it

3714
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:15,430
tremendous amount working with him on it
 

3715
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:17,710
tremendous amount working with him on it
growing up field already yeah but it's

3716
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:17,720
growing up field already yeah but it's
 

3717
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,030
growing up field already yeah but it's
now it's pretty mature but I must admit

3718
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:19,040
now it's pretty mature but I must admit
 

3719
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,740
now it's pretty mature but I must admit
the first time I saw the definition of

3720
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:20,750
the first time I saw the definition of
 

3721
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:22,300
the first time I saw the definition of
deferential privacy my reaction was like

3722
01:17:22,300 --> 01:17:22,310
deferential privacy my reaction was like
 

3723
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,880
deferential privacy my reaction was like
well that is a clever definition and

3724
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:24,890
well that is a clever definition and
 

3725
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:27,550
well that is a clever definition and
it's really making very strong promises

3726
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:27,560
it's really making very strong promises
 

3727
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:30,640
it's really making very strong promises
and my you know you know at first saw

3728
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:30,650
and my you know you know at first saw
 

3729
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:31,479
and my you know you know at first saw
the definition

3730
01:17:31,479 --> 01:17:31,489
the definition
 

3731
01:17:31,489 --> 01:17:33,190
the definition
in much earlier days and my first

3732
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:33,200
in much earlier days and my first
 

3733
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,530
in much earlier days and my first
reaction was like well my worry about

3734
01:17:35,530 --> 01:17:35,540
reaction was like well my worry about
 

3735
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:37,090
reaction was like well my worry about
this definition would be that it's a

3736
01:17:37,090 --> 01:17:37,100
this definition would be that it's a
 

3737
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:38,920
this definition would be that it's a
great definition of privacy but that

3738
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:38,930
great definition of privacy but that
 

3739
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:41,320
great definition of privacy but that
it'll be so restrictive that we won't

3740
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:41,330
it'll be so restrictive that we won't
 

3741
01:17:41,330 --> 01:17:42,760
it'll be so restrictive that we won't
really be able to use it like you know

3742
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:42,770
really be able to use it like you know
 

3743
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:44,950
really be able to use it like you know
we won't be able to do compute many

3744
01:17:44,950 --> 01:17:44,960
we won't be able to do compute many
 

3745
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,450
we won't be able to do compute many
things in a differentially private way

3746
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:46,460
things in a differentially private way
 

3747
01:17:46,460 --> 01:17:48,820
things in a differentially private way
so that that's one of the great

3748
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:48,830
so that that's one of the great
 

3749
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,530
so that that's one of the great
successes of the field I think isn't

3750
01:17:50,530 --> 01:17:50,540
successes of the field I think isn't
 

3751
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,690
successes of the field I think isn't

01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,380
showing that the opposite is true and
that you know most things that we know

3754
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:56,390
that you know most things that we know

01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:59,470
that you know most things that we know

01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,480
you put in a query into Google it would
send that query to Google but in the

send that query to Google but in the
 

3897
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:03,910
send that query to Google but in the

it would just be sending this torrent of

01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:07,330
it would just be sending this torrent of
 

3903
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:11,200
it would just be sending this torrent of
irrelevant queries to the search engine

3904

irrelevant queries to the search engine
 

3905
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:13,420
irrelevant queries to the search engine
so you know it's like a weed and chaff

3906
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:13,430
so you know it's like a weed and chaff
 

3907
01:21:13,430 --> 01:21:16,450
so you know it's like a weed and chaff
thing so you know out of every thousand

3908
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:16,460
thing so you know out of every thousand
 

3909
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:18,100
thing so you know out of every thousand
queries let's say that Google was

3910
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:18,110
queries let's say that Google was
 

3911
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:20,530
queries let's say that Google was
receiving from your browser one of them

3912
01:21:20,530 --> 01:21:20,540
receiving from your browser one of them
 

3913
01:21:20,540 --> 01:21:21,850
receiving from your browser one of them
was one that you put in but the other

3914
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:21,860
was one that you put in but the other
 

3915
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:24,790
was one that you put in but the other
999 were not okay so it's the same kind

3916
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:24,800
999 were not okay so it's the same kind
 

3917
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,520
999 were not okay so it's the same kind
of idea kind of you know privacy by

3918
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:27,530
of idea kind of you know privacy by
 

3919
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,280
of idea kind of you know privacy by
obfuscation so I think that's an

3920
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:30,290
obfuscation so I think that's an
 

3921
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:33,310
obfuscation so I think that's an
interesting idea doesn't give you

3922
01:21:33,310 --> 01:21:33,320
interesting idea doesn't give you
 

3923
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:36,610
interesting idea doesn't give you
differential privacy it's also I was

3924
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:36,620
differential privacy it's also I was

01:21:36,620 --> 01:21:37,750
differential privacy it's also I was

01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:42,350
the fact that you know just this kind of
 

3931
01:21:42,350 --> 01:21:45,580
the fact that you know just this kind of
thing that there are some times when the

3932
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:45,590
thing that there are some times when the
 

3933
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:49,360
thing that there are some times when the
response to my data needs to be very

3934
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:49,370
response to my data needs to be very
 

3935
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:52,180
response to my data needs to be very
specific to my data right like I type

3936
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:52,190
specific to my data right like I type
 

3937
01:21:52,190 --> 01:21:55,090
specific to my data right like I type
mountain biking into Google I want

3938
01:21:55,090 --> 01:21:55,100
mountain biking into Google I want
 

3939
01:21:55,100 --> 01:21:56,830
mountain biking into Google I want
results on mountain biking and I really

3940
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:56,840
results on mountain biking and I really
 

3941
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,799
results on mountain biking and I really
want Google to know that I typed in

3942
01:21:58,799 --> 01:21:58,809
want Google to know that I typed in
 

3943
01:21:58,809 --> 01:22:00,870
want Google to know that I typed in
biking I don't want noise adage to that

3944
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:00,880
biking I don't want noise adage to that
 

3945
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,810
biking I don't want noise adage to that
and so I think there's sort of maybe

3946
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:03,820
and so I think there's sort of maybe
 

3947
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,430
and so I think there's sort of maybe
even interesting technical questions

3948
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:05,440
even interesting technical questions
 

3949
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,080
even interesting technical questions
around notions of privacy that are

3950
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:07,090
around notions of privacy that are
 

3951
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:09,629
around notions of privacy that are
appropriate where you know it's not that

3952
01:22:09,629 --> 01:22:09,639
appropriate where you know it's not that
 

3953
01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:11,700
appropriate where you know it's not that
my date is part of some aggregate like

3954
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:11,710
my date is part of some aggregate like
 

3955
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,439
my date is part of some aggregate like
medical records and that we're trying to

3956
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:13,449
medical records and that we're trying to
 

3957
01:22:13,449 --> 01:22:15,990
medical records and that we're trying to
discover important correlations and

3958
01:22:15,990 --> 01:22:16,000
discover important correlations and
 

3959
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,700
discover important correlations and
facts about the world at large

3960
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:17,710
facts about the world at large
 

3961
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:19,799
facts about the world at large
but rather you know there's a service

3962
01:22:19,799 --> 01:22:19,809
but rather you know there's a service
 

3963
01:22:19,809 --> 01:22:22,290
but rather you know there's a service
that I really want to you know pay

3964
01:22:22,290 --> 01:22:22,300
that I really want to you know pay
 

3965
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:24,209
that I really want to you know pay
attention to my specific data yet I

3966
01:22:24,209 --> 01:22:24,219
attention to my specific data yet I
 

3967
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:25,620
attention to my specific data yet I
still want some kind of privacy

3968
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:25,630
still want some kind of privacy
 

3969
01:22:25,630 --> 01:22:26,910
still want some kind of privacy
guarantee and I think these kind of

3970
01:22:26,910 --> 01:22:26,920
guarantee and I think these kind of
 

3971
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:29,430
guarantee and I think these kind of
obfuscation ideas are sort of one way of

3972
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:29,440
obfuscation ideas are sort of one way of
 

3973
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:30,750
obfuscation ideas are sort of one way of
getting at that but maybe there are

3974
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:30,760
getting at that but maybe there are
 

3975
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,790
getting at that but maybe there are
others as well so where do you think

3976
01:22:32,790 --> 01:22:32,800
others as well so where do you think
 

3977
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:34,799
others as well so where do you think
will land in this algorithm driven

3978
01:22:34,799 --> 01:22:34,809
will land in this algorithm driven
 

3979
01:22:34,809 --> 01:22:37,939
will land in this algorithm driven
society in terms of privacy so sort of

3980
01:22:37,939 --> 01:22:37,949
society in terms of privacy so sort of
 

3981
01:22:37,949 --> 01:22:43,080
society in terms of privacy so sort of
China like Chi Fuli describes you know

3982
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:43,090
China like Chi Fuli describes you know
 

3983
01:22:43,090 --> 01:22:44,970
China like Chi Fuli describes you know
it's collecting a lot of data on its

3984
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:44,980
it's collecting a lot of data on its
 

3985
01:22:44,980 --> 01:22:48,149
it's collecting a lot of data on its
citizens but in the best form it's

3986
01:22:48,149 --> 01:22:48,159
citizens but in the best form it's
 

3987
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,569
citizens but in the best form it's
actually able to provide a lot of sort

3988
01:22:51,569 --> 01:22:51,579
actually able to provide a lot of sort
 

3989
01:22:51,579 --> 01:22:53,279
actually able to provide a lot of sort
of protects human rights and provide a

3990
01:22:53,279 --> 01:22:53,289
of protects human rights and provide a
 

3991
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:55,350
of protects human rights and provide a
lot of amazing services and its worst

3992
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:55,360
lot of amazing services and its worst
 

3993
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,930
lot of amazing services and its worst
forms it can violate those human rights

3994
01:22:57,930 --> 01:22:57,940
forms it can violate those human rights
 

3995
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,799
forms it can violate those human rights
and and limit services so what do you

3996
01:23:01,799 --> 01:23:01,809
and and limit services so what do you
 

3997
01:23:01,809 --> 01:23:05,040
and and limit services so what do you
think will land on so algorithms are

3998
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:05,050
think will land on so algorithms are
 

3999
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:08,609
think will land on so algorithms are
powerful when they use data so as a

4000
01:23:08,609 --> 01:23:08,619
powerful when they use data so as a
 

4001
01:23:08,619 --> 01:23:11,430
powerful when they use data so as a
society do you think we'll give over

4002
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
society do you think we'll give over
 

4003
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,310
society do you think we'll give over
more data is it possible to protect the

4004
01:23:14,310 --> 01:23:14,320
more data is it possible to protect the
 

4005
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,760
more data is it possible to protect the
privacy of that data so I'm optimistic

4006
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:17,770
privacy of that data so I'm optimistic
 

4007
01:23:17,770 --> 01:23:20,870
privacy of that data so I'm optimistic
about the possibility of you know

4008
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
about the possibility of you know
 

4009
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,450
about the possibility of you know
balancing the desire for individual

4010
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:24,460
balancing the desire for individual
 

4011
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,689
balancing the desire for individual
privacy and individual control of

4012
01:23:26,689 --> 01:23:26,699
privacy and individual control of
 

4013
01:23:26,699 --> 01:23:31,080
privacy and individual control of
privacy with kind of societally and

01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:31,090
privacy with kind of societally and
 

4015
01:23:31,090 --> 01:23:34,109
privacy with kind of societally and
commercially beneficial uses of data not

individuals should have control of their

4022
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:39,520
individuals should have control of their
 

4023
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,939
individuals should have control of their
data they should be able to limit the

4024
01:23:41,939 --> 01:23:41,949
data they should be able to limit the
 

4025
01:23:41,949 --> 01:23:44,370
data they should be able to limit the
uses of that data they should even you

4026
01:23:44,370 --> 01:23:44,380
uses of that data they should even you
 

4027
01:23:44,380 --> 01:23:46,709
uses of that data they should even you
know there's there's you know fledgling

4028
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:46,719
know there's there's you know fledgling
 

4029
01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:48,660
know there's there's you know fledgling
discussions going on in research circles

4030
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:48,670
discussions going on in research circles
 

4031
01:23:48,670 --> 01:23:51,629
discussions going on in research circles
about allowing people selective use of

4032
01:23:51,629 --> 01:23:51,639
about allowing people selective use of
 

4033
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:53,689
about allowing people selective use of
their data and being compensated for it

4034
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:53,699
their data and being compensated for it
 

4035
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:55,859
their data and being compensated for it
and then you get to sort of very

4036
01:23:55,859 --> 01:23:55,869
and then you get to sort of very
 

4037
01:23:55,869 --> 01:23:57,600
and then you get to sort of very
interesting economic questions like

4038
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:57,610
interesting economic questions like
 

4039
01:23:57,610 --> 01:24:00,510
interesting economic questions like
pricing right and one interesting idea

4040
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:00,520
pricing right and one interesting idea
 

4041
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,729
pricing right and one interesting idea
is that maybe differential privacy would

4042
01:24:02,729 --> 01:24:02,739
is that maybe differential privacy would
 

4043
01:24:02,739 --> 01:24:05,399
is that maybe differential privacy would
also you know be Bo a conceptual

4044
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:05,409
also you know be Bo a conceptual
 

4045
01:24:05,409 --> 01:24:06,540
also you know be Bo a conceptual
framework in which you could talk about

4046
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:06,550
framework in which you could talk about
 

4047
01:24:06,550 --> 01:24:08,580
framework in which you could talk about
the relative value of different people's

4048
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:08,590
the relative value of different people's
 

4049
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:11,100
the relative value of different people's
data like you know to demystify this a

4050
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:11,110
data like you know to demystify this a
 

4051
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:12,310
data like you know to demystify this a
little bit if I

4052
01:24:12,310 --> 01:24:12,320
little bit if I
 

4053
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,290
little bit if I
front of build a predictive model for

4054
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:14,300
front of build a predictive model for
 

4055
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:16,839
front of build a predictive model for
some rare disease and I'm trying to you

4056
01:24:16,839 --> 01:24:16,849
some rare disease and I'm trying to you
 

4057
01:24:16,849 --> 01:24:18,780
some rare disease and I'm trying to you
I'm gonna use machine learning to do it

4058
01:24:18,780 --> 01:24:18,790
I'm gonna use machine learning to do it
 

4059
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:21,220
I'm gonna use machine learning to do it
it's easy to get negative examples

4060
01:24:21,220 --> 01:24:21,230
it's easy to get negative examples
 

4061
01:24:21,230 --> 01:24:23,770
it's easy to get negative examples
because the disease is rare right but I

4062
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:23,780
because the disease is rare right but I
 

4063
01:24:23,780 --> 01:24:26,050
because the disease is rare right but I
really want to have lots of people with

4064
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:26,060
really want to have lots of people with
 

4065
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:29,709
really want to have lots of people with
the disease in my data set okay

4066
01:24:29,709 --> 01:24:29,719
the disease in my data set okay
 

4067
01:24:29,719 --> 01:24:31,990
the disease in my data set okay
but but and so somehow those people's

4068
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
but but and so somehow those people's
 

4069
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,240
but but and so somehow those people's
data with respect to this application is

4070
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:34,250
data with respect to this application is
 

4071
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:36,490
data with respect to this application is
much more valuable to me than just like

4072
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:36,500
much more valuable to me than just like
 

4073
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,709
much more valuable to me than just like
the background population and so maybe

4074
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
the background population and so maybe
 

4075
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,370
the background population and so maybe
they should be compensated more for it

4076
01:24:41,370 --> 01:24:41,380
they should be compensated more for it
 

4077
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:44,620
they should be compensated more for it
and so you know I think these are kind

4078
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:44,630
and so you know I think these are kind
 

4079
01:24:44,630 --> 01:24:48,250
and so you know I think these are kind
of very very fledgling conceptual

4080
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:48,260
of very very fledgling conceptual
 

4081
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:50,350
of very very fledgling conceptual
questions that maybe will have kind of

4082
01:24:50,350 --> 01:24:50,360
questions that maybe will have kind of
 

4083
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,330
questions that maybe will have kind of
technical thought on them sometime in

4084
01:24:52,330 --> 01:24:52,340
technical thought on them sometime in
 

4085
01:24:52,340 --> 01:24:54,550
technical thought on them sometime in
the coming years but but I do think well

4086
01:24:54,550 --> 01:24:54,560
the coming years but but I do think well
 

4087
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:55,720
the coming years but but I do think well
you know to kind of get more directly

4088
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:55,730
you know to kind of get more directly
 

4089
01:24:55,730 --> 01:24:57,609
you know to kind of get more directly
answer your question I think I'm

4090
01:24:57,609 --> 01:24:57,619
answer your question I think I'm
 

4091
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:00,040
answer your question I think I'm
optimistic at this point from what I've

4092
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:00,050
optimistic at this point from what I've
 

4093
01:25:00,050 --> 01:25:02,859
optimistic at this point from what I've
seen that we will land at some you know

4094
01:25:02,859 --> 01:25:02,869
seen that we will land at some you know
 

4095
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:05,140
seen that we will land at some you know
better compromise than we're at right

4096
01:25:05,140 --> 01:25:05,150
better compromise than we're at right
 

4097
01:25:05,150 --> 01:25:08,050
better compromise than we're at right
now where again you know privacy

4098
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:08,060
now where again you know privacy
 

4099
01:25:08,060 --> 01:25:10,629
now where again you know privacy
guarantees are a few far between and

4100
01:25:10,629 --> 01:25:10,639
guarantees are a few far between and
 

4101
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,240
guarantees are a few far between and
weak and users have very very little

4102
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:13,250
weak and users have very very little
 

4103
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:16,540
weak and users have very very little
control and I'm optimistic that we'll

4104
01:25:16,540 --> 01:25:16,550
control and I'm optimistic that we'll
 

4105
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:18,910
control and I'm optimistic that we'll
land in something that you know provides

4106
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:18,920
land in something that you know provides
 

4107
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,680
land in something that you know provides
better privacy overall and more

4108
01:25:20,680 --> 01:25:20,690
better privacy overall and more
 

4109
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:22,660
better privacy overall and more
individual control of data and privacy

4110
01:25:22,660 --> 01:25:22,670
individual control of data and privacy
 

4111
01:25:22,670 --> 01:25:25,660
individual control of data and privacy
but you know I think to get there it's

4112
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:25,670
but you know I think to get there it's
 

4113
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:27,399
but you know I think to get there it's
again just like fairness it's not going

4114
01:25:27,399 --> 01:25:27,409
again just like fairness it's not going
 

4115
01:25:27,409 --> 01:25:28,810
again just like fairness it's not going
to be enough to propose algorithmic

4116
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:28,820
to be enough to propose algorithmic
 

4117
01:25:28,820 --> 01:25:30,100
to be enough to propose algorithmic
solutions there's gonna have to be a

4118
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:30,110
solutions there's gonna have to be a
 

4119
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:32,830
solutions there's gonna have to be a
whole kind of regulatory legal process

4120
01:25:32,830 --> 01:25:32,840
whole kind of regulatory legal process
 

4121
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:35,680
whole kind of regulatory legal process
that prods companies and other parties

4122
01:25:35,680 --> 01:25:35,690
that prods companies and other parties
 

4123
01:25:35,690 --> 01:25:39,069
that prods companies and other parties
to kind of adopt solutions and I think

4124
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:39,079
to kind of adopt solutions and I think
 

4125
01:25:39,079 --> 01:25:41,050
to kind of adopt solutions and I think
you've mentioned the word control and I

4126
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:41,060
you've mentioned the word control and I
 

4127
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:42,970
you've mentioned the word control and I
think giving people control that's

4128
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:42,980
think giving people control that's
 

4129
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:45,760
think giving people control that's
something that people don't quite have

4130
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:45,770
something that people don't quite have
 

4131
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:48,040
something that people don't quite have
and a lot of these algorithms that's a

4132
01:25:48,040 --> 01:25:48,050
and a lot of these algorithms that's a
 

4133
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:49,510
and a lot of these algorithms that's a
really interesting idea of giving them

4134
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
really interesting idea of giving them
 

4135
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,129
really interesting idea of giving them
control some of that is actually

4136
01:25:51,129 --> 01:25:51,139
control some of that is actually
 

4137
01:25:51,139 --> 01:25:54,430
control some of that is actually
literally an interface design question

4138
01:25:54,430 --> 01:25:54,440
literally an interface design question
 

4139
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:58,060
literally an interface design question
sort of just enabling because I think

4140
01:25:58,060 --> 01:25:58,070
sort of just enabling because I think
 

4141
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:59,560
sort of just enabling because I think
it's good for everybody to give users

4142
01:25:59,560 --> 01:25:59,570
it's good for everybody to give users
 

4143
01:25:59,570 --> 01:26:01,870
it's good for everybody to give users
control it's not it's not a it's almost

4144
01:26:01,870 --> 01:26:01,880
control it's not it's not a it's almost
 

4145
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,660
control it's not it's not a it's almost
not a trade off except you have to hire

4146
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:04,670
not a trade off except you have to hire
 

4147
01:26:04,670 --> 01:26:06,550
not a trade off except you have to hire
people that are good at interface design

4148
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:06,560
people that are good at interface design
 

4149
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:09,550
people that are good at interface design
yeah I mean the other thing that has to

4150
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:09,560
yeah I mean the other thing that has to
 

4151
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,220
yeah I mean the other thing that has to
be said right is that you know it's a

4152
01:26:12,220 --> 01:26:12,230
be said right is that you know it's a
 

4153
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:16,000
be said right is that you know it's a
cliche but you know we who is the users

4154
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:16,010
cliche but you know we who is the users
 

4155
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:19,240
cliche but you know we who is the users
of many systems platforms and apps you

4156
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:19,250
of many systems platforms and apps you
 

4157
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:22,149
of many systems platforms and apps you
know we are the product we are not the

4158
01:26:22,149 --> 01:26:22,159
know we are the product we are not the
 

4159
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,640
know we are the product we are not the
customer the customer our advertisers

4160
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:24,650
customer the customer our advertisers
 

4161
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:26,529
customer the customer our advertisers
and our data is the prod

4162
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:26,539
and our data is the prod
 

4163
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:28,810
and our data is the prod
okay so it's one thing to kind of

4164
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:28,820
okay so it's one thing to kind of
 

4165
01:26:28,820 --> 01:26:31,479
okay so it's one thing to kind of
suggest more individual control of data

4166
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:31,489
suggest more individual control of data
 

4167
01:26:31,489 --> 01:26:34,859
suggest more individual control of data
and privacy and uses but this you know

4168
01:26:34,859 --> 01:26:34,869
and privacy and uses but this you know
 

4169
01:26:34,869 --> 01:26:38,709
and privacy and uses but this you know
if this happens in sufficient degree it

4170
01:26:38,709 --> 01:26:38,719
if this happens in sufficient degree it
 

4171
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:41,620
if this happens in sufficient degree it
will upend the entire economic model

4172
01:26:41,620 --> 01:26:41,630
will upend the entire economic model
 

4173
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,750
will upend the entire economic model
that has supported the internet to date

4174
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:43,760
that has supported the internet to date
 

4175
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,629
that has supported the internet to date
and so some other economic model will

4176
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
and so some other economic model will
 

4177
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:49,029
and so some other economic model will
have to be you know will have to replace

4178
01:26:49,029 --> 01:26:49,039
have to be you know will have to replace
 

4179
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:51,489
have to be you know will have to replace
it so the idea of markets you mentioned

4180
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:51,499
it so the idea of markets you mentioned
 

4181
01:26:51,499 --> 01:26:55,270
it so the idea of markets you mentioned
by exposing the economic model to the

4182
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
by exposing the economic model to the
 

4183
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,640
by exposing the economic model to the
people they will then become a market

4184
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:57,650
people they will then become a market
 

4185
01:26:57,650 --> 01:26:59,620
people they will then become a market
they can be participants in participants

4186
01:26:59,620 --> 01:26:59,630
they can be participants in participants
 

4187
01:26:59,630 --> 01:27:01,600
they can be participants in participants
in and and you know this isn't you know

4188
01:27:01,600 --> 01:27:01,610
in and and you know this isn't you know
 

4189
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:03,189
in and and you know this isn't you know
this is not a weird idea right because

4190
01:27:03,189 --> 01:27:03,199
this is not a weird idea right because
 

4191
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,739
this is not a weird idea right because
there are markets for data already it's

4192
01:27:05,739 --> 01:27:05,749
there are markets for data already it's
 

4193
01:27:05,749 --> 01:27:08,140
there are markets for data already it's
just that consumers are not participants

4194
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,150
just that consumers are not participants
 

4195
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:09,850
just that consumers are not participants
in there's like you know there's sort of

4196
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:09,860
in there's like you know there's sort of
 

4197
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:12,129
in there's like you know there's sort of
you know publishers and content

4198
01:27:12,129 --> 01:27:12,139
you know publishers and content
 

4199
01:27:12,139 --> 01:27:13,540
you know publishers and content
providers on one side that have

4200
01:27:13,540 --> 01:27:13,550
providers on one side that have
 

4201
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,430
providers on one side that have
inventory and then they're advertised on

4202
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,440
inventory and then they're advertised on
 

4203
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,770
inventory and then they're advertised on
the others and you know you know Google

4204
01:27:17,770 --> 01:27:17,780
the others and you know you know Google
 

4205
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:19,390
the others and you know you know Google
and Facebook are running you know

4206
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:19,400
and Facebook are running you know
 

4207
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,330
and Facebook are running you know
they're pretty much their entire revenue

4208
01:27:22,330 --> 01:27:22,340
they're pretty much their entire revenue
 

4209
01:27:22,340 --> 01:27:25,000
they're pretty much their entire revenue
stream is by running two-sided markets

4210
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:25,010
stream is by running two-sided markets
 

4211
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,669
stream is by running two-sided markets
between those parties right and so it's

4212
01:27:27,669 --> 01:27:27,679
between those parties right and so it's
 

4213
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,620
between those parties right and so it's
not a crazy idea that there would be

4214
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:29,630
not a crazy idea that there would be
 

4215
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:31,689
not a crazy idea that there would be
like a three sided market or that you

4216
01:27:31,689 --> 01:27:31,699
like a three sided market or that you
 

4217
01:27:31,699 --> 01:27:34,089
like a three sided market or that you
know that on one side of the market or

4218
01:27:34,089 --> 01:27:34,099
know that on one side of the market or
 

4219
01:27:34,099 --> 01:27:35,709
know that on one side of the market or
the other we would have proxies

4220
01:27:35,709 --> 01:27:35,719
the other we would have proxies
 

4221
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:37,509
the other we would have proxies
representing our interest it's not you

4222
01:27:37,509 --> 01:27:37,519
representing our interest it's not you
 

4223
01:27:37,519 --> 01:27:39,850
representing our interest it's not you
know it's not a crazy idea but it would

4224
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:39,860
know it's not a crazy idea but it would
 

4225
01:27:39,860 --> 01:27:43,000
know it's not a crazy idea but it would
it it's not a crazy technical idea but

4226
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,010
it it's not a crazy technical idea but
 

4227
01:27:43,010 --> 01:27:47,229
it it's not a crazy technical idea but
it would have pretty extreme economic

4228
01:27:47,229 --> 01:27:47,239
it would have pretty extreme economic
 

4229
01:27:47,239 --> 01:27:51,220
it would have pretty extreme economic
consequences speaking of markets a lot

4230
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:51,230
consequences speaking of markets a lot
 

4231
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,989
consequences speaking of markets a lot
of fascinating aspects of this world

4232
01:27:52,989 --> 01:27:52,999
of fascinating aspects of this world
 

4233
01:27:52,999 --> 01:27:56,649
of fascinating aspects of this world
arise not from individual humans but

4234
01:27:56,649 --> 01:27:56,659
arise not from individual humans but
 

4235
01:27:56,659 --> 01:27:58,859
arise not from individual humans but
from the interaction of human beings

4236
01:27:58,859 --> 01:27:58,869
from the interaction of human beings
 

4237
01:27:58,869 --> 01:28:01,450
from the interaction of human beings
you've done a lot of work in game theory

4238
01:28:01,450 --> 01:28:01,460
you've done a lot of work in game theory
 

4239
01:28:01,460 --> 01:28:05,049
you've done a lot of work in game theory
first can you say what is game theory

4240
01:28:05,049 --> 01:28:05,059
first can you say what is game theory
 

4241
01:28:05,059 --> 01:28:07,209
first can you say what is game theory
and how does help us model and study

4242
01:28:07,209 --> 01:28:07,219
and how does help us model and study
 

4243
01:28:07,219 --> 01:28:10,120
and how does help us model and study
yeah game theory of course let us give

4244
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:10,130
yeah game theory of course let us give
 

4245
01:28:10,130 --> 01:28:12,129
yeah game theory of course let us give
credit where it's due they don't comes

4246
01:28:12,129 --> 01:28:12,139
credit where it's due they don't comes
 

4247
01:28:12,139 --> 01:28:14,020
credit where it's due they don't comes
from the economist first and foremost

4248
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:14,030
from the economist first and foremost
 

4249
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,629
from the economist first and foremost
but as I've mentioned before like you

4250
01:28:16,629 --> 01:28:16,639
but as I've mentioned before like you
 

4251
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,330
but as I've mentioned before like you
know computer scientists never hesitate

4252
01:28:19,330 --> 01:28:19,340
know computer scientists never hesitate
 

4253
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:21,819
know computer scientists never hesitate
to wander into other people's turf and

4254
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:21,829
to wander into other people's turf and
 

4255
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:24,370
to wander into other people's turf and
so there is now this 20 year old field

4256
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:24,380
so there is now this 20 year old field
 

4257
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,620
so there is now this 20 year old field
called algorithmic game theory but you

4258
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:26,630
called algorithmic game theory but you
 

4259
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:29,950
called algorithmic game theory but you
know game game theory first and foremost

4260
01:28:29,950 --> 01:28:29,960
know game game theory first and foremost
 

4261
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,739
know game game theory first and foremost
is a mathematical framework for

4262
01:28:32,739 --> 01:28:32,749
is a mathematical framework for
 

4263
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:35,879
is a mathematical framework for
reasoning about collective outcomes in

4264
01:28:35,879 --> 01:28:35,889
reasoning about collective outcomes in
 

4265
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:40,209
reasoning about collective outcomes in
systems of interacting individuals you

4266
01:28:40,209 --> 01:28:40,219
systems of interacting individuals you
 

4267
01:28:40,219 --> 01:28:41,939
systems of interacting individuals you
know so you need at least two people to

4268
01:28:41,939 --> 01:28:41,949
know so you need at least two people to
 

4269
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,520
know so you need at least two people to
get started in game theory and many

4270
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:45,530
get started in game theory and many
 

4271
01:28:45,530 --> 01:28:46,899
get started in game theory and many
people are probably familiar with

4272
01:28:46,899 --> 01:28:46,909
people are probably familiar with
 

4273
01:28:46,909 --> 01:28:49,450
people are probably familiar with
prisoner's dilemma as kind of a classic

4274
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:49,460
prisoner's dilemma as kind of a classic
 

4275
01:28:49,460 --> 01:28:51,100
prisoner's dilemma as kind of a classic
example of game theory and a classic

4276
01:28:51,100 --> 01:28:51,110
example of game theory and a classic
 

4277
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:55,060
example of game theory and a classic
example where everybody looking out for

4278
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:55,070
example where everybody looking out for
 

4279
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:57,189
example where everybody looking out for
their own individual interests leads to

4280
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
their own individual interests leads to
 

4281
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,989
their own individual interests leads to
a collective outcome that's kind of

4282
01:28:58,989 --> 01:28:58,999
a collective outcome that's kind of
 

4283
01:28:58,999 --> 01:29:02,080
a collective outcome that's kind of
worse for everybody then what might be

4284
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:02,090
worse for everybody then what might be
 

4285
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:04,450
worse for everybody then what might be
possible if they cooperated for example

4286
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:04,460
possible if they cooperated for example
 

4287
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:07,629
possible if they cooperated for example
but cooperation is not an equilibrium in

4288
01:29:07,629 --> 01:29:07,639
but cooperation is not an equilibrium in
 

4289
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:11,919
but cooperation is not an equilibrium in
prisoner's dilemma and so my work and

4290
01:29:11,919 --> 01:29:11,929
prisoner's dilemma and so my work and
 

4291
01:29:11,929 --> 01:29:14,049
prisoner's dilemma and so my work and
the field of algorithmic game theory

4292
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:14,059
the field of algorithmic game theory
 

4293
01:29:14,059 --> 01:29:16,390
the field of algorithmic game theory
more generally in these areas kind of

4294
01:29:16,390 --> 01:29:16,400
more generally in these areas kind of
 

4295
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:20,080
more generally in these areas kind of
looks at settings in which the number of

4296
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:20,090
looks at settings in which the number of
 

4297
01:29:20,090 --> 01:29:23,049
looks at settings in which the number of
actors is potentially extraordinarily

4298
01:29:23,049 --> 01:29:23,059
actors is potentially extraordinarily
 

4299
01:29:23,059 --> 01:29:26,859
actors is potentially extraordinarily
large and their incentives might be

4300
01:29:26,859 --> 01:29:26,869
large and their incentives might be
 

4301
01:29:26,869 --> 01:29:29,410
large and their incentives might be
quite complicated and kind of hard to

4302
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:29,420
quite complicated and kind of hard to
 

4303
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:31,989
quite complicated and kind of hard to
model directly but you still want kind

4304
01:29:31,989 --> 01:29:31,999
model directly but you still want kind
 

4305
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,729
model directly but you still want kind
of algorithmic ways of kind of

4306
01:29:33,729 --> 01:29:33,739
of algorithmic ways of kind of
 

4307
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:35,469
of algorithmic ways of kind of
predicting what will happen or

4308
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:35,479
predicting what will happen or
 

4309
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,089
predicting what will happen or
influencing what will happen in the

4310
01:29:37,089 --> 01:29:37,099
influencing what will happen in the
 

4311
01:29:37,099 --> 01:29:41,379
influencing what will happen in the
design of platforms so what to you is

4312
01:29:41,379 --> 01:29:41,389
design of platforms so what to you is
 

4313
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:44,169
design of platforms so what to you is
the most beautiful idea that you've

4314
01:29:44,169 --> 01:29:44,179
the most beautiful idea that you've
 

4315
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:47,500
the most beautiful idea that you've
encountered in game theory there's a lot

4316
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:47,510
encountered in game theory there's a lot
 

4317
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:49,770
encountered in game theory there's a lot
of them I'm a big fan of the field I

4318
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:49,780
of them I'm a big fan of the field I
 

4319
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:52,930
of them I'm a big fan of the field I
mean you know I mean technical answers

4320
01:29:52,930 --> 01:29:52,940
mean you know I mean technical answers
 

4321
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:55,719
mean you know I mean technical answers
to that of course would include Nash's

4322
01:29:55,719 --> 01:29:55,729
to that of course would include Nash's
 

4323
01:29:55,729 --> 01:29:58,479
to that of course would include Nash's
work just establishing that you know

4324
01:29:58,479 --> 01:29:58,489
work just establishing that you know
 

4325
01:29:58,489 --> 01:30:00,520
work just establishing that you know
there there's a competitive equilibrium

4326
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:00,530
there there's a competitive equilibrium
 

4327
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:02,049
there there's a competitive equilibrium
under very very general circumstances

4328
01:30:02,049 --> 01:30:02,059
under very very general circumstances
 

4329
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:05,500
under very very general circumstances
which in many ways kind of put the field

4330
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:05,510
which in many ways kind of put the field
 

4331
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:09,489
which in many ways kind of put the field
on a firm conceptual footing because if

4332
01:30:09,489 --> 01:30:09,499
on a firm conceptual footing because if
 

4333
01:30:09,499 --> 01:30:10,989
on a firm conceptual footing because if
you don't have equilibria it's kind of

4334
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:10,999
you don't have equilibria it's kind of
 

4335
01:30:10,999 --> 01:30:12,910
you don't have equilibria it's kind of
hard to ever reason about what might

4336
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:12,920
hard to ever reason about what might
 

4337
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:14,739
hard to ever reason about what might
happen since you know there's just no

4338
01:30:14,739 --> 01:30:14,749
happen since you know there's just no
 

4339
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:17,020
happen since you know there's just no
stability so just the idea that

4340
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:17,030
stability so just the idea that
 

4341
01:30:17,030 --> 01:30:19,120
stability so just the idea that
stability can emerge when there's

4342
01:30:19,120 --> 01:30:19,130
stability can emerge when there's
 

4343
01:30:19,130 --> 01:30:20,950
stability can emerge when there's
multiple or that it means not that it

4344
01:30:20,950 --> 01:30:20,960
multiple or that it means not that it
 

4345
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:22,540
multiple or that it means not that it
will necessarily emerge just that it's

4346
01:30:22,540 --> 01:30:22,550
will necessarily emerge just that it's
 

4347
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:24,520
will necessarily emerge just that it's
possible right it's like the existence

4348
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:24,530
possible right it's like the existence
 

4349
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:26,589
possible right it's like the existence
of equilibrium doesn't mean that sort of

4350
01:30:26,589 --> 01:30:26,599
of equilibrium doesn't mean that sort of
 

4351
01:30:26,599 --> 01:30:28,870
of equilibrium doesn't mean that sort of
natural iterative behavior will

4352
01:30:28,870 --> 01:30:28,880
natural iterative behavior will
 

4353
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,149
natural iterative behavior will
necessarily lead to it in the real world

4354
01:30:31,149 --> 01:30:31,159
necessarily lead to it in the real world
 

4355
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:33,640
necessarily lead to it in the real world
yeah maybe answering a slightly less

4356
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:33,650
yeah maybe answering a slightly less
 

4357
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:35,290
yeah maybe answering a slightly less
personally than you asked the question I

4358
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:35,300
personally than you asked the question I
 

4359
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:37,029
personally than you asked the question I
think within the field of algorithmic

4360
01:30:37,029 --> 01:30:37,039
think within the field of algorithmic
 

4361
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:39,790
think within the field of algorithmic
game theory perhaps the single most

4362
01:30:39,790 --> 01:30:39,800
game theory perhaps the single most
 

4363
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:41,660
game theory perhaps the single most
important

4364
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:41,670
important
 

4365
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:44,660
important
kind of technical contribution that's

4366
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:44,670
kind of technical contribution that's
 

4367
01:30:44,670 --> 01:30:46,250
kind of technical contribution that's
been made is the real the the

4368
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:46,260
been made is the real the the
 

4369
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:48,020
been made is the real the the
realization between close connections

4370
01:30:48,020 --> 01:30:48,030
realization between close connections
 

4371
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,690
realization between close connections
between machine learning and game theory

4372
01:30:50,690 --> 01:30:50,700
between machine learning and game theory
 

4373
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,400
between machine learning and game theory
and in particular between game theory

4374
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:52,410
and in particular between game theory
 

4375
01:30:52,410 --> 01:30:54,020
and in particular between game theory
and the branch of machine learning

4376
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:54,030
and the branch of machine learning
 

4377
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,940
and the branch of machine learning
that's known as no regret learning and

01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:55,950
that's known as no regret learning and
 

4379
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:59,420
that's known as no regret learning and
and this sort of provides a fray a very

4380
01:30:59,420 --> 01:30:59,430
and this sort of provides a fray a very
 

4381
01:30:59,430 --> 01:31:02,390
and this sort of provides a fray a very
general framework in which a bunch of

01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:02,400
general framework in which a bunch of

that's in their self-interest will
 

4389
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:11,270
that's in their self-interest will
actually kind of reach an equilibrium

4390
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:11,280
actually kind of reach an equilibrium
 

4391
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:14,060
actually kind of reach an equilibrium
and actually reach an equilibrium in a

4392
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:14,070
and actually reach an equilibrium in a

01:31:14,070 --> 01:31:18,380
and actually reach an equilibrium in a
you know a pretty you know a rather you

4394
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:18,390
you know a pretty you know a rather you
 

4395
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:22,160
you know a pretty you know a rather you
know short amount of steps so you kind

4396
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:22,170
know short amount of steps so you kind
 

4397
01:31:22,170 --> 01:31:26,450
know short amount of steps so you kind
of mentioned acting greedily can somehow

4398
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:26,460
of mentioned acting greedily can somehow
 

4399
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:29,750
of mentioned acting greedily can somehow
end up pretty good for everybody or

4400
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:29,760
end up pretty good for everybody or
 

4401
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:33,170
end up pretty good for everybody or
pretty bad or pretty bad it will end up

4402
01:31:33,170 --> 01:31:33,180
pretty bad or pretty bad it will end up
 

4403
01:31:33,180 --> 01:31:36,440
pretty bad or pretty bad it will end up
stable yeah right and and you know

4404
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:36,450
stable yeah right and and you know
 

4405
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:39,560
stable yeah right and and you know
stability or equilibrium by itself is

4406
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:39,570
stability or equilibrium by itself is
 

4407
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,840
stability or equilibrium by itself is
neither is not necessarily either a good

4408
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:41,850
neither is not necessarily either a good
 

4409
01:31:41,850 --> 01:31:43,550
neither is not necessarily either a good
thing or a bad thing so what's the

4410
01:31:43,550 --> 01:31:43,560
thing or a bad thing so what's the
 

4411
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:45,170
thing or a bad thing so what's the
connection between machine learning and

4412
01:31:45,170 --> 01:31:45,180
connection between machine learning and
 

4413
01:31:45,180 --> 01:31:46,850
connection between machine learning and
the ideas well if we kind of talked

4414
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:46,860
the ideas well if we kind of talked
 

4415
01:31:46,860 --> 01:31:49,250
the ideas well if we kind of talked
about these ideas already in in kind of

4416
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:49,260
about these ideas already in in kind of
 

4417
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,370
about these ideas already in in kind of
a non-technical way which is maybe the

4418
01:31:52,370 --> 01:31:52,380
a non-technical way which is maybe the
 

4419
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,080
a non-technical way which is maybe the
more interesting way of understanding

4420
01:31:54,080 --> 01:31:54,090
more interesting way of understanding
 

4421
01:31:54,090 --> 01:31:57,590
more interesting way of understanding
them first which is you know we have

4422
01:31:57,590 --> 01:31:57,600
them first which is you know we have
 

4423
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:01,190
them first which is you know we have
many systems platforms and apps these

01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:01,200
many systems platforms and apps these
 

4425
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,160

01:32:34,640 --> 01:32:34,650
necessarily minimize the distance but

4456
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:39,090
growing up like the only resources you
 

4457
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:41,090
growing up like the only resources you
had to do that were like maps in the car

4458
01:32:41,090 --> 01:32:41,100
had to do that were like maps in the car
 

4459
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:42,980
had to do that were like maps in the car
which literally just told you what roads

4460
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:42,990
which literally just told you what roads
 

4461
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:46,040
which literally just told you what roads
were available and then you might have

4462
01:32:46,040 --> 01:32:46,050
were available and then you might have
 

4463
01:32:46,050 --> 01:32:49,160
were available and then you might have
like half hourly traffic reports just

4464
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:49,170
like half hourly traffic reports just
 

4465
01:32:49,170 --> 01:32:51,020
like half hourly traffic reports just
about the major freeways but not about

4466
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:51,030
about the major freeways but not about
 

4467
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:52,610
about the major freeways but not about
side roads so you were pretty much on

4468
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:52,620
side roads so you were pretty much on
 

4469
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:55,169
side roads so you were pretty much on
your own and now we've

4470
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:55,179
your own and now we've
 

4471
01:32:55,179 --> 01:32:56,790
your own and now we've
these apps you pull it out and you say I

4472
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:56,800
these apps you pull it out and you say I
 

4473
01:32:56,800 --> 01:32:58,410
these apps you pull it out and you say I
want to go from point A to point B and

4474
01:32:58,410 --> 01:32:58,420
want to go from point A to point B and
 

4475
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:01,140
want to go from point A to point B and
in response kind of to what everybody

4476
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:01,150
in response kind of to what everybody
 

4477
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:03,149
in response kind of to what everybody
else is doing if you like what all the

4478
01:33:03,149 --> 01:33:03,159
else is doing if you like what all the
 

4479
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:05,009
else is doing if you like what all the
other players in this game are doing

4480
01:33:05,009 --> 01:33:05,019
other players in this game are doing
 

4481
01:33:05,019 --> 01:33:07,649
other players in this game are doing
right now here's the the you know the

4482
01:33:07,649 --> 01:33:07,659
right now here's the the you know the
 

4483
01:33:07,659 --> 01:33:09,750
right now here's the the you know the
the route that minimizes your driving

4484
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:09,760
the route that minimizes your driving
 

4485
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,719
the route that minimizes your driving
time so it is really kind of computing a

4486
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:12,729
time so it is really kind of computing a
 

4487
01:33:12,729 --> 01:33:15,870
time so it is really kind of computing a
selfish best response for each of us in

4488
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:15,880
selfish best response for each of us in
 

4489
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,969
selfish best response for each of us in
response to what all of the rest of us

4490
01:33:17,969 --> 01:33:17,979
response to what all of the rest of us
 

4491
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:20,759
response to what all of the rest of us
are doing at any given moment and so you

4492
01:33:20,759 --> 01:33:20,769
are doing at any given moment and so you
 

4493
01:33:20,769 --> 01:33:23,279
are doing at any given moment and so you
know I think it's quite fair to think of

4494
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:23,289
know I think it's quite fair to think of
 

4495
01:33:23,289 --> 01:33:26,729
know I think it's quite fair to think of
these apps as driving or nudging us all

4496
01:33:26,729 --> 01:33:26,739
these apps as driving or nudging us all

4500
01:33:32,939 --> 01:33:32,949
equilibrium of that game now you might
 

4501
01:33:32,949 --> 01:33:34,859

ask like well that sounds great why is

4502
01:33:34,859 --> 01:33:34,869
ask like well that sounds great why is
 

4503
01:33:34,869 --> 01:33:35,699
ask like well that sounds great why is
that a bad thing

4504
01:33:35,699 --> 01:33:35,709
that a bad thing
 

4505
01:33:35,709 --> 01:33:39,359
that a bad thing
well you know it's it's known both in

4506
01:33:39,359 --> 01:33:39,369
well you know it's it's known both in
 

4507
01:33:39,369 --> 01:33:43,290
well you know it's it's known both in
theory and with some limited studies

4508
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:43,300
theory and with some limited studies
 

4509

significantly higher than it would be
 

4519
01:33:57,489 --> 01:34:00,029
significantly higher than it would be
under other solutions and then you have

4520
01:34:00,029 --> 01:34:00,039
under other solutions and then you have
 

4521
01:34:00,039 --> 01:34:01,649
under other solutions and then you have
to talk about what those other solutions

4522
01:34:01,649 --> 01:34:01,659
to talk about what those other solutions
 

4523
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:04,500
to talk about what those other solutions
might be and what what the algorithms to

might be and what what the algorithms to
 

4525
01:34:04,510 --> 01:34:06,029
might be and what what the algorithms to
implement them are which we do discuss

4541
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,649

of the most important lessons of game

4544
01:34:27,270 --> 01:34:27,280
of the most important lessons of game
 

4545
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:28,770
of the most important lessons of game
theory is that just because we're at

4546
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:28,780
theory is that just because we're at
 

4547
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,179
theory is that just because we're at
equilibrium doesn't mean that there's

4548
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:30,189
equilibrium doesn't mean that there's
 

4549
01:34:30,189 --> 01:34:32,640
equilibrium doesn't mean that there's
not a solution in which some or maybe

4550
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:32,650
not a solution in which some or maybe
 

4551
01:34:32,650 --> 01:34:35,310
not a solution in which some or maybe
even all of us might be better off and

4552
01:34:35,310 --> 01:34:35,320
even all of us might be better off and
 

4553
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:36,839
even all of us might be better off and
then the connection to machine learning

4554
01:34:36,839 --> 01:34:36,849
then the connection to machine learning
 

4555
01:34:36,849 --> 01:34:39,029
then the connection to machine learning
of course is that in all these platforms

history it still surprises me that you
 

4619
01:35:54,969 --> 01:35:56,280
history it still surprises me that you
know you had people at the RAND

4620
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:56,290
know you had people at the RAND
 

4621
01:35:56,290 --> 01:35:58,020
know you had people at the RAND

that they were taking seriously you know

4630
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:06,460
that they were taking seriously you know
 

4631
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,970
that they were taking seriously you know
you know I'm sure if I was there maybe

4632
01:36:08,970 --> 01:36:08,980
you know I'm sure if I was there maybe
 

4633
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,560
you know I'm sure if I was there maybe
it wouldn't have seemed as as naive as

4634
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:10,570
it wouldn't have seemed as as naive as
 

4635
01:36:10,570 --> 01:36:13,050
it wouldn't have seemed as as naive as
it does at the time you know seems to

4636
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:13,060
it does at the time you know seems to
 

4637
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,089
it does at the time you know seems to
have worked which is why it seems naive

4638
01:36:15,089 --> 01:36:15,099
have worked which is why it seems naive
 

4639
01:36:15,099 --> 01:36:17,220
have worked which is why it seems naive
well we're still here we're still here

4640
01:36:17,220 --> 01:36:17,230
well we're still here we're still here
 

4641
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:19,020
well we're still here we're still here
in that sense yeah even though I kind of

4642
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:19,030
in that sense yeah even though I kind of
 

4643
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,839
in that sense yeah even though I kind of
laugh at those efforts they were more

4644
01:36:21,839 --> 01:36:21,849
laugh at those efforts they were more
 

4645
01:36:21,849 --> 01:36:23,310
laugh at those efforts they were more
sensible than than they would be now

4646
01:36:23,310 --> 01:36:23,320
sensible than than they would be now
 

4647
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:24,750
sensible than than they would be now
right because there were sort of only

4648
01:36:24,750 --> 01:36:24,760
right because there were sort of only
 

4649
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,850
right because there were sort of only
two nuclear powers at the time and you

4650
01:36:26,850 --> 01:36:26,860
two nuclear powers at the time and you
 

4651
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,339
two nuclear powers at the time and you
didn't have to worry about deterring new

4652
01:36:29,339 --> 01:36:29,349
didn't have to worry about deterring new
 

4653
01:36:29,349 --> 01:36:31,500
didn't have to worry about deterring new
entrants and who was developing the

4654
01:36:31,500 --> 01:36:31,510
entrants and who was developing the
 

4655
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:33,780
entrants and who was developing the
capacity and so we have many we have

4656
01:36:33,780 --> 01:36:33,790
capacity and so we have many we have
 

4657
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:37,439
capacity and so we have many we have
this it's definitely a game with more

4658
01:36:37,439 --> 01:36:37,449
this it's definitely a game with more
 

4659
01:36:37,449 --> 01:36:39,720
this it's definitely a game with more
players now and more potential entrants

4660
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:39,730
players now and more potential entrants
 

4661
01:36:39,730 --> 01:36:42,419
players now and more potential entrants
I'm not in general somebody who

4662
01:36:42,419 --> 01:36:42,429
I'm not in general somebody who
 

4663
01:36:42,429 --> 01:36:44,640
I'm not in general somebody who
advocates using kind of simple

01:36:47,129 --> 01:36:47,139
mathematical models when the stakes are
 

4667
01:36:47,139 --> 01:36:49,950
mathematical models when the stakes are
as high as things like that and the

4668
01:36:49,950 --> 01:36:49,960
as high as things like that and the
 

4669
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:51,930
as high as things like that and the
complexities are very political and

4670
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:51,940
complexities are very political and
 

4671
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:55,800
complexities are very political and
social but but we are still here so

you've worn many hats one of which the

4674
01:36:58,680 --> 01:36:58,690
you've worn many hats one of which the
 

4675
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,450
you've worn many hats one of which the
one that first caused me to become a big

01:37:00,450 --> 01:37:00,460
one that first caused me to become a big
 

4677
01:37:00,460 --> 01:37:02,160
one that first caused me to become a big
fan of your work many years ago is

4678
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:02,170
fan of your work many years ago is
 

4679
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:05,939
fan of your work many years ago is
algorithmic trading so I have to just

4680
01:37:05,939 --> 01:37:05,949
algorithmic trading so I have to just
 

4681
01:37:05,949 --> 01:37:07,379
algorithmic trading so I have to just
ask a question about this because you

4682
01:37:07,379 --> 01:37:07,389
ask a question about this because you
 

4683
01:37:07,389 --> 01:37:09,510
ask a question about this because you
have so much fascinating work there in

4684
01:37:09,510 --> 01:37:09,520
have so much fascinating work there in
 

4685
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:11,939
have so much fascinating work there in
the 21st century would what role do you

4686
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:11,949
the 21st century would what role do you
 

4687
01:37:11,949 --> 01:37:15,359
the 21st century would what role do you
think algorithms have in space of

4688
01:37:15,359 --> 01:37:15,369
think algorithms have in space of
 

4689
01:37:15,369 --> 01:37:17,580

4690
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:17,590
trading investment in the financial
 

4691
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:20,010
trading investment in the financial
sector yeah

4692
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:20,020
sector yeah
 

4693
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:22,210
sector yeah
it's a good question I mean

4694
01:37:22,210 --> 01:37:22,220
it's a good question I mean
 

4695
01:37:22,220 --> 01:37:25,570
it's a good question I mean
in the time I've spent on Wall Street

4696
01:37:25,570 --> 01:37:25,580
in the time I've spent on Wall Street
 

4697
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,730
in the time I've spent on Wall Street
and in finance you know I've seen a

4698
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:27,740
and in finance you know I've seen a
 

4699
01:37:27,740 --> 01:37:29,590
and in finance you know I've seen a
clear progression and I think it's a

4700
01:37:29,590 --> 01:37:29,600
clear progression and I think it's a
 

4701
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,540
clear progression and I think it's a
progression that kind of models the use

4702
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:31,550
progression that kind of models the use
 

4703
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,580
progression that kind of models the use
of algorithms and automation more

4704
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:33,590
of algorithms and automation more
 

4705
01:37:33,590 --> 01:37:37,090
of algorithms and automation more
generally in society which is you know

4706
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:37,100
generally in society which is you know
 

4707
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,880
generally in society which is you know
the things that kind of get taken over

4708
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:39,890
the things that kind of get taken over
 

4709
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,100
the things that kind of get taken over
by the algos first are sort of the

4710
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:42,110
by the algos first are sort of the

01:37:42,110 --> 01:37:44,830
by the algos first are sort of the
things that computers are obviously

4712
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:44,840
things that computers are obviously
 

4713
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:49,210
things that computers are obviously
better at than people right so you know

4714
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:49,220
better at than people right so you know
 

4715
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,350
better at than people right so you know
so first of all there needed to be this

4716
01:37:50,350 --> 01:37:50,360
so first of all there needed to be this
 

4717
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:52,540
so first of all there needed to be this
era of automation right we're just you

4718
01:37:52,540 --> 01:37:52,550
era of automation right we're just you
 

4719
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:54,520
era of automation right we're just you
know financial exchanges became largely

4720
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:54,530
know financial exchanges became largely
 

4721
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:57,280
know financial exchanges became largely
electronic which then enabled the

4722
01:37:57,280 --> 01:37:57,290
electronic which then enabled the
 

4723
01:37:57,290 --> 01:38:00,550
electronic which then enabled the
possibility of you know trading becoming

4724
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
possibility of you know trading becoming
 

4725
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,590
possibility of you know trading becoming
more algorithmic because once you know

4726
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:02,600
more algorithmic because once you know
 

4727
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:04,480
more algorithmic because once you know
the exchanges are electronic an

4728
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:04,490
the exchanges are electronic an
 

4729
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:06,730
the exchanges are electronic an
algorithm can submit an order through an

4730
01:38:06,730 --> 01:38:06,740
algorithm can submit an order through an
 

4731
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:08,920
algorithm can submit an order through an
API just as well as a human can do at a

4732
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:08,930
API just as well as a human can do at a
 

4733
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:10,990
API just as well as a human can do at a
monitor quickly it can read all the data

4734
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:11,000
monitor quickly it can read all the data
 

4735
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:13,630
monitor quickly it can read all the data
so yeah and so you know I think the the

4736
01:38:13,630 --> 01:38:13,640
so yeah and so you know I think the the
 

4737
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,440
so yeah and so you know I think the the
places where algorithmic trading have

4738
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:17,450
places where algorithmic trading have
 

4739
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:19,240
places where algorithmic trading have
had the greatest inroads and had the

4740
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:19,250
had the greatest inroads and had the
 

4741
01:38:19,250 --> 01:38:21,550
had the greatest inroads and had the
first inroads were in in kind of

4742
01:38:21,550 --> 01:38:21,560
first inroads were in in kind of
 

4743
01:38:21,560 --> 01:38:23,500
first inroads were in in kind of
execution problems kind of optimized

4744
01:38:23,500 --> 01:38:23,510
execution problems kind of optimized
 

4745
01:38:23,510 --> 01:38:25,900
execution problems kind of optimized
execution problems so what I mean by

4746
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:25,910
execution problems so what I mean by
 

4747
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:28,540
execution problems so what I mean by
that is at a large brokerage firm for

4748
01:38:28,540 --> 01:38:28,550
that is at a large brokerage firm for
 

4749
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:30,490
that is at a large brokerage firm for
example one of the lines of business

4750
01:38:30,490 --> 01:38:30,500
example one of the lines of business
 

4751
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,950
example one of the lines of business
might be on behalf of large

4752
01:38:32,950 --> 01:38:32,960
might be on behalf of large
 

4753
01:38:32,960 --> 01:38:35,590
might be on behalf of large
institutional clients taking you know

4754
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,600
institutional clients taking you know
 

4755
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:37,180
institutional clients taking you know
what we might consider difficult trade

4756
01:38:37,180 --> 01:38:37,190
what we might consider difficult trade
 

4757
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:39,280
what we might consider difficult trade
so it's not like a mom-and-pop investor

4758
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:39,290
so it's not like a mom-and-pop investor
 

4759
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:40,840
so it's not like a mom-and-pop investor

01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:43,370
Microsoft it's a large hedge fund saying
 

4763
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:46,180

you know I want to buy a very very large
 

4765
01:38:46,190 --> 01:38:49,420
you know I want to buy a very very large
stake in Apple and I want to do it over

4766
01:38:49,420 --> 01:38:49,430
stake in Apple and I want to do it over
 

4767
01:38:49,430 --> 01:38:52,150
stake in Apple and I want to do it over
the span of a day and it's such a large

4768
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:52,160
the span of a day and it's such a large
 

4769
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:53,860
the span of a day and it's such a large
volume that if you're not clever about

4770
01:38:53,860 --> 01:38:53,870
volume that if you're not clever about
 

4771
01:38:53,870 --> 01:38:56,200
volume that if you're not clever about
how you break that trade up not just

4772
01:38:56,200 --> 01:38:56,210
how you break that trade up not just
 

4773
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:58,000
how you break that trade up not just
over time but over perhaps multiple

4774
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:58,010
over time but over perhaps multiple
 

4775
01:38:58,010 --> 01:39:00,190

different electronic exchanges that all
 

4777
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:01,990

let you trade Apple on their platform

4778
01:39:01,990 --> 01:39:02,000
let you trade Apple on their platform

you know you will you will move you'll
push prices around in a way that hurts

4782
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:06,830
push prices around in a way that hurts
 

4783
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:09,670
push prices around in a way that hurts
your your execution so you know this is

4784
01:39:09,670 --> 01:39:09,680
your your execution so you know this is
 

4785
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,480

optimization problem this is a control
 

4789
01:39:12,410 --> 01:39:16,960
optimization problem this is a control
problem right and so machines are a

4790
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:16,970
problem right and so machines are a
 

4791
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:19,120
problem right and so machines are a
better we know how to design algorithms

4792
01:39:19,120 --> 01:39:19,130
better we know how to design algorithms
 

4793
01:39:19,130 --> 01:39:21,310
better we know how to design algorithms
you know that are better at that kind of

yeah so I think we are in an era where

4832
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:10,070
yeah so I think we are in an era where
 

4833
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:11,560
yeah so I think we are in an era where
you know clearly there have been some

you know clearly there have been some

01:40:11,570 --> 01:40:12,850
you know clearly there have been some
very successful

01:40:16,989 --> 01:40:16,999
you know quant hedge funds that are you

01:40:16,999 --> 01:40:18,969
you know quant hedge funds that are you
know in what we would traditionally call

01:40:18,969 --> 01:40:18,979
know in what we would traditionally call

01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:21,320
you know still in this the stat ARB
 

4843
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,040
you know still in this the stat ARB
regime like so you know stat are

4844
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:24,050
regime like so you know stat are
 

4845
01:40:24,050 --> 01:40:25,899
regime like so you know stat are
referring to statistical arbitrage but

4846
01:40:25,899 --> 01:40:25,909
referring to statistical arbitrage but
 

4847
01:40:25,909 --> 01:40:27,729
referring to statistical arbitrage but
but for the purposes of this

4848
01:40:27,729 --> 01:40:27,739
but for the purposes of this
 

4849
01:40:27,739 --> 01:40:29,109
but for the purposes of this
conversation what it really means is

4850
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
conversation what it really means is
 

4851
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:32,350
conversation what it really means is
making directional predictions in asset

4852
01:40:32,350 --> 01:40:32,360
making directional predictions in asset
 

4853
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,290
making directional predictions in asset
price movement or returns your

4854
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:35,300
price movement or returns your
 

4855
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,600
price movement or returns your
prediction about that directional

4856
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:37,610
prediction about that directional
 

4857
01:40:37,610 --> 01:40:40,389
prediction about that directional
movement is good for you know you you

4858
01:40:40,389 --> 01:40:40,399
movement is good for you know you you
 

4859
01:40:40,399 --> 01:40:43,239
movement is good for you know you you
have a view that it's valid for some

4860
01:40:43,239 --> 01:40:43,249
have a view that it's valid for some
 

4861
01:40:43,249 --> 01:40:45,759
have a view that it's valid for some
period of time between a few seconds and

4862
01:40:45,759 --> 01:40:45,769
period of time between a few seconds and
 

4863
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:48,429
period of time between a few seconds and
a few days and that's the amount of time

4864
01:40:48,429 --> 01:40:48,439
a few days and that's the amount of time
 

4865
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:49,750
a few days and that's the amount of time
that you're gonna kind of get into the

4866
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:49,760
that you're gonna kind of get into the
 

4867
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:51,639
that you're gonna kind of get into the
position hold it and then hopefully be

4868
01:40:51,639 --> 01:40:51,649
position hold it and then hopefully be
 

4869
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:53,409
position hold it and then hopefully be
right about the directional movement and

4870
01:40:53,409 --> 01:40:53,419
right about the directional movement and
 

4871
01:40:53,419 --> 01:40:55,750
right about the directional movement and
you know buy low and sell high as the

4872
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:55,760
you know buy low and sell high as the
 

4873
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,979
you know buy low and sell high as the
cliche goes so that is a you know kind

4874
01:40:59,979 --> 01:40:59,989
cliche goes so that is a you know kind
 

4875
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:02,049
cliche goes so that is a you know kind
of a sweet spot I think for quant

4876
01:41:02,049 --> 01:41:02,059
of a sweet spot I think for quant
 

4877
01:41:02,059 --> 01:41:04,959
of a sweet spot I think for quant
trading and investing right now and has

4878
01:41:04,959 --> 01:41:04,969
trading and investing right now and has
 

4879
01:41:04,969 --> 01:41:07,540
trading and investing right now and has
been for some time when you really get

4880
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:07,550
been for some time when you really get
 

4881
01:41:07,550 --> 01:41:10,929
been for some time when you really get
to kind of more warren buffett style

4882
01:41:10,929 --> 01:41:10,939
to kind of more warren buffett style
 

4883
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:13,120
to kind of more warren buffett style
timescales right like you know my

4884
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:13,130
timescales right like you know my
 

4885
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,189
timescales right like you know my
cartoon of warren buffett is that you

4886
01:41:15,189 --> 01:41:15,199
cartoon of warren buffett is that you
 

4887
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,049
cartoon of warren buffett is that you
know warren buffett sits and thinks what

4888
01:41:17,049 --> 01:41:17,059
know warren buffett sits and thinks what
 

4889
01:41:17,059 --> 01:41:19,299
know warren buffett sits and thinks what
the long-term value of Apple really

4890
01:41:19,299 --> 01:41:19,309
the long-term value of Apple really
 

4891
01:41:19,309 --> 01:41:21,699
the long-term value of Apple really
should be and he doesn't even look at

4892
01:41:21,699 --> 01:41:21,709
should be and he doesn't even look at
 

4893
01:41:21,709 --> 01:41:24,100
should be and he doesn't even look at
what Apple's doing today he just decides

4894
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:24,110
what Apple's doing today he just decides
 

4895
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:26,529
what Apple's doing today he just decides
you know yeah you know I think that this

4896
01:41:26,529 --> 01:41:26,539
you know yeah you know I think that this
 

4897
01:41:26,539 --> 01:41:28,419
you know yeah you know I think that this
was what its long-term value is and it's

4898
01:41:28,419 --> 01:41:28,429
was what its long-term value is and it's
 

4899
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:30,489
was what its long-term value is and it's
far from that right now and so I'm gonna

4900
01:41:30,489 --> 01:41:30,499
far from that right now and so I'm gonna
 

4901
01:41:30,499 --> 01:41:32,679
far from that right now and so I'm gonna
buy some Apple or you know shorts and

4902
01:41:32,679 --> 01:41:32,689
buy some Apple or you know shorts and
 

4903
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:35,379
buy some Apple or you know shorts and
Apple and I'm gonna I'm gonna sit on

4904
01:41:35,379 --> 01:41:35,389
Apple and I'm gonna I'm gonna sit on
 

4905
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:39,129
Apple and I'm gonna I'm gonna sit on
that for 10 or 20 years okay so when

4906
01:41:39,129 --> 01:41:39,139
that for 10 or 20 years okay so when
 

4907
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:40,719
that for 10 or 20 years okay so when
you're at that kind of time scale or

4908
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:40,729
you're at that kind of time scale or
 

4909
01:41:40,729 --> 01:41:44,889
you're at that kind of time scale or
even more than just a few days all kinds

4910
01:41:44,889 --> 01:41:44,899
even more than just a few days all kinds
 

4911
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:48,609
even more than just a few days all kinds
of other sources of risk and information

4912
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:48,619
of other sources of risk and information
 

4913
01:41:48,619 --> 01:41:50,080
of other sources of risk and information
you know so now

4914
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:50,090
you know so now
 

4915
01:41:50,090 --> 01:41:51,880
you know so now
are talking about holding things through

4916
01:41:51,880 --> 01:41:51,890
are talking about holding things through
 

4917
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:54,790
are talking about holding things through
recessions and economic cycles wars can

4918
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:54,800
recessions and economic cycles wars can
 

4919
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,340
recessions and economic cycles wars can
break out so there you have to install a

4920
01:41:57,340 --> 01:41:57,350
break out so there you have to install a
 

4921
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:59,590
break out so there you have to install a
human nature at 11:00 yeah and you need

4922
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
human nature at 11:00 yeah and you need
 

4923
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:02,470
human nature at 11:00 yeah and you need
to just be able to ingest many many more

4924
01:42:02,470 --> 01:42:02,480
to just be able to ingest many many more
 

4925
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:04,570
to just be able to ingest many many more
sources of data that are on wildly

4926
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:04,580
sources of data that are on wildly
 

4927
01:42:04,580 --> 01:42:06,790
sources of data that are on wildly
different timescales right so if I'm an

4928
01:42:06,790 --> 01:42:06,800
different timescales right so if I'm an
 

4929
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,430
different timescales right so if I'm an
hft I'm a high-frequency trader like I

4930
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
hft I'm a high-frequency trader like I
 

4931
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,270
hft I'm a high-frequency trader like I
don't I don't I really my main source of

4932
01:42:13,270 --> 01:42:13,280
don't I don't I really my main source of
 

4933
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,550
don't I don't I really my main source of
data is just the data from the exchanges

4934
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:15,560
data is just the data from the exchanges
 

4935
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,410
data is just the data from the exchanges
themselves about the activity in the

4936
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:17,420
themselves about the activity in the
 

4937
01:42:17,420 --> 01:42:19,960
themselves about the activity in the
exchanges right and maybe I need to pay

4938
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:19,970
exchanges right and maybe I need to pay
 

4939
01:42:19,970 --> 01:42:21,610
exchanges right and maybe I need to pay
you know I need to keep an eye on the

4940
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:21,620
you know I need to keep an eye on the
 

4941
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:23,710
you know I need to keep an eye on the
news right because you know that can

4942
01:42:23,710 --> 01:42:23,720
news right because you know that can
 

4943
01:42:23,720 --> 01:42:26,110
news right because you know that can
sudden cause sudden you know the the you

4944
01:42:26,110 --> 01:42:26,120
sudden cause sudden you know the the you
 

4945
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:28,330
sudden cause sudden you know the the you
know CEO gets caught in a scandal or you

4946
01:42:28,330 --> 01:42:28,340
know CEO gets caught in a scandal or you
 

4947
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,340
know CEO gets caught in a scandal or you
know gets run over by a bus or something

4948
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:30,350
know gets run over by a bus or something
 

4949
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:32,110
know gets run over by a bus or something
that can cause very sudden changes in

4950
01:42:32,110 --> 01:42:32,120
that can cause very sudden changes in
 

4951
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:34,650
that can cause very sudden changes in
but you know I don't need to understand

4952
01:42:34,650 --> 01:42:34,660
but you know I don't need to understand
 

4953
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:36,700
but you know I don't need to understand
economic cycles I don't need to

4954
01:42:36,700 --> 01:42:36,710
economic cycles I don't need to
 

4955
01:42:36,710 --> 01:42:38,200
economic cycles I don't need to
understand recessions I don't need to

4956
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:38,210
understand recessions I don't need to
 

4957
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:40,780
understand recessions I don't need to
worry about the political situation or

4958
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:40,790
worry about the political situation or
 

4959
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:42,640
worry about the political situation or
war breaking out in this part of the

4960
01:42:42,640 --> 01:42:42,650
war breaking out in this part of the
 

4961
01:42:42,650 --> 01:42:44,440
war breaking out in this part of the
world because you know all you need to

4962
01:42:44,440 --> 01:42:44,450
world because you know all you need to
 

4963
01:42:44,450 --> 01:42:46,000
world because you know all you need to
know is as long as that's not gonna

4964
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:46,010
know is as long as that's not gonna
 

4965
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:49,240
know is as long as that's not gonna
happen in the left next 500 milliseconds

4966
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:49,250
happen in the left next 500 milliseconds
 

4967
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:52,540
happen in the left next 500 milliseconds
then you know my models good when you

4968
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:52,550
then you know my models good when you
 

4969
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:54,070
then you know my models good when you
get to these longer timescales you

4970
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:54,080
get to these longer timescales you
 

4971
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,570
get to these longer timescales you
really have to worry about that kind of

4972
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:55,580
really have to worry about that kind of
 

4973
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:56,740
really have to worry about that kind of
stuff and people in the machine learning

4974
01:42:56,740 --> 01:42:56,750
stuff and people in the machine learning
 

4975
01:42:56,750 --> 01:42:58,600
stuff and people in the machine learning
community are starting to think about

4976
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:58,610
community are starting to think about
 

4977
01:42:58,610 --> 01:43:01,690
community are starting to think about
this we held a we did we jointly

4978
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:01,700
this we held a we did we jointly
 

4979
01:43:01,700 --> 01:43:04,480
this we held a we did we jointly
sponsored a workshop at 10:00 with the

4980
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:04,490
sponsored a workshop at 10:00 with the
 

4981
01:43:04,490 --> 01:43:06,820
sponsored a workshop at 10:00 with the
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia a

little more than a year ago on you know

4984
01:43:09,040 --> 01:43:09,050
little more than a year ago on you know
 

4985
01:43:09,050 --> 01:43:10,150
little more than a year ago on you know
I think the title is something like

4986
01:43:10,150 --> 01:43:10,160
I think the title is something like
 

4987
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:12,400
I think the title is something like
machine learning for macroeconomic

4988
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:12,410
machine learning for macroeconomic
 

4989
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:13,810
machine learning for macroeconomic
prediction

4990
01:43:13,810 --> 01:43:13,820
prediction
 

4991
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,700
prediction
you know macroeconomic referring

4992
01:43:15,700 --> 01:43:15,710
you know macroeconomic referring
 

4993
01:43:15,710 --> 01:43:17,980
you know macroeconomic referring
specifically to these longer timescales

4994
01:43:17,980 --> 01:43:17,990
specifically to these longer timescales
 

4995
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:19,690
specifically to these longer timescales
and you know it was an interesting

4996
01:43:19,690 --> 01:43:19,700
and you know it was an interesting
 

4997
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:23,170
and you know it was an interesting
conference but it you know my it left me

4998
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:23,180
conference but it you know my it left me
 

4999
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,880
conference but it you know my it left me
with greater confidence that we have a

5000
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:27,890
with greater confidence that we have a
 

5001
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:29,920
with greater confidence that we have a
long way to go to you know and so I

5002
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:29,930
long way to go to you know and so I
 

5003
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:32,050
long way to go to you know and so I
think that people that you know in the

5004
01:43:32,050 --> 01:43:32,060
think that people that you know in the
 

5005
01:43:32,060 --> 01:43:33,810
think that people that you know in the
grand scheme of things you know if

5006
01:43:33,810 --> 01:43:33,820
grand scheme of things you know if
 

5007
01:43:33,820 --> 01:43:36,280
grand scheme of things you know if
somebody asked me like well whose job on

5008
01:43:36,280 --> 01:43:36,290
somebody asked me like well whose job on
 

5009
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:38,470
somebody asked me like well whose job on
Wall Street is safe from the bots I

5010
01:43:38,470 --> 01:43:38,480
Wall Street is safe from the bots I
 

5011
01:43:38,480 --> 01:43:40,630
Wall Street is safe from the bots I
think people that are at that longer you

5012
01:43:40,630 --> 01:43:40,640
think people that are at that longer you
 

5013
01:43:40,640 --> 01:43:42,250
think people that are at that longer you
know the time scale and have that

5014
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:42,260
know the time scale and have that
 

5015
01:43:42,260 --> 01:43:44,440
know the time scale and have that
appetite for all the risks involved in

5016
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:44,450
appetite for all the risks involved in
 

5017
01:43:44,450 --> 01:43:47,200
appetite for all the risks involved in
long term investing and that really need

5018
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,210
long term investing and that really need
 

5019
01:43:47,210 --> 01:43:49,660
long term investing and that really need
kind of not just algorithms that can

5020
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:49,670
kind of not just algorithms that can
 

5021
01:43:49,670 --> 01:43:51,490
kind of not just algorithms that can
optimize from data but they need views

5022
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:51,500
optimize from data but they need views
 

5023
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,980
optimize from data but they need views
on stuff they need views on the

5024
01:43:53,980 --> 01:43:53,990
on stuff they need views on the
 

5025
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:56,680
on stuff they need views on the
political landscape economic cycles and

5026
01:43:56,680 --> 01:43:56,690
political landscape economic cycles and
 

5027
01:43:56,690 --> 01:43:59,920
political landscape economic cycles and
the like and I think you know they're

5028
01:43:59,920 --> 01:43:59,930
the like and I think you know they're
 

5029
01:43:59,930 --> 01:44:01,660
the like and I think you know they're
they're they're pretty safe for a while

5030
01:44:01,660 --> 01:44:01,670
they're they're pretty safe for a while
 

5031
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,970
they're they're pretty safe for a while
as far as I can tell so Warren Buffett

5032
01:44:03,970 --> 01:44:03,980
as far as I can tell so Warren Buffett
 

5033
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:06,550
as far as I can tell so Warren Buffett
yeah I'm not seeing you know a robo

5034
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:06,560
yeah I'm not seeing you know a robo
 

5035
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:08,770
yeah I'm not seeing you know a robo
Warren Buffett anytime so she'd give him

5036
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:08,780
Warren Buffett anytime so she'd give him
 

5037
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:13,090
Warren Buffett anytime so she'd give him
comfort last question if you could go

5038
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:13,100
comfort last question if you could go
 

5039
01:44:13,100 --> 01:44:16,750
comfort last question if you could go
back to if there's a day in your life

5040
01:44:16,750 --> 01:44:16,760
back to if there's a day in your life
 

5041
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:18,340
back to if there's a day in your life
you could relive because I made you

5042
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:18,350
you could relive because I made you
 

5043
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:23,860
you could relive because I made you
truly happy maybe you outside family boy

5044
01:44:23,860 --> 01:44:23,870
truly happy maybe you outside family boy
 

5045
01:44:23,870 --> 01:44:27,700
truly happy maybe you outside family boy
otherwise do you know what what day

5046
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:27,710
otherwise do you know what what day
 

5047
01:44:27,710 --> 01:44:28,390
otherwise do you know what what day
would it be

5048
01:44:28,390 --> 01:44:28,400
would it be
 

5049
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,360
would it be
what can you look back you remember just

5050
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:31,370
what can you look back you remember just
 

5051
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:35,170
what can you look back you remember just
being profoundly transformed in some way

5052
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:35,180
being profoundly transformed in some way
 

5053
01:44:35,180 --> 01:44:41,410
being profoundly transformed in some way
or blissful I'll answer a slightly

5054
01:44:41,410 --> 01:44:41,420
or blissful I'll answer a slightly
 

5055
01:44:41,420 --> 01:44:42,820
or blissful I'll answer a slightly
different question which is like what's

5056
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:42,830
different question which is like what's
 

5057
01:44:42,830 --> 01:44:46,270
different question which is like what's
a day in my life or my career that was

5058
01:44:46,270 --> 01:44:46,280
a day in my life or my career that was
 

5059
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:49,240
a day in my life or my career that was
kind of a watershed moment I went

5060
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:49,250
kind of a watershed moment I went
 

5061
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:52,300
kind of a watershed moment I went
straight from undergrad to doctoral

5062
01:44:52,300 --> 01:44:52,310
straight from undergrad to doctoral
 

5063
01:44:52,310 --> 01:44:54,340
straight from undergrad to doctoral
studies and you know that's not at all a

5064
01:44:54,340 --> 01:44:54,350
studies and you know that's not at all a
 

5065
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:56,920
studies and you know that's not at all a
typical and I'm also from an academic

5066
01:44:56,920 --> 01:44:56,930
typical and I'm also from an academic
 

5067
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:59,500
typical and I'm also from an academic
family like my dad was a professor or my

5068
01:44:59,500 --> 01:44:59,510
family like my dad was a professor or my
 

5069
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,630
family like my dad was a professor or my
uncle on his side as a professor both my

5070
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:01,640
uncle on his side as a professor both my
 

5071
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:03,790
uncle on his side as a professor both my
grandfather's were professors all kinds

5072
01:45:03,790 --> 01:45:03,800
grandfather's were professors all kinds
 

5073
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:06,820
grandfather's were professors all kinds
of majors to philosophy yeah all over

5074
01:45:06,820 --> 01:45:06,830
of majors to philosophy yeah all over
 

5075
01:45:06,830 --> 01:45:10,270
of majors to philosophy yeah all over
the map yeah and I was a grad student

5076
01:45:10,270 --> 01:45:10,280
the map yeah and I was a grad student
 

5077
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:11,890
the map yeah and I was a grad student
here just up the river at Harvard and

5078
01:45:11,890 --> 01:45:11,900
here just up the river at Harvard and
 

5079
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:13,630
here just up the river at Harvard and
came to study with less valiant which

5080
01:45:13,630 --> 01:45:13,640
came to study with less valiant which
 

5081
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:16,000
came to study with less valiant which
was a wonderful experience but you know

5082
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:16,010
was a wonderful experience but you know
 

5083
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:17,680
was a wonderful experience but you know
I remember my first year of graduate

5084
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:17,690
I remember my first year of graduate
 

5085
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:20,350
I remember my first year of graduate
school I was generally pretty unhappy

5086
01:45:20,350 --> 01:45:20,360
school I was generally pretty unhappy
 

5087
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:23,290
school I was generally pretty unhappy
and I was unhappy because you know at

5088
01:45:23,290 --> 01:45:23,300
and I was unhappy because you know at
 

5089
01:45:23,300 --> 01:45:25,030
and I was unhappy because you know at
Berkeley as an undergraduate you know

5090
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,040
Berkeley as an undergraduate you know
 

5091
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:26,440
Berkeley as an undergraduate you know
yeah I studied a lot of math and

5092
01:45:26,440 --> 01:45:26,450
yeah I studied a lot of math and
 

5093
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:28,690
yeah I studied a lot of math and
computer science but it was a huge

5094
01:45:28,690 --> 01:45:28,700
computer science but it was a huge
 

5095
01:45:28,700 --> 01:45:30,310
computer science but it was a huge
school first of all and I took a lot of

5096
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:30,320
school first of all and I took a lot of
 

5097
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,930
school first of all and I took a lot of
other courses as we've discussed I

5098
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:31,940
other courses as we've discussed I
 

5099
01:45:31,940 --> 01:45:33,670
other courses as we've discussed I
started as an English major and took

5100
01:45:33,670 --> 01:45:33,680
started as an English major and took
 

5101
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,560
started as an English major and took
history courses and art history classes

5102
01:45:35,560 --> 01:45:35,570
history courses and art history classes
 

5103
01:45:35,570 --> 01:45:37,960
history courses and art history classes
and had friends you know that did all

5104
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:37,970
and had friends you know that did all
 

5105
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:40,570
and had friends you know that did all
kinds of different things and you know

01:45:40,570 --> 01:45:40,580
kinds of different things and you know
 

5107
01:45:40,580 --> 01:45:42,460
kinds of different things and you know
Harvard's a much smaller institution

5108
01:45:42,460 --> 01:45:42,470
Harvard's a much smaller institution
 

5109
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:44,500
Harvard's a much smaller institution
than Berkeley and it's computer science

5110
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:44,510
than Berkeley and it's computer science
 

5111
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,910
than Berkeley and it's computer science
department especially at that time was

5112
01:45:45,910 --> 01:45:45,920
department especially at that time was
 

5113
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:47,800
department especially at that time was
was a much smaller place than it is now

5114
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:47,810
was a much smaller place than it is now
 

5115
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:50,830
was a much smaller place than it is now
and I suddenly just felt very you know

5116
01:45:50,830 --> 01:45:50,840
and I suddenly just felt very you know
 

5117
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:53,620
and I suddenly just felt very you know
like I'd gone from this very big world

5118
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:53,630
like I'd gone from this very big world
 

5119
01:45:53,630 --> 01:45:57,010
like I'd gone from this very big world
to this highly specialized world and now

5120
01:45:57,010 --> 01:45:57,020
to this highly specialized world and now
 

5121
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:58,690
to this highly specialized world and now
all of the classes I was taking were

5122
01:45:58,690 --> 01:45:58,700
all of the classes I was taking were
 

5123
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,610
all of the classes I was taking were
computer science classes and I was only

5124
01:46:00,610 --> 01:46:00,620
computer science classes and I was only
 

5125
01:46:00,620 --> 01:46:02,920
computer science classes and I was only
in classes with math and computer

5126
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:02,930
in classes with math and computer
 

5127
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:06,420
in classes with math and computer
science people and so I was you know I

5128
01:46:06,420 --> 01:46:06,430
science people and so I was you know I
 

5129
01:46:06,430 --> 01:46:09,100
science people and so I was you know I
thought often in that first year of grad

5130
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:09,110
thought often in that first year of grad
 

5131
01:46:09,110 --> 01:46:11,020
thought often in that first year of grad
school about whether I really wanted to

5132
01:46:11,020 --> 01:46:11,030
school about whether I really wanted to
 

5133
01:46:11,030 --> 01:46:12,940
school about whether I really wanted to
stick with it or not and you know I

5134
01:46:12,940 --> 01:46:12,950
stick with it or not and you know I
 

5135
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:15,040
stick with it or not and you know I
thought like oh I could you know stop

5136
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:15,050
thought like oh I could you know stop
 

5137
01:46:15,050 --> 01:46:17,109
thought like oh I could you know stop
with a masters I could go back

5138
01:46:17,109 --> 01:46:17,119
with a masters I could go back
 

5139
01:46:17,119 --> 01:46:19,330
with a masters I could go back
to the Bay Area into California and you

5140
01:46:19,330 --> 01:46:19,340
to the Bay Area into California and you
 

5141
01:46:19,340 --> 01:46:20,830
to the Bay Area into California and you
know this was from one of the early

5142
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:20,840
know this was from one of the early
 

5143
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,390
know this was from one of the early
periods where there was you know like

5144
01:46:22,390 --> 01:46:22,400
periods where there was you know like
 

5145
01:46:22,400 --> 01:46:24,669
periods where there was you know like
you could definitely get a relatively

5146
01:46:24,669 --> 01:46:24,679
you could definitely get a relatively
 

5147
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:27,370
you could definitely get a relatively
good job paying job at one of the one of

5148
01:46:27,370 --> 01:46:27,380
good job paying job at one of the one of
 

5149
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:28,660
good job paying job at one of the one of
the tech companies back you know that

5150
01:46:28,660 --> 01:46:28,670
the tech companies back you know that
 

5151
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:30,609
the tech companies back you know that
were the the big tech companies back

5152
01:46:30,609 --> 01:46:30,619
were the the big tech companies back
 

5153
01:46:30,619 --> 01:46:32,859
were the the big tech companies back
then and so I distinctly remember like

5154
01:46:32,859 --> 01:46:32,869
then and so I distinctly remember like
 

5155
01:46:32,869 --> 01:46:35,229
then and so I distinctly remember like
kind of a late spring day when I was

5156
01:46:35,229 --> 01:46:35,239
kind of a late spring day when I was
 

5157
01:46:35,239 --> 01:46:37,600
kind of a late spring day when I was
kind of you know sitting in Boston

5158
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:37,610
kind of you know sitting in Boston
 

5159
01:46:37,610 --> 01:46:38,919
kind of you know sitting in Boston
Common and kind of really just kind of

5160
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:38,929
Common and kind of really just kind of
 

5161
01:46:38,929 --> 01:46:40,750
Common and kind of really just kind of
chewing over what I wanted to do with my

5162
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:40,760
chewing over what I wanted to do with my
 

5163
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:43,390
chewing over what I wanted to do with my
life and I realized like okay you know

5164
01:46:43,390 --> 01:46:43,400
life and I realized like okay you know
 

5165
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:44,709
life and I realized like okay you know
and I think this is where my academic

5166
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
and I think this is where my academic
 

5167
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,270
and I think this is where my academic
background helped me a great deal I sort

5168
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:46,280
background helped me a great deal I sort
 

5169
01:46:46,280 --> 01:46:48,129
background helped me a great deal I sort
of realized you know yeah you're not

5170
01:46:48,129 --> 01:46:48,139
of realized you know yeah you're not
 

5171
01:46:48,139 --> 01:46:50,109
of realized you know yeah you're not
having a great time right now this feels

5172
01:46:50,109 --> 01:46:50,119
having a great time right now this feels
 

5173
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:52,270
having a great time right now this feels
really narrowing but you know that

5174
01:46:52,270 --> 01:46:52,280
really narrowing but you know that
 

5175
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:54,100
really narrowing but you know that
you're here for research eventually and

5176
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:54,110
you're here for research eventually and
 

5177
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:57,160
you're here for research eventually and
to do something original and to try to

5178
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:57,170
to do something original and to try to
 

5179
01:46:57,170 --> 01:46:59,979
to do something original and to try to
you know carve out a career where you

5180
01:46:59,979 --> 01:46:59,989
you know carve out a career where you
 

5181
01:46:59,989 --> 01:47:02,589
you know carve out a career where you
kind of you know choose what you want to

5182
01:47:02,589 --> 01:47:02,599
kind of you know choose what you want to
 

5183
01:47:02,599 --> 01:47:04,359
kind of you know choose what you want to
think about you know and have a great

5184
01:47:04,359 --> 01:47:04,369
think about you know and have a great
 

5185
01:47:04,369 --> 01:47:07,390
think about you know and have a great
deal of Independence and so you know at

5186
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:07,400
deal of Independence and so you know at
 

5187
01:47:07,400 --> 01:47:09,310
deal of Independence and so you know at
that point I really didn't have any real

5188
01:47:09,310 --> 01:47:09,320
that point I really didn't have any real
 

5189
01:47:09,320 --> 01:47:11,140
that point I really didn't have any real
research experience yet I mean it was

5190
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:11,150
research experience yet I mean it was
 

5191
01:47:11,150 --> 01:47:12,879
research experience yet I mean it was
trying to think about some problems with

5192
01:47:12,879 --> 01:47:12,889
trying to think about some problems with
 

5193
01:47:12,889 --> 01:47:15,669
trying to think about some problems with
very little success but but I knew that

5194
01:47:15,669 --> 01:47:15,679
very little success but but I knew that
 

5195
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:19,209
very little success but but I knew that
like I I hadn't really tried to do the

5196
01:47:19,209 --> 01:47:19,219
like I I hadn't really tried to do the
 

5197
01:47:19,219 --> 01:47:22,810
like I I hadn't really tried to do the
thing that I knew I'd come to do and so

5198
01:47:22,810 --> 01:47:22,820
thing that I knew I'd come to do and so
 

5199
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,370
thing that I knew I'd come to do and so
I thought you know I'm gonna I'm gonna

5200
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:24,380
I thought you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
 

5201
01:47:24,380 --> 01:47:26,050
I thought you know I'm gonna I'm gonna
stick I'm gonna you know stick through

5202
01:47:26,050 --> 01:47:26,060
stick I'm gonna you know stick through
 

5203
01:47:26,060 --> 01:47:28,689
stick I'm gonna you know stick through
it for the summer and you know and and

5204
01:47:28,689 --> 01:47:28,699
it for the summer and you know and and
 

5205
01:47:28,699 --> 01:47:30,729
it for the summer and you know and and
and that was very formative because I

5206
01:47:30,729 --> 01:47:30,739
and that was very formative because I
 

5207
01:47:30,739 --> 01:47:33,270
and that was very formative because I
went from kind of contemplating quitting

5208
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:33,280
went from kind of contemplating quitting
 

5209
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:37,450
went from kind of contemplating quitting
to you know a year later it being very

5210
01:47:37,450 --> 01:47:37,460
to you know a year later it being very
 

5211
01:47:37,460 --> 01:47:38,589
to you know a year later it being very
clear to me I was going to finish

5212
01:47:38,589 --> 01:47:38,599
clear to me I was going to finish
 

5213
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:40,780
clear to me I was going to finish
because I still had a ways to go but I

5214
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:40,790
because I still had a ways to go but I
 

5215
01:47:40,790 --> 01:47:43,689
because I still had a ways to go but I
kind of started doing research it was

5216
01:47:43,689 --> 01:47:43,699
kind of started doing research it was
 

5217
01:47:43,699 --> 01:47:45,700
kind of started doing research it was
going well it was really interesting and

5218
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:45,710
going well it was really interesting and
 

5219
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:47,280
going well it was really interesting and
it was sort of a complete transformation

5220
01:47:47,280 --> 01:47:47,290
it was sort of a complete transformation
 

5221
01:47:47,290 --> 01:47:49,390
it was sort of a complete transformation
you know it's just that transition that

5222
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:49,400
you know it's just that transition that
 

5223
01:47:49,400 --> 01:47:52,570
you know it's just that transition that
I think every doctoral student makes at

5224
01:47:52,570 --> 01:47:52,580
I think every doctoral student makes at
 

5225
01:47:52,580 --> 01:47:54,850
I think every doctoral student makes at
some point which is to sort of go from

5226
01:47:54,850 --> 01:47:54,860
some point which is to sort of go from
 

5227
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:58,689
some point which is to sort of go from
being like a student of what's been done

5228
01:47:58,689 --> 01:47:58,699
being like a student of what's been done
 

5229
01:47:58,699 --> 01:48:01,870
being like a student of what's been done
before to doing you know your own thing

5230
01:48:01,870 --> 01:48:01,880
before to doing you know your own thing
 

5231
01:48:01,880 --> 01:48:03,700
before to doing you know your own thing
and figure out what makes you interested

5232
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:03,710
and figure out what makes you interested
 

5233
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:04,810
and figure out what makes you interested
in what your strengths and weaknesses

5234
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:04,820
in what your strengths and weaknesses
 

5235
01:48:04,820 --> 01:48:07,780
in what your strengths and weaknesses
are as a researcher and once you know I

5236
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:07,790
are as a researcher and once you know I
 

5237
01:48:07,790 --> 01:48:09,520
are as a researcher and once you know I
kind of made that decision on that

5238
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:09,530
kind of made that decision on that
 

5239

kind of made that decision on that
particular day at that particular moment
