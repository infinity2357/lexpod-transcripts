long time for a reason and
 

1001
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,830
long time for a reason and
one of the reasons is that it

1002
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:31,840
one of the reasons is that it
 

1003
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,070
one of the reasons is that it
understands itself not to be static so i

1004
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:34,080
understands itself not to be static so i
 

1005
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:34,870
understands itself not to be static so i
have

1009
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,470

view that uh

1010
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:42,480
view that uh
 

1011
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,470
view that uh
harvard is is going to adapt

1012
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
harvard is is going to adapt
 

1013
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,830
harvard is is going to adapt
and get itself back on course and be

1014
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
and get itself back on course and be
 

1015
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,710
and get itself back on course and be
around another

1016

400 years at least that's my goal so i

1018
00:18:53,669 --> 00:18:53,679
400 years at least that's my goal so i
 

1019
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:54,390
400 years at least that's my goal so i
mean

1020
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
mean
 

1021
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,390
mean
what this kind of boils down to is just

1022
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
what this kind of boils down to is just
 

1023
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,390
what this kind of boils down to is just
having difficult conversation difficult

1024
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
having difficult conversation difficult
 

1025
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,350
having difficult conversation difficult
debates

1026
00:18:59,350 --> 00:18:59,360
debates
 

1027
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,909
debates
uh when you mention sort of 19 year olds

1028
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:01,919
uh when you mention sort of 19 year olds
 

1029
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,430
uh when you mention sort of 19 year olds
and it's funny i've seen this even at

1030
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
and it's funny i've seen this even at
 

1031
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,549
and it's funny i've seen this even at
mit

1032
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:04,559
mit
 

1033
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,710
mit
it's not that uh they shouldn't have a

1034
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:06,720
it's not that uh they shouldn't have a
 

1035
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,990
it's not that uh they shouldn't have a
voice

1036
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:08,000
voice
 

1037
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,029
voice
they should they they do seem to i guess

1038
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
they should they they do seem to i guess
 

1039
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,549
they should they they do seem to i guess
you have to experience it and just

1040
00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:12,559
you have to experience it and just
 

1041
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,669
you have to experience it and just
observe it

1042
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:13,679
observe it
 

1043
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,390
observe it
they have a strangely disproportionate

1044
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:16,400
they have a strangely disproportionate
 

1045
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:16,950
they have a strangely disproportionate
power

1046
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:16,960
power
 

1047
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,590
power
right right it's very interesting to uh

1048
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:19,600
right right it's very interesting to uh
 

1049
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,549
right right it's very interesting to uh
to basically

1050
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
to basically
 

1051
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,630
to basically
i mean you say yes there's great faculty

1052
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
i mean you say yes there's great faculty
 

1053
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,990
i mean you say yes there's great faculty
and so on

1054
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,000
and so on
 

1055
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,470
and so on
but you know it's not even just that the

1056
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
but you know it's not even just that the
 

1057
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,150
but you know it's not even just that the
faculty is smart or

1058
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:28,160
faculty is smart or
 

1059
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,510
faculty is smart or
wise or whatever it's that they're just

1060
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:31,520
wise or whatever it's that they're just
 

1061
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,150
wise or whatever it's that they're just
silenced so the terminology that you

1062
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:34,160
silenced so the terminology that you
 

1063
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,630
silenced so the terminology that you
mentioned

1064
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:34,640
mentioned
 

1065
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,070
mentioned
is weaponized as sort of safe spaces

1066
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
is weaponized as sort of safe spaces
 

1067
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,230
is weaponized as sort of safe spaces
or that certain conversations make

1068
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:40,240
or that certain conversations make
 

1069
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,110
or that certain conversations make
people feel unsafe

1070
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
people feel unsafe
 

1071
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,190
people feel unsafe
what do you think about this kind of

1072
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
what do you think about this kind of
 

1073
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,870
what do you think about this kind of
idea

1074
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:46,880
idea
 

1075
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,470
idea
you know is is there some things that

1076
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:50,480
you know is is there some things that
 

1077
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,029
you know is is there some things that
are

1078
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:51,039
are
 

1079
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,630
are
unsafe to talk about in the university

1080
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:54,640
unsafe to talk about in the university
 

1081
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,270
unsafe to talk about in the university
setting

1082
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:55,280
setting
 

1083
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,470
setting
is there lines to be drawn somewhere and

1084
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:58,480
is there lines to be drawn somewhere and
 

1085
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,190
is there lines to be drawn somewhere and
uh just like you said on the flip side

1086
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:01,200
uh just like you said on the flip side
 

1087
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,789
uh just like you said on the flip side
with a slippery slope

1088
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:02,799
with a slippery slope
 

1089
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:05,029
with a slippery slope
is it too easy for the lines to be drawn

1090
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:05,039
is it too easy for the lines to be drawn
 

1091
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,390
is it too easy for the lines to be drawn
everywhere

1092
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:06,400
everywhere
 

1093
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,789
everywhere
yeah that's a great question so this

1094
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:08,799
yeah that's a great question so this
 

1095
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:09,990
yeah that's a great question so this
idea of unsafe

1096
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,000
idea of unsafe
 

1097
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,870
idea of unsafe
space at least the vocabulary derives

1098
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:12,880
space at least the vocabulary derives
 

1099
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,750
space at least the vocabulary derives
from

1100
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
from
 

1101
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,870
from
some research uh academic research

1102
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:16,880
some research uh academic research
 

1103
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,149
some research uh academic research
about feeling psychologically uh

1104
00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:20,159
about feeling psychologically uh
 

1105
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,510
about feeling psychologically uh
unsafe and so the notion here is that

1106
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:23,520
unsafe and so the notion here is that
 

1107
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,390
unsafe and so the notion here is that
there is

1108
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:24,400
there is
 

1109
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,310
there is
uh there are forms of uh

1110
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
uh there are forms of uh
 

1111
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,149
uh there are forms of uh
psychological disquiet that impedes

1112
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:32,159
psychological disquiet that impedes
 

1113
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,029
psychological disquiet that impedes
people from uh experiencing the

1114
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
people from uh experiencing the

uh so look i think that the presumption

1238
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:51,919
uh so look i think that the presumption
 

1239
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,350
uh so look i think that the presumption
ought to be that uh the most

1240

uh the flat earth theory you know the

1256
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,720
uh the flat earth theory you know the
 

1257
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,070
uh the flat earth theory you know the
earth is flat

get into these crowds and we get
we start chanting and it's fun for some

1492
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:46,559
we start chanting and it's fun for some
 

1493
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,070
we start chanting and it's fun for some
reason and then you forget yourself

1494
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
reason and then you forget yourself
 

1495
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,470
reason and then you forget yourself
and then you sort of wake up the next

1496
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:50,480
and then you sort of wake up the next
 

1497
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,029
and then you sort of wake up the next
day not

1498
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:53,039
day not
 

1499
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,630
day not
not having uh anticipated the

1500
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:54,640
not having uh anticipated the
 

1501
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,549
not having uh anticipated the
consequences of all the chanting

1502
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:56,559
consequences of all the chanting
 

1503
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,389
consequences of all the chanting
yeah and we get ourselves in trouble in

1504
00:27:58,389 --> 00:27:58,399
yeah and we get ourselves in trouble in
 

1505
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:00,310
yeah and we get ourselves in trouble in
that i mean there's some responsibility

1506
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:00,320
that i mean there's some responsibility
 

1507
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,669
that i mean there's some responsibility
on the

1508
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:01,679
on the
 

1509
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,870
on the
on social networks and the mechanisms by

1510
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:04,880
on social networks and the mechanisms by
 

1511
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,830
on social networks and the mechanisms by
which

1512
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:05,840
which
 

1513
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,750
which
they make it more frictionless to do the

1514
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:07,760
they make it more frictionless to do the
 

1515
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,750
they make it more frictionless to do the
chanting to do the canceling to do the

1516
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:09,760
chanting to do the canceling to do the
 

1517
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,590
chanting to do the canceling to do the
outrage and all that kind of stuff so

1518
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
outrage and all that kind of stuff so
 

1519
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,269
outrage and all that kind of stuff so
i actually on the technology side have a

1520
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:13,279
i actually on the technology side have a
 

1521
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,750
i actually on the technology side have a
hope that that's fixable but

1522
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
hope that that's fixable but
 

1523
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:19,190
hope that that's fixable but
yeah it does seem to be

1524
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
yeah it does seem to be
 

1525
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,669
yeah it does seem to be
you know it almost like the internet

1526
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
you know it almost like the internet
 

1527
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,190
you know it almost like the internet
showed to us

1528
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,200
showed to us
 

1529
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,149
showed to us
that we have a lot of broken ways about

1530
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
that we have a lot of broken ways about
 

1531
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:26,870
that we have a lot of broken ways about
which we

1532
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:26,880
which we
 

1533
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,230
which we
communicate with each other and we're

1534
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,240
communicate with each other and we're
 

1535
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,669
communicate with each other and we're
trying to figure that out same with the

1536
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
trying to figure that out same with the
 

1537
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,110
trying to figure that out same with the
university

1538
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,120
university
 

1539
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,830
university
the this mistake by harvard showed that

1540
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:33,840
the this mistake by harvard showed that
 

1541
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,710
the this mistake by harvard showed that
we need to

1542
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
we need to
 

1543
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,590
we need to
reinvent what the university is and i

1544
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:37,600
reinvent what the university is and i
 

1545
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,950
reinvent what the university is and i
mean all of this is

1546
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
mean all of this is
 

1547
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,350
mean all of this is
it's almost like we're finding our baby

1548
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
it's almost like we're finding our baby
 

1549

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,750
and trying to strengthen the
institutions that

1554
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:45,760
institutions that
 

1555
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,149
institutions that
have been very successful for for a long

1556
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:48,159
have been very successful for for a long
 

1557
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,110
have been very successful for for a long
time you know

1558
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:49,120
time you know
 

1559
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,950
time you know
the really interesting thing about

1560
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:50,960
the really interesting thing about
 

1561
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,029
the really interesting thing about
harvey weinstein and

1562
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
harvey weinstein and
 

1563
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,870
harvey weinstein and
you choosing these exceptionally

1564
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:54,880
you choosing these exceptionally
 

1565
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,510
you choosing these exceptionally
difficult cases

1566
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:57,520
difficult cases
 

1567
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,830
difficult cases
is also thinking about

1568
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:01,840

 

1569
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,510

what it means to defend evil people

1570
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:05,520
what it means to defend evil people
 

1571
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,470
what it means to defend evil people
what it means to defend these we could

1572
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
what it means to defend these we could
 

1573
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:08,789
what it means to defend these we could
say

1574
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
say
 

1575
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,190
say
unpopular and you might push back

1576
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:11,200
unpopular and you might push back
 

1577
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,310
unpopular and you might push back
against the word

1578
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:12,320
against the word
 

1579
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,750
against the word
evil but bad people in society

1580
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:15,760
evil but bad people in society
 

1581
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,510
evil but bad people in society
um first of all do you think there's

1582
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:17,520
um first of all do you think there's
 

1583
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,789
um first of all do you think there's
such a thing as evil

1584
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:18,799
such a thing as evil
 

1585
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,789
such a thing as evil
or do you think all people are good and

1586
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
or do you think all people are good and
 

1587
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,909
or do you think all people are good and
it's just circumstances that create evil

1588
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
it's just circumstances that create evil
 

1589
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,950
it's just circumstances that create evil
and also is there somebody too evil for

1590
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
and also is there somebody too evil for
 

1591
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,710
and also is there somebody too evil for
the law to defend

1592
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:28,720
the law to defend
 

1593
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,389
the law to defend
and so that's a so the first question

1594
00:29:30,389 --> 00:29:30,399
and so that's a so the first question
 

1595
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,870
and so that's a so the first question
that's a deep uh philosophical question

1596
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:32,880
that's a deep uh philosophical question
 

1597
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,750
that's a deep uh philosophical question
whether the

1598
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
whether the
 

1599
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,190
whether the
category of evil uh does any work

1600
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
category of evil uh does any work
 

1601
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,310
category of evil uh does any work
uh for me it does for me i

1602
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:40,320
uh for me it does for me i
 

1603
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,510
uh for me it does for me i
i do think that i do subscribe

1604
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
i do think that i do subscribe
 

1605
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,110
i do think that i do subscribe
to that category that there is uh evil

1606
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,120
to that category that there is uh evil
 

1607
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,669
to that category that there is uh evil
uh in the world as conventionally uh

1608
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
uh in the world as conventionally uh
 

1609
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,870
uh in the world as conventionally uh
understood so

1610
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
understood so
 

1611
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,110
understood so
uh so there are many who will say yeah

1612
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:53,120
uh so there are many who will say yeah
 

1613
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,630
uh so there are many who will say yeah
that just doesn't

1614
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:54,640
that just doesn't
 

1615
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,750
that just doesn't
doesn't do any work for me uh but

1616
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
doesn't do any work for me uh but
 

1617
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,470
doesn't do any work for me uh but
the category evil in fact does

1618
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:00,480
the category evil in fact does
 

1619
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,669
the category evil in fact does
intellectual work

1620
00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:01,679
intellectual work
 

1621
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,470
intellectual work
for me and i i understand it as as

1622
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
for me and i i understand it as as
 

1623
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,269
for me and i i understand it as as
something that

1624
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:05,279
something that
 

1625
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,510
something that
uh that exists uh is it genetic or is it

1626
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
uh that exists uh is it genetic or is it
 

1627
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,269
uh that exists uh is it genetic or is it
the circumstance like

1628
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
the circumstance like
 

1629
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,710
the circumstance like
what kind of work does it do for you

1630
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:12,720
what kind of work does it do for you
 

1631
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,310
what kind of work does it do for you
intellectually i think that

1632
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,320
intellectually i think that
 

1633
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,110
intellectually i think that
it's uh it's highly contingent that is

1634
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:17,120
it's uh it's highly contingent that is
 

1635
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,990
it's uh it's highly contingent that is
to say that

1636
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,000
to say that
 

1637
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,590
to say that
the conditions in which one

1638
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:21,600
the conditions in which one
 

1639
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,870
the conditions in which one
grows up and so forth uh

1640
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:24,880
grows up and so forth uh
 

1641
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,230
grows up and so forth uh
uh uh begins to

1642
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:28,240
uh uh begins to
 

1643
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,110
uh uh begins to
create this category that we may think

1644
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,120
create this category that we may think
 

1645
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,389
create this category that we may think
of as evil

1646
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:32,399
of as evil
 

1647
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,909
of as evil
now there are um studies and and whatnot

1648
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
now there are um studies and and whatnot
 

1649
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:36,710
now there are um studies and and whatnot
that show

1650
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:36,720
that show
 

1651
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,149
that show
that uh certain um uh brain

1652
00:30:40,149 --> 00:30:40,159
that uh certain um uh brain
 

1653
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,870
that uh certain um uh brain
abnormalities and so forth are are more

1654
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
abnormalities and so forth are are more
 

1655
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,470
abnormalities and so forth are are more
prevalent in say

1656
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:44,480
prevalent in say
 

1657
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,789
prevalent in say
serial killer so there may be a

1658
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:46,799
serial killer so there may be a
 

1659
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:49,350
serial killer so there may be a
biological predisposition

1660
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,360
biological predisposition
 

1661
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,470
biological predisposition
to certain forms of conduct but

1662
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:52,480
to certain forms of conduct but
 

1663
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,149
to certain forms of conduct but
uh i don't i don't have the

1664
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:56,159
uh i don't i don't have the
 

1665
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,110
uh i don't i don't have the
uh biological evidence to make a

1666
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,120
uh biological evidence to make a
 

1667
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,950
uh biological evidence to make a
statement that someone is born

1668
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:00,960
statement that someone is born
 

1669
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,470
statement that someone is born
evil in and you know i i'm not a

1670
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
evil in and you know i i'm not a
 

1671
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,430
evil in and you know i i'm not a
determinist

1672
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:05,440
determinist
 

1673
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,750
determinist
thinker in that way so you come out the

1674
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:07,760
thinker in that way so you come out the
 

1675
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,909
thinker in that way so you come out the
womb evil and you're destined to be that

1676
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:09,919
womb evil and you're destined to be that
 

1677
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:10,630
womb evil and you're destined to be that
way

1678
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:10,640
way
 

1679
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,149
way
um to the extent there may be biological

1680
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
um to the extent there may be biological
 

1681
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,509
um to the extent there may be biological
uh determinants uh there still require

1682
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
uh determinants uh there still require
 

1683
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,110
uh determinants uh there still require
some um uh nurture uh as well

1684
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
some um uh nurture uh as well
 

1685
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,110
some um uh nurture uh as well
uh so but do you still put a

1686
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
uh so but do you still put a
 

1687
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,870
uh so but do you still put a
responsibility

1688
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:24,880
responsibility
 

1689
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,430
responsibility
for the on the individual of course yeah

1690
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:27,440
for the on the individual of course yeah
 

1691
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,190
for the on the individual of course yeah
we all make choices

1692
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:29,200
we all make choices
 

1693
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,909
we all make choices
and so some responsibility on the

1694
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:31,919
and so some responsibility on the
 

1695
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:32,549
and so some responsibility on the
individual

1696
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:32,559
individual
 

1697
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,630
individual
indeed

1698
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:36,640

 

1699
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,549

we live in a culture unfortunately where

1700
00:31:40,549 --> 00:31:40,559
we live in a culture unfortunately where
 

1701
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,870
we live in a culture unfortunately where
a lot of people

1702
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:42,880
a lot of people
 

1703
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,070
a lot of people
have a constellation of bad choices in

1704
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
have a constellation of bad choices in
 

1705
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,389
have a constellation of bad choices in
front of them and that makes me very sad

1706
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:48,399
front of them and that makes me very sad
 

1707
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,190
front of them and that makes me very sad
yeah um that the people grow up with

1708
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
yeah um that the people grow up with
 

1709
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,389
yeah um that the people grow up with
with

1710
00:31:52,389 --> 00:31:52,399
with
 

1711
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,110
with
predominantly bad choices in in front of

1712
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,120
predominantly bad choices in in front of
 

1713
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,389
predominantly bad choices in in front of
them and that's unfair

1714
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
them and that's unfair
 

1715
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,710
them and that's unfair
and that's that that's on all of us but

1716
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:58,720
and that's that that's on all of us but
 

1717
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,029
and that's that that's on all of us but
yes i do think we make we make choices

1718
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
yes i do think we make we make choices
 

1719
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,590
yes i do think we make we make choices
wow that's so powerful the constellation

1720
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
wow that's so powerful the constellation
 

1721
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,789
wow that's so powerful the constellation
of bad choices

1722
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:04,799
of bad choices
 

1723
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,830
of bad choices
hey

1724
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:07,840

 

1725
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,789

that's such a powerful way to think

1726
00:32:10,789 --> 00:32:10,799
that's such a powerful way to think
 

1727
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:11,350
that's such a powerful way to think
about

1728
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:11,360
about
 

1729
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,269
about
sort of equality which is

1730
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
sort of equality which is
 

1731
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,630
sort of equality which is
this the set of trajectories before you

1732
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:18,640
this the set of trajectories before you
 

1733
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,549
this the set of trajectories before you
that you could take if you just roll the

1734
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
that you could take if you just roll the
 

1735
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,669
that you could take if you just roll the
dice because uh

1736
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:23,679
dice because uh
 

1737
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,190
dice because uh
you know life is is a kind of

1738
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,200
you know life is is a kind of
 

1739
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,789
you know life is is a kind of
optimization problem

1740
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:26,799
optimization problem
 

1741
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,789
optimization problem
sorry to take us into math over a set of

1742
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
sorry to take us into math over a set of
 

1743
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,070
sorry to take us into math over a set of
trajectories

1744
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:30,080
trajectories
 

1745
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,190
trajectories
under imperfect information uh

1746
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,200
under imperfect information uh
 

1747
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,990
under imperfect information uh
so you're gonna do a lot of stupid [\h__\h]

1748
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
so you're gonna do a lot of stupid [\h__\h]
 

1749
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,630
so you're gonna do a lot of stupid [\h__\h]
to put it

1750
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
to put it
 

1751
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,830
to put it
uh in technical terms uh

1752
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:40,840
uh in technical terms uh
 

1753
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,590
uh in technical terms uh
but uh the

1754
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:43,600
but uh the
 

1755
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,430
but uh the
the the fraction of the trajectories

1756
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:45,440
the the fraction of the trajectories
 

1757
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,669
the the fraction of the trajectories
that take you into into bad places

1758
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
that take you into into bad places
 

1759
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,669
that take you into into bad places
or into good places is really important

1760
00:32:49,669 --> 00:32:49,679
or into good places is really important
 

1761
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:51,190
or into good places is really important
and that's ultimately what we're talking

1762
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:51,200
and that's ultimately what we're talking
 

1763
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,669
and that's ultimately what we're talking
about

1764
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:51,679
about
 

1765
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,149
about
and evil might be just a little bit of a

1766
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:54,159
and evil might be just a little bit of a
 

1767
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,389
and evil might be just a little bit of a
predisposition biologically but the rest

1768
00:32:56,389 --> 00:32:56,399
predisposition biologically but the rest
 

1769
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,070
predisposition biologically but the rest
is just trajectories that you can take

1770
00:32:58,070 --> 00:32:58,080
is just trajectories that you can take
 

1771
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,190
is just trajectories that you can take
i've been studying hitler a lot recently

1772
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:01,200
i've been studying hitler a lot recently
 

1773
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,430
i've been studying hitler a lot recently
i've been reading probably way too much

1774
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
i've been reading probably way too much
 

1775
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,190
i've been reading probably way too much
and it's it's interesting to think about

1776
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,200
and it's it's interesting to think about
 

1777
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,029
and it's it's interesting to think about
all the possible trajectories

1778
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:07,039
all the possible trajectories
 

1779
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,950
all the possible trajectories
right that could have avoided

1780
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
right that could have avoided
 

1781
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,029
right that could have avoided
the this particular individual

1782
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
the this particular individual
 

1783
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,710
the this particular individual
developing the hate that he did the

1784
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:14,720
developing the hate that he did the
 

1785
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,470
developing the hate that he did the
following that he did

1786
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
following that he did
 

1787
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,870
following that he did
the the actual final uh

1788
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:20,880
the the actual final uh
 

1789
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,389
the the actual final uh
there's a few turns in him

1790
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
there's a few turns in him
 

1791
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,990
there's a few turns in him
psychologically where he went

1792
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:24,000
psychologically where he went
 

1793
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,350
psychologically where he went
from being a leader that just wants to

1794
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
from being a leader that just wants to
 

1795
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,029
from being a leader that just wants to
conquer and to

1796
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:31,039
conquer and to
 

1797
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,149
conquer and to
somebody who allowed his anger and

1798
00:33:34,149 --> 00:33:34,159
somebody who allowed his anger and
 

1799
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,750
somebody who allowed his anger and
emotion to take over

1800
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
emotion to take over
 

1801
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,789
emotion to take over
where he started making mistakes for uh

1802
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:38,799
where he started making mistakes for uh
 

1803
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:41,669
where he started making mistakes for uh
in terms of militarily speaking but also

1804
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
in terms of militarily speaking but also
 

1805
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,710
in terms of militarily speaking but also
started

1806
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
started
 

1807
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,990
started
doing you know evil things

1808
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:46,000
doing you know evil things
 

1809
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,149
doing you know evil things
and all the possible trajectories that

1810
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
and all the possible trajectories that
 

1811
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,909
and all the possible trajectories that
could have avoided that are fascinating

1812
00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:49,919
could have avoided that are fascinating
 

1813
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,029
could have avoided that are fascinating
including

1814
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
including
 

1815
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,389
including
he wasn't that bad at painting a drawing

1816
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
he wasn't that bad at painting a drawing
 

1817
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,470
he wasn't that bad at painting a drawing
right that's that's true from the very

uh and i i likely based on the hypo you
gave me and i would tweak it a bit

gave me and i would tweak it a bit

and economic station but we have a

that's a
 

2055
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,510
that's a
good feature of the criminal justice

system
so here's how it works the idea of the

so here's how it works the idea of the

set a process that makes it difficult

set a process that makes it difficult
 

2111
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,670
set a process that makes it difficult
to convict people we have rules of

2115
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,349
procedure
that are cumbersome and that slow down

that are cumbersome and that slow down

and that um exclude otherwise reliable
evidence and this is all

evidence and this is all
 

2123
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,109
evidence and this is all
because we place a value on

00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:26,240
years will look like i'm not saying it's
 

2417
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:26,790
years will look like i'm not saying it's
going to be

2418
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:26,800
going to be
 

2419
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,829
going to be
short but i'm saying that if we keep

2420
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:29,839
short but i'm saying that if we keep
 

2421
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,190
short but i'm saying that if we keep
at it keep getting to know each other

2422
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:33,200
at it keep getting to know each other
 

2423
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,710
at it keep getting to know each other
a little better keep enforcing laws

2424
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
a little better keep enforcing laws
 

2425
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,230
a little better keep enforcing laws
uh that prohibit uh

2426
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:40,240
uh that prohibit uh
 

2427
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,589
uh that prohibit uh
the the sort of race-based

2428
00:45:41,589 --> 00:45:41,599
the the sort of race-based
 

2429
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:43,270
the the sort of race-based
discrimination that people have

2430
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:43,280
discrimination that people have
 

2431
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,829
discrimination that people have
experienced and

2432
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:44,839
experienced and
 

2433
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:48,470
experienced and
provide as a society opportunities

2434
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
provide as a society opportunities
 

2435
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:52,069
provide as a society opportunities
for people to thrive in this world then

2436
00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:52,079
for people to thrive in this world then
 

2437
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:52,950

2443
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,430
a better world we'll see a better
judicial system so i think it's kind of

2444
00:45:59,430 --> 00:45:59,440
judicial system so i think it's kind of
 

2445
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,990
judicial system so i think it's kind of
fascinating

2446
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,000
fascinating
 

2447
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,349
fascinating
if you look throughout history and race

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,589
that we're not
we're not uh there yet in terms of uh

2634
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:39,599
we're not uh there yet in terms of uh
 

2635
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:40,870
we're not uh there yet in terms of uh
this notion of uh

2636
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:40,880
this notion of uh
 

2637
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,069
this notion of uh
the machines having uh a consciousness

2638
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:44,079
the machines having uh a consciousness
 

2639
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:48,710
the machines having uh a consciousness
um uh or a great general intelligence

2640
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:48,720
um uh or a great general intelligence
 

2641
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,750
um uh or a great general intelligence
all those kinds of things

2642
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
all those kinds of things
 

2643
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,589
all those kinds of things
yeah yeah a huge amount of progress has

2644
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:51,599
yeah yeah a huge amount of progress has
 

2645
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,349
yeah yeah a huge amount of progress has
been made and

2646
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
been made and
 

2647
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,670
been made and
there is it's fascinating to watch so

2648
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
there is it's fascinating to watch so
 

2649
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,750
there is it's fascinating to watch so
i'm on both minds as a person who's

2650
00:49:57,750 --> 00:49:57,760
i'm on both minds as a person who's
 

2651
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,190
i'm on both minds as a person who's
building them

2652
00:49:59,190 --> 00:49:59,200
building them
 

2653
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,750
building them
i'm realizing how sort of quote-unquote

2654
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:01,760
i'm realizing how sort of quote-unquote
 

2655
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,750
i'm realizing how sort of quote-unquote
dumb they are

2656
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:03,760
dumb they are
 

2657
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,950
dumb they are
but also looking at human history and

how

00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,510
how
poor we are predicting the progress of

2662
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:09,520
poor we are predicting the progress of
 

2663
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,510
poor we are predicting the progress of

innovation and technology
 

2665
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,710
innovation and technology
it's obvious that we have to be humble

2666
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:14,720
it's obvious that we have to be humble
 

2667
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,190
it's obvious that we have to be humble
by our ability to predict coupled with

00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:17,200
by our ability to predict coupled with

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,309
by our ability to predict coupled with
the fact that we

00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:18,319
the fact that we
 

2671
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:22,150
the fact that we
keep uh to use terminology carefully

2672
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:22,160
keep uh to use terminology carefully
 

2673
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:22,549
keep uh to use terminology carefully
here

2674
00:50:22,549 --> 00:50:22,559
here
 

2675
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:24,309
here
we keep discriminating against the

2676
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
we keep discriminating against the
 

2677
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,230
we keep discriminating against the

2678
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:26,240
intelligence of
 

2679
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:29,109
intelligence of
artificial systems the smarter they get

00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:29,119
artificial systems the smarter they get
 

2681
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,510
artificial systems the smarter they get
the more ways we find to dismiss

2682
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:31,520
the more ways we find to dismiss
 

2683
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,549
the more ways we find to dismiss
the their intelligence so this this has

2684
00:50:34,549 --> 00:50:34,559
the their intelligence so this this has
 

2685
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,309
the their intelligence so this this has
just been going on throughout

2686
00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:36,319
just been going on throughout
 

2687
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:40,150
just been going on throughout
where i it's almost as if we're

2688
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:40,160
where i it's almost as if we're
 

2689
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,109
where i it's almost as if we're
threatened

2690
00:50:41,109 --> 00:50:41,119
threatened
 

2691
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,470
threatened
in the most primitive human way

2692
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:44,480
in the most primitive human way
 

2693
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,270
in the most primitive human way
animalistic way we're threatened by the

2694
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:47,280
animalistic way we're threatened by the
 

2695
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,309
animalistic way we're threatened by the
power of

2696
00:50:48,309 --> 00:50:48,319
power of
 

2697
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:51,030
power of
other creatures and we want to lessen

2698
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:51,040
other creatures and we want to lessen
 

2699
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,230
other creatures and we want to lessen
dismiss them

2700
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:52,240
dismiss them
 

2701
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,390
dismiss them
so consciousness is a really important

2702
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:54,400
so consciousness is a really important
 

2703
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,349
so consciousness is a really important
one but the one i think about a lot

2704
00:50:57,349 --> 00:50:57,359
one but the one i think about a lot
 

2705
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,349
one but the one i think about a lot
in terms of consciousness the very

2706
00:50:59,349 --> 00:50:59,359
in terms of consciousness the very
 

2707
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:00,950
in terms of consciousness the very
engineering question

2708
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:00,960
engineering question
 

2709
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,510
engineering question
is whether the display of consciousness

2710
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
is whether the display of consciousness
 

2711
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,470
is whether the display of consciousness
is the same

2712
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
is the same
 

2713
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,510
is the same
as the possession of consciousness so

2714
00:51:07,510 --> 00:51:07,520
as the possession of consciousness so
 

2715
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,349
as the possession of consciousness so
if a robot tells you they are conscious

2716
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
if a robot tells you they are conscious
 

2717
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,950
if a robot tells you they are conscious
if a robot looks like they're suffering

2718
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:14,960
if a robot looks like they're suffering
 

2719
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,589
if a robot looks like they're suffering
when you torture them if a robot is

2720
00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:17,599
when you torture them if a robot is
 

2721
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:18,710
when you torture them if a robot is
afraid of death

2722
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
afraid of death
 

2723
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,430
afraid of death

that is a social creation like we

00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,309
that is a social creation like we

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,630
believe our common humanity together
alone we wouldn't be aware of our

and when you add other creatures into it

2776
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:22,400
and when you add other creatures into it
 

2777
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,390
and when you add other creatures into it
it's not obvious to me that like you

it's not obvious to me that like you
 

2779
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,630
it's not obvious to me that like you
have to build

2780
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
have to build
 

2781
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,470
have to build
there will be a moment when you say this

2782
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
there will be a moment when you say this
 

2783
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,870
there will be a moment when you say this
thing is not conscious

2784
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:30,880
thing is not conscious
 

2785
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,790
thing is not conscious
i think there's going to be a lot of

2786
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:32,800
i think there's going to be a lot of
 

2787
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,309
i think there's going to be a lot of
fake it until you make it

2788
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
fake it until you make it
 

2789
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,390
fake it until you make it
and there'll be a very gray area between

2790
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
and there'll be a very gray area between

00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,150
and there'll be a very gray area between
fake and make

fake and make

00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,109
fake and make
that uh is going to force us to contend

2794
00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:41,119
that uh is going to force us to contend
 

2795
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,870
that uh is going to force us to contend
with what it means

2796
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:42,880
with what it means
 

2797
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,750
with what it means
to be an entity that deserves rights

2798
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:45,760
to be an entity that deserves rights
 

2799
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:46,309
to be an entity that deserves rights
where

2800
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
where
 

2801
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,190
where
all men are created equal the the men

2802
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
all men are created equal the the men
 

2803
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:49,750
all men are created equal the the men
part

2804
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
part
 

2805
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,510
part
might have to expand in ways that we

2806
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
might have to expand in ways that we
 

2807
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,349
might have to expand in ways that we
are not yet anticipating that's very

2808
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
are not yet anticipating that's very
 

2809
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:58,390
are not yet anticipating that's very
interesting i mean my favorite

2810
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:58,400
interesting i mean my favorite
 

2811
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,990
interesting i mean my favorite
the fundamental thing i love about

2812
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
the fundamental thing i love about
 

2813
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,430
the fundamental thing i love about
artificial intelligence is it gets

2814
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:01,440
artificial intelligence is it gets
 

2815
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,270
artificial intelligence is it gets
smarter and smarter it challenges to

2816
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:03,280
smarter and smarter it challenges to
 

2817
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,870
smarter and smarter it challenges to
think of

2818
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:04,880
think of
 

2819
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,589
think of
uh what is right the questions of

2820
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:07,599
uh what is right the questions of
 

2821
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:09,510
uh what is right the questions of
justice questions of freedom

2822
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:09,520
justice questions of freedom
 

2823
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:12,790
justice questions of freedom
it basically challenges us

2824
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:12,800
it basically challenges us
 

2825
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,309
it basically challenges us
to uh to understand our own mind

2826
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
to uh to understand our own mind
 

2827
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:21,030
to uh to understand our own mind
to understand uh what uh like

2828
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:21,040
to understand uh what uh like
 

2829
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,710
to understand uh what uh like
almost from an engineering first

2830
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
almost from an engineering first
 

2831
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,549
almost from an engineering first
principles perspective to understand

2832
00:53:24,549 --> 00:53:24,559
principles perspective to understand
 

2833
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,470
principles perspective to understand
what it is that makes us human

2834
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
what it is that makes us human
 

2835
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,309
what it is that makes us human
that is at the core of all the rights

2836
00:53:28,309 --> 00:53:28,319
that is at the core of all the rights
 

2837
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,829
that is at the core of all the rights
that we talk about and all the documents

2838
00:53:29,829 --> 00:53:29,839
that we talk about and all the documents
 

2839
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:31,109
that we talk about and all the documents
we write

2840
00:53:31,109 --> 00:53:31,119
we write
 

2841
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:32,390
we write
so even if we don't give rights

2842
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
so even if we don't give rights
 

2843
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,230
so even if we don't give rights
artificial intelligence systems we may

2844
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:34,240
artificial intelligence systems we may
 

2845
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,390
artificial intelligence systems we may
be able to construct

2846
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:36,400
be able to construct
 

2847
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,510
be able to construct
more fair legal systems to protect us

2848
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
more fair legal systems to protect us
 

2849
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,790
more fair legal systems to protect us
humans

2850
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
humans
 

2851
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,950
humans
well i mean interesting ontological

2852
00:53:42,950 --> 00:53:42,960
well i mean interesting ontological
 

2853
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,150
well i mean interesting ontological
question uh

2854
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:44,160
question uh
 

2855
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,950
question uh
between the the performance of

2856
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:46,960
between the the performance of
 

2857
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,470
between the the performance of
consciousness and

2858
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
consciousness and
 

2859
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,870
consciousness and
and and actual consciousness to the

2860
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
and and actual consciousness to the
 

2861
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,069
and and actual consciousness to the
extent

2862
00:53:52,069 --> 00:53:52,079
extent
 

2863
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,349
extent
that it's um that actual consciousness

2864
00:53:55,349 --> 00:53:55,359
that it's um that actual consciousness
 

2865
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,470
that it's um that actual consciousness
is anything beyond some contingent

2866
00:53:58,470 --> 00:53:58,480
is anything beyond some contingent
 

2867
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,910
is anything beyond some contingent
reality uh but you've posed a number of

2868
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
reality uh but you've posed a number of
 

2869
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,670
reality uh but you've posed a number of
of interesting philosophical questions

2870
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
of interesting philosophical questions
 

2871
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,349
of interesting philosophical questions
and then there's also

2872
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:05,359
and then there's also
 

2873
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,950
and then there's also
it strikes me that that

2874
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:08,960
it strikes me that that
 

2875
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,710
it strikes me that that
philosophers of religion would pose

2876
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:10,720
philosophers of religion would pose
 

2877
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:12,630
philosophers of religion would pose
another set of questions

2878
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:12,640
another set of questions
 

2879
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,829
another set of questions
uh as well when you um deal with uh

2880
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:15,839
uh as well when you um deal with uh
 

2881
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,670
uh as well when you um deal with uh
uh issues of uh of structure versus soul

2882
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:19,680
uh issues of uh of structure versus soul
 

2883
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:23,109
uh issues of uh of structure versus soul
body versus soul and and uh it

2884
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
body versus soul and and uh it
 

2885
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,309
body versus soul and and uh it
it would be a it will be a

2886
00:54:26,309 --> 00:54:26,319
it would be a it will be a
 

2887
00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,510
it would be a it will be a
complicated mix and i suspect i'll be uh

2888
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:29,520
complicated mix and i suspect i'll be uh
 

2889
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,309
complicated mix and i suspect i'll be uh
dust by the time those questions get get

2890
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
dust by the time those questions get get
 

2891
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,510
dust by the time those questions get get
worked out

2892
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:33,520
worked out
 

2893
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,990
worked out
and uh so yeah the soul the soul is a

2894
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:36,000
and uh so yeah the soul the soul is a
 

2895
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:36,789
and uh so yeah the soul the soul is a
fun one

2896
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
fun one
 

2897
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,950
fun one
there's no soul i'm i'm not sure maybe

2898
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
there's no soul i'm i'm not sure maybe
 

2899
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,390
there's no soul i'm i'm not sure maybe
you can correct me but

2900
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:40,400
you can correct me but
 

2901
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,630
you can correct me but
there's very few discussion of soul in

2902
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:42,640
there's very few discussion of soul in
 

2903
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,470
there's very few discussion of soul in
our legal system right

2904
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:44,480
our legal system right
 

2905
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,990
our legal system right
right correct so uh but there is a

2906
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
right correct so uh but there is a
 

2907
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,910
right correct so uh but there is a
discussion about what constitutes a

2908
00:54:49,910 --> 00:54:49,920
discussion about what constitutes a
 

2909
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:50,789
discussion about what constitutes a
human

2910
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:50,799
human
 

2911
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:53,270
human
being and i mean you gestured at the

2912
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
being and i mean you gestured at the
 

2913
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,549
being and i mean you gestured at the
notion of

2914
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
notion of
 

2915
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,910
notion of
uh the potential of the law uh widening

2916
00:54:57,910 --> 00:54:57,920
uh the potential of the law uh widening
 

2917
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,069
uh the potential of the law uh widening
the domain of uh so of of human being so

2918
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
the domain of uh so of of human being so
 

2919
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:05,190
the domain of uh so of of human being so
and in that sense right uh you know

2920
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
and in that sense right uh you know
 

2921
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,750
and in that sense right uh you know
people are very angry because they can't

2922
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:07,760
people are very angry because they can't
 

2923
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,630
people are very angry because they can't
uh

2924
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:08,640
uh
 

2925
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,270
uh
uh get uh sort of pain and suffering

2926
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
uh get uh sort of pain and suffering
 

2927
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,870
uh get uh sort of pain and suffering
damages if someone

2928
00:55:12,870 --> 00:55:12,880
damages if someone
 

2929
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,750
damages if someone
negligently kills a pet because a pet is

2930
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
negligently kills a pet because a pet is
 

2931
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,069
negligently kills a pet because a pet is
not

2932
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
not
 

2933
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,109
not
a human being and people say well i love

2934
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
a human being and people say well i love
 

2935
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:19,670
a human being and people say well i love
my

2936
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
my
 

2937
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,430
my
pet but the law sees uh a pet as

2938
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:23,440
pet but the law sees uh a pet as
 

2939
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,630
pet but the law sees uh a pet as
chattel as property like this this water

2940
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
chattel as property like this this water
 

2941
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,430
chattel as property like this this water
bottle

2942
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:27,440
bottle
 

2943
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,829
bottle
uh so the the current legal definitions

2944
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
uh so the the current legal definitions
 

2945
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:35,030
uh so the the current legal definitions
um trade on a definition of

2946
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,040
um trade on a definition of
 

2947
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,750
um trade on a definition of
humanity that may not be worked out in

2948
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:37,760
humanity that may not be worked out in
 

2949
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,670
humanity that may not be worked out in
any sophisticated way but

2950
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:39,680
any sophisticated way but
 

2951
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,270
any sophisticated way but
certainly um there's a there's a

2952
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:43,280
certainly um there's a there's a
 

2953
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,510
certainly um there's a there's a
share broad and shared understanding of

2954
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:45,520
share broad and shared understanding of
 

2955
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,510
share broad and shared understanding of
what what it what it means

2956
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
what what it what it means
 

2957
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,470
what what it what it means
so probably doesn't uh explicitly

2958
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,480
so probably doesn't uh explicitly
 

2959
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,470
so probably doesn't uh explicitly

the mindset the state of mind there

is not an intention but it's a
 

3693
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:37,430
is not an intention but it's a
depraved indifference uh and what that

3694
01:09:37,430 --> 01:09:37,440
depraved indifference uh and what that
 

3695
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:39,189
depraved indifference uh and what that
means is that the jury doesn't have to

3696
01:09:39,189 --> 01:09:39,199
means is that the jury doesn't have to
 

3697
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:41,990
means is that the jury doesn't have to
find that he intended to do anything

find that he intended to do anything
 

3699
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,870
find that he intended to do anything
uh rather they could find that he was

3700

uh rather they could find that he was
 

3701
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:46,070
uh rather they could find that he was
just

3702
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:46,080
just
 

3703
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,349
just
indifferent to a risk

3704
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:49,359
indifferent to a risk
 

3705
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,390

uh that's dark yeah

3706
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:52,400
uh that's dark yeah
 

3707
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,030
uh that's dark yeah
yeah i'm not sure what's worse uh yeah

3708
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,040
yeah i'm not sure what's worse uh yeah

well that's that's a good point
 

3711
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,870
well that's that's a good point
but uh but but it's another basis for

3712
01:09:58,870 --> 01:09:58,880
but uh but but it's another basis for
 

3713
01:09:58,880 --> 01:09:59,830
but uh but but it's another basis for
the jury

3714
01:09:59,830 --> 01:09:59,840
the jury
 

3715
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,229
the jury
uh to convict but but look uh you never

3716
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
uh to convict but but look uh you never
 

3717
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,910
uh to convict but but look uh you never
know what what happens when you go to a

3718
01:10:03,910 --> 01:10:03,920
know what what happens when you go to a
 

3719
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,350
know what what happens when you go to a
jury trial so there could be

3720
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:05,360
jury trial so there could be
 

3721
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,950
jury trial so there could be
a um an acquittal

a um an acquittal
 

3723
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,470
a um an acquittal
and if there is i imagine there would be

3724
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:12,480
and if there is i imagine there would be
 

3725
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:14,310
and if there is i imagine there would be
massive uh

3726
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:14,320
massive uh
 

3727
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,229
massive uh
uh protests uh if he's convicted i

3728

i i don't think that would happen uh
 

3731
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,189

uh potential tensions that could arise

3744
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
uh potential tensions that could arise
 

3745
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,430
uh potential tensions that could arise
from the sentencing

3746
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:37,440
from the sentencing

01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:54,320
uh so it depends what he's convicted of
 

3765
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,470
uh so it depends what he's convicted of
and yes it depends on how much

3766
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
and yes it depends on how much
 

3767
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,590
and yes it depends on how much
of the how much time the judge gives him

3768
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,600
of the how much time the judge gives him
 

3769
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:00,950
of the how much time the judge gives him
if he is convicted

3770
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
if he is convicted
 

3771
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,870
if he is convicted
uh that there's a lot of space for

3772
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
uh that there's a lot of space for
 

3773
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,470
uh that there's a lot of space for
people to be very angry

3774
01:11:04,470 --> 01:11:04,480
people to be very angry
 

3775
01:11:04,480 --> 01:11:07,430
people to be very angry
and so we will we will see what happens

3776
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
and so we will we will see what happens
 

3777

one
 

3891
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,590
one
it was the first dna case a major

3892

it was the first dna case a major
 

3893
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,070
it was the first dna case a major
dna case and there were significant

3894
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
dna case and there were significant
 

3895
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,430
dna case and there were significant
lessons learned from that

3896
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:11,440
lessons learned from that
 

3897
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,430
lessons learned from that
one mistake that the prosecution

3898
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:15,440
one mistake that the prosecution
 

3899
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:19,189
one mistake that the prosecution
made was uh that they didn't present the

3900
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:19,199
made was uh that they didn't present the
 

3901
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,470
made was uh that they didn't present the
science in a way

3902
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:20,480
science in a way
 

3903
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:23,750
science in a way
that a lay jury could understand it

3904
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:23,760
that a lay jury could understand it
 

3905
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,750
that a lay jury could understand it
um and uh what johnny cochran did was

3906
01:13:27,750 --> 01:13:27,760
um and uh what johnny cochran did was
 

3907
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,709
um and uh what johnny cochran did was
he understood the science and was able

3908
01:13:30,709 --> 01:13:30,719
he understood the science and was able
 

3909
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:31,430
he understood the science and was able
to

3910
01:13:31,430 --> 01:13:31,440
to
 

3911
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:34,709
to
uh uh translate that

3912
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:34,719
uh uh translate that
 

3913
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:38,390
uh uh translate that
into a into a vocabulary that he

3914
01:13:38,390 --> 01:13:38,400
into a into a vocabulary that he
 

3915
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,669
into a into a vocabulary that he
bet that that jury understood

3916
01:13:41,669 --> 01:13:41,679
bet that that jury understood
 

3917
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,350
bet that that jury understood
uh so so cochran was dismissive

3918
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
uh so so cochran was dismissive
 

3919
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,669
uh so so cochran was dismissive
of a lot of dna they say you know he

3920
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
of a lot of dna they say you know he
 

3921
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,030
of a lot of dna they say you know he
said something like oh you know they say

3922
01:13:49,030 --> 01:13:49,040
said something like oh you know they say
 

3923
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,910
said something like oh you know they say
they found

3924
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:49,920
they found
 

3925
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:53,189
they found
you know uh such and such amount of dna

3926
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
you know uh such and such amount of dna
 

3927
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,310
you know uh such and such amount of dna
that's just like me

3928
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:54,320
that's just like me
 

3929
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:55,990
that's just like me
you know wiping my finger against my

3930
01:13:55,990 --> 01:13:56,000
you know wiping my finger against my
 

3931
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,350
you know wiping my finger against my
nose and

3932
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:57,360
nose and
 

3933
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,950
nose and
and and just that little bit of dna and

3934
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
and and just that little bit of dna and
 

3935
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,270
and and just that little bit of dna and
uh that was effective because the

3936
01:14:03,270 --> 01:14:03,280
uh that was effective because the
 

3937
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:05,270
uh that was effective because the
prosecution hadn't done a good job of

3938
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
prosecution hadn't done a good job of
 

3939
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,110
prosecution hadn't done a good job of
establishing that

3940
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:07,120
establishing that
 

3941
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,910
establishing that
yes it's microscopic you don't need that

3942
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:09,920
yes it's microscopic you don't need that
 

3943
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:10,310
yes it's microscopic you don't need that
much

3944
01:14:10,310 --> 01:14:10,320
much
 

3945
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:11,990
much
yes wiping your hand on your nose and

3946
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:12,000
yes wiping your hand on your nose and
 

3947
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,910
yes wiping your hand on your nose and
touching something you can transfer a

3948
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:13,920
touching something you can transfer a
 

3949
01:14:13,920 --> 01:14:15,669
touching something you can transfer a
lot of dna and that gives you good

3950
01:14:15,669 --> 01:14:15,679
lot of dna and that gives you good
 

3951
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:16,390
lot of dna and that gives you good
information

3952
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:16,400
information
 

3953
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,709
information
yeah but you know it was the first time

3954
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:18,719
yeah but you know it was the first time
 

3955
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:20,550
yeah but you know it was the first time
that the public generally

3956
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:20,560
that the public generally
 

3957
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,550
that the public generally
and that jury maybe since high school

3958
01:14:22,550 --> 01:14:22,560
and that jury maybe since high school
 

3959
01:14:22,560 --> 01:14:24,390
and that jury maybe since high school
science had heard you know

3960
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
science had heard you know
 

3961
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:26,470
science had heard you know
you know nucleotide i mean it was just

3962
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:26,480
you know nucleotide i mean it was just
 

3963
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:28,310
you know nucleotide i mean it was just
all these terms getting thrown

3964
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:28,320
all these terms getting thrown
 

3965
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,510
all these terms getting thrown
at them and and but it was not weaved

3966
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
at them and and but it was not weaved
 

3967
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,470
at them and and but it was not weaved
into a

3968
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,480
into a
 

3969
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,590
into a
narrative so cochrane taught us

3970
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:35,600
narrative so cochrane taught us
 

3971
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,790
narrative so cochrane taught us
that no matter what type of case it is

3972
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
that no matter what type of case it is
 

3973
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,550
that no matter what type of case it is
no matter what science is involved it's

3974
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
no matter what science is involved it's
 

3975
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:41,270
no matter what science is involved it's
still about

3976
01:14:41,270 --> 01:14:41,280
still about
 

3977
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,350
still about
storytelling it's still about a

3978
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
storytelling it's still about a
 

3979
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,669
storytelling it's still about a
narrative and he was uh

3980
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
narrative and he was uh
 

3981
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,270
narrative and he was uh
and he was great uh at that at that

3982
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:49,280
and he was great uh at that at that
 

3983
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:53,030
and he was great uh at that at that
uh at that narrative and was consistent

3984
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:53,040
uh at that narrative and was consistent
 

3985
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,070
uh at that narrative and was consistent
uh with his narrative all the way out um

3986
01:14:56,070 --> 01:14:56,080
uh with his narrative all the way out um
 

3987
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,350
uh with his narrative all the way out um
another uh lesson that

3988
01:14:59,350 --> 01:14:59,360
another uh lesson that
 

3989
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:01,750
another uh lesson that
was relearned uh it's that you know you

3990
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:01,760
was relearned uh it's that you know you
 

3991
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,510
was relearned uh it's that you know you
never ask a question to what you don't

3992
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:03,520
never ask a question to what you don't
 

3993
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:07,189
never ask a question to what you don't
know the answer that's like uh

3994
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
know the answer that's like uh
 

3995
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,149
know the answer that's like uh
trial advocacy 101 yeah and so when they

3996
01:15:10,149 --> 01:15:10,159
trial advocacy 101 yeah and so when they
 

3997
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:10,709
trial advocacy 101 yeah and so when they
gave

3998
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
gave
 

3999
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,189
gave
uh o.j simpson the glove and it wouldn't

4000
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
uh o.j simpson the glove and it wouldn't
 

4001
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:13,910
uh o.j simpson the glove and it wouldn't
fit

4002
01:15:13,910 --> 01:15:13,920
fit
 

4003
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,149
fit
you know you don't you don't do things

4004
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:16,159
you know you don't you don't do things
 

4005
01:15:16,159 --> 01:15:17,430
you know you don't you don't do things
where you just don't know how it's going

4006
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:17,440
where you just don't know how it's going
 

4007
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,950
where you just don't know how it's going
to turn out it was

4008
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:18,960
to turn out it was
 

4009
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:21,910
to turn out it was
way way too risky and then and and i

4010
01:15:21,910 --> 01:15:21,920
way way too risky and then and and i
 

4011
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:22,870
way way too risky and then and and i
think that's what

4012
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:22,880
think that's what
 

4013
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,030
think that's what
acquitted him because that glove the

4014
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:25,040
acquitted him because that glove the
 

4015
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:27,590

and all of that and
 

4021
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:34,149
and all of that and
uh and it was big do you think about do

sense of the world around us so
 

4039
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:55,750
sense of the world around us so
as a scientist you tell a different type

4040
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:55,760
as a scientist you tell a different type
 

4041
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,189
as a scientist you tell a different type
of story

of story
 

4043
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:00,229
of story
but we as a public have
