00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,310
example that you don't have to do that
you can just let go let physics do most

496
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:38,320
you can just let go let physics do most
 

497
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,790
you can just let go let physics do most
of the work right and you just have to

498
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:40,800
of the work right and you just have to
 

499
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,550
of the work right and you just have to
give it a little bit of energy this one

500
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:42,560
give it a little bit of energy this one
 

501
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,909
give it a little bit of energy this one
only walked down a ramp it would never

502
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:43,919
only walked down a ramp it would never
 

503
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,990
only walked down a ramp it would never
walk on the flat to walk on the flat you

504
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:46,000
walk on the flat to walk on the flat you
 

505
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,110
walk on the flat to walk on the flat you
have to give a little energy at some

506
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:47,120
have to give a little energy at some
 

507
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,310
have to give a little energy at some
point

508
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
point
 

509
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,030
point
but maybe instead of trying to take the

510
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
but maybe instead of trying to take the
 

511
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,590
but maybe instead of trying to take the
forces imparted to you by the world

512
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
forces imparted to you by the world
 

513
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,590
forces imparted to you by the world
and replacing them what we should be

514
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
and replacing them what we should be
 

515
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,870
and replacing them what we should be
doing is letting the world push us

516
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:56,880
doing is letting the world push us
 

517
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,070
doing is letting the world push us
around

518
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:58,080
around
 

519
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,310
around
and we go with the flow very zen very

520
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,320
and we go with the flow very zen very

yeah but okay so that sounds very zen

524
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
yeah but okay so that sounds very zen
 

525
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,829
yeah but okay so that sounds very zen
but you can i can also imagine

526
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
but you can i can also imagine
 

527
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,670
but you can i can also imagine
how many like failed

528

how many like failed
 

529
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,829
how many like failed
versions they had to go through like how

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,310
many like
i would say it's probably would you say

534
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,320
i would say it's probably would you say
 

535
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,670
i would say it's probably would you say
it's in the thousands that they've had

536
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:15,680
it's in the thousands that they've had
 

537
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,790
it's in the thousands that they've had
to have the system

538
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:16,800
to have the system
 

539
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,430
to have the system
fall down before they figured out how

540
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
fall down before they figured out how
 

541
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,230
fall down before they figured out how
they could i don't know if it's

542
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:20,240
they could i don't know if it's
 

543
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,790
they could i don't know if it's
thousands but uh it's a lot it takes

544
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
thousands but uh it's a lot it takes
 

545
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,030
thousands but uh it's a lot it takes
some patience there's no question

546
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
some patience there's no question
 

547
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,590
some patience there's no question
so in that sense control might help a

548
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:27,600
so in that sense control might help a
 

549
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,150
so in that sense control might help a
little bit

550

00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
said that the answer is to do with that
 

557
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,910
said that the answer is to do with that
with control but it was just pointing

558
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:35,920
with control but it was just pointing
 

559
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,509
with control but it was just pointing
out that maybe the way we're doing

560
00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:37,519
out that maybe the way we're doing
 

561
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,110
out that maybe the way we're doing
control right now

562
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
control right now
 

563
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,750
control right now
isn't the way we should got it so what

564
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
isn't the way we should got it so what
 

565
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,670
isn't the way we should got it so what
what about on the animal side

566
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
what about on the animal side
 

567
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,590
what about on the animal side
the ones that figured out how to move

568
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
the ones that figured out how to move
 

569
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,350
the ones that figured out how to move
efficiently is there anything you find

570
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
efficiently is there anything you find
 

571
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,070
efficiently is there anything you find
inspiring or beautiful in the movement

of anybody i do have a favorite example

574
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
of anybody i do have a favorite example
 

575
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,030
of anybody i do have a favorite example
okay so it sort of

576
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,040
okay so it sort of
 

577
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,430
okay so it sort of
goes with the passive walking idea so is

578
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,440
goes with the passive walking idea so is
 

579
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,310
goes with the passive walking idea so is
there

580
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
there
 

581
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,230
there
you know how energy efficient are

582
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
you know how energy efficient are
 

583
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,630
you know how energy efficient are
animals okay there's a great series of

584
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:02,640
animals okay there's a great series of
 

585
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,670

they were studying
 

599
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,910
they were studying
were these rainbow trout because they

600
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:17,920
were these rainbow trout because they
 

601
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,470
were these rainbow trout because they
there was a

602
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,480
there was a
 

603
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,710
there was a
phenomenon well understood that rainbow

604
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:20,720
phenomenon well understood that rainbow
 

605
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,150

they kind of hang out behind the rocks

610
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:24,959
they kind of hang out behind the rocks
 

611
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,470
they kind of hang out behind the rocks
and it looks like i mean that's tiring

612
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
and it looks like i mean that's tiring
 

613
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,910

they're hanging out behind the rocks
 

617
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,310
they're hanging out behind the rocks
maybe there's something energetically

618
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,320
maybe there's something energetically
 

619
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,389
maybe there's something energetically
interesting there so they tried to

620
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:32,399
interesting there so they tried to
 

621
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,269
interesting there so they tried to
recreate that

622
00:10:33,269 --> 00:10:33,279
recreate that
 

623
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,910
recreate that
they put in this water tunnel a rock

624
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
they put in this water tunnel a rock
 

625
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,430
they put in this water tunnel a rock
basically a cylinder

626
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
basically a cylinder
 

627
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,630
basically a cylinder
that had the same sort of vortex street

628
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:40,640
that had the same sort of vortex street
 

629
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,069
that had the same sort of vortex street
the eddies coming off the back of the

630
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:42,079
the eddies coming off the back of the
 

631
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,069
the eddies coming off the back of the
rock that you would see in a stream

632
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
rock that you would see in a stream
 

633
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,069
rock that you would see in a stream
and they put a real fish behind this and

634
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:46,079
and they put a real fish behind this and
 

635
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,910
and they put a real fish behind this and
watched how it swims

636
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:47,920
watched how it swims
 

637
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,150
watched how it swims
and the amazing thing is that if you

638
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,160
and the amazing thing is that if you
 

639
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,750
and the amazing thing is that if you
watch from above

640
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
watch from above
 

641
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,350
watch from above
what the fish swims when it's not behind

a rock it has a particular gate
 

645
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,829
a rock it has a particular gate
you can identify the fish the same way

646
00:10:57,829 --> 00:10:57,839
you can identify the fish the same way
 

647
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,350
you can identify the fish the same way
you look at a human looking walking down

648
00:10:59,350 --> 00:10:59,360
you look at a human looking walking down
 

649
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,630
you look at a human looking walking down
the street you sort of have a sense of

650
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:00,640
the street you sort of have a sense of
 

651
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,230
the street you sort of have a sense of
how human walks

652

how human walks
 

653
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,269
how human walks
the fish has a characteristic gate you

654
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:05,279
the fish has a characteristic gate you
 

655
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,030
the fish has a characteristic gate you
put that fish behind the rock its gate

656

put that fish behind the rock its gate
 

657
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,030
put that fish behind the rock its gate
changes

changes
 

659
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,269
changes
and what they saw was that it was

660
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:11,279
and what they saw was that it was
 

661
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,550
and what they saw was that it was
actually resonating

662
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:12,560
actually resonating
 

663
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,110
actually resonating
and kind of surfing between the vortices

664
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,120
and kind of surfing between the vortices
 

665
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,470
and kind of surfing between the vortices
yeah

666
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
yeah
 

667
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,190
yeah
now here was the experiment that really

668
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
now here was the experiment that really
 

669
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,870
now here was the experiment that really
was the clincher because there was still

670
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:20,880
was the clincher because there was still
 

671
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,310
was the clincher because there was still
it wasn't clear how much of that was

672
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,320
it wasn't clear how much of that was
 

673
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,389
it wasn't clear how much of that was
mechanics of the fish how much of that

674
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:24,399
mechanics of the fish how much of that
 

675
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,430
mechanics of the fish how much of that
is control

676
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:25,440
is control
 

677
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,389
is control
the brain so the clincher experiment and

678
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
the brain so the clincher experiment and
 

679
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,670
the brain so the clincher experiment and
maybe one of my favorites to date

680
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
maybe one of my favorites to date
 

681
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,710
maybe one of my favorites to date
although there are

682
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:30,720
although there are
 

683
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,670
although there are
many good experiments they took

684
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
many good experiments they took
 

685
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,630
many good experiments they took
this was now a dead fish um they took a

686
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
this was now a dead fish um they took a
 

687
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,990
this was now a dead fish um they took a
dead fish

688
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
dead fish
 

689
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,990
dead fish
they put a string that went that tied

690
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,000
they put a string that went that tied
 

691
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,230
they put a string that went that tied
the mouse of the fish to the rock so it

692
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
the mouse of the fish to the rock so it
 

693
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,269
the mouse of the fish to the rock so it
couldn't go back and get

694
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:45,279
couldn't go back and get
 

695
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,509
couldn't go back and get
caught in the grates uh and then they

696
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
caught in the grates uh and then they
 

697
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,949
caught in the grates uh and then they
asked what would that dead fish do

698
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
asked what would that dead fish do
 

699
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,949
asked what would that dead fish do
when it was hanging out behind the rock

700
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
when it was hanging out behind the rock
 

701
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,310
when it was hanging out behind the rock
and so what you'd expect it sort of

702
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:52,320
and so what you'd expect it sort of
 

703
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,750
and so what you'd expect it sort of
flopped around like a dead fish

704
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:53,760
flopped around like a dead fish
 

705
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,310
flopped around like a dead fish
in the in the vortex wake until

706
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
in the in the vortex wake until
 

707
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,750
in the in the vortex wake until
something sort of amazing happens and

708
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:57,760
something sort of amazing happens and
 

709
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,110
something sort of amazing happens and
this video

710
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
this video
 

711
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,470
this video
is worth putting in

712
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
is worth putting in
 

713
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,550
is worth putting in
right what happens uh the dead fish

714
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
right what happens uh the dead fish
 

715
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,550
right what happens uh the dead fish
basically starts swimming upstream

716
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
basically starts swimming upstream
 

717
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,150
basically starts swimming upstream
right it's completely dead no brain no

718
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,160
right it's completely dead no brain no
 

719
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,790
right it's completely dead no brain no
motors

720
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:10,800
motors
 

721
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,069
motors
no control but it somehow the mechanics

722
00:12:14,069 --> 00:12:14,079
no control but it somehow the mechanics
 

723
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,509
no control but it somehow the mechanics
of the fish resonate with the vortex

724
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:15,519
of the fish resonate with the vortex
 

725
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,150
of the fish resonate with the vortex
street

726
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:16,160
street
 

727
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,310
street
and it starts swimming upstream it's one

728
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:18,320
and it starts swimming upstream it's one
 

729
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,389
and it starts swimming upstream it's one
of the best examples ever

730
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
of the best examples ever
 

731
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,590
of the best examples ever
who do you give credit for that too

732
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
who do you give credit for that too
 

733
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,030
who do you give credit for that too
is that just evolution constantly just

734
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
is that just evolution constantly just
 

735
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,790
is that just evolution constantly just
figuring out by killing a lot of

736
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:28,800
figuring out by killing a lot of
 

737
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,389
figuring out by killing a lot of
generations of animals

738
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:30,399
generations of animals
 

739
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,350
generations of animals
uh like the most efficient motion is

740
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
uh like the most efficient motion is
 

741
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,030
uh like the most efficient motion is
that uh or maybe the

742
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,040
that uh or maybe the
 

743
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,470
that uh or maybe the
physics of our world completely like

744
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:38,480
physics of our world completely like
 

745
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,389
physics of our world completely like
it's like evolution applied not only to

746
00:12:40,389 --> 00:12:40,399
it's like evolution applied not only to
 

747
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:41,990
it's like evolution applied not only to
animals but just the entirety of it

748
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,000
animals but just the entirety of it
 

749
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,269
animals but just the entirety of it
somehow

750
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:43,279
somehow
 

751
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,069
somehow
drives to efficiency like nature likes

752
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
drives to efficiency like nature likes
 

753
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,990
drives to efficiency like nature likes
efficiency

754
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,000
efficiency
 

755
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,269
efficiency
i don't know if that question even makes

756
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
i don't know if that question even makes
 

757
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,870
i don't know if that question even makes
any sense i understand the question

758
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
any sense i understand the question
 

759
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,030
any sense i understand the question
that's reason i mean

760
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
that's reason i mean
 

761
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,230
that's reason i mean
do they co-evolve yeah somehow yeah like

762
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:56,240
do they co-evolve yeah somehow yeah like
 

763
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,910
do they co-evolve yeah somehow yeah like
i don't know if an environment can

764
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
i don't know if an environment can
 

765
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,910
i don't know if an environment can
evolve but um

766
00:12:59,910 --> 00:12:59,920
evolve but um
 

767
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,990
evolve but um
i mean there are experiments that people

768
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
i mean there are experiments that people
 

769
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,389
i mean there are experiments that people
do careful experiments that show that

770
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:04,399
do careful experiments that show that
 

771
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,389
do careful experiments that show that
um animals can adapt to unusual

772
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:06,399
um animals can adapt to unusual
 

773
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,550
um animals can adapt to unusual
situations and recover efficiency

774
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:08,560
situations and recover efficiency
 

775
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,910
situations and recover efficiency
so there seems like at least in one

776
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:09,920
so there seems like at least in one
 

777
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,670
so there seems like at least in one
direction i think

778
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:11,680
direction i think
 

779
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,870
direction i think
there is reason to believe that the

780
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:12,880
there is reason to believe that the
 

781
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,590
there is reason to believe that the
animal's motor system

782
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:15,600
animal's motor system
 

783
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,629
animal's motor system
and probably its mechanics adapt

784
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:18,639
and probably its mechanics adapt
 

785
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:19,990
and probably its mechanics adapt
in order to be more efficient but

786
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
in order to be more efficient but
 

787
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,030
in order to be more efficient but
efficiency isn't the only goal of course

788
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
efficiency isn't the only goal of course
 

789
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,269
efficiency isn't the only goal of course
sometimes it's too easy to think about

790
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:25,279
sometimes it's too easy to think about
 

791
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,949
sometimes it's too easy to think about
only efficiency but we have to do a lot

792
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:26,959
only efficiency but we have to do a lot
 

793
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,230
only efficiency but we have to do a lot
of other things

794
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
of other things
 

795
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,509
of other things
first not get eaten and then

796
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:31,519
first not get eaten and then
 

797
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,430
first not get eaten and then
all other things being equal try to save

798
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:33,440
all other things being equal try to save
 

799
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,190
all other things being equal try to save
energy by the way let's uh

800
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:35,200
energy by the way let's uh
 

801
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,949
energy by the way let's uh
draw a distinction between control and

802
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:36,959
draw a distinction between control and
 

803
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,550
draw a distinction between control and
mechanics like how

804
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
mechanics like how
 

805
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,590
mechanics like how
how can how would you define each yeah i

806
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
how can how would you define each yeah i
 

807
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,829
how can how would you define each yeah i
mean i think part of the point is that

808
00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:43,839
mean i think part of the point is that
 

809
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,629
mean i think part of the point is that
we shouldn't draw a line as as clearly

810
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
we shouldn't draw a line as as clearly
 

811
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:47,670
we shouldn't draw a line as as clearly
as we tend to

812
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:47,680
as we tend to
 

813
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,470
as we tend to
but the you know on a robot we have

814
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:50,480
but the you know on a robot we have
 

815
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:51,269
but the you know on a robot we have
motors

816
00:13:51,269 --> 00:13:51,279
motors
 

817
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,829
motors
and we have the links of the robot let's

818
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:53,839
and we have the links of the robot let's
 

819
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,629
and we have the links of the robot let's
say

820
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:54,639
say
 

821
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,629
say
if the motors are turned off the robot

822
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:56,639
if the motors are turned off the robot
 

823
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,949
if the motors are turned off the robot
has some passive dynamics

right if we have springs and dampers

830
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:04,800
right if we have springs and dampers
 

831
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,910
right if we have springs and dampers
which our muscles are springs and

832
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:05,920
which our muscles are springs and
 

833
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,310
which our muscles are springs and
dampers and tendons

00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:08,320
dampers and tendons
 

835
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,590

but then you have something that's doing

836
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:09,600

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:21,920
right so the mechanics and control
 

849
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,990
right so the mechanics and control
interplay somewhere the divide is around

you know did you decide to send some

852
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:26,560
you know did you decide to send some
 

853
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,990
you know did you decide to send some
commands to your motor or did you just

854
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,000
commands to your motor or did you just
 

855
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,269
commands to your motor or did you just
leave the motors off and let them do

856
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:29,279
leave the motors off and let them do
 

857
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,629
leave the motors off and let them do
their work

their work
 

859
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,110

so the idea that somehow

924
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
so the idea that somehow

it's only our brain that's adapting or
 

927
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,990
it's only our brain that's adapting or
evolving is not right

928
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
evolving is not right
 

929
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,389
evolving is not right
maybe sticking on evolution for a bit

930
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:52,399
maybe sticking on evolution for a bit
 

931
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:53,509
maybe sticking on evolution for a bit
because

932
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
because
 

933
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,350
because
it's tended to create some interesting

it's tended to create some interesting
 

935
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,710
it's tended to create some interesting
things uh

936
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:56,720

do you uh why the heck did evolution

940
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
do you uh why the heck did evolution
 

941
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,269
do you uh why the heck did evolution
give us

942
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:03,279
give us
 

943
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,949
give us
i think we're are we the only mammals

944
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
i think we're are we the only mammals
 

945
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:06,470

that walk on two feet

946
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:06,480
that walk on two feet
 

947
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,790
that walk on two feet
no i mean there's a bunch of animals

948
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:08,800
no i mean there's a bunch of animals
 

949
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,749
no i mean there's a bunch of animals
that do it

950
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:09,759
that do it
 

951
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,629
that do it
a bit there's a i think we are the most

952
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
a bit there's a i think we are the most

i think some uh i think i read somewhere

956
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:16,720
i think some uh i think i read somewhere
 

957
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,030
i think some uh i think i read somewhere
that

958
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,040
that
 

959
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,790
that
um the reason the

960
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:20,800
um the reason the
 

961
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,749
um the reason the
you know evolution made us walk on two

962
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:23,759
you know evolution made us walk on two
 

963
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,069
you know evolution made us walk on two
feet is because uh there's an advantage

964
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
feet is because uh there's an advantage
 

965
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,150
feet is because uh there's an advantage
to being able to carry food back to the

966
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
to being able to carry food back to the
 

967
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,430
to being able to carry food back to the
tribe or something like that

968
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
tribe or something like that
 

969
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,910
tribe or something like that
so like you can carry it's kind of this

970
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
so like you can carry it's kind of this
 

971
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,269
so like you can carry it's kind of this
communal

communal
 

973
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,069
communal
cooperative thing so like to carry stuff

974
00:16:36,069 --> 00:16:36,079
cooperative thing so like to carry stuff
 

975
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,470
cooperative thing so like to carry stuff
back

976
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480

to um to a place of shelter and so on to
 

979
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,230
to um to a place of shelter and so on to

yeah there are some great books written
 

989
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,030
yeah there are some great books written
about evolution of

990
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,040
about evolution of
 

991
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,069
about evolution of
walking evolution of the human body i

992
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:56,079
walking evolution of the human body i
 

993
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:56,629
walking evolution of the human body i
think it's

994
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
think it's
 

995
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,910
think it's
easy though to make bad evolutionary

996
00:16:59,910 --> 00:16:59,920
easy though to make bad evolutionary
 

997
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,550
easy though to make bad evolutionary
arguments

998
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
arguments
 

999
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,309
arguments
sure most of them are probably bad but

1000
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
sure most of them are probably bad but
 

1001
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,230
sure most of them are probably bad but
what else can we do i mean i think um

1002
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
what else can we do i mean i think um
 

1003
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,110
what else can we do i mean i think um
a lot of what dominated our evolution

1004
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
a lot of what dominated our evolution
 

1005
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,750
a lot of what dominated our evolution
probably was not

1006
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:13,760
probably was not
 

1007
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,510
probably was not
the things that worked well sort of in

1008
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
the things that worked well sort of in
 

1009
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,230
the things that worked well sort of in
the steady state um

1010
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
the steady state um
 

1011
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,590
the steady state um
you know when things are when things are

1012
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:19,600
you know when things are when things are
 

1013
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,069
you know when things are when things are
good but but uh

1014
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:22,079
good but but uh
 

1015
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,390
good but but uh
for instance people talk about what we

1016
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:24,400
for instance people talk about what we
 

1017
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,429
for instance people talk about what we
should eat now because

1018
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:25,439
should eat now because
 

1019
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,270
should eat now because
our ancestors were meat eaters or or

1020
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:27,280
our ancestors were meat eaters or or
 

1021
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,430
our ancestors were meat eaters or or
whatever oh yeah i love that

1022
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:29,440
whatever oh yeah i love that
 

1023
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,390
whatever oh yeah i love that
yeah but probably you know the reason

1024
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:32,400
yeah but probably you know the reason
 

1025
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,350
yeah but probably you know the reason
that

1026
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:33,360
that
 

1027
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,430
that
one pre uh pre-homo sapien species

1028
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
one pre uh pre-homo sapien species
 

1029
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,029
one pre uh pre-homo sapien species
versus another

1030
00:17:39,029 --> 00:17:39,039
versus another
 

1031
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,909
versus another
survived was not because of whether they

1032
00:17:41,909 --> 00:17:41,919
survived was not because of whether they
 

1033
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:42,710
survived was not because of whether they
ate well

1034
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:42,720
ate well
 

1035
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,070
ate well
uh when there was lots of food but when

1036
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
uh when there was lots of food but when
 

1037
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,190
uh when there was lots of food but when
the ice age came

1038
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
the ice age came
 

1039
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,669
the ice age came
you know probably one of them happened

1040
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:49,679
you know probably one of them happened
 

1041
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,789
you know probably one of them happened
to be in the wrong place

1042
00:17:50,789 --> 00:17:50,799
to be in the wrong place
 

1043
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,190
to be in the wrong place
one of them happened to forage a food

1044
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
one of them happened to forage a food
 

1045
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,150
one of them happened to forage a food
that was okay

1046
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
that was okay
 

1047
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,110
that was okay
even even when the glaciers came or

1048
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,120
even even when the glaciers came or
 

1049
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,070
even even when the glaciers came or
something like that i mean

1050
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
something like that i mean
 

1051
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,750
something like that i mean
there's a million variables that

1052
00:17:59,750 --> 00:17:59,760
there's a million variables that
 

1053
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,190
there's a million variables that
contributed and we can't

1054
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,200
contributed and we can't
 

1055
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,190
contributed and we can't
and our actually the amount of

1056
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:03,200
and our actually the amount of
 

1057
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,950
and our actually the amount of
information we're working with and

1058
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:04,960
information we're working with and
 

1059
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,789
information we're working with and
telling these stories

1060
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
telling these stories
 

1061
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,350
telling these stories
these evolutionary stories is uh is very

1062
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
these evolutionary stories is uh is very
 

1063
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,150
these evolutionary stories is uh is very
little

1064
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
little
 

1065
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,950
little
so yeah just like you said it seems like

1066
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
so yeah just like you said it seems like
 

1067
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,350
so yeah just like you said it seems like
if we

1068
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:13,360
if we
 

1069
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,710
if we
if we study history it seems like

1070
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:14,720
if we study history it seems like
 

1071
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,950
if we study history it seems like
history turns on like these little

1072
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
history turns on like these little
 

1073
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,070
history turns on like these little
events

1074
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:18,080
events
 

1075
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,549
events
that uh that otherwise would seem

1076
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
that uh that otherwise would seem
 

1077
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,430
that uh that otherwise would seem
meaningless

1078
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:21,440
meaningless
 

1079
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,990
meaningless
but in the grant like when you in

1080
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
but in the grant like when you in
 

1081
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,350
but in the grant like when you in
retrospect

1082
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,360
retrospect
 

1083
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,470
retrospect
were turning points absolutely and that

1084
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
were turning points absolutely and that
 

1085
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,630
were turning points absolutely and that
that's probably how like somebody got

1086
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:30,640
that's probably how like somebody got
 

1087
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,390
that's probably how like somebody got
hit in the head with a rock

1088
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:32,400
hit in the head with a rock
 

1089
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,909
hit in the head with a rock
because somebody slept with the wrong

1090
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:33,919
because somebody slept with the wrong
 

1091
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,310
because somebody slept with the wrong
person back in the

person back in the
 

1093
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,470
person back in the
cave days and somebody get angry and

1094
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:38,480
cave days and somebody get angry and
 

1095
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,750
cave days and somebody get angry and
that turned uh

1096
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:39,760
that turned uh
 

1097
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,390
that turned uh
you know warring tribes combined with

1098
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
you know warring tribes combined with
 

1099
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,190
you know warring tribes combined with
the environment

1100
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
the environment
 

1101
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,669
the environment
all those millions of things and the

1102
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,679
all those millions of things and the
 

1103
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,310
all those millions of things and the
meat eating

1104
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:46,320
meat eating
 

1105
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,070
meat eating
which i get a lot of criticism because i

1106
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
which i get a lot of criticism because i
 

1107
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,830
which i get a lot of criticism because i
i don't know um i don't know what your

1108
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:49,840
i don't know um i don't know what your
 

1109
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,750
i don't know um i don't know what your
dietary processes are like but

1110
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:51,760
dietary processes are like but
 

1111
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,870
dietary processes are like but
these days i been eating only meat

1112
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
these days i been eating only meat
 

1113
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,070
these days i been eating only meat
which is um there's a large community

1114
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:58,080
which is um there's a large community
 

1115
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,830
which is um there's a large community
people who say yeah probably make

1116
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
people who say yeah probably make
 

1117
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,990
people who say yeah probably make
evolutionary arguments and say you do a

1118
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
evolutionary arguments and say you do a
 

1119
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,110
evolutionary arguments and say you do a
great job there's

1120
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
great job there's
 

1121
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,950
great job there's
probably an even larger community of

1122
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:04,960
probably an even larger community of
 

1123
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,630
probably an even larger community of
people including my mom

1124
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:06,640
people including my mom
 

1125
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,549
people including my mom
who says it's deeply unhealthy it's

1126
00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:08,559
who says it's deeply unhealthy it's
 

1127
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,630
who says it's deeply unhealthy it's
wrong but i just feel good doing it

1128
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:10,640
wrong but i just feel good doing it
 

1129
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,470
wrong but i just feel good doing it
but you're right these evolutionary

1130
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:12,480
but you're right these evolutionary
 

1131
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,470
but you're right these evolutionary
arguments can be flawed but is there

1132
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
arguments can be flawed but is there
 

1133
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,110
arguments can be flawed but is there
anything interesting to pull out for um

1134
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
anything interesting to pull out for um
 

1135
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,510
anything interesting to pull out for um
there's a great book by the way um look

1136
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:19,520
there's a great book by the way um look
 

1137
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,190
there's a great book by the way um look
a series of books by nicholas taleb

1138
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:21,200
a series of books by nicholas taleb
 

1139
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,110
a series of books by nicholas taleb
about fooled by randomness and black

1140
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,120
about fooled by randomness and black
 

1141
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,630
about fooled by randomness and black
swan um

1142
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:24,640
swan um
 

1143
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,950
swan um
highly recommend them but yeah they make

1144
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:26,960
highly recommend them but yeah they make
 

1145
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,310
highly recommend them but yeah they make
the point nicely that

1146
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
the point nicely that
 

1147
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,350
the point nicely that
probably it was a few

1148
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:31,360
probably it was a few
 

1149
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,510
probably it was a few
random events that yes maybe it was

1150
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
random events that yes maybe it was
 

1151
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,789
random events that yes maybe it was
someone getting hit by a rock as you say

1152
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:38,799
someone getting hit by a rock as you say
 

1153
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,909
someone getting hit by a rock as you say
uh that said do you think i don't know

1154
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:41,919
uh that said do you think i don't know
 

1155
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,510
uh that said do you think i don't know
how to ask this question or how to talk

1156
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:43,520
how to ask this question or how to talk
 

1157
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,029
how to ask this question or how to talk
about this but there's something elegant

1158
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:45,039
about this but there's something elegant
 

1159
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,750
about this but there's something elegant
and beautiful about moving on two feet

1160
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
and beautiful about moving on two feet
 

1161
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,950
and beautiful about moving on two feet
obviously biased because i'm human but

from a robotics perspective too you work

1164
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:53,600
from a robotics perspective too you work
 

1165
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,390
from a robotics perspective too you work
with robots on two feet

1166
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:56,400
with robots on two feet
 

1167
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,630
with robots on two feet
is it um is it all useful to build

1168
00:19:58,630 --> 00:19:58,640
is it um is it all useful to build
 

1169
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,390
is it um is it all useful to build
robots that are on two feet as opposed

1170
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:00,400
robots that are on two feet as opposed
 

1171
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,950
robots that are on two feet as opposed
to four

to four
 

1173
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,470
to four
is there something useful about it the

1174
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:02,480
is there something useful about it the
 

1175
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,630
is there something useful about it the
most um i mean the reason i

1176
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:04,640
most um i mean the reason i
 

1177
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,710
most um i mean the reason i
spent a long time working on bipedal

1178
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
spent a long time working on bipedal

walking was because it was hard

1180
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
walking was because it was hard
 

1181
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,430
walking was because it was hard
and it was um it challenged control

1182
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:11,440
and it was um it challenged control
 

1183
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,950
and it was um it challenged control
theory in ways that i thought were

00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
um i wouldn't have

ever tried to convince you that you

1190
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:20,080
ever tried to convince you that you
 

1191
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:20,630
ever tried to convince you that you
should

1192
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
should
 

1193
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,470
should
start a company around bipeds or

1194
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,480
start a company around bipeds or
 

1195
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,070
start a company around bipeds or
something like this

1196
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:24,080
something like this
 

1197
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,029
something like this
there are people that make pretty

1198
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
there are people that make pretty
 

1199
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,390
there are people that make pretty
compelling arguments right i think the

1200
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:26,400
compelling arguments right i think the
 

1201
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,510
compelling arguments right i think the
most compelling one

1202
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:27,520
most compelling one
 

1203
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,950
most compelling one
is that the world is built for the human

1204
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:30,960
is that the world is built for the human
 

1205
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,350
is that the world is built for the human
form

1206
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:31,360
form
 

1207
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,190
form
and if you want a robot to work in the

1208
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
and if you want a robot to work in the
 

1209
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,789
and if you want a robot to work in the
world we have today

1210
00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:34,799
world we have today
 

1211
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,950
world we have today
then you know having a human form is a

1212
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:36,960
then you know having a human form is a
 

1213
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,669
then you know having a human form is a
pretty good way to go

1214
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
pretty good way to go
 

1215
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,430
pretty good way to go
there there are places that a biped can

1216
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:41,440
there there are places that a biped can
 

1217
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,070
there there are places that a biped can
go that would be hard for

1218
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,080
go that would be hard for
 

1219
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,710
go that would be hard for
other form factors to go even natural

1220
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:46,720
other form factors to go even natural
 

1221
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:47,590
other form factors to go even natural
places

1222
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
places
 

1223
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,630
places
but um you know at some point in the

1224
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,640
but um you know at some point in the
 

1225
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,270
but um you know at some point in the
long run

1226
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:51,280
long run
 

1227
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,870
long run
we'll be building our environments for

1228
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:52,880
we'll be building our environments for
 

1229
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,789
we'll be building our environments for
our robots probably and so maybe that

1230
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:54,799
our robots probably and so maybe that
 

1231
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,390
our robots probably and so maybe that
argument falls aside

1232
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:56,400
argument falls aside
 

1233
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,789
argument falls aside
so you famously run barefoot

1234
00:21:00,789 --> 00:21:00,799

 

1235
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,470

do you still run barefoot i still run

1236
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
do you still run barefoot i still run
 

1237
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,630
do you still run barefoot i still run
barefoot that's so awesome

1238
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:04,640
barefoot that's so awesome
 

1239
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,669
barefoot that's so awesome
much to my wife's chagrin

1240
00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:07,679
much to my wife's chagrin
 

1241
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,789
much to my wife's chagrin
do you want to make an evolutionary

1242
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:08,799
do you want to make an evolutionary
 

1243
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,789
do you want to make an evolutionary
argument for why running barefoot is

1244
00:21:10,789 --> 00:21:10,799
argument for why running barefoot is
 

1245
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:11,990
argument for why running barefoot is
advantageous

1246
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
advantageous
 

1247
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,149
advantageous
um what have you learned about um

1248
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
um what have you learned about um
 

1249
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,310
um what have you learned about um
human and robot movement in general from

1250
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:18,320
human and robot movement in general from
 

1251
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,029
human and robot movement in general from
running barefoot

1252
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:21,039
running barefoot
 

1253
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,990
running barefoot
human or robot and or well you know it

1254
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:24,000
human or robot and or well you know it
 

1255
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,270
human or robot and or well you know it
happened the other way

1256
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
happened the other way
 

1257
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,669
happened the other way
right so i was studying walking robots

1258
00:21:27,669 --> 00:21:27,679
right so i was studying walking robots
 

1259
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,789
right so i was studying walking robots
and

1260
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:28,799
and
 

1261
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,590
and
i was there's a great conference called

1262
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:31,600
i was there's a great conference called
 

1263
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,029
i was there's a great conference called
the dynamic walking

1264
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:33,039
the dynamic walking
 

1265
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,430
the dynamic walking
conference where it brings together both

1266
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
conference where it brings together both
 

1267
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,870
conference where it brings together both
the biomechanics community

1268
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,880
the biomechanics community
 

1269
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,070
the biomechanics community
and the walking robots community and so

1270
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
and the walking robots community and so
 

1271
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,669
and the walking robots community and so
i've been going to this for years and

1272
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:41,679
i've been going to this for years and
 

1273
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:42,950
i've been going to this for years and
hearing

1274
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:42,960
hearing
 

1275
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,630
hearing
talks by people who study barefoot

1276
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
talks by people who study barefoot
 

1277
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,230
talks by people who study barefoot
running and other the mechanics of

1278
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
running and other the mechanics of
 

1279
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,909
running and other the mechanics of
running

1280
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
running
 

1281
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,149
running
so i i did eventually read born to run

1282
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:50,159
so i i did eventually read born to run
 

1283
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,750
so i i did eventually read born to run
most people read born to run in the

1284
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
most people read born to run in the
 

1285
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,390
most people read born to run in the
first thing

1286
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
first thing
 

1287
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,190
first thing
right the other thing i had going for me

1288
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
right the other thing i had going for me
 

1289
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,710
right the other thing i had going for me
is actually that i

1290
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:56,720
is actually that i
 

1291
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,870
is actually that i
i wouldn't i wasn't a runner before and

1292
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
i wouldn't i wasn't a runner before and
 

1293
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,630
i wouldn't i wasn't a runner before and
i learned to run

1294
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:00,640
i learned to run
 

1295
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,470
i learned to run
after i had learned about barefoot

1296
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:02,480
after i had learned about barefoot
 

1297
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,390
after i had learned about barefoot
running i mean started running longer

1298
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,400
running i mean started running longer
 

1299
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,350
running i mean started running longer
distances

1300
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:05,360
distances
 

1301
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,510
distances
so i didn't have to unlearn and i'm

1302
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
so i didn't have to unlearn and i'm
 

1303
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,390
so i didn't have to unlearn and i'm
definitely

1304
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:08,400
definitely
 

1305
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,350
definitely
um i'm a big fan of it for me but i'm

1306
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
um i'm a big fan of it for me but i'm
 

1307
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,230
um i'm a big fan of it for me but i'm
not gonna

1308
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
not gonna
 

1309
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,149
not gonna
i tend to not try to convince other

1310
00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:14,159
i tend to not try to convince other
 

1311
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,350
i tend to not try to convince other
people there's people who run

1312
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
people there's people who run
 

1313
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,310
people there's people who run
beautifully

1314
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:16,320
beautifully
 

1315
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,909
beautifully
with shoes on and that's good um

1316
00:22:19,909 --> 00:22:19,919
with shoes on and that's good um
 

1317
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,909
with shoes on and that's good um
but here's why it makes sense for me um

1318
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
but here's why it makes sense for me um
 

1319
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,310
but here's why it makes sense for me um
it's all about the long-term game right

1320
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:26,320
it's all about the long-term game right
 

1321
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,630
it's all about the long-term game right
so i think it's just too easy to run 10

1322
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:28,640
so i think it's just too easy to run 10
 

1323
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,350
so i think it's just too easy to run 10
miles

1324
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:29,360
miles
 

1325
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,190
miles
feel pretty good and then you get home

1326
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:31,200
feel pretty good and then you get home
 

1327
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,390
feel pretty good and then you get home
at night and you realize

1328
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:32,400
at night and you realize
 

1329
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,029
at night and you realize
uh my knees hurt i did something wrong

1330
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:35,039
uh my knees hurt i did something wrong
 

1331
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:35,990
uh my knees hurt i did something wrong
right

1332
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,000
right
 

1333
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,669
right
um if you take your shoes off

1334
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:39,679
um if you take your shoes off
 

1335
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,549
um if you take your shoes off
then if you hit hard with your foot at

1336
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
then if you hit hard with your foot at
 

1337
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,430
then if you hit hard with your foot at
all

1338
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:43,440
all
 

1339
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,549
all
um then it hurts you don't like run 10

1340
00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:46,559
um then it hurts you don't like run 10
 

1341
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,830
um then it hurts you don't like run 10
miles

1342
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:47,840
miles
 

1343
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,430
miles
and then and then realize you've done

1344
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,440
and then and then realize you've done
 

1345
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,350
and then and then realize you've done
something some damage you have immediate

1346
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:51,360
something some damage you have immediate
 

1347
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,470
something some damage you have immediate
feedback

1348
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:52,480
feedback
 

1349
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,590
feedback
telling you that you've done something

1350
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:53,600
telling you that you've done something
 

1351
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,590
telling you that you've done something
that's that's maybe sub-optimal and you

1352
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
that's that's maybe sub-optimal and you
 

1353
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,390
that's that's maybe sub-optimal and you
change your gait

1354
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:56,400
change your gait
 

1355
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,149
change your gait
i mean it's even subconscious if i right

1356
00:22:58,149 --> 00:22:58,159
i mean it's even subconscious if i right
 

1357
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,430
i mean it's even subconscious if i right
now having run many

1358
00:22:59,430 --> 00:22:59,440
now having run many
 

1359
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,669
now having run many
miles barefoot if i put a shoe on my

1360
00:23:01,669 --> 00:23:01,679
miles barefoot if i put a shoe on my
 

1361
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,029
miles barefoot if i put a shoe on my
gate changes

1362
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:03,039
gate changes
 

1363
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,830
gate changes
in a way that i think is not as good um

1364
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
in a way that i think is not as good um
 

1365
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,110
in a way that i think is not as good um
so

1366
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:07,120
so
 

1367
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,149
so
so it makes me land softer and

1368
00:23:10,149 --> 00:23:10,159
so it makes me land softer and
 

1369
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,350
so it makes me land softer and
i think my my goals for running are to

1370
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
i think my my goals for running are to
 

1371
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,789
i think my my goals for running are to
do it for as long as i can

1372
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
do it for as long as i can
 

1373
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,990
do it for as long as i can
into old age um not to win any

1374
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
into old age um not to win any
 

1375
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,350
into old age um not to win any
races and so for me this is a you know

1376
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:21,360
races and so for me this is a you know
 

1377
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,190
races and so for me this is a you know
a way to protect myself yeah i think um

1378
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:25,200
a way to protect myself yeah i think um
 

1379
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,669
a way to protect myself yeah i think um

many years ago
uh probably the other way just just just

1384
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:31,679
uh probably the other way just just just
 

1385
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,470
uh probably the other way just just just
uh

1386
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:32,480
uh
 

1387
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,510
uh
reading born to run but

1388
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:35,520
reading born to run but
 

1389
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,510
reading born to run but
just to understand because i felt like i

1390
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
just to understand because i felt like i
 

1391
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,630
just to understand because i felt like i
couldn't

1392
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:38,640
couldn't
 

1393
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,350
couldn't
put in the miles that i wanted to and it

1394
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,360
put in the miles that i wanted to and it
 

1395
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,870
put in the miles that i wanted to and it
feels like

1396
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:42,880
feels like
 

1397
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,029
feels like
running for me and i think for a lot of

1398
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:45,039
running for me and i think for a lot of
 

1399
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,149
running for me and i think for a lot of
people

1400
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:46,159
people
 

1401
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,149
people
was one of those activities that we do

1402
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
was one of those activities that we do
 

1403
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,470
was one of those activities that we do
often and never really

1404
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,480
often and never really
 

1405
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,750
often and never really
try to learn to do correctly like it's

1406
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:53,760
try to learn to do correctly like it's
 

1407
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,830
try to learn to do correctly like it's
funny there's so many activities

1408
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:55,840
funny there's so many activities
 

1409
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,190
funny there's so many activities
we do every day like brushing our teeth

1410
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
we do every day like brushing our teeth
 

1411
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,310
we do every day like brushing our teeth
right i think a lot of us at least me

1412
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:02,320
right i think a lot of us at least me
 

1413
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,390
right i think a lot of us at least me
probably have never deeply studied how

1414
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:04,400
probably have never deeply studied how
 

1415
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,630
probably have never deeply studied how
to properly brush my teeth

1416
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:06,640
to properly brush my teeth
 

1417
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,950
to properly brush my teeth
right or wash as now with a pandemic or

1418
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
right or wash as now with a pandemic or
 

1419
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,870
right or wash as now with a pandemic or
how to properly wash our hands or do it

1420
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:10,880
how to properly wash our hands or do it
 

1421
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,669
how to properly wash our hands or do it
every day

1422
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
every day
 

1423
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,390
every day
but we haven't really studied like am i

1424
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:14,400
but we haven't really studied like am i
 

1425
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,990
but we haven't really studied like am i
doing this correctly but running felt

1426
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
doing this correctly but running felt
 

1427
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,110
doing this correctly but running felt
like one of those things

1428
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,120
like one of those things
 

1429
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,669
like one of those things
it was absurd not to study how to do

1430
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:19,679
it was absurd not to study how to do
 

1431
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,190
it was absurd not to study how to do
correctly because it's the source of so

1432
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,200
correctly because it's the source of so
 

1433
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,149
correctly because it's the source of so
much pain

1434
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:22,159
much pain
 

1435
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,390
much pain
and suffering like i hate running but i

1436
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,400
and suffering like i hate running but i
 

1437
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,510
and suffering like i hate running but i
do it

1438
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
do it
 

1439
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,830
do it
i do it because i hate it but it i feel

1440
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:27,840
i do it because i hate it but it i feel
 

1441
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,789
i do it because i hate it but it i feel
good afterwards

1442
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:28,799
good afterwards
 

1443
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,310
good afterwards
but i think it feels like you need to

1444
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:30,320
but i think it feels like you need to
 

1445
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,070
but i think it feels like you need to
learn how to do it properly so that's

1446
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,080
learn how to do it properly so that's
 

1447
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,750
learn how to do it properly so that's
where barefoot running came in and then

1448
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:33,760
where barefoot running came in and then
 

1449
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,190
where barefoot running came in and then
i quickly realized that

1450
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,200
i quickly realized that
 

1451
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,390
i quickly realized that
my gait was completely wrong i was

1452
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:38,400
my gait was completely wrong i was
 

1453
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,430
my gait was completely wrong i was
taking huge like steps

1454
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
taking huge like steps
 

1455
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,830
taking huge like steps
and landing hard on the heel all those

1456
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:44,840
and landing hard on the heel all those
 

1457
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,029
and landing hard on the heel all those
elements and so yeah from that i

1458
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:47,039
elements and so yeah from that i
 

1459
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:47,909
elements and so yeah from that i
actually learned to take

1460
00:24:47,909 --> 00:24:47,919
actually learned to take
 

1461
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,029
actually learned to take
really small steps look i

1462
00:24:51,029 --> 00:24:51,039
really small steps look i
 

1463
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,630
really small steps look i
already forgot the number but i feel

1464
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:52,640
already forgot the number but i feel
 

1465
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,630
already forgot the number but i feel
like it was 180 a minute or something

1466
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:54,640
like it was 180 a minute or something
 

1467
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,510
like it was 180 a minute or something
like that

1468
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:55,520
like that
 

1469
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,350
like that
and i remember i was uh i actually just

1470
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,360
and i remember i was uh i actually just
 

1471
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,350
and i remember i was uh i actually just
took songs that are 180 beats per minute

1472
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:03,360
took songs that are 180 beats per minute
 

1473
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,070
took songs that are 180 beats per minute
and then like tried to run at that beat

1474
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
and then like tried to run at that beat
 

1475
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,470

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,909
they were going to charge me
you know some some dollar per minute

1796
00:30:31,909 --> 00:30:31,919
you know some some dollar per minute
 

1797
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,350
you know some some dollar per minute
that i was late uh

1798
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,360
that i was late uh
 

1799
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,870
that i was late uh
i've run some fast splits to daycare

1800
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
i've run some fast splits to daycare
 

1801
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,590
i've run some fast splits to daycare
but that those times are passed now

1802
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:41,600
but that those times are passed now
 

1803
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,830
but that those times are passed now
i think work you can find a work-life

1804
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:43,840
i think work you can find a work-life
 

1805
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,269
i think work you can find a work-life
balance in that way i think you just

1806
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
balance in that way i think you just
 

1807
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,110
balance in that way i think you just
have to

1808
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:47,120
have to
 

1809
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,190
have to
i think i am better at work because i

1810
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,200
i think i am better at work because i
 

1811
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,310
i think i am better at work because i
take time to

1812
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:50,320
take time to
 

1813
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,669
take time to
think on the way in so i plan my day

1814
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
think on the way in so i plan my day
 

1815
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,190
think on the way in so i plan my day
around it

1816
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
around it
 

1817
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,070
around it
and i i rarely feel that those are

1818
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:58,080
and i i rarely feel that those are
 

1819
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,509
and i i rarely feel that those are
really in

1820
00:30:59,509 --> 00:30:59,519
really in
 

1821
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,190
really in
at odds so what the bucket list item

1822
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:03,200
at odds so what the bucket list item
 

1823
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,029
at odds so what the bucket list item
if we're talking 12 times 2

1824
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:07,039
if we're talking 12 times 2
 

1825
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,549
if we're talking 12 times 2
or approaching a marathon uh

1826
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
or approaching a marathon uh
 

1827
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,549
or approaching a marathon uh
what uh have you run an ultra marathon

1828
00:31:14,549 --> 00:31:14,559
what uh have you run an ultra marathon
 

1829
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,509
what uh have you run an ultra marathon
before do you do races is there what's

1830
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
before do you do races is there what's
 

1831
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,509
before do you do races is there what's
uh to win

1832
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:21,519

 

1833
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,110

i'm not gonna like take a dinghy across

1834
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:23,120
i'm not gonna like take a dinghy across
 

1835
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,310
i'm not gonna like take a dinghy across
the atlantic or something if that's what

but if someone does and wants to write a
 

1841
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,110
but if someone does and wants to write a
book i would totally read it because i'm

a sucker for that kind of thing
 

1845
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,789
a sucker for that kind of thing
no i do have some fun things that i will

try you know i like to
 

1849
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,230
try you know i like to
when i travel i almost always bike to

1850
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:36,240
when i travel i almost always bike to
 

1851
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,830
when i travel i almost always bike to
logan airport and fold up a little

1852
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:37,840
logan airport and fold up a little
 

1853
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,509
logan airport and fold up a little
folding bike on and then take it with me

1854
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
folding bike on and then take it with me
 

1855
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,430
folding bike on and then take it with me
and bike to wherever i'm going and

1856
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:41,440
and bike to wherever i'm going and
 

1857
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,269
and bike to wherever i'm going and
i've it's taken me or i'll take a

1858
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:43,279
i've it's taken me or i'll take a
 

1859
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,950
i've it's taken me or i'll take a
stand-up paddleboard these days on the

1860
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:44,960
stand-up paddleboard these days on the
 

1861
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,230
stand-up paddleboard these days on the
airplane and then i'll try to paddle

1862
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,240
airplane and then i'll try to paddle
 

1863
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,750
airplane and then i'll try to paddle
around where i'm going or whatever

1864
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
around where i'm going or whatever
 

1865
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,549
around where i'm going or whatever
and i've done some crazy things but um

1866
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
and i've done some crazy things but um
 

1867
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,789
and i've done some crazy things but um
but not for the

1868
00:31:52,789 --> 00:31:52,799
but not for the
 

1869
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,350
but not for the
you know i've i now talk i don't know if

1870
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:55,360
you know i've i now talk i don't know if
 

1871
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,950
you know i've i now talk i don't know if
you know who david goggins is by any

1872
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:56,960
you know who david goggins is by any
 

1873
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,350
you know who david goggins is by any
chance

1874
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
chance
 

1875
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,430
chance
not well but yeah but i i talk to him

1876
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
not well but yeah but i i talk to him
 

1877
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,509
not well but yeah but i i talk to him
now every day so he's the person

1878
00:32:01,509 --> 00:32:01,519
now every day so he's the person
 

1879
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,909
now every day so he's the person
who made me uh do this stupid challenge

1880
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
who made me uh do this stupid challenge
 

1881
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,430
who made me uh do this stupid challenge
so he he's insane and he does things for

1882
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
so he he's insane and he does things for
 

1883
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,070
so he he's insane and he does things for
the purpose

1884
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
the purpose
 

1885
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,669
the purpose
in in the best kind of way he does

1886
00:32:11,669 --> 00:32:11,679
in in the best kind of way he does
 

1887
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,190
in in the best kind of way he does
things

1888
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:13,200
things
 

1889
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,230
things
like for the explicit purpose of

1890
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
like for the explicit purpose of
 

1891
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:16,870
like for the explicit purpose of
suffering

1892
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:16,880
suffering
 

1893
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,549
suffering
like he picks the thing that like

1894
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
like he picks the thing that like
 

1895
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,870
like he picks the thing that like
whatever he thinks he can do he does

1896
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:20,880
whatever he thinks he can do he does
 

1897
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,310
whatever he thinks he can do he does
more uh so is that do you have

1898
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
more uh so is that do you have
 

1899
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,509
more uh so is that do you have
that thing in you or you uh i think it's

1900
00:32:27,509 --> 00:32:27,519
that thing in you or you uh i think it's
 

1901
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:27,990
that thing in you or you uh i think it's
become the

1902
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:28,000
become the
 

1903
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,190
become the
opposite it's uh so you're like that

1904
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
opposite it's uh so you're like that
 

1905
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,470
opposite it's uh so you're like that
dynamical system that

1906
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
dynamical system that
 

1907
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,310
dynamical system that
the walker the efficient uh yeah it's uh

1908
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
the walker the efficient uh yeah it's uh
 

1909
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,350
the walker the efficient uh yeah it's uh
leave no pain right you should end

1910
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,360
leave no pain right you should end
 

1911
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,470
leave no pain right you should end
feeling better than you started okay but

1912
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:42,480
feeling better than you started okay but
 

1913
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,110
feeling better than you started okay but
um it's mostly i think and kovit has

1914
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,120
um it's mostly i think and kovit has
 

1915
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,590
um it's mostly i think and kovit has
tested this because i've lost my commute

1916
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
tested this because i've lost my commute
 

1917
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,430
tested this because i've lost my commute
i think i'm perfectly happy walking

1918
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:49,440
i think i'm perfectly happy walking
 

1919
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,789
i think i'm perfectly happy walking
around uh

1920
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:50,799
around uh
 

1921
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,070
around uh
around town with my wife and uh kids if

1922
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:54,080
around town with my wife and uh kids if
 

1923
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,909
around town with my wife and uh kids if
they could get them to go

1924
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:55,919
they could get them to go
 

1925
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:57,669
they could get them to go
and it's more about just getting outside

1926
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
and it's more about just getting outside
 

1927
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,430
and it's more about just getting outside
and getting away from the keyboard for

1928
00:32:59,430 --> 00:32:59,440
and getting away from the keyboard for
 

1929
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,630
and getting away from the keyboard for
some time just to let things compress

1930
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:02,640
some time just to let things compress
 

1931
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,230
some time just to let things compress
let's go into robotics a little bit what

1932
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:04,240
let's go into robotics a little bit what
 

1933
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,830
let's go into robotics a little bit what
to use the most beautiful idea in

1934
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:05,840
to use the most beautiful idea in
 

1935
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,669
to use the most beautiful idea in
robotics

1936
00:33:07,669 --> 00:33:07,679
robotics
 

1937
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,950
robotics
whether we're talking about control or

1938
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:10,960
whether we're talking about control or
 

1939
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,710
whether we're talking about control or
whether we're talking about optimization

1940
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:12,720
whether we're talking about optimization
 

1941
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,070
whether we're talking about optimization
the math side of things

1942
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:14,080
the math side of things
 

1943
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,630
the math side of things
or the engineering side of things or the

1944
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:16,640
or the engineering side of things or the
 

1945
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,310
or the engineering side of things or the
philosophical side of things

1946
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320

 

1947
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,950

i think i've been lucky to experience

1948
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
i think i've been lucky to experience
 

1949
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,310
i think i've been lucky to experience
something that

1950
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:24,320
something that
 

1951
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,590
something that
not so many roboticists have experienced

1952
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:27,600
not so many roboticists have experienced
 

1953
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,630
not so many roboticists have experienced
which is to hang out with

1954
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
which is to hang out with
 

1955
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,389
which is to hang out with
some really amazing control theorists

1956
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:34,399
some really amazing control theorists
 

1957
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,710
some really amazing control theorists
and uh

1958
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:38,720
and uh
 

1959
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,509
and uh
the clarity of thought that some of the

1960
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:41,519
the clarity of thought that some of the
 

1961
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,269
the clarity of thought that some of the
more mathematical control theory can

1962
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
more mathematical control theory can
 

1963
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,549
more mathematical control theory can
bring

1964
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:44,559
bring
 

1965
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,789
bring
to even very complex messy looking

1966
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:46,799
to even very complex messy looking
 

1967
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:49,430
to even very complex messy looking
problems

1968
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:49,440

 

1969
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,630

is really it really had a big impact on

1970
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:52,640
is really it really had a big impact on
 

1971
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,110
is really it really had a big impact on
me

1972
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,120
me
 

1973
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,789
me
and and uh i had a day even like

1974
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
and and uh i had a day even like
 

1975
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,310
and and uh i had a day even like
just a couple weeks ago where i had

1976
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
just a couple weeks ago where i had
 

1977
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,990
just a couple weeks ago where i had
spent the day on a zoom

1978
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:00,000
spent the day on a zoom
 

1979
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,509
spent the day on a zoom
robotics conference having great

1980
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
robotics conference having great
 

1981
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,750
robotics conference having great
conversations with lots of people

1982
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,760
conversations with lots of people
 

1983
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,789
conversations with lots of people
i felt really good about the ideas that

1984
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
i felt really good about the ideas that
 

1985
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,149
i felt really good about the ideas that
were flowing and

1986
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:08,159
were flowing and
 

1987
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,750
were flowing and
and the like and then i had a you know

1988
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:11,760
and the like and then i had a you know
 

1989
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,069
and the like and then i had a you know
late afternoon meeting with uh one of my

1990
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:14,079
late afternoon meeting with uh one of my
 

1991
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,909
late afternoon meeting with uh one of my
favorite control theorists and

1992
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:15,919
favorite control theorists and
 

1993
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,190
favorite control theorists and
um and we went from these

1994
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
um and we went from these
 

1995
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,430
um and we went from these
from these abstract discussions about

1996
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:21,440
from these abstract discussions about
 

1997
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,190
from these abstract discussions about
maybes and what-ifs and

1998
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:23,200
maybes and what-ifs and
 

1999
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,629
maybes and what-ifs and
and what a great idea to these super

2000
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:26,639
and what a great idea to these super
 

2001
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,470
and what a great idea to these super
precise

2002
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:28,480
precise
 

2003
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,190
precise
statements about systems that aren't

2004
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:31,200
statements about systems that aren't
 

2005
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,950
statements about systems that aren't
that much

2006
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:32,960
that much
 

2007
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,069
that much
more simple or or abstract than the ones

2008
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:36,079
more simple or or abstract than the ones
 

2009
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:36,950
more simple or or abstract than the ones
i care about

2010
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:36,960
i care about
 

2011
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,310
i care about
deeply and the contrast of that is

2012
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,320
deeply and the contrast of that is
 

2013
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,149
deeply and the contrast of that is
um i don't know it really gets me i

2014
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:44,159
um i don't know it really gets me i
 

2015
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,310
um i don't know it really gets me i
think

2016
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,320
think
 

2017
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,750
think
people underestimate um

2018
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
people underestimate um
 

2019
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,510
people underestimate um
maybe the power of clear thinking

2020
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
maybe the power of clear thinking
 

2021
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,869
maybe the power of clear thinking
and so for instance deep learning

2022
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
and so for instance deep learning
 

2023
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,470
and so for instance deep learning
is amazing um

2024
00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:00,480
is amazing um
 

2025
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,550
is amazing um
i use it heavily in our work i think

2026
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:02,560
i use it heavily in our work i think
 

2027
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,829
i use it heavily in our work i think
it's changed the world

2028
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
it's changed the world
 

2029
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,990
it's changed the world
unquestionable it makes it easy to get

2030
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:08,000
unquestionable it makes it easy to get
 

2031
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,470
unquestionable it makes it easy to get
things

2032
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:08,480
things
 

2033
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,069
things
to work without thinking as critically

2034
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
to work without thinking as critically
 

2035
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,190
to work without thinking as critically
about it so i think one of the

2036
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:11,200
about it so i think one of the
 

2037
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,349
about it so i think one of the
challenges as an educator

2038
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:13,359
challenges as an educator
 

2039
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,910
challenges as an educator
is to think about how do we make sure

2040
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
is to think about how do we make sure
 

2041
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,030
is to think about how do we make sure
people get a taste

2042
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
people get a taste
 

2043
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,150
people get a taste
of the more rigorous thinking that i

2044
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:20,160
of the more rigorous thinking that i
 

2045
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,349
of the more rigorous thinking that i
think

2046
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:21,359
think
 

2047
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,910
think
goes along uh with with some different

2048
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:23,920
goes along uh with with some different
 

2049
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:24,630
goes along uh with with some different
approaches

2050
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:24,640
approaches
 

2051
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,190
approaches
yeah so that's really interesting so

2052
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
yeah so that's really interesting so
 

2053
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,270
yeah so that's really interesting so
understanding like the fundamentals the

2054
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,280
understanding like the fundamentals the
 

2055
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,630
understanding like the fundamentals the
first principles of the of the

2056
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:32,640
first principles of the of the
 

2057
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,950
first principles of the of the
the the problem where in this case is

2058
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:34,960
the the problem where in this case is
 

2059
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,829
the the problem where in this case is
mechanics

2060
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
mechanics
 

2061
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,950
mechanics
like how a thing moves

2062
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
like how a thing moves
 

2063
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,349
like how a thing moves
how thing behaves like all the forces

2064
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
how thing behaves like all the forces
 

2065
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,310
how thing behaves like all the forces
involved

2066
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:42,320
involved
 

2067
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,990
involved
like really getting a deep understanding

2068
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
like really getting a deep understanding
 

2069
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,390
like really getting a deep understanding
of that i mean from physics the first

2070
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:46,400
of that i mean from physics the first
 

2071
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,190
of that i mean from physics the first
principle thing

2072
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
principle thing
 

2073
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,030
principle thing
come from physics and here it's

2074
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:49,040
come from physics and here it's
 

2075
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,990
come from physics and here it's
literally physics

2076
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
literally physics
 

2077
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,829
literally physics
yeah and this applies in deep learning

2078
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
yeah and this applies in deep learning
 

2079
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,990
yeah and this applies in deep learning
this applies to um

2080
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:56,000
this applies to um
 

2081
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,390
this applies to um
not just i mean it applies so cleanly in

2082
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:58,400
not just i mean it applies so cleanly in
 

2083
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,589
not just i mean it applies so cleanly in
in robotics but

2084
00:35:59,589 --> 00:35:59,599
in robotics but
 

2085
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,349
in robotics but
it also applies to just in any data set

2086
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:03,359
it also applies to just in any data set
 

2087
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,950
it also applies to just in any data set
i find this true i mean driving as well

2088
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:06,960
i find this true i mean driving as well
 

2089
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,270
i find this true i mean driving as well
there's a lot of folks in it that work

2090
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,280
there's a lot of folks in it that work
 

2091
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,829
there's a lot of folks in it that work
on autonomous vehicles

2092
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:11,839
on autonomous vehicles
 

2093
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:17,750
on autonomous vehicles
that don't study driving

2094
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760

 

2095
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,109

like deeply i i might be coming a little

2096
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
like deeply i i might be coming a little
 

2097
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,030
like deeply i i might be coming a little
bit from the psychology side

2098
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
bit from the psychology side
 

2099
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,230
bit from the psychology side
but i remember i spent

2100
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:26,240
but i remember i spent
 

2101
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,550
but i remember i spent
a ridiculous number of hours at lunch

2102
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
a ridiculous number of hours at lunch
 

2103
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,109
a ridiculous number of hours at lunch
at this like lawn chair and i would sit

2104
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
at this like lawn chair and i would sit
 

2105
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,390
at this like lawn chair and i would sit
somewhere

2106
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:34,400
somewhere
 

2107
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,990
somewhere
somewhere on mit's campus there's a few

2108
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
somewhere on mit's campus there's a few
 

2109
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,750
somewhere on mit's campus there's a few
interesting intersections and we just

2110
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,760
interesting intersections and we just
 

2111
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,190
interesting intersections and we just
watched people cross

2112
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:39,200
watched people cross
 

2113
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,150
watched people cross
so we were studying um pedestrian

2114
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
so we were studying um pedestrian
 

2115
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,109
so we were studying um pedestrian
behavior

2116
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
behavior
 

2117
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,589
behavior

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,430
should tell us the story but i think
there's a rigorous thinking

rigorous approaches and i wonder where

2228
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:39,119
rigorous approaches and i wonder where
 

2229
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,310
rigorous approaches and i wonder where
that takes us

that takes us

about it i just want to

2234
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
about it i just want to
 

2235
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,190
about it i just want to
do my part to try to steer that rigorous

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:47,200
do my part to try to steer that rigorous
 

2237
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:47,910
do my part to try to steer that rigorous

2239
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,390

so there's like two questions i want to

2240
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:50,400
so there's like two questions i want to
 

2241
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:50,950
so there's like two questions i want to
ask

2242
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:50,960
ask
 

2243
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,710
ask
do you have sort of a good example

2244
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:54,720
do you have sort of a good example
 

2245
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,589
do you have sort of a good example
of rigorous thinking where it's easy to

2246
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
of rigorous thinking where it's easy to
 

2247
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,030
of rigorous thinking where it's easy to
get lazy

2248
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
get lazy
 

2249
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,109
get lazy
and not do the rigorous thinking and the

2250
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
and not do the rigorous thinking and the
 

2251
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,550
and not do the rigorous thinking and the
other question i have is like do you

2252
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:02,560
other question i have is like do you
 

2253
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,109
other question i have is like do you
have advice

2254
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:05,119
have advice
 

2255
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,230
have advice
of um how to practice rigorous

2256
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:08,240
of um how to practice rigorous
 

2257
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,230
of um how to practice rigorous
thinking and um you know in all the

2258
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,240
thinking and um you know in all the
 

2259
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,069
thinking and um you know in all the
computer science disciplines that we've

2260
00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:14,079
computer science disciplines that we've
 

2261
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,230
computer science disciplines that we've

mentioned
 

2263
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:20,950
mentioned
yeah i mean there are times where

2264
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:20,960
yeah i mean there are times where
 

2265
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,470
yeah i mean there are times where
problems that can be solved with

problems that can be solved with
 

2267

problems that can be solved with
well-known mature methods

2268

well-known mature methods
 

2269
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,230
well-known mature methods
could also be solved with with a deep

00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,310

there's an argument that you must use

there's an argument that you must use
 

2277
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,750
there's an argument that you must use
learning even for the parts we already

00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:39,670
think we know because if the human has
touched it

2282
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:39,680
touched it
 

2283
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,310
touched it
then you've if you've biased the system

2284
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,320
then you've if you've biased the system
 

2285
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,870
then you've if you've biased the system
and you've

2286
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:42,880
and you've
 

2287
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,710
and you've
suddenly put a bottleneck in there that

2288
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:44,720
suddenly put a bottleneck in there that
 

2289
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,710
suddenly put a bottleneck in there that
is your own mental model but

2290
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:46,720
is your own mental model but
 

2291
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,470
is your own mental model but
something like inverting a matrix you

2292
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:48,480
something like inverting a matrix you
 

2293
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,230
something like inverting a matrix you
know i i think we know how to do that

2294
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,240
know i i think we know how to do that
 

2295
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,430
know i i think we know how to do that
pretty well even if it's a pretty big

2296
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:51,440
pretty well even if it's a pretty big
 

2297
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,790
pretty well even if it's a pretty big
matrix and we understand that pretty

2298
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:52,800
matrix and we understand that pretty
 

2299
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,430
matrix and we understand that pretty
well and

2300
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:53,440
well and
 

2301
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,950
well and
you could train a deep network to do it

2302
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
you could train a deep network to do it
 

2303
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,270
you could train a deep network to do it
but you shouldn't probably

2304
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:57,280
but you shouldn't probably
 

2305
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,910
but you shouldn't probably
so so in that sense rigorous thinking is

2306
00:39:59,910 --> 00:39:59,920
so so in that sense rigorous thinking is
 

2307
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,190
so so in that sense rigorous thinking is
uh

2308
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
uh
 

2309
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,150
uh
understanding the the scope and the

2310
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,160
understanding the the scope and the
 

2311
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,589
understanding the the scope and the
limitations of the mess

2312
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:05,599
limitations of the mess
 

2313
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,670
limitations of the mess
of the methods that we have like how to

2314
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:07,680
of the methods that we have like how to
 

2315
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,630
of the methods that we have like how to
use the tools

2316
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
use the tools
 

2317
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,670
use the tools
of mathematics properly yeah i think

2318
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:11,680
of mathematics properly yeah i think
 

2319
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,950
of mathematics properly yeah i think
you know taking a class on analysis

2320
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:14,960
you know taking a class on analysis
 

2321
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,270
you know taking a class on analysis
is all i'm sort of arguing is to take

2322
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,280
is all i'm sort of arguing is to take
 

2323
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,109
is all i'm sort of arguing is to take
take a chance to stop and

2324
00:40:19,109 --> 00:40:19,119
take a chance to stop and
 

2325
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,790
take a chance to stop and
and force yourself to think rigorously

2326
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
and force yourself to think rigorously
 

2327
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,230
and force yourself to think rigorously
about even

2328
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:22,240
about even
 

2329
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,309
about even
you know the rational numbers or

2330
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:24,319
you know the rational numbers or
 

2331
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:26,309
you know the rational numbers or
something you know it doesn't have to be

2332
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
something you know it doesn't have to be
 

2333
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,510
something you know it doesn't have to be
the end-all problem but that exercise of

2334
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:29,520
the end-all problem but that exercise of
 

2335
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,630
the end-all problem but that exercise of
clear thinking i think uh

2336
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:32,640
clear thinking i think uh
 

2337
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,069
clear thinking i think uh
goes a long way and i just want to make

2338
00:40:34,069 --> 00:40:34,079
goes a long way and i just want to make
 

2339
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,829
goes a long way and i just want to make
sure we we keep preaching don't lose it

2340
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
sure we we keep preaching don't lose it
 

2341
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:36,230
sure we we keep preaching don't lose it
yeah

2342
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
yeah
 

2343
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,550
yeah
but do you think uh when you're doing

2344
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:38,560
but do you think uh when you're doing
 

2345
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,030
but do you think uh when you're doing
like rigorous thinking or like maybe

2346
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:41,040
like rigorous thinking or like maybe
 

2347
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,470
like rigorous thinking or like maybe
uh trying to write down equations or

2348
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
uh trying to write down equations or
 

2349
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,470
uh trying to write down equations or
sort of explicitly like formally

2350
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:46,480
sort of explicitly like formally
 

2351
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,829
sort of explicitly like formally
describe a system

2352
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:47,839
describe a system
 

2353
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,589
describe a system
do you think we naturally simplify

2354
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:49,599
do you think we naturally simplify
 

2355
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,430
do you think we naturally simplify
things too much

2356
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:51,440
things too much
 

2357
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,470
things too much
is that a danger you run into like uh

2358
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:54,480
is that a danger you run into like uh
 

2359
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,750
is that a danger you run into like uh
in order to be able to understand

2360
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
in order to be able to understand
 

2361
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,790
in order to be able to understand
something about the system

2362
00:40:56,790 --> 00:40:56,800
something about the system
 

2363
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,150
something about the system
mathematically

2364
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
mathematically
 

2365
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,510
mathematically
we uh make it too much of a toy example

2366
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:01,520
we uh make it too much of a toy example
 

2367
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,510
we uh make it too much of a toy example
but i think that's the good stuff right

2368
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:03,520
but i think that's the good stuff right
 

2369
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,190
but i think that's the good stuff right
um that's how you understand the

2370
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,200
um that's how you understand the
 

2371
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,950
um that's how you understand the
fundamentals

2372
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:06,960
fundamentals
 

2373
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,430
fundamentals
i think so i think maybe even that's a

2374
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:09,440
i think so i think maybe even that's a
 

2375
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,670
i think so i think maybe even that's a
key to intelligence or something but

2376
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:11,680
key to intelligence or something but
 

2377
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,670
key to intelligence or something but
i mean okay what if newton and galileo

2378
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
i mean okay what if newton and galileo
 

2379
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,030
i mean okay what if newton and galileo
had deep learning

2380
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
had deep learning
 

2381
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,270
had deep learning
and and they had done a bunch of

2382
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
and and they had done a bunch of
 

2383
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,230
and and they had done a bunch of
experiments

2384
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
experiments
 

2385
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,710
experiments
and they told the world here's your

2386
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
and they told the world here's your
 

2387
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,309
and they told the world here's your
weights of your neural network i've

2388
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
weights of your neural network i've
 

2389
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,430
weights of your neural network i've
we've solved the problem

2390
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:23,440
we've solved the problem
 

2391
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,349
we've solved the problem
yeah you know where would we be today i

2392
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:25,359
yeah you know where would we be today i
 

2393
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:27,190
yeah you know where would we be today i
don't i don't think we'd be as far

2394
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:27,200
don't i don't think we'd be as far
 

2395
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,870
don't i don't think we'd be as far
as we as we are there's something to be

2396
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
as we as we are there's something to be
 

2397
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,230
as we as we are there's something to be
said about having a the simplest

2398
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:30,240
said about having a the simplest
 

2399
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,670
said about having a the simplest
explanation

2400
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
explanation
 

2401
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,270
explanation
for a phenomenon so i don't doubt that

2402
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:35,280
for a phenomenon so i don't doubt that
 

2403
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,910
for a phenomenon so i don't doubt that
we can train neural networks to predict

2404
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
we can train neural networks to predict
 

2405
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,630
we can train neural networks to predict
even

2406
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:38,640
even
 

2407
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,550
even
physical you know

2408
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560

 

2409
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,230

f equals m a type equations

2410
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:46,240
f equals m a type equations
 

2411
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,990
f equals m a type equations
but um i maybe

2412
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,000
but um i maybe
 

2413
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,750
but um i maybe
i want another newton to come along

2414
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
i want another newton to come along
 

2415
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,950
i want another newton to come along
because i think there's more to do in

2416
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:52,960
because i think there's more to do in
 

2417
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,230
because i think there's more to do in
terms of

2418
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:54,240
terms of
 

2419
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,430
terms of
coming up with the simple models for

2420
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:57,440
coming up with the simple models for
 

2421
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,109
coming up with the simple models for
more complicated tasks yeah uh

2422
00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:01,119
more complicated tasks yeah uh
 

2423
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,750
more complicated tasks yeah uh
let's not offend the ai systems from 50

2424
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
let's not offend the ai systems from 50
 

2425
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,550
let's not offend the ai systems from 50
years from

2426
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:04,560
years from
 

2427
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,790
years from
now that are listening to this that are

2428
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:06,800
now that are listening to this that are
 

2429
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,309
now that are listening to this that are
probably better at

2430
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
probably better at
 

2431
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,950
probably better at
might be better coming up with f equals

2432
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:10,960
might be better coming up with f equals
 

2433
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,950
might be better coming up with f equals
m a equations themselves

2434
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:12,960
m a equations themselves
 

2435
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,510
m a equations themselves
so sorry i actually think um learning is

2436
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:15,520
so sorry i actually think um learning is
 

2437
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,790
so sorry i actually think um learning is
probably a route

2438
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:16,800
probably a route
 

2439
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,150
probably a route
to achieving this but the representation

2440
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
to achieving this but the representation
 

2441
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,870
to achieving this but the representation
matters

2442
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880

i think we're we're learning that that
was that the

incredibly complex not because

00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:22,480

 

2503
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,550

actually not so much because of the

actually not so much because of the
 

2505
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,550
actually not so much because of the

but it's just the interactions and when

they turn on and off
right so having a high dimensional you

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:32,880
right so having a high dimensional you
 

2513
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,829
right so having a high dimensional you
know but

2514
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:33,839
know but

there
 

2535
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,710
there
then that's too complex so i need to

2536
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:54,720
then that's too complex so i need to
 

2537
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,630
then that's too complex so i need to
somehow summarize that with a

somehow summarize that with a
 

2539
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,069
somehow summarize that with a
more intuitive physics

get us there

2546
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
get us there
 

2547
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,150
get us there
first of all i mean i'll probably do it

2548
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
first of all i mean i'll probably do it
 

2549
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,550
first of all i mean i'll probably do it
in the introduction but you're

2550
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:10,560
in the introduction but you're
 

2551
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,790
in the introduction but you're
one of the great robotics people at mit

2552
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:12,800
one of the great robotics people at mit
 

2553
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,230
one of the great robotics people at mit
you're a professor at mit

2554
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:14,240
you're a professor at mit
 

2555
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,910
you're a professor at mit
you've teach them a lot of amazing

2556
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:15,920
you've teach them a lot of amazing
 

2557
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,349
you've teach them a lot of amazing
courses you

2558
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:17,359
courses you
 

2559
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:20,710
courses you
run a large group and you have a

2560
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:20,720
run a large group and you have a
 

2561
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:23,270
run a large group and you have a
important history for mit i think as

2562
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:23,280
important history for mit i think as
 

2563
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,109
important history for mit i think as
being a part of the darpa robotics

2564
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:25,119
being a part of the darpa robotics
 

2565
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,230
being a part of the darpa robotics
challenge

2566
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
challenge
 

2567
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,030
challenge
can you maybe first say what is the dark

2568
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
can you maybe first say what is the dark
 

2569
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,510
can you maybe first say what is the dark
robotics challenge and then

2570
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:31,520
robotics challenge and then
 

2571
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,190
robotics challenge and then
tell your story around it your journey

2572
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:35,200
tell your story around it your journey
 

2573
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,109
tell your story around it your journey
with it yeah sure um

2574
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:39,119
with it yeah sure um
 

2575
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,510
with it yeah sure um
so the darpa robotics challenge it came

2576
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:41,520
so the darpa robotics challenge it came
 

2577
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,829
so the darpa robotics challenge it came
on the tales of the darpa

2578
00:44:43,829 --> 00:44:43,839
on the tales of the darpa
 

2579
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,349
on the tales of the darpa
grand challenge and darpa urban

grand challenge and darpa urban
 

2581
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:47,030
grand challenge and darpa urban
challenge which were the

2582
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
challenge which were the
 

2583
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,829
challenge which were the
challenges that brought us put a

2584
00:44:49,829 --> 00:44:49,839
challenges that brought us put a
 

2585
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,069
challenges that brought us put a
spotlight on self-driving

2586
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
spotlight on self-driving
 

2587
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,270

cars

2588
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:55,280

 

2589
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,349

guild pratt was at darpa and

2590
00:44:59,349 --> 00:44:59,359
guild pratt was at darpa and
 

2591
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:02,150
guild pratt was at darpa and
pitched a new challenge that involved

2592
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,160
pitched a new challenge that involved
 

2593
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,870
pitched a new challenge that involved
disaster response

2594
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:04,880
disaster response
 

2595
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,030
disaster response
it didn't explicitly require humanoids

2596
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:07,040
it didn't explicitly require humanoids
 

2597
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,150
it didn't explicitly require humanoids
although humanoids came into the picture

2598
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:10,160
although humanoids came into the picture
 

2599
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,589
although humanoids came into the picture
this happened shortly after the

2600
00:45:11,589 --> 00:45:11,599
this happened shortly after the
 

2601
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,270
this happened shortly after the
fukushima disaster

2602
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:13,280
fukushima disaster
 

2603
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,550
fukushima disaster
in japan and our challenge was motivated

2604
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
in japan and our challenge was motivated
 

2605
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,589
in japan and our challenge was motivated
roughly by that

2606
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:17,599
roughly by that
 

2607
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:20,390
roughly by that
because that was a case where if we had

2608
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:20,400
because that was a case where if we had
 

2609
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,550
because that was a case where if we had
had robots that were ready to be sent in

2610
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:22,560
had robots that were ready to be sent in
 

2611
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,950
had robots that were ready to be sent in
there's a chance that we could have

2612
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:24,960
there's a chance that we could have
 

2613
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,470
there's a chance that we could have
averted disaster

2614
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
averted disaster
 

2615
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,349
averted disaster
and certainly after the um in the

2616
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:29,359
and certainly after the um in the
 

2617
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:30,470
and certainly after the um in the
disaster response

2618
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:30,480
disaster response
 

2619
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,910
disaster response
there were times we would love we would

2620
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
there were times we would love we would
 

2621
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,550
there were times we would love we would
have loved to have sent robots in

2622
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:34,560
have loved to have sent robots in
 

2623
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,470
have loved to have sent robots in
so in practice what we ended up with was

2624
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
so in practice what we ended up with was
 

2625
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,069
so in practice what we ended up with was
a

humanoids in order to compete in
 

2651
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,870
humanoids in order to compete in
the the final challenge which was a

2652
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
the the final challenge which was a
 

2653
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,390
the the final challenge which was a
physical challenge

2654

physical challenge
 

2655
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,470
physical challenge
and at that point it was already so it

2656
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:10,480
and at that point it was already so it
 

2657
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,270
and at that point it was already so it
was decided as humanoid robots

2658
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
was decided as humanoid robots
 

2659
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,030
was decided as humanoid robots
there were there were two tracks there

2660
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:15,040
there were there were two tracks there
 

2661
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,870
there were there were two tracks there
you could enter as a hardware team where

00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
you could enter as a hardware team where
 

2663
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,309
you could enter as a hardware team where
you brought your own robot

that would try to win the right to use

2670
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:24,400
that would try to win the right to use
 

2671
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,069
that would try to win the right to use
one of the boston dynamics robots which

2672
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,079
one of the boston dynamics robots which
 

2673
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:26,710
one of the boston dynamics robots which
are called

2674
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
are called
 

2675
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:29,030
are called
atlas atlas humanoid robots yeah it was

2676
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,040
atlas atlas humanoid robots yeah it was
 

2677
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,790
atlas atlas humanoid robots yeah it was
a 400-pound

2678
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:30,800
a 400-pound
 

2679
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,349
a 400-pound
marvel but a you know pretty big scary

2680
00:46:33,349 --> 00:46:33,359
marvel but a you know pretty big scary
 

2681
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:33,829
marvel but a you know pretty big scary
looking

2682
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:33,839
looking
 

2683
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:37,109
looking
robot expensive too expensive at the

2684
00:46:37,109 --> 00:46:37,119
robot expensive too expensive at the
 

2685
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,150
robot expensive too expensive at the
time yeah

2686
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
time yeah
 

2687
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,150
time yeah
okay so uh i mean how did you feel

2688
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:42,160
okay so uh i mean how did you feel
 

2689
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,069
okay so uh i mean how did you feel
at the prospect of this kind of

2690
00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:44,079
at the prospect of this kind of
 

2691
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,790
at the prospect of this kind of
challenge i mean it seems

2692
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:46,800
challenge i mean it seems
 

2693
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,270
challenge i mean it seems
you know autonomous vehicles yeah i

2694
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:49,280
you know autonomous vehicles yeah i
 

2695
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:50,950
you know autonomous vehicles yeah i
guess that sounds hard

2696
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:50,960
guess that sounds hard
 

2697
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,270
guess that sounds hard
but uh not really from a robotics

2698
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
but uh not really from a robotics
 

2699
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,630
but uh not really from a robotics
perspective it's like

2700
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
perspective it's like
 

2701
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,390
perspective it's like
didn't they do in the 80s is the kind of

2702
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:56,400
didn't they do in the 80s is the kind of
 

2703
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,150
didn't they do in the 80s is the kind of
feeling i would have

2704
00:46:58,150 --> 00:46:58,160
feeling i would have
 

2705
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,990
feeling i would have
uh like when you first look at the

2706
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:00,000
uh like when you first look at the
 

2707
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,750
uh like when you first look at the
problem it's on wheels

2708
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:01,760
problem it's on wheels
 

2709
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,790
problem it's on wheels
but like humanoid robots

2710
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
but like humanoid robots
 

2711
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,069
but like humanoid robots
that sounds really hard

2712
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
that sounds really hard
 

2713
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,589
that sounds really hard
so what like what are your the

2714
00:47:11,589 --> 00:47:11,599
so what like what are your the
 

2715
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,270
so what like what are your the
psychologically speaking what were you

2716
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
psychologically speaking what were you
 

2717
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,710
psychologically speaking what were you
feeling excited

2718
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:14,720
feeling excited
 

2719
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:17,430
feeling excited
scared why the heck did you get yourself

2720
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
scared why the heck did you get yourself
 

2721
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,710
scared why the heck did you get yourself
involved in this kind of

2722
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:18,720
involved in this kind of
 

2723
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,109
involved in this kind of
messy challenge we didn't really know

2724
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:21,119
messy challenge we didn't really know
 

2725
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:21,829
messy challenge we didn't really know
for sure

2726
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
for sure
 

2727
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,950
for sure
what we were signing up for in the sense

2728
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
what we were signing up for in the sense
 

2729
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,710
what we were signing up for in the sense
that you could have something that

2730
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:26,720
that you could have something that
 

2731
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,870
that you could have something that
as it was described in the call for

2732
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:28,880
as it was described in the call for
 

2733
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,630
as it was described in the call for
participation

2734
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
participation
 

2735
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,190
participation
that could have put a huge emphasis on

2736
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:33,200
that could have put a huge emphasis on
 

2737
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,630
that could have put a huge emphasis on
the dynamics of walking

2738
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:34,640
the dynamics of walking
 

2739
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,150
the dynamics of walking
and not falling down and walking over

2740
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
and not falling down and walking over
 

2741
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,390
and not falling down and walking over
rough terrain or the same description

2742
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
rough terrain or the same description
 

2743
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:39,750
rough terrain or the same description
because the robot had to go into this

2744
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
because the robot had to go into this
 

2745
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,349
because the robot had to go into this
disaster area and

2746
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:41,359
disaster area and
 

2747
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,549
disaster area and
turn valves and and pick up a drill

2748
00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:44,559
turn valves and and pick up a drill
 

2749
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,990
turn valves and and pick up a drill
cut the hole through a wall it had to do

2750
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
cut the hole through a wall it had to do
 

2751
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,230
cut the hole through a wall it had to do
some interesting things

2752
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
some interesting things
 

2753
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,390
some interesting things
the challenge could have really

2754
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:50,400
the challenge could have really
 

2755
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:52,549
the challenge could have really
highlighted perception and

2756
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:52,559
highlighted perception and
 

2757
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:56,549
highlighted perception and
autonomous planning or it ended up

2758
00:47:56,549 --> 00:47:56,559
autonomous planning or it ended up
 

2759
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,910
autonomous planning or it ended up
that you know locomoting over a complex

2760
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
that you know locomoting over a complex
 

2761
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,710
that you know locomoting over a complex
terrain played a pretty big role in the

2762
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:02,720
terrain played a pretty big role in the
 

2763
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,910
terrain played a pretty big role in the
competition

2764
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:03,920
competition
 

2765
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,030
competition
so and the degree of autonomy wasn't

2766
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
so and the degree of autonomy wasn't
 

2767
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,230
so and the degree of autonomy wasn't
clear

2768
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:08,240
clear
 

2769
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,990
clear
the decree of autonomy was always a

2770
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
the decree of autonomy was always a
 

2771
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,910
the decree of autonomy was always a
central part of the discussion

2772
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
central part of the discussion
 

2773
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,030
central part of the discussion
so um what wasn't clear was how we would

2774
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:15,040
so um what wasn't clear was how we would
 

2775
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,710
so um what wasn't clear was how we would
be able how far we'd be able to get with

2776
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:16,720
be able how far we'd be able to get with
 

2777
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,430
be able how far we'd be able to get with
it

2778
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:17,440
it
 

2779
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,150
it
so the idea was always that you want

2780
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:20,160
so the idea was always that you want
 

2781
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,510
so the idea was always that you want
semi-autonomy

2782
00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:21,520
semi-autonomy
 

2783
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,750
semi-autonomy
that you want the robot to have enough

2784
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
that you want the robot to have enough
 

2785
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,510
that you want the robot to have enough
compute that you can have a degraded

2786
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
compute that you can have a degraded
 

2787
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,870
compute that you can have a degraded
network link to a human and so the same

2788
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:28,880
network link to a human and so the same
 

2789
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,549
network link to a human and so the same
way you we had degraded networks

2790
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:30,559
way you we had degraded networks
 

2791
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:33,430
way you we had degraded networks
at many natural disasters you'd send

2792
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:33,440
at many natural disasters you'd send
 

2793
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,870
at many natural disasters you'd send
your robot in

2794
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:34,880
your robot in
 

2795
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,109
your robot in
you'd be able to get a few bits back and

2796
00:48:37,109 --> 00:48:37,119
you'd be able to get a few bits back and
 

2797
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,790
you'd be able to get a few bits back and
forth but you don't get to have enough

2798
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
forth but you don't get to have enough
 

2799
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,470
forth but you don't get to have enough
potentially to fully

2800
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,480
potentially to fully
 

2801
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,630
potentially to fully
uh operate the robot in every joint of

2802
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,640
uh operate the robot in every joint of
 

2803
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,549
uh operate the robot in every joint of
the robot

2804
00:48:44,549 --> 00:48:44,559
the robot
 

2805
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:46,309
the robot
so and then the question was and the

2806
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:46,319
so and then the question was and the
 

2807
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:48,069
so and then the question was and the
gamesmanship of the

2808
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
gamesmanship of the
 

2809
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,829
gamesmanship of the
organizers was to figure out what we're

2810
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:49,839
organizers was to figure out what we're
 

2811
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,470
organizers was to figure out what we're
capable of push us as far as we could

2812
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:52,480
capable of push us as far as we could
 

2813
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,870
capable of push us as far as we could
so that um it would differentiate the

2814
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
so that um it would differentiate the
 

2815
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:55,670
so that um it would differentiate the
teams that

2816
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:55,680
teams that
 

2817
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,390
teams that
put more autonomy on the robot and had a

2818
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
put more autonomy on the robot and had a
 

2819
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,910
put more autonomy on the robot and had a
few clicks and just said go there do

2820
00:48:59,910 --> 00:48:59,920
few clicks and just said go there do
 

2821
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:01,349
few clicks and just said go there do
this go there do this versus someone

2822
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:01,359
this go there do this versus someone
 

2823
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,390
this go there do this versus someone
who's picking

2824
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:02,400
who's picking
 

2825
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,710
who's picking
every footstep or something like that so

2826
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
every footstep or something like that so
 

2827
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,710
every footstep or something like that so
what were some memories

2828
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:10,720
what were some memories
 

2829
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,510
what were some memories
painful triumphant from the experience

2830
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,520
painful triumphant from the experience
 

2831
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,430
painful triumphant from the experience
like what was that journey maybe

2832
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
like what was that journey maybe
 

2833
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,829
like what was that journey maybe
if you can dig in a little deeper maybe

2834
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:17,839
if you can dig in a little deeper maybe
 

2835
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:19,829
if you can dig in a little deeper maybe
even on the technical side and the team

2836
00:49:19,829 --> 00:49:19,839
even on the technical side and the team
 

2837
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,069
even on the technical side and the team
side that that whole process of um

2838
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:24,079
side that that whole process of um
 

2839
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,710
side that that whole process of um
from the early idea stages to actually

2840
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:26,720
from the early idea stages to actually
 

2841
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,069
from the early idea stages to actually
competing

2842
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:28,079
competing
 

2843
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,910
competing
i mean this was a defining experience

2844
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:29,920
i mean this was a defining experience
 

2845
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,510
i mean this was a defining experience
for me i i

2846
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
for me i i
 

2847
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,190
for me i i
it was it came at the right time for me

2848
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:33,200
it was it came at the right time for me
 

2849
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,190
it was it came at the right time for me
in my career i had gotten tenure before

2850
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:35,200
in my career i had gotten tenure before
 

2851
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,990
in my career i had gotten tenure before
i was

2852
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:36,000
i was
 

2853
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,309
i was
do a sabbatical and most people do

2854
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:38,319
do a sabbatical and most people do
 

2855
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:39,030
do a sabbatical and most people do
something you know

2856
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:39,040
something you know
 

2857
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,030
something you know
relaxing and restorative for a

2858
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
relaxing and restorative for a
 

2859
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,349
relaxing and restorative for a
sabbatical so you got tenure before the

2860
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:43,359
sabbatical so you got tenure before the
 

2861
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,470
sabbatical so you got tenure before the
the before this yeah yeah yeah it was a

2862
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:46,480
the before this yeah yeah yeah it was a
 

2863
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,190
the before this yeah yeah yeah it was a
good time for me

2864
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:47,200
good time for me
 

2865
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,109
good time for me
i had i had we had a bunch of algorithms

2866
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:49,119
i had i had we had a bunch of algorithms
 

2867
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,190
i had i had we had a bunch of algorithms
that we were very happy with we wanted

2868
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:51,200
that we were very happy with we wanted
 

2869
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,470
that we were very happy with we wanted
to see how far we could push them and

2870
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,480
to see how far we could push them and
 

2871
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,990
to see how far we could push them and
this was a chance to really test our

2872
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:54,000
this was a chance to really test our
 

2873
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:54,710
this was a chance to really test our
metal

2874
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:54,720
metal
 

2875
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,910
metal
to do more proper software engineering

2876
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:57,920
to do more proper software engineering
 

2877
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,950
to do more proper software engineering
the team we all just worked our butts

2878
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:00,960
the team we all just worked our butts
 

2879
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:01,349
the team we all just worked our butts
off

2880
00:50:01,349 --> 00:50:01,359
off

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,230
off
we you know we're in that lab almost all

2882
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:04,240
we you know we're in that lab almost all
 

2883
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:07,510
we you know we're in that lab almost all
the time

2885
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,670

okay so i mean there were some of course

2886
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:09,680
okay so i mean there were some of course
 

2887
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,950
okay so i mean there were some of course
high highs and low lows

2888
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:10,960
high highs and low lows
 

2889
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,030
high highs and low lows
throughout that anytime you're you know

2890
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:13,040
throughout that anytime you're you know
 

2891
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,150
throughout that anytime you're you know
not sleeping and

2892
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,160
not sleeping and
 

2893
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,670
not sleeping and
devoting your life to a 400 pound

humanoid um
 

2897
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,549
humanoid um
i remember actually one funny moment

2898
00:50:20,549 --> 00:50:20,559
i remember actually one funny moment
 

2899
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,710
i remember actually one funny moment
where we're all super tired and

2900
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
where we're all super tired and
 

2901
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,309
where we're all super tired and
so atlas had to walk across cinder

2902
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
so atlas had to walk across cinder
 

2903
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,309
so atlas had to walk across cinder
blocks that was one of the obstacles

2904
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
blocks that was one of the obstacles
 

2905
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,150
blocks that was one of the obstacles
and i remember atlas was powered down

2906
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:28,160
and i remember atlas was powered down
 

2907
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,230
and i remember atlas was powered down
and hanging limp you know on the on its

2908
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:30,240
and hanging limp you know on the on its
 

2909
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,190
and hanging limp you know on the on its
harness

2910
00:50:31,190 --> 00:50:31,200
harness
 

2911
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,870
harness
and the the humans were there like

2912
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:32,880
and the the humans were there like
 

2913
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,309
and the the humans were there like
laying you know picking up and laying

2914
00:50:34,309 --> 00:50:34,319
laying you know picking up and laying
 

2915
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,829
laying you know picking up and laying
the brick down so that the robot could

2916
00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:35,839
the brick down so that the robot could
 

2917
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:37,430
the brick down so that the robot could
walk over it and i thought what is wrong

2918
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:37,440
walk over it and i thought what is wrong
 

2919
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,710
walk over it and i thought what is wrong
with this you know we've got a robot

2920
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:40,720
with this you know we've got a robot
 

2921
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:42,390
with this you know we've got a robot
just watching us do all the manual labor

2922
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:42,400
just watching us do all the manual labor
 

2923
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,150
just watching us do all the manual labor
so that it can take its little

2924
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
so that it can take its little
 

2925
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,670
so that it can take its little
um stroll across the train but

2926
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680

 

2927
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,270

i mean even the even the virtual

2928
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
i mean even the even the virtual
 

2929
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,870
i mean even the even the virtual
robotics challenge was was

2930
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:52,880
robotics challenge was was
 

2931
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,950
robotics challenge was was
super nerve-wracking and dramatic i

2932
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:54,960
super nerve-wracking and dramatic i
 

2933
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:55,910
super nerve-wracking and dramatic i
remember

2934
00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:55,920
remember
 

2935
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:00,230
remember
um so so we were using gazebo as a

2936
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:00,240
um so so we were using gazebo as a
 

2937
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,109
um so so we were using gazebo as a
simulator

2938
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:01,119
simulator
 

2939
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:03,030
simulator
uh on the cloud there was all these

2940
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,040
uh on the cloud there was all these
 

2941
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,230
uh on the cloud there was all these
interesting challenges i think

2942
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:04,240
interesting challenges i think
 

2943
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,990
interesting challenges i think
um the investment that that osrs

2944
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
um the investment that that osrs
 

2945
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,670
um the investment that that osrs
fc whatever they were called at that

2946
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:09,680
fc whatever they were called at that
 

2947
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:11,510
fc whatever they were called at that

robotics

2950
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:12,640
robotics
 

2951
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,270
robotics
um they were pushing on the capabilities

2952
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,280
um they were pushing on the capabilities
 

2953
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,190
um they were pushing on the capabilities
of gazebo in order to scale it to the

2954
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:17,200
of gazebo in order to scale it to the
 

2955
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,470
of gazebo in order to scale it to the
complexity

2956
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:18,480
complexity
 

2957
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,670
complexity
of these challenges so um

2958
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:21,680
of these challenges so um
 

2959
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,750
of these challenges so um
you know up to the virtual competition

2960
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:23,760
you know up to the virtual competition
 

2961
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,670
you know up to the virtual competition
so the virtual competition

2962
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:25,680
so the virtual competition
 

2963
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,309
so the virtual competition
was you will sign on at a certain time

2964
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:28,319
was you will sign on at a certain time
 

2965
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:29,910
was you will sign on at a certain time
and we'll have a network connection to

2966
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:29,920
and we'll have a network connection to
 

2967
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,390
and we'll have a network connection to
another

2968
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,400
another
 

2969
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,710
another
machine on the cloud that is running the

2970
00:51:32,710 --> 00:51:32,720
machine on the cloud that is running the
 

2971
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,790
machine on the cloud that is running the
simulator of your robot

2972
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
simulator of your robot
 

2973
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,630
simulator of your robot
and your controller will run on this

2974
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:36,640
and your controller will run on this
 

2975
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:39,109
and your controller will run on this
this controller this computer and and

2976
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
this controller this computer and and
 

2977
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,870
this controller this computer and and
the physics will run on the other and

2978
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
the physics will run on the other and
 

2979
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,950
the physics will run on the other and
you have to connect

2980
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:42,960
you have to connect
 

2981
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:46,630
you have to connect
now um the physics they wanted it to run

2982
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
now um the physics they wanted it to run
 

2983
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,990
now um the physics they wanted it to run
at real-time rates

2984
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
at real-time rates
 

2985
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,750
at real-time rates
because there was an element of human

2986
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:49,760
because there was an element of human
 

2987
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,589
because there was an element of human
interaction um and humans

2988
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:51,599
interaction um and humans
 

2989
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,270
interaction um and humans
could if you do want to tell the op it

2990
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
could if you do want to tell the op it
 

2991
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,950
could if you do want to tell the op it
works way better if it's at

2992
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:54,960
works way better if it's at
 

2993
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,990
works way better if it's at
frame rate oh cool but it was very hard

2994
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
frame rate oh cool but it was very hard
 

2995
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,430
frame rate oh cool but it was very hard
to simulate these

2996
00:51:59,430 --> 00:51:59,440
to simulate these
 

2997
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,309
to simulate these
comple these complex scenes at real-time

2998
00:52:02,309 --> 00:52:02,319
comple these complex scenes at real-time
 

2999
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:03,109
comple these complex scenes at real-time
rate

3000
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:03,119
rate
 

3001
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,109
rate
so right up to like days before the

3002
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:05,119
so right up to like days before the
 

3003
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:06,390
so right up to like days before the
competition

3004
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
competition
 

3005
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,430
competition
the the simulator wasn't quite

3006
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:09,440
the the simulator wasn't quite
 

3007
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,750
the the simulator wasn't quite
at real time rate and that was great for

3008
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:11,760
at real time rate and that was great for
 

3009
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,670
at real time rate and that was great for
me because my controller was solving a

3010
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:13,680
me because my controller was solving a
 

3011
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,150
me because my controller was solving a
big pretty big optimization problem

3012
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
big pretty big optimization problem
 

3013
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,829
big pretty big optimization problem
and it wasn't quite at real-time rate so

3014
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:17,839
and it wasn't quite at real-time rate so
 

3015
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,750
and it wasn't quite at real-time rate so
i was fine i was keeping up with the

3016
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:19,760
i was fine i was keeping up with the
 

3017
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,349
i was fine i was keeping up with the
simulator we were both running at about

3018
00:52:21,349 --> 00:52:21,359
simulator we were both running at about
 

3019
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:22,710
simulator we were both running at about
0.7

3020
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:22,720
0.7
 

3021
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:25,109
0.7
and i remember getting this email and by

3022
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:25,119
and i remember getting this email and by
 

3023
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:26,069
and i remember getting this email and by
the way the perception

3024
00:52:26,069 --> 00:52:26,079
the way the perception
 

3025
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,030
the way the perception
folks on our team hated that that they

3026
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:29,040
folks on our team hated that that they
 

3027
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,270
folks on our team hated that that they
knew that if my controller was too slow

3028
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
knew that if my controller was too slow
 

3029
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,870
knew that if my controller was too slow
the robot was going to fall down and and

3030
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:32,880
the robot was going to fall down and and
 

3031
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,829
the robot was going to fall down and and
you know no matter how good their

3032
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:33,839
you know no matter how good their
 

3033
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:35,510
you know no matter how good their
perception system was if i can't make my

3034
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:35,520
perception system was if i can't make my
 

3035
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,790
perception system was if i can't make my
controller fast

3036
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:36,800
controller fast
 

3037
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:38,309
controller fast
anyways we get this email like three

3038
00:52:38,309 --> 00:52:38,319
anyways we get this email like three
 

3039
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,150
anyways we get this email like three
days before the virtual competition well

3040
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:40,160
days before the virtual competition well
 

3041
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,430
days before the virtual competition well
you know it's for all the marbles we're

3042
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
you know it's for all the marbles we're
 

3043
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,030
you know it's for all the marbles we're
going to either get a humanoid robot

3044
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:43,040
going to either get a humanoid robot
 

3045
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,670
going to either get a humanoid robot
or we're not and we get an email saying

3046
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:45,680
or we're not and we get an email saying
 

3047
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,309
or we're not and we get an email saying
good news

3048
00:52:46,309 --> 00:52:46,319
good news
 

3049
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:47,990
good news
we made the robot does the simulator

3050
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
we made the robot does the simulator
 

3051
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,470
we made the robot does the simulator
faster it's now one point

3052
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:50,480
faster it's now one point
 

3053
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,829
faster it's now one point
and uh yeah we're i was just like oh man

3054
00:52:53,829 --> 00:52:53,839
and uh yeah we're i was just like oh man
 

3055
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:55,030
and uh yeah we're i was just like oh man
what are we going to do here so

3056
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
what are we going to do here so
 

3057
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,309
what are we going to do here so
yeah that came in late at night for me

3058
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
yeah that came in late at night for me
 

3059
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:01,349
yeah that came in late at night for me
um a few days ahead a few days ahead

3060
00:53:01,349 --> 00:53:01,359
um a few days ahead a few days ahead
 

3061
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:03,030
um a few days ahead a few days ahead
i went over there was it happened that

3062
00:53:03,030 --> 00:53:03,040
i went over there was it happened that
 

3063
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:04,710
i went over there was it happened that
frank permentor who's a

3064
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:04,720
frank permentor who's a
 

3065
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,349
frank permentor who's a
a very very sharp he's a he was a

3066
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:07,359
a very very sharp he's a he was a
 

3067
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,630
a very very sharp he's a he was a
student at the time

3068
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
student at the time
 

3069
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,430
student at the time
working on optimization was he was still

3070
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
working on optimization was he was still
 

3071
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,390
working on optimization was he was still
in lab

3072
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:12,400
in lab
 

3073
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,670
in lab
uh frank we need to make this quadratic

3074
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:15,680
uh frank we need to make this quadratic
 

3075
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,270
uh frank we need to make this quadratic
programming solver faster

3076
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
programming solver faster
 

3077
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,870
programming solver faster
not like a little faster it's actually

3078
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:18,880
not like a little faster it's actually
 

3079
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,870
not like a little faster it's actually
you know um

3080
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:20,880
you know um
 

3081
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,870
you know um
and we wrote a new solver for that qp

3082
00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:24,880
and we wrote a new solver for that qp
 

3083
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,990
and we wrote a new solver for that qp
together that night

3084
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:28,000
together that night
 

3085
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,750
together that night
and you start terrifying so there's a

3086
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
and you start terrifying so there's a
 

3087
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,750
and you start terrifying so there's a
really hard optimization problem

3088
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:31,760
really hard optimization problem
 

3089
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:34,549
really hard optimization problem
that you're constantly solving you

3090
00:53:34,549 --> 00:53:34,559
that you're constantly solving you
 

3091
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:36,069
that you're constantly solving you
didn't make the optimization problem

00:53:36,069 --> 00:53:36,079
didn't make the optimization problem
 

3093
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:36,790
didn't make the optimization problem
simpler

3094
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
simpler
 

3095
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,150
simpler
you you wrote any solver so um i mean

3096
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:40,160
you you wrote any solver so um i mean
 

3097
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,710
you you wrote any solver so um i mean
your observation is almost spot on well

3098
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:42,720
your observation is almost spot on well
 

3099
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:43,349
your observation is almost spot on well
what we

3100
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:43,359
what we
 

3101
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,870
what we
did was what everybody i mean people

3102
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:44,880
did was what everybody i mean people
 

3103
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:46,710
did was what everybody i mean people
know how to do this but we had not yet

3104
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
know how to do this but we had not yet
 

3105
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,510
know how to do this but we had not yet
done

3106
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:47,520
done
 

3107
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,510
done
this idea of warm starting so we are

3108
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:49,520
this idea of warm starting so we are
 

3109
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,190
this idea of warm starting so we are
solving a big optimization problem

3110
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:51,200
solving a big optimization problem
 

3111
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,190
solving a big optimization problem
at every time step but if you're running

3112
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:53,200
at every time step but if you're running
 

3113
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,109
at every time step but if you're running
fast enough the optimization problem

3114
00:53:55,109 --> 00:53:55,119
fast enough the optimization problem
 

3115
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:55,990
fast enough the optimization problem
you're solving on the last

3116
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,000
you're solving on the last
 

3117
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,069
you're solving on the last
time step is pretty similar to the

3118
00:53:58,069 --> 00:53:58,079
time step is pretty similar to the
 

3119
00:53:58,079 --> 00:53:59,109
time step is pretty similar to the

3124
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:01,839
we had course had told our commercial
 

3125
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,430
we had course had told our commercial

solver to use warm starting
 

3127
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,990
solver to use warm starting
but even the interface to that

00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:06,000
but even the interface to that

commercial solver
 

3131
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,150
commercial solver
was causing us these delays so what we

3132
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:10,160
was causing us these delays so what we
 

3133
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,630
was causing us these delays so what we
did

3134
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:10,640
did
 

3135
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,109
did
was we basically wrote we called it

3136
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
was we basically wrote we called it
 

3137
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:15,190
was we basically wrote we called it
fastqp at the time

3138
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:15,200
fastqp at the time
 

3139
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,430
fastqp at the time
we wrote a very lightweight very fast

3140
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,440
we wrote a very lightweight very fast
 

3141
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,390
we wrote a very lightweight very fast
layer

3142
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
layer
 

3143
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,430
layer
which would basically check if nearby

3144
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
which would basically check if nearby
 

3145
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,750
which would basically check if nearby
solutions to the quadratic program

3146
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:23,760
solutions to the quadratic program
 

3147
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,470
solutions to the quadratic program
were which were very easily checked uh

3148
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:26,480
were which were very easily checked uh
 

3149
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,829
were which were very easily checked uh
could stabilize the robot

3150
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
could stabilize the robot
 

3151
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,190
could stabilize the robot
and if they couldn't we would fall back

3152
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
and if they couldn't we would fall back
 

3153
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,510
and if they couldn't we would fall back
to the solver you couldn't really test

3154
00:54:31,510 --> 00:54:31,520
to the solver you couldn't really test
 

3155
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,309
to the solver you couldn't really test
this well right

3156
00:54:32,309 --> 00:54:32,319
this well right
 

3157
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:36,069
this well right
um or like i mean so we always knew that

3158
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:36,079
um or like i mean so we always knew that
 

3159
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:36,630
um or like i mean so we always knew that
if we

3160
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:36,640
if we
 

3161
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,309
if we
fell back if we it got to the point

3162
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:38,319
fell back if we it got to the point
 

3163
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,309
fell back if we it got to the point
where if for some reason

3164
00:54:40,309 --> 00:54:40,319
where if for some reason
 

3165
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:41,670
where if for some reason
things slowed down and we fell back to

3166
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:41,680
things slowed down and we fell back to
 

3167
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,349
things slowed down and we fell back to
the original solver the robot would

3168
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
the original solver the robot would
 

3169
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,190
the original solver the robot would
actually literally fall down

3170
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200
actually literally fall down
 

3171
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,309
actually literally fall down
um so it was it was a harrowing

3172
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:48,319
um so it was it was a harrowing
 

3173
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,390
um so it was it was a harrowing
sort of edge we're ledge we were sort of

3174
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:50,400
sort of edge we're ledge we were sort of
 

3175
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,069
sort of edge we're ledge we were sort of
on but

3176
00:54:52,069 --> 00:54:52,079
on but
 

3177
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,470
on but
i mean actually like the the 400 pound

3178
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
i mean actually like the the 400 pound
 

3179
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,750
i mean actually like the the 400 pound
humor could come crashing to the ground

3180
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:55,760
humor could come crashing to the ground
 

3181
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:56,549
humor could come crashing to the ground
if you if you

3182
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
if you if you
 

3183
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,109
if you if you
if your solver is not fast enough but

3184
00:54:59,109 --> 00:54:59,119
if your solver is not fast enough but
 

3185
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:00,390
if your solver is not fast enough but
you know that we have lots of good

3186
00:55:00,390 --> 00:55:00,400
you know that we have lots of good
 

3187
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,829
you know that we have lots of good
experiences

3188
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
experiences
 

3189
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,950
experiences
so can i ask you a weird question i

3190
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:04,960
so can i ask you a weird question i
 

3191
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,430
so can i ask you a weird question i
i get um about idea of hard work

3192
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,440
i get um about idea of hard work
 

3193
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:12,710
i get um about idea of hard work
so um actually people

3194
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
so um actually people
 

3195
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,470
so um actually people
like students of yours that i've

3196
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:14,480
like students of yours that i've
 

3197
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,829
like students of yours that i've
interacted with

3198
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
interacted with
 

3199
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:19,349
interacted with
and just and robotics people in general

3200
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:19,359
and just and robotics people in general
 

3201
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:22,710
and just and robotics people in general
but they uh they have

3202
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
but they uh they have
 

3203
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,349
but they uh they have
moments at moments have worked harder

3204
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
moments at moments have worked harder
 

3205
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:26,630
moments at moments have worked harder
than

3206
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
than
 

3207
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,510
than
uh most people i know in terms of if you

3208
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:29,520
uh most people i know in terms of if you
 

3209
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:30,789
uh most people i know in terms of if you
look at different disciplines of how

3210
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:30,799
look at different disciplines of how
 

3211
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:32,230
look at different disciplines of how
hard people work

3212
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:32,240
hard people work
 

3213
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,190
hard people work
but they're also like the happiest like

3214
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:35,200
but they're also like the happiest like
 

3215
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,150
but they're also like the happiest like
just like

3216
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:36,160
just like
 

3217
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,549
just like
i don't know um it's the same thing with

3218
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:38,559
i don't know um it's the same thing with
 

3219
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,150
i don't know um it's the same thing with
like running people that push themselves

3220
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,160
like running people that push themselves
 

3221
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,270
like running people that push themselves
to like the limit

3222
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
to like the limit
 

3223
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,430
to like the limit
they all also seem to be like the most

3224
00:55:43,430 --> 00:55:43,440
they all also seem to be like the most
 

3225
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,150
they all also seem to be like the most
like full of life somehow

3226
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:46,160
like full of life somehow
 

3227
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,710
like full of life somehow
uh and i get often criticized like

3228
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:48,720
uh and i get often criticized like
 

3229
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,630
uh and i get often criticized like
you're not getting enough sleep what are

3230
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
you're not getting enough sleep what are
 

3231
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,069
you're not getting enough sleep what are
you doing to your body

3232
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:52,079
you doing to your body
 

3233
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:54,630
you doing to your body
blah blah blah like this kind of stuff

3234
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
blah blah blah like this kind of stuff
 

3235
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:55,510
blah blah blah like this kind of stuff
and

3236
00:55:55,510 --> 00:55:55,520
and
 

3237
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:57,910
and
i usually just kind of respond like i'm

3238
00:55:57,910 --> 00:55:57,920
i usually just kind of respond like i'm
 

3239
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,190
i usually just kind of respond like i'm
i'm doing what i

3240
00:55:59,190 --> 00:55:59,200
i'm doing what i
 

3241
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,589
i'm doing what i
love i'm passionate about i love it i

3242
00:56:01,589 --> 00:56:01,599
love i'm passionate about i love it i
 

3243
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:03,670
love i'm passionate about i love it i
feel like it's

3244
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:03,680
feel like it's
 

3245
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:06,230
feel like it's
it's invigorating i actually think i

3246
00:56:06,230 --> 00:56:06,240
it's invigorating i actually think i
 

3247
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,589
it's invigorating i actually think i
don't think the lack of sleep

3248
00:56:07,589 --> 00:56:07,599
don't think the lack of sleep
 

3249
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,750
don't think the lack of sleep
is what hurts you i think what hurts you

3250
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:09,760
is what hurts you i think what hurts you
 

3251
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,910
is what hurts you i think what hurts you
is uh stress and lack of doing things

3252
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
is uh stress and lack of doing things
 

3253
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,109
is uh stress and lack of doing things
that you're passionate about

3254
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:13,119
that you're passionate about
 

3255
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,190
that you're passionate about
but in this world yeah i mean can you

3256
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,200
but in this world yeah i mean can you
 

3257
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,710
but in this world yeah i mean can you
comment about

3258
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:16,720
comment about
 

3259
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,710
comment about
uh why the heck robotics people

3260
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:20,720
uh why the heck robotics people
 

3261
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,910
uh why the heck robotics people
are uh

3262
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:23,920
are uh
 

3263
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,510
are uh
willing to push themselves to that

3264
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:25,520
willing to push themselves to that
 

3265
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,589
willing to push themselves to that
degree is there value in that

3266
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
degree is there value in that
 

3267
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,789
degree is there value in that
and why are they so happy i think

3268
00:56:30,789 --> 00:56:30,799
and why are they so happy i think
 

3269
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,789
and why are they so happy i think
i think you got it right i mean i think

3270
00:56:32,789 --> 00:56:32,799
i think you got it right i mean i think
 

3271
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:34,390
i think you got it right i mean i think
the causality is not

3272
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:34,400
the causality is not
 

3273
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,870
the causality is not
that we work hard and i think other

3274
00:56:36,870 --> 00:56:36,880
that we work hard and i think other
 

3275
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:38,630
that we work hard and i think other
disciplines work very hard too but it's

3276
00:56:38,630 --> 00:56:38,640
disciplines work very hard too but it's
 

3277
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,430
disciplines work very hard too but it's
i don't think it's

3278
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
i don't think it's
 

3279
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,990
i don't think it's
that we work hard and therefore we are

3280
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:42,000
that we work hard and therefore we are
 

3281
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,030
that we work hard and therefore we are
happy

3282
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,040
happy
 

3283
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:45,109
happy
i think we found something that we're

3284
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
i think we found something that we're
 

3285
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,990
i think we found something that we're
truly passionate about

3286
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:48,000
truly passionate about
 

3287
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,030
truly passionate about
it makes us very happy and then we

3288
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
it makes us very happy and then we
 

3289
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,549
it makes us very happy and then we
get a little involved with it and spend

3290
00:56:52,549 --> 00:56:52,559
get a little involved with it and spend
 

3291
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:54,390
get a little involved with it and spend
a lot of time on it um

3292
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
a lot of time on it um
 

3293
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,150
a lot of time on it um
what a luxury to have something that you

3294
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
what a luxury to have something that you
 

3295
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,589
what a luxury to have something that you
want to spend all your time on

3296
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
want to spend all your time on
 

3297
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,390
want to spend all your time on
right we could talk about this for many

3298
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:00,400
right we could talk about this for many
 

3299
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,430
right we could talk about this for many
hours but

3300
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,440
hours but
 

3301
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,069
hours but
maybe if we could pick is there

3302
00:57:04,069 --> 00:57:04,079
maybe if we could pick is there
 

3303
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,670
maybe if we could pick is there
something on the technical side on the

3304
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:05,680
something on the technical side on the
 

3305
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:06,230
something on the technical side on the
approach

3306
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
approach
 

3307
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,630
approach
you took that's interesting that turned

3308
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:08,640
you took that's interesting that turned
 

3309
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,870
you took that's interesting that turned
out to be a terrible failure or a

3310
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:10,880
out to be a terrible failure or a
 

3311
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,710
out to be a terrible failure or a
success that you carry into your work

3312
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:12,720
success that you carry into your work
 

3313
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:13,750
success that you carry into your work
today

3314
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:13,760
today
 

3315
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,390
today
about all the different ideas that were

3316
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:16,400
about all the different ideas that were
 

3317
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,190
about all the different ideas that were
involved

making this semi-autonomous system work
 

3325
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,829
making this semi-autonomous system work
i mean it really did teach me

3326
00:57:29,829 --> 00:57:29,839
i mean it really did teach me
 

3327
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:32,069
i mean it really did teach me
something fundamental about what it's

3328
00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:32,079
something fundamental about what it's
 

3329
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,829
something fundamental about what it's
going to take to get robustness out of a

i would say the darpa challenge really

3334
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:39,359
i would say the darpa challenge really
 

3335
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:41,750
i would say the darpa challenge really
was foundational in my thinking i think

3336
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:41,760
was foundational in my thinking i think
 

3337
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,190
was foundational in my thinking i think
the autonomous driving community thinks

3338
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:43,200
the autonomous driving community thinks
 

3339
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,630
the autonomous driving community thinks
about this i think lots of

3340
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
about this i think lots of

00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,549
about this i think lots of
people thinking about safety critical

in the loop
 

3347
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,470

are thinking about these questions for
me the darpa challenge was

3350
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:52,720
me the darpa challenge was
 

3351
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,430
me the darpa challenge was
the moment where i realized you know

3352
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
the moment where i realized you know
 

3353
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,069
the moment where i realized you know
we've spent

3354
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:56,079
we've spent
 

3355
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,789
we've spent
every waking minute running this robot

3356
00:57:58,789 --> 00:57:58,799
every waking minute running this robot
 

3357
00:57:58,799 --> 00:57:59,190
every waking minute running this robot
and

3358
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,200
and
 

3359
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,789
and
again the in for the physical

competition days before the competition
 

3363
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,309
competition days before the competition
we saw the robot fall down in a way

3364
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:04,319
we saw the robot fall down in a way
 

3365
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,990
we saw the robot fall down in a way
it had never fallen down before i

3366
00:58:05,990 --> 00:58:06,000
it had never fallen down before i
 

3367
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,430
it had never fallen down before i
thought

3368
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:07,440
thought
 

3369
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,190
thought
you know how could we have found that

3370
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
you know how could we have found that
 

3371
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,589
you know how could we have found that
you know we only have one robot it's

3372
00:58:11,589 --> 00:58:11,599
you know we only have one robot it's
 

3373
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:13,430
you know we only have one robot it's
running almost all the time

3374
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:13,440
running almost all the time
 

3375
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,710
running almost all the time
we just didn't have enough hours in the

3376
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:14,720
we just didn't have enough hours in the
 

3377
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,030
we just didn't have enough hours in the
day to test that robot

3378
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:17,040
day to test that robot
 

3379
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,910
day to test that robot
something has to change right and then i

3380
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:19,920
something has to change right and then i
 

3381
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:20,390
something has to change right and then i
think that

3382
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:20,400
think that
 

3383
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,150
think that
i mean i would say that the team that

3384
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
i mean i would say that the team that
 

3385
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,670
i mean i would say that the team that
won

3386
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:23,680
won
 

3387
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:26,950
won
was was from kaist was the team that had

3388
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:26,960
was was from kaist was the team that had
 

3389
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,589
was was from kaist was the team that had
two robots and was able to do not only

3390
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
two robots and was able to do not only
 

3391
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,510
two robots and was able to do not only
incredible engineering just absolutely

3392
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
incredible engineering just absolutely
 

3393
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,910
incredible engineering just absolutely
top-rate engineering but also they were

3394
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:33,920
top-rate engineering but also they were
 

3395
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,789
top-rate engineering but also they were
able to test

3396
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:34,799
able to test
 

3397
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,230
able to test
at a rate and um discipline that we

3398
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:38,240
at a rate and um discipline that we
 

3399
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,589
at a rate and um discipline that we
didn't keep up with

3400
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
didn't keep up with
 

3401
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,349
didn't keep up with
what does testing look like what are we

3402
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
what does testing look like what are we
 

3403
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,870
what does testing look like what are we
talking about here like what's

3404
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:42,880
talking about here like what's
 

3405
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,069
talking about here like what's
what's a a loop of test like a

3406
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
what's a a loop of test like a
 

3407
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:48,150
what's a a loop of test like a
from start to finish what is a loop of

3408
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:48,160
from start to finish what is a loop of
 

3409
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,150
from start to finish what is a loop of
testing yeah i mean i think

3410
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:50,160
testing yeah i mean i think
 

3411
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,750
testing yeah i mean i think
there's a whole philosophy to testing

3412
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:51,760
there's a whole philosophy to testing
 

3413
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,349
there's a whole philosophy to testing
there's the unit tests and you can do

3414
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:53,359
there's the unit tests and you can do
 

3415
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,309
there's the unit tests and you can do
that on a hardware

3416
00:58:54,309 --> 00:58:54,319
that on a hardware
 

3417
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:56,150
that on a hardware
you can do that in a small piece of code

3418
00:58:56,150 --> 00:58:56,160
you can do that in a small piece of code
 

3419
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:57,430
you can do that in a small piece of code
you write one function you should write

3420
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:57,440
you write one function you should write
 

3421
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,150
you write one function you should write
a test that

3422
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
a test that
 

3423
00:58:58,160 --> 00:58:59,750
a test that
that checks that function's input

3424
00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
that checks that function's input
 

3425
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,589
that checks that function's input
outputs you should also write an

3426
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:01,599
outputs you should also write an
 

3427
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,109
outputs you should also write an
integration test at the other extreme of

3428
00:59:03,109 --> 00:59:03,119
integration test at the other extreme of
 

3429
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,950
integration test at the other extreme of
of running the whole system together you

3430
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
of running the whole system together you
 

3431
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,069
of running the whole system together you
know where that

3432
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:06,079
know where that
 

3433
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:08,549
know where that
that try to turn on all the different

3434
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:08,559
that try to turn on all the different
 

3435
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:09,750
that try to turn on all the different
functions that you've

3436
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
functions that you've
 

3437
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,990
functions that you've
you think are correct it's much harder

3438
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
you think are correct it's much harder
 

3439
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,750
you think are correct it's much harder
to write the specifications for a system

3440
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:13,760
to write the specifications for a system
 

3441
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,390
to write the specifications for a system
level test

3442
00:59:14,390 --> 00:59:14,400
level test
 

3443
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,710
level test
especially if that system is as

3444
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:16,720
especially if that system is as
 

3445
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,309
especially if that system is as
complicated as a humanoid robot

3446
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
complicated as a humanoid robot
 

3447
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,870
complicated as a humanoid robot
but the philosophy is sort of the same

3448
00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:20,880
but the philosophy is sort of the same
 

3449
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,030
but the philosophy is sort of the same
i'm the real robot

3450
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:23,040
i'm the real robot
 

3451
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,589
i'm the real robot
it's it's no different but on a real

3452
00:59:25,589 --> 00:59:25,599
it's it's no different but on a real
 

3453
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,270
it's it's no different but on a real
robot it's impossible to run the same

3454
00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:27,280
robot it's impossible to run the same
 

3455
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,549
robot it's impossible to run the same
experiment twice

3456
00:59:28,549 --> 00:59:28,559
experiment twice
 

3457
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:32,390
experiment twice
so if you if you see a failure

3458
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:32,400
so if you if you see a failure
 

3459
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,990
so if you if you see a failure
you hope you caught something in the

3460
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:34,000
you hope you caught something in the
 

3461
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,430
you hope you caught something in the
logs that tell you what happened

3462
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:35,440
logs that tell you what happened
 

3463
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,870
logs that tell you what happened
but you'd probably never be able to run

3464
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
but you'd probably never be able to run
 

3465
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,349
but you'd probably never be able to run
exactly that experiment again

3466
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
exactly that experiment again
 

3467
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,470
exactly that experiment again
and right now

3468
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
and right now
 

3469
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,589
and right now
i think our philosophy is just

3470
00:59:45,589 --> 00:59:45,599
i think our philosophy is just
 

3471
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:48,950
i think our philosophy is just
basically monte carlo estimation is just

3472
00:59:48,950 --> 00:59:48,960
basically monte carlo estimation is just
 

3473
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,030
basically monte carlo estimation is just
run as many experiments as we can maybe

3474
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
run as many experiments as we can maybe
 

3475
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,030
run as many experiments as we can maybe
try to set up the environment

3476
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,040
try to set up the environment
 

3477
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,069
try to set up the environment
to to make the things we are worried

3478
00:59:56,069 --> 00:59:56,079
to to make the things we are worried
 

3479
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:57,510
to to make the things we are worried
about

3480
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:57,520
about
 

3481
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,230
about
happen as often as possible but really

3482
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
happen as often as possible but really
 

3483
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:01,190
happen as often as possible but really
we're relying on

3484
01:00:01,190 --> 01:00:01,200
we're relying on
 

3485
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:04,069
we're relying on
somewhat random search in order to test

3486
01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
somewhat random search in order to test
 

3487
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,430
somewhat random search in order to test
maybe that's all we'll ever be able to

3488
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:05,440
maybe that's all we'll ever be able to
 

3489
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,950
maybe that's all we'll ever be able to
but i think uh

3490
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:06,960
but i think uh
 

3491
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,069
but i think uh
you know because there's an argument

3492
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:08,079
you know because there's an argument
 

3493
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:10,549
you know because there's an argument
that the things that will get you are

3494
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
that the things that will get you are
 

3495
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:10,870
that the things that will get you are
the

3496
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
the
 

3497
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,349
the
the things that are really nuanced in

3498
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:13,359
the things that are really nuanced in
 

3499
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,270
the things that are really nuanced in
the world and it'd be very hard to for

3500
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:15,280
the world and it'd be very hard to for
 

3501
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,789
the world and it'd be very hard to for
instance put back in a simulation

3502
01:00:16,789 --> 01:00:16,799
instance put back in a simulation
 

3503
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:20,069
instance put back in a simulation
yeah the i guess the edge cases

3504
01:00:20,069 --> 01:00:20,079
yeah the i guess the edge cases
 

3505
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:22,470
yeah the i guess the edge cases
what was the the hardest thing like so

3506
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:22,480
what was the the hardest thing like so
 

3507
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:23,589
what was the the hardest thing like so
you said walking over

3508
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:23,599
you said walking over
 

3509
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,670
you said walking over
rough terrain like the just taking

3510
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:25,680
rough terrain like the just taking
 

3511
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:26,950
rough terrain like the just taking
footsteps

3512
01:00:26,950 --> 01:00:26,960
footsteps
 

3513
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,549
footsteps
i mean people there's it's so dramatic

3514
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
i mean people there's it's so dramatic
 

3515
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,309
i mean people there's it's so dramatic
and painful in a certain kind of way to

3516
01:00:32,309 --> 01:00:32,319
and painful in a certain kind of way to
 

3517
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,309
and painful in a certain kind of way to
watch these videos from

3518
01:00:34,309 --> 01:00:34,319
watch these videos from
 

3519
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:37,510
watch these videos from
the drc of robots falling

3520
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:37,520
the drc of robots falling
 

3521
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,589
the drc of robots falling
yep it's just so heartbreaking i don't

3522
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:39,599
yep it's just so heartbreaking i don't
 

3523
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:41,510
yep it's just so heartbreaking i don't
know maybe it's because

3524
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
know maybe it's because
 

3525
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,390
know maybe it's because
for me at least we anthropomorphize the

3526
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:44,400
for me at least we anthropomorphize the
 

3527
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,910
for me at least we anthropomorphize the
robot

3528
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
robot
 

3529
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,670
robot
um of course there's everything funny

3530
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:47,680
um of course there's everything funny
 

3531
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,589
um of course there's everything funny
for some reason like humans falling is

3532
01:00:49,589 --> 01:00:49,599
for some reason like humans falling is
 

3533
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:50,390
for some reason like humans falling is
funny

3534
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:50,400
funny
 

3535
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,430
funny
uh for i don't it's some dark reason i'm

3536
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
uh for i don't it's some dark reason i'm
 

3537
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,390
uh for i don't it's some dark reason i'm
not sure why

3538
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
not sure why
 

3539
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,190
not sure why
it is so but it's also like tragic and

3540
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:57,200
it is so but it's also like tragic and
 

3541
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,829
it is so but it's also like tragic and
painful

3542
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
painful
 

3543
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,710
painful
and uh so speaking of which i mean what

3544
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:00,720
and uh so speaking of which i mean what
 

3545
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,030
and uh so speaking of which i mean what
what made the robots fall and fail

3546
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:03,040
what made the robots fall and fail
 

3547
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,670
what made the robots fall and fail
uh in your view so i can tell you

3548
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:05,680
uh in your view so i can tell you
 

3549
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,109
uh in your view so i can tell you
exactly what happened on our we i

3550
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:07,119
exactly what happened on our we i
 

3551
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:08,710
exactly what happened on our we i
contributed one of those our team

falls

3556

falls
 

3557
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:14,470
falls
every one of those falls the has a

every one of those falls the has a
 

3559
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:15,910
every one of those falls the has a
complicated story i mean

3560
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:15,920
complicated story i mean
 

3561
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,309
complicated story i mean
one time the power effectively went out

3562
01:01:18,309 --> 01:01:18,319
one time the power effectively went out
 

3563
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:20,069
one time the power effectively went out
on the robot

3564
01:01:20,069 --> 01:01:20,079
on the robot
 

3565
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,589
on the robot
because it had been sitting at the door

3566
01:01:21,589 --> 01:01:21,599
because it had been sitting at the door
 

3567
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,589
because it had been sitting at the door
waiting for a green light to be able to

proceed
and its batteries you know and therefore

3572
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
and its batteries you know and therefore
 

3573
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:27,510
and its batteries you know and therefore
it just fell

3574
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:27,520
it just fell
 

3575
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:28,950
it just fell
backwards and smashed its head across

3576
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:28,960
backwards and smashed its head across
 

3577
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,150
backwards and smashed its head across
ground and it was hilarious but it

3578
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:30,160
ground and it was hilarious but it
 

3579
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:32,230
ground and it was hilarious but it
wasn't because of bad software

3580
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:32,240
wasn't because of bad software
 

3581
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:35,670
wasn't because of bad software
right um but for ours so the hardest

3582
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
right um but for ours so the hardest
 

3583
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,910
right um but for ours so the hardest
part of the challenge the hardest task

3584
01:01:37,910 --> 01:01:37,920
part of the challenge the hardest task
 

3585
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,430
part of the challenge the hardest task
in my view was getting out of the

3586
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:39,440
in my view was getting out of the
 

3587
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,230
in my view was getting out of the
polaris

3588
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:40,240
polaris
 

3589
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:42,549
polaris
it was actually relatively easy to drive

3590
01:01:42,549 --> 01:01:42,559
it was actually relatively easy to drive
 

3591
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:43,670
it was actually relatively easy to drive
the polaris we have

3592
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:43,680
the polaris we have
 

3593
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:46,069
the polaris we have
can you tell the stars no the story of

3594
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:46,079
can you tell the stars no the story of
 

3595
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:46,800
can you tell the stars no the story of
the car

3596
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:46,810
the car
 

3597
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:49,990
the car
[Laughter]

3598
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:50,000
[Laughter]
 

3599
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,510
[Laughter]
people should watch this video i mean

3600
01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:51,520
people should watch this video i mean
 

3601
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,190
people should watch this video i mean
the the the thing you've come up with is

3602
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:53,200
the the the thing you've come up with is
 

3603
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,950
the the the thing you've come up with is
just brilliant but uh anyway sorry

3604
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
just brilliant but uh anyway sorry
 

3605
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,750
just brilliant but uh anyway sorry
what's uh

3606
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:55,760
what's uh
 

3607
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,349
what's uh
yeah we we kind of joke we call it the

3608
01:01:57,349 --> 01:01:57,359
yeah we we kind of joke we call it the
 

3609
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,910
yeah we we kind of joke we call it the
big robot little car problem because

3610
01:01:59,910 --> 01:01:59,920
big robot little car problem because
 

3611
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,270
big robot little car problem because
um somehow the race organizers decided

3612
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:03,280
um somehow the race organizers decided
 

3613
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,589
um somehow the race organizers decided
to give us a 400 pound humanoid and they

3614
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:05,599
to give us a 400 pound humanoid and they
 

3615
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:07,349
to give us a 400 pound humanoid and they
also provided the vehicle

3616
01:02:07,349 --> 01:02:07,359
also provided the vehicle
 

3617
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:10,710
also provided the vehicle
which was a little polaris and the robot

3618
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:10,720
which was a little polaris and the robot
 

3619
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,069
which was a little polaris and the robot
didn't really fit in the car so

3620
01:02:12,069 --> 01:02:12,079
didn't really fit in the car so
 

3621
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:13,670
didn't really fit in the car so
you couldn't drive the car with your

3622
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:13,680
you couldn't drive the car with your
 

3623
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:15,670
you couldn't drive the car with your
feet under the steering column

3624
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:15,680
feet under the steering column
 

3625
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:19,029
feet under the steering column
we actually had to straddle the the main

3626
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:19,039
we actually had to straddle the the main
 

3627
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:22,390
we actually had to straddle the the main
column of the uh and have basically one

3628
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
column of the uh and have basically one
 

3629
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,230
column of the uh and have basically one
foot in the passenger seat one foot in

3630
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
foot in the passenger seat one foot in
 

3631
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,150
foot in the passenger seat one foot in
the driver's seat and then drive

3632
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
the driver's seat and then drive
 

3633
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,670
the driver's seat and then drive
with our left hand but the hard part was

3634
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
with our left hand but the hard part was
 

3635
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,190
with our left hand but the hard part was
we had to then park the car

3636
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
we had to then park the car
 

3637
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:33,430
we had to then park the car
get out of the car uh it didn't have a

3638
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:33,440
get out of the car uh it didn't have a
 

3639
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:34,950
get out of the car uh it didn't have a
door that was okay but

3640
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:34,960
door that was okay but
 

3641
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,670
door that was okay but
it's just uh getting up from crouched

3642
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:37,680
it's just uh getting up from crouched
 

3643
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:38,630
it's just uh getting up from crouched
from sitting

3644
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:38,640
from sitting
 

3645
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,470
from sitting
when you're in this very constrained

3646
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:40,480
when you're in this very constrained
 

3647
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,549
when you're in this very constrained
environment uh first of all

3648
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
environment uh first of all
 

3649
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,309
environment uh first of all
i remember after watching those videos i

3650
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:44,319
i remember after watching those videos i
 

3651
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,910
i remember after watching those videos i
was much more cognizant of

3652
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920
was much more cognizant of
 

3653
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,390
was much more cognizant of
how hard is it it is for me to get in

3654
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:48,400
how hard is it it is for me to get in
 

3655
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,510
how hard is it it is for me to get in
and out of the car

3656
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
and out of the car
 

3657
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,910
and out of the car
and out of the car especially like it's

3658
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
and out of the car especially like it's
 

3659
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:53,349
and out of the car especially like it's
actually a really difficult control

3660
01:02:53,349 --> 01:02:53,359
actually a really difficult control
 

3661
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:54,150
actually a really difficult control
problem

3662
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:54,160
problem
 

3663
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:57,270
problem
yeah and i i'm very cognizant of it when

3664
01:02:57,270 --> 01:02:57,280
yeah and i i'm very cognizant of it when
 

3665
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:57,670
yeah and i i'm very cognizant of it when
i'm like

3666
01:02:57,670 --> 01:02:57,680
i'm like
 

3667
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,430
i'm like
injured for whatever reason it's really

3668
01:02:59,430 --> 01:02:59,440
injured for whatever reason it's really
 

3669
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,109
injured for whatever reason it's really
hard yeah

3670
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:01,119
hard yeah
 

3671
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,109
hard yeah
so so how did you how did you approach

3672
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:03,119
so so how did you how did you approach
 

3673
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,630
so so how did you how did you approach
so so we had a

3674
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:04,640
so so we had a
 

3675
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,349
so so we had a
you know you think of um nasa's

3676
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
you know you think of um nasa's
 

3677
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,630
you know you think of um nasa's
operations and they have these

3678
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
operations and they have these
 

3679
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:09,510
operations and they have these
checklists

3680
01:03:09,510 --> 01:03:09,520
checklists
 

3681
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:10,630
checklists
you know pre-launch checklists and

3682
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:10,640
you know pre-launch checklists and
 

3683
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:12,069
you know pre-launch checklists and
they're like we weren't far off from

3684
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
they're like we weren't far off from
 

3685
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,990
they're like we weren't far off from
that we had this big checklist and

3686
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:14,000
that we had this big checklist and
 

3687
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,309
that we had this big checklist and
on the first day of the competition we

3688
01:03:16,309 --> 01:03:16,319
on the first day of the competition we
 

3689
01:03:16,319 --> 01:03:17,670
on the first day of the competition we
were running down our checklist and one

3690
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
were running down our checklist and one
 

3691
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:18,950
were running down our checklist and one
of the things we had to do

3692
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:18,960
of the things we had to do
 

3693
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,349
of the things we had to do
we had to turn off the controller the

3694
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:21,359
we had to turn off the controller the
 

3695
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,190
we had to turn off the controller the
piece of software that was running

3696
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200
piece of software that was running
 

3697
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,950
piece of software that was running
that would drive the left foot of the

3698
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
that would drive the left foot of the
 

3699
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,990
that would drive the left foot of the
robot in order to accelerate on the gas

3700
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
robot in order to accelerate on the gas
 

3701
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,349
robot in order to accelerate on the gas
and then we turned on our balancing

3702
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:29,359
and then we turned on our balancing
 

3703
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,349
and then we turned on our balancing
controller and

3704
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:31,359
controller and
 

3705
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:33,029
controller and
the nerves jitters of the first day of

3706
01:03:33,029 --> 01:03:33,039
the nerves jitters of the first day of
 

3707
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:34,950
the nerves jitters of the first day of
the competition someone forgot to check

3708
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:34,960
the competition someone forgot to check
 

3709
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,510
the competition someone forgot to check
that box and turn that controller off

3710
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:37,520
that box and turn that controller off
 

3711
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,789
that box and turn that controller off
so um we used a lot of motion planning

3712
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
so um we used a lot of motion planning
 

3713
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,789
so um we used a lot of motion planning
to figure out a a sort of configuration

3714
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
to figure out a a sort of configuration
 

3715
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,390
to figure out a a sort of configuration
of the robot that we get up and

3716
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:46,400
of the robot that we get up and
 

3717
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,230
of the robot that we get up and
and over we relied heavily on our

3718
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:48,240
and over we relied heavily on our
 

3719
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,230
and over we relied heavily on our
balancing controller

3720
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
balancing controller
 

3721
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,950
balancing controller
and and basically there was when the

3722
01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:52,960
and and basically there was when the
 

3723
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,309
and and basically there was when the
robot was in one of its most

3724
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:54,319
robot was in one of its most
 

3725
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:56,630
robot was in one of its most
precarious you know sort of

3726
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:56,640
precarious you know sort of
 

3727
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,630
precarious you know sort of
configurations trying to

3728
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
configurations trying to
 

3729
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,390
configurations trying to
sneak its big leg out of the out of the

3730
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:00,400
sneak its big leg out of the out of the
 

3731
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,910
sneak its big leg out of the out of the
side

3732
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:01,920
side
 

3733
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,670
side
the other controller that thought it was

3734
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
the other controller that thought it was
 

3735
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:04,950
the other controller that thought it was
still driving

3736
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:04,960
still driving
 

3737
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,109
still driving
told its left foot to go like this and

3738
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
told its left foot to go like this and
 

3739
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:08,230
told its left foot to go like this and
uh

3740
01:04:08,230 --> 01:04:08,240
uh
 

3741
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,430
uh
and that wasn't good um but but it

3742
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
and that wasn't good um but but it
 

3743
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,270
and that wasn't good um but but it
turned disastrous for us

3744
01:04:13,270 --> 01:04:13,280
turned disastrous for us
 

3745
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,150
turned disastrous for us
because um what happened was a little

3746
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:16,160
because um what happened was a little
 

3747
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,510
because um what happened was a little
bit of push here actually

3748
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
bit of push here actually
 

3749
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,150
bit of push here actually
if you we have videos of us you know

3750
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
if you we have videos of us you know
 

3751
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,750
if you we have videos of us you know
running into the robot with a

3752
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:21,760
running into the robot with a
 

3753
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,549
running into the robot with a
10-foot pole and it kind of will recover

3754
01:04:24,549 --> 01:04:24,559
10-foot pole and it kind of will recover
 

3755
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,309
10-foot pole and it kind of will recover
but this is a case where

3756
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:26,319
but this is a case where
 

3757
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:28,230
but this is a case where
there's no space to recover so a lot of

3758
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
there's no space to recover so a lot of
 

3759
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,870
there's no space to recover so a lot of
our secondary balancing mechanisms about

3760
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
our secondary balancing mechanisms about
 

3761
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,309
our secondary balancing mechanisms about
like take a step to recover they were

3762
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
like take a step to recover they were
 

3763
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:33,670
like take a step to recover they were
all disabled because we were in the car

3764
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:33,680
all disabled because we were in the car
 

3765
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:35,190
all disabled because we were in the car
and there's no place to step

3766
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
and there's no place to step
 

3767
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,630
and there's no place to step
so we're relying on our just lowest

3768
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
so we're relying on our just lowest
 

3769
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,390
so we're relying on our just lowest
level reflexes

3770
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:38,400
level reflexes
 

3771
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,270
level reflexes
and even then i think just hitting the

3772
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:41,280
and even then i think just hitting the
 

3773
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,230
and even then i think just hitting the
foot on the seat

3774
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
foot on the seat
 

3775
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:43,589
foot on the seat
on the on the floor we probably could

3776
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:43,599
on the on the floor we probably could
 

3777
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,349
on the on the floor we probably could
have recovered from it but the thing

3778
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
have recovered from it but the thing
 

3779
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,789
have recovered from it but the thing
that was bad that happened is when we

3780
01:04:46,789 --> 01:04:46,799
that was bad that happened is when we
 

3781
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:47,990
that was bad that happened is when we
did that and we

3782
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
did that and we
 

3783
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,950
did that and we
jostled a little bit the tailbone of our

3784
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:50,960
jostled a little bit the tailbone of our
 

3785
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:51,990
jostled a little bit the tailbone of our
robot

3786
01:04:51,990 --> 01:04:52,000
robot
 

3787
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,829
robot
hat was only a little off the seat it

3788
01:04:53,829 --> 01:04:53,839
hat was only a little off the seat it
 

3789
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:55,349
hat was only a little off the seat it
hit the seat

3790
01:04:55,349 --> 01:04:55,359
hit the seat
 

3791
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,630
hit the seat
and the other foot came off the ground

3792
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:56,640
and the other foot came off the ground
 

3793
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,109
and the other foot came off the ground
just a little bit and nothing in our

3794
01:04:59,109 --> 01:04:59,119
just a little bit and nothing in our
 

3795
01:04:59,119 --> 01:04:59,829
just a little bit and nothing in our
plans

3796
01:04:59,829 --> 01:04:59,839
plans
 

3797
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,549
plans
had ever told us what to do if your

3798
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:02,559
had ever told us what to do if your
 

3799
01:05:02,559 --> 01:05:03,670
had ever told us what to do if your
butt's on the seat

3800
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:03,680
butt's on the seat
 

3801
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,990
butt's on the seat
and your feet are in the air feeding air

3802
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:06,000
and your feet are in the air feeding air
 

3803
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,349
and your feet are in the air feeding air
and then

3804
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
and then
 

3805
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:09,990
and then
the thing is once you get off the script

3806
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
the thing is once you get off the script
 

3807
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,430
the thing is once you get off the script
things can go very wrong because even

3808
01:05:11,430 --> 01:05:11,440
things can go very wrong because even
 

3809
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:12,069
things can go very wrong because even
our state

3810
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:12,079
our state
 

3811
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,230
our state
estimation our system that was trying to

3812
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:14,240
estimation our system that was trying to
 

3813
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:15,829
estimation our system that was trying to
collect all the data from the sensors

3814
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:15,839
collect all the data from the sensors
 

3815
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:16,630
collect all the data from the sensors
and understand

3816
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
and understand
 

3817
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,549
and understand
what's happening with the robot it

3818
01:05:18,549 --> 01:05:18,559
what's happening with the robot it
 

3819
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:20,309
what's happening with the robot it
didn't know about this situation so it

3820
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
didn't know about this situation so it
 

3821
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,589
didn't know about this situation so it
was predicting things that were just

3822
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
was predicting things that were just
 

3823
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:22,789
was predicting things that were just
wrong

3824
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
wrong
 

3825
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:26,069
wrong
and then we did a violent shake and

3826
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
and then we did a violent shake and
 

3827
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,470
and then we did a violent shake and
fell off in our uh face first on out of

3828
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
fell off in our uh face first on out of
 

3829
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,190
fell off in our uh face first on out of
the robot

3830
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:29,200
the robot
 

3831
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:32,470
the robot
but like into the destination

3832
01:05:32,470 --> 01:05:32,480
but like into the destination
 

3833
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,069
but like into the destination
that's true we fell in we got our point

3834
01:05:34,069 --> 01:05:34,079
that's true we fell in we got our point
 

3835
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:36,309
that's true we fell in we got our point
for egress

3836
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:36,319
for egress
 

3837
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,710
for egress
but so uh is there any hope for that's

3838
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:38,720
but so uh is there any hope for that's
 

3839
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,549
but so uh is there any hope for that's
interesting is there any hope

3840
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:40,559
interesting is there any hope
 

3841
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,190
interesting is there any hope
for uh atlas to be able to do something

3842
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:43,200
for uh atlas to be able to do something
 

3843
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,950
for uh atlas to be able to do something
when it's just on its butt

3844
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:44,960
when it's just on its butt
 

3845
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,349
when it's just on its butt
and feet in the air absolutely so you

3846
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:47,359
and feet in the air absolutely so you
 

3847
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:48,390
and feet in the air absolutely so you
can

3848
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400
can
 

3849
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,390
can
no so that's um that is one of the big

3850
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:50,400
no so that's um that is one of the big
 

3851
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,630
no so that's um that is one of the big
challenges and i think it's still true

3852
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:52,640
challenges and i think it's still true
 

3853
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,990
challenges and i think it's still true
um you know boston dynamics and and

3854
01:05:55,990 --> 01:05:56,000
um you know boston dynamics and and
 

3855
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,789
um you know boston dynamics and and
um animal and there's this incredible

3856
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
um animal and there's this incredible
 

3857
01:05:58,799 --> 01:05:59,510
um animal and there's this incredible
work on

3858
01:05:59,510 --> 01:05:59,520
work on
 

3859
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:02,829
work on
on legged robots happening around the

01:06:02,829 --> 01:06:02,839
on legged robots happening around the
 

3861
01:06:02,839 --> 01:06:04,630
on legged robots happening around the
world

world
most of them still are are very good at

3864
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:07,200
most of them still are are very good at
 

3865
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,390
most of them still are are very good at
the case where you're

3866
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:08,400
the case where you're
 

3867
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,510
the case where you're
making contact with the world at your

3868
01:06:09,510 --> 01:06:09,520
making contact with the world at your
 

3869
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,510
making contact with the world at your
feet and they have typically point feet

3870
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
feet and they have typically point feet
 

3871
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,630
feet and they have typically point feet
relatively they're

3872
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
relatively they're
 

3873
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,029
relatively they're
balls on their feet for instance if that

3874
01:06:15,029 --> 01:06:15,039
balls on their feet for instance if that
 

3875
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:17,190
balls on their feet for instance if that
if those robots get in a situation where

3876
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:17,200
if those robots get in a situation where
 

3877
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,270
if those robots get in a situation where
the elbow hits the wall or something

3878
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:19,280
the elbow hits the wall or something
 

3879
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:20,549
the elbow hits the wall or something
like this that's a pretty different

3880
01:06:20,549 --> 01:06:20,559
like this that's a pretty different
 

3881
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:22,390
like this that's a pretty different
situation now they have

3882
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:22,400
situation now they have
 

3883
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,230
situation now they have
layers of mechanisms that will make i

3884
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:24,240
layers of mechanisms that will make i
 

3885
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:26,309
layers of mechanisms that will make i
think the the more mature solutions have

01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:26,319
think the the more mature solutions have
 

3887
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:29,270
think the the more mature solutions have
have ways in which the controller won't

01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:29,280
have ways in which the controller won't
 

3889
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,190
have ways in which the controller won't
do stupid things

01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:31,200
do stupid things
 

3891
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,069
do stupid things
but a human for instance is able to

3892
01:06:34,069 --> 01:06:34,079
but a human for instance is able to
 

3893
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:34,710
but a human for instance is able to

01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:37,440
accomplish a goal in fact i might if you
 

3899
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,710
accomplish a goal in fact i might if you
push me i might actually

3900
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:38,720
push me i might actually
 

3901
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,710
push me i might actually
put my hand out and make a new brand new

3902
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:40,720
put my hand out and make a new brand new
 

3903
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,150
put my hand out and make a new brand new
contact

3904
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:42,160
contact
 

3905
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:44,390
contact
the feet of the robot are doing this on

3906
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
the feet of the robot are doing this on
 

3907
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:45,750
the feet of the robot are doing this on
quadrupeds but

3908
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:45,760
quadrupeds but
 

3909
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,549
quadrupeds but
we mostly in robotics are afraid of

3910
01:06:48,549 --> 01:06:48,559
we mostly in robotics are afraid of
 

3911
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,950
we mostly in robotics are afraid of
contact on the rest of our body

3912
01:06:50,950 --> 01:06:50,960
contact on the rest of our body
 

3913
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,230
contact on the rest of our body
which is crazy there's this whole field

3914
01:06:54,230 --> 01:06:54,240
which is crazy there's this whole field
 

3915
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:54,950
which is crazy there's this whole field
of

3916
01:06:54,950 --> 01:06:54,960
of
 

3917
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:57,029
of
motion planning collision-free motion

3918
01:06:57,029 --> 01:06:57,039
motion planning collision-free motion
 

3919
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:57,990
motion planning collision-free motion
planning

3920
01:06:57,990 --> 01:06:58,000
planning
 

3921
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,910
planning
and we write very complex algorithms so

3922
01:06:59,910 --> 01:06:59,920
and we write very complex algorithms so
 

3923
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,829
and we write very complex algorithms so
that the robot can dance around and make

3924
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:01,839
that the robot can dance around and make
 

3925
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,270
that the robot can dance around and make
sure it doesn't touch

3926
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,280
sure it doesn't touch
 

3927
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,950
sure it doesn't touch
the world um so people are just afraid

3928
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:06,960
the world um so people are just afraid
 

3929
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,670
the world um so people are just afraid
of contact

3930
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
of contact
 

3931
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:09,750
of contact
because contact is seen as a difficult

3932
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:09,760
because contact is seen as a difficult
 

3933
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,150
because contact is seen as a difficult
it's still a difficult control problem

3934
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
it's still a difficult control problem
 

3935
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,829
it's still a difficult control problem
and sensing problem now you're a serious

3936
01:07:15,829 --> 01:07:15,839
and sensing problem now you're a serious
 

3937
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,789
and sensing problem now you're a serious
person

3938
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:18,799

 

3939
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:21,270

uh i'm a little bit of an idiot and i'm

3940
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:21,280
uh i'm a little bit of an idiot and i'm
 

3941
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,589
uh i'm a little bit of an idiot and i'm
going to ask you some dumb questions

3942
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:23,599
going to ask you some dumb questions
 

3943
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,029
going to ask you some dumb questions
uh so i do uh i do martial arts uh

3944
01:07:27,029 --> 01:07:27,039
uh so i do uh i do martial arts uh
 

3945
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:29,270
uh so i do uh i do martial arts uh
so like jiu jitsu there's wrestled my

3946
01:07:29,270 --> 01:07:29,280
so like jiu jitsu there's wrestled my
 

3947
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:30,309
so like jiu jitsu there's wrestled my
whole life

3948
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
whole life
 

3949
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:33,670
whole life
so let me let me ask the question um

3950
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:33,680
so let me let me ask the question um
 

3951
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,510
so let me let me ask the question um
you know like whenever people learn that

3952
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:35,520
you know like whenever people learn that
 

3953
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,190
you know like whenever people learn that
i do any kind of ai or

3954
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
i do any kind of ai or
 

3955
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,950
i do any kind of ai or
like i mention robots and things like

3956
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,960
like i mention robots and things like
 

3957
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,950
like i mention robots and things like
that they say when am i gonna have

3958
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:40,960
that they say when am i gonna have
 

3959
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,549
that they say when am i gonna have
robots that um you know that can

3960
01:07:44,549 --> 01:07:44,559
robots that um you know that can
 

3961
01:07:44,559 --> 01:07:47,829
robots that um you know that can
win in a wrestling match or in a fight

3962
01:07:47,829 --> 01:07:47,839
win in a wrestling match or in a fight
 

3963
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,630
win in a wrestling match or in a fight
against a human so we just mentioned

3964
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:50,640
against a human so we just mentioned
 

3965
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,990
against a human so we just mentioned
sitting on your butt

3966
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:52,000
sitting on your butt
 

3967
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,430
sitting on your butt
if you in the air that's a common

3968
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
if you in the air that's a common
 

3969
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,870
if you in the air that's a common
position jiu jitsu when you're on the

3970
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
position jiu jitsu when you're on the
 

3971
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,470
position jiu jitsu when you're on the
ground you're when

3972
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:56,480
ground you're when
 

3973
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,670
ground you're when
you're down opponent um like what

3974
01:07:59,670 --> 01:07:59,680
you're down opponent um like what
 

3975
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:03,270
you're down opponent um like what
how difficult do you think is the

3976
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:03,280
how difficult do you think is the
 

3977
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:03,750
how difficult do you think is the
problem

3978
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
problem
 

3979
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:05,750
problem
and when will we have a robot that can

3980
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:05,760
and when will we have a robot that can
 

3981
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,470
and when will we have a robot that can
defeat a human in a wrestling match

3982
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:08,480
defeat a human in a wrestling match
 

3983
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:10,870
defeat a human in a wrestling match
and we're talking about a lot like if i

3984
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
and we're talking about a lot like if i
 

3985
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:11,910
and we're talking about a lot like if i
don't know if you're familiar with

3986
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:11,920
don't know if you're familiar with
 

3987
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:12,950
don't know if you're familiar with
wrestling but

3988
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:12,960
wrestling but
 

3989
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,990
wrestling but
essentially um not very

3990
01:08:15,990 --> 01:08:16,000
essentially um not very
 

3991
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,510
essentially um not very
it's basically the art of contact

3992
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:19,520
it's basically the art of contact
 

3993
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,749
it's basically the art of contact
it's like it's because you're you're

3994
01:08:21,749 --> 01:08:21,759
it's like it's because you're you're
 

3995
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:24,630
it's like it's because you're you're
you're picking contact points

3996
01:08:24,630 --> 01:08:24,640
you're picking contact points
 

3997
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:28,149
you're picking contact points
and then using like leverage like to uh

3998
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:28,159
and then using like leverage like to uh
 

3999
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:31,349
and then using like leverage like to uh
off balance to to trick people

4000
01:08:31,349 --> 01:08:31,359
off balance to to trick people
 

4001
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,309
off balance to to trick people
like you uh make them feel like you're

4002
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
like you uh make them feel like you're
 

4003
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,590
like you uh make them feel like you're
doing one thing

4004
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:35,600
doing one thing
 

4005
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,789
doing one thing
and then they they change their balance

4006
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
and then they they change their balance
 

4007
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:41,510
and then they they change their balance
and then you uh switch what you're doing

4008
01:08:41,510 --> 01:08:41,520
and then you uh switch what you're doing
 

4009
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:41,990
and then you uh switch what you're doing
and then

4010
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
and then
 

4011
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,390
and then
results in a throw or whatever so like

4012
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:44,400
results in a throw or whatever so like
 

4013
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,470
results in a throw or whatever so like
it's basically the art of

4014
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:46,480
it's basically the art of
 

4015
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,349
it's basically the art of
multiple contacts so awesome that's a

4016
01:08:49,349 --> 01:08:49,359
multiple contacts so awesome that's a
 

4017
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:50,789
multiple contacts so awesome that's a
nice description of it

4018
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
nice description of it
 

4019
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:52,709
nice description of it
so there's also an opponent in there

4020
01:08:52,709 --> 01:08:52,719
so there's also an opponent in there
 

4021
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,070
so there's also an opponent in there
right so so if

4022
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
right so so if
 

4023
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:57,189
right so so if
very dynamic right if you are wrestling

4024
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
very dynamic right if you are wrestling
 

4025
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:00,229
very dynamic right if you are wrestling
a human and uh are

4026
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
a human and uh are
 

4027
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,390
a human and uh are
in a game theoretic situation with a

4028
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:02,400
in a game theoretic situation with a
 

4029
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:03,349
in a game theoretic situation with a
human that's

4030
01:09:03,349 --> 01:09:03,359
human that's
 

4031
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:06,470
human that's
still hard

4032
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:06,480
still hard
 

4033
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,229
still hard
but just to speak to the you know

4034
01:09:08,229 --> 01:09:08,239
but just to speak to the you know
 

4035
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:10,229
but just to speak to the you know
quickly reasoning about contact

4036
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:10,239
quickly reasoning about contact
 

4037
01:09:10,239 --> 01:09:11,829
quickly reasoning about contact
part of it for instance yeah maybe even

4038
01:09:11,829 --> 01:09:11,839
part of it for instance yeah maybe even
 

4039
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:13,349
part of it for instance yeah maybe even
throwing the game theory out of it

4040
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
throwing the game theory out of it
 

4041
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,309
throwing the game theory out of it
almost like uh yeah almost like a

4042
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
almost like uh yeah almost like a
 

4043
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,669
almost like uh yeah almost like a
non-dynamic opponent

4044
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
non-dynamic opponent
 

4045
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,910
non-dynamic opponent
right there's reasons to be optimistic

4046
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
right there's reasons to be optimistic
 

4047
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,189
right there's reasons to be optimistic
but i think our

4048
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:21,199
but i think our
 

4049
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:22,709
but i think our
best understanding of those problems are

4050
01:09:22,709 --> 01:09:22,719
best understanding of those problems are
 

4051
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:24,309
best understanding of those problems are
still pretty hard

4052
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:24,319
still pretty hard
 

4053
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,309
still pretty hard
um i have been increasingly focused on

4054
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
um i have been increasingly focused on
 

4055
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,870
um i have been increasingly focused on
manipulation partly where that's a case

4056
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:30,880
manipulation partly where that's a case
 

4057
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:32,550
manipulation partly where that's a case
where the contact has to be much more

4058

4061
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,590

and there are some really impressive

4062
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:37,600
and there are some really impressive
 

4063
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,070
and there are some really impressive
examples of of deep learning

4064
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:40,080
examples of of deep learning
 

4065
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:43,510
examples of of deep learning

policies controllers that
 

4067
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,269
policies controllers that
that can appear to do good things

through contact
 

4071
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:51,030
through contact
we've even got new examples of of

4072
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
we've even got new examples of of
 

4073
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,630
we've even got new examples of of
you know deep learning models of

4074
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:52,640
you know deep learning models of
 

4075
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:53,910
you know deep learning models of
predicting what's going to happen to

4076
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:53,920
predicting what's going to happen to
 

4077
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,070
predicting what's going to happen to
objects as they go through contact

objects as they go through contact
 

4079
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,790
objects as they go through contact
but i think the challenge you just

4080
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
but i think the challenge you just
 

4081
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,750
but i think the challenge you just
offered there

4082

offered there
 

4083
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:02,790
offered there
still eludes us right the ability to

4084
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
still eludes us right the ability to
 

4085
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,550
still eludes us right the ability to
make a decision based on those models

4086
01:10:04,550 --> 01:10:04,560
make a decision based on those models
 

4087
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,430
make a decision based on those models
quickly

4089
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,790

you know i have to think though it's

4090
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
you know i have to think though it's
 

4091
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:10,630
you know i have to think though it's
hard for humans too when you get that

4092
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:10,640
hard for humans too when you get that
 

4093
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:13,270
hard for humans too when you get that
complicated i think probably

4094
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
complicated i think probably
 

4095
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,070
complicated i think probably
you had maybe a slow-motion version of

4096
01:10:16,070 --> 01:10:16,080
you had maybe a slow-motion version of
 

4097
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,990
you had maybe a slow-motion version of
where you learn the basic skills

4098
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:18,000
where you learn the basic skills
 

4099
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,630
where you learn the basic skills
and you've probably gotten better at it

4100
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
and you've probably gotten better at it
 

4101
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:21,430
and you've probably gotten better at it
and and

4102
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:21,440
and and
 

4103
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,470
and and
um there's there's much more subtlety

4104
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:24,480
um there's there's much more subtlety
 

4105
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,790
um there's there's much more subtlety
but it might still be hard to actually

4106
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:26,800
but it might still be hard to actually
 

4107
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,910
but it might still be hard to actually
you know

4108
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
you know
 

4109
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:31,350
you know
really on the fly take a you know model

4110
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:31,360
really on the fly take a you know model
 

4111
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,830
really on the fly take a you know model
of your humanoid and figure out how to

4112
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840
of your humanoid and figure out how to
 

4113
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,270
of your humanoid and figure out how to
how to plan the optimal sequence that

4114
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:35,280
how to plan the optimal sequence that
 

4115
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,790
how to plan the optimal sequence that
might be a problem we never solve well

4116
01:10:36,790 --> 01:10:36,800
might be a problem we never solve well

the i mean one of the most amazing
 

4121
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:40,790

things to me about
 

4123
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:43,590
things to me about
the we could talk about martial arts uh

4124
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
the we could talk about martial arts uh
 

4125
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,189
the we could talk about martial arts uh
we could also talk about dancing

4126
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:45,199
we could also talk about dancing
 

4127
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,950
we could also talk about dancing
it doesn't really matter too human

4128
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
it doesn't really matter too human
 

4129
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,470
it doesn't really matter too human
i think it's the most interesting study

4130
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
i think it's the most interesting study
 

4131
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,229
i think it's the most interesting study
of contact it's not even the dynamic

4132
01:10:52,229 --> 01:10:52,239
of contact it's not even the dynamic
 

4133
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:53,030
of contact it's not even the dynamic
element of it

4134
01:10:53,030 --> 01:10:53,040
element of it
 

4135
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,630
element of it
it's the like when you get good at it

4136
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:56,640
it's the like when you get good at it
 

4137
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,669
it's the like when you get good at it
it's so effortless like i can just

4138
01:10:59,669 --> 01:10:59,679
it's so effortless like i can just
 

4139
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:01,669
it's so effortless like i can just
i'm very cognizant of the entirety of

i'm very cognizant of the entirety of
 

4141
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:03,350
i'm very cognizant of the entirety of
the learning process

4142
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:03,360
the learning process
 

4143
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,709
the learning process
being essentially like learning how to

4144
01:11:06,709 --> 01:11:06,719
being essentially like learning how to
 

4145
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:07,590
being essentially like learning how to
move my body

4146
01:11:07,590 --> 01:11:07,600
move my body
 

4147
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,590
move my body
in a way that i could throw very large

4148
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:11,600
in a way that i could throw very large
 

4149
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:15,110
in a way that i could throw very large
weights around effortlessly

4150
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,120
weights around effortlessly
 

4151
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:18,310
weights around effortlessly
like and and i can feel the learning

4152
01:11:18,310 --> 01:11:18,320
like and and i can feel the learning
 

4153
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:20,390
like and and i can feel the learning
like i'm a huge believer in drilling of

4154
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:20,400
like i'm a huge believer in drilling of
 

4155
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,430
like i'm a huge believer in drilling of
techniques

4156
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:21,440
techniques
 

4157
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:23,510
techniques
and you can just like feel your i don't

4158
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:23,520
and you can just like feel your i don't
 

4159
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:24,630
and you can just like feel your i don't
you're not feeling

4160
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:24,640
you're not feeling
 

4161
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,350
you're not feeling
you're feeling um sorry you're learning

4162
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:27,360
you're feeling um sorry you're learning
 

4163
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:27,990
you're feeling um sorry you're learning
it

4164
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:28,000
it
 

4165
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,390
it
intellectually a little bit but a lot of

4166
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,400
intellectually a little bit but a lot of
 

4167
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,270
intellectually a little bit but a lot of
it is the body

4168
01:11:31,270 --> 01:11:31,280
it is the body
 

4169
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:33,030
it is the body
learning it somehow uh like

4170
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:33,040
learning it somehow uh like
 

4171
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,110
learning it somehow uh like
instinctually and whatever that learning

4172
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:35,120
instinctually and whatever that learning
 

4173
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:35,910
instinctually and whatever that learning
is

4174
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
is
 

4175
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,630
is
that's really i'm not even sure if

4176
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:38,640
that's really i'm not even sure if
 

4177
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:39,189
that's really i'm not even sure if
that's

4178
01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
that's
 

4179
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:42,229
that's
um equivalent to uh like a

4180
01:11:42,229 --> 01:11:42,239
um equivalent to uh like a
 

4181
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:44,709
um equivalent to uh like a
deep learning learning a controller i

4182
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
deep learning learning a controller i
 

4183
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:46,630
deep learning learning a controller i
think it's something more

4184
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:46,640
think it's something more
 

4185
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:48,550
think it's something more
it feels like there's a lot of

4186
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:48,560
it feels like there's a lot of
 

4187
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,270
it feels like there's a lot of
distributed learning going on

4188
01:11:51,270 --> 01:11:51,280
distributed learning going on
 

4189
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,430
distributed learning going on
yeah i think there's hierarchy and

4190
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
yeah i think there's hierarchy and
 

4191
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,390
yeah i think there's hierarchy and
composition

4192
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:54,400
composition
 

4193
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:58,149
composition
yeah um probably in the systems that we

4194
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
yeah um probably in the systems that we
 

4195
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:58,550
yeah um probably in the systems that we
don't

4196
01:11:58,550 --> 01:11:58,560
don't
 

4197
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,510
don't
capture very well yet uh you have layers

4198
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
capture very well yet uh you have layers
 

4199
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,189
capture very well yet uh you have layers
of control systems you have reflexes at

4200
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
of control systems you have reflexes at
 

4201
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:05,510
of control systems you have reflexes at
the bottom layer and you have a

4202
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:05,520
the bottom layer and you have a
 

4203
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:07,910
the bottom layer and you have a
you know a system that's capable of

4204
01:12:07,910 --> 01:12:07,920
you know a system that's capable of
 

4205
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:10,310
you know a system that's capable of
planning a vacation to

4206
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
planning a vacation to
 

4207
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,390
planning a vacation to
some distant country which is probably

4208
01:12:12,390 --> 01:12:12,400
some distant country which is probably
 

4209
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,510
some distant country which is probably
you probably don't have a

4210
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
you probably don't have a
 

4211
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:16,790
you probably don't have a
controller a policy for every possible

4212
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:16,800
controller a policy for every possible
 

4213
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,229
controller a policy for every possible
destination you'll ever pick right um

4214
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:20,239
destination you'll ever pick right um
 

4215
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:22,310
destination you'll ever pick right um
but there's something magical in the in

4216
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
but there's something magical in the in
 

4217
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,350
but there's something magical in the in
between

4218
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
between
 

4219
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,510
between
and how do you go from these low-level

4220
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:25,520
and how do you go from these low-level
 

4221
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,030
and how do you go from these low-level
feedback loops to something that

4222
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
feedback loops to something that
 

4223
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:30,310
feedback loops to something that
feels like a pretty complex set of

4224
01:12:30,310 --> 01:12:30,320
feels like a pretty complex set of
 

4225
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,630
feels like a pretty complex set of
outcomes

4226
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:32,640
outcomes
 

4227
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:34,149
outcomes
you know my guess is i think i think

4228
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:34,159
you know my guess is i think i think
 

4229
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:35,830
you know my guess is i think i think
there's evidence that you can plan at

4230
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:35,840
there's evidence that you can plan at
 

4231
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:36,709
there's evidence that you can plan at
some of these levels

4232
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
some of these levels
 

4233
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,830
some of these levels
right so uh josh tenenbaum just showed

4234
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
right so uh josh tenenbaum just showed
 

4235
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,070
right so uh josh tenenbaum just showed
it

4236
01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:40,080
it
 

4237
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:41,990
it
in his talk the other day he's got a

4238
01:12:41,990 --> 01:12:42,000
in his talk the other day he's got a
 

4239
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,270
in his talk the other day he's got a
game he likes to talk about

4240
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
game he likes to talk about
 

4241
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,510
game he likes to talk about
i think he calls it the pick 3 game or

4242
01:12:45,510 --> 01:12:45,520
i think he calls it the pick 3 game or
 

4243
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,630
i think he calls it the pick 3 game or
something

4244
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:46,640
something
 

4245
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,149
something
where he puts a bunch of clutter down in

4246
01:12:48,149 --> 01:12:48,159
where he puts a bunch of clutter down in
 

4247
01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:50,630
where he puts a bunch of clutter down in
front of a person

4248
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:50,640
front of a person
 

4249
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,390
front of a person
and he says okay pick three objects and

4250
01:12:52,390 --> 01:12:52,400
and he says okay pick three objects and
 

4251
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:53,750
and he says okay pick three objects and
it might be a

4252
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
it might be a
 

4253
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:58,310
it might be a
telephone or a shoe or a kleenex box or

4254
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:58,320
telephone or a shoe or a kleenex box or
 

4255
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,030
telephone or a shoe or a kleenex box or
whatever and apparently you pick three

4256
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:01,040
whatever and apparently you pick three
 

4257
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:02,229
whatever and apparently you pick three
items and then you pick he says okay

4258
01:13:02,229 --> 01:13:02,239
items and then you pick he says okay
 

4259
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:02,870
items and then you pick he says okay
pick the

4260
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:02,880
pick the
 

4261
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:04,070
pick the
first one up with your right hand the

4262
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
first one up with your right hand the
 

4263
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,310
first one up with your right hand the
second one up with your left hand

4264
01:13:06,310 --> 01:13:06,320
second one up with your left hand
 

4265
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,390
second one up with your left hand
now using those objects those now as

4266
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
now using those objects those now as
 

4267
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,950
now using those objects those now as
tools pick up the third object

4268
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:10,960
tools pick up the third object
 

4269
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,870
tools pick up the third object
right so that's down at the level of

4270
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880

 

4271
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,550

of physics and mechanics and contact

4272
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:16,560
of physics and mechanics and contact
 

4273
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,950
of physics and mechanics and contact
mechanics that

4274
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:18,960
mechanics that
 

4275
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,950
mechanics that
that i think we do learning we do have

4276
01:13:20,950 --> 01:13:20,960
that i think we do learning we do have
 

4277
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:23,189
that i think we do learning we do have
policies for we do control for

4278
01:13:23,189 --> 01:13:23,199
policies for we do control for
 

4279
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,510
policies for we do control for
almost feedback but somehow we're able

4280
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:25,520
almost feedback but somehow we're able
 

4281
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,830
almost feedback but somehow we're able
to still i mean i've never picked up a

4282
01:13:27,830 --> 01:13:27,840
to still i mean i've never picked up a
 

4283
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,669
to still i mean i've never picked up a
telephone with a shoe and a water bottle

4284
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
telephone with a shoe and a water bottle
 

4285
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,189
telephone with a shoe and a water bottle
before and somehow

4286
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
before and somehow
 

4287
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:32,709
before and somehow
and it takes me a little longer to do

4288
01:13:32,709 --> 01:13:32,719
and it takes me a little longer to do
 

4289
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:34,310
and it takes me a little longer to do
that the first time

4290
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
that the first time
 

4291
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,590
that the first time
but most of the time we can sort of

4292
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:35,600
but most of the time we can sort of
 

4293
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:39,669
but most of the time we can sort of
figure that out so

4294
01:13:39,669 --> 01:13:39,679

 

4295
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:41,430

yeah i think the amazing thing is this

4296
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:41,440
yeah i think the amazing thing is this
 

4297
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,030
yeah i think the amazing thing is this
ability to be flexible

4298
01:13:43,030 --> 01:13:43,040
ability to be flexible
 

4299
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,070
ability to be flexible
with our models plan when we need to

4300
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:46,080
with our models plan when we need to
 

4301
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,870
with our models plan when we need to
use our well-oiled controllers when we

4302
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:48,880
use our well-oiled controllers when we
 

4303
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:49,590
use our well-oiled controllers when we
don't

4304
01:13:49,590 --> 01:13:49,600
don't
 

4305
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,189
don't
when we're in familiar territory um

4306
01:13:53,189 --> 01:13:53,199
when we're in familiar territory um
 

4307
01:13:53,199 --> 01:13:54,790
when we're in familiar territory um
having models i think the the other

4308
01:13:54,790 --> 01:13:54,800
having models i think the the other
 

4309
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:57,030
having models i think the the other
thing you just said was something about

4310
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:57,040
thing you just said was something about
 

4311
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,390
thing you just said was something about
i think your awareness of what's

4312
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
i think your awareness of what's
 

4313
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,470
i think your awareness of what's
happening is even changing as you as you

4314
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480
happening is even changing as you as you
 

4315
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:00,870
happening is even changing as you as you
get

4316
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:00,880
get
 

4317
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,030
get
as you improve your expertise right so

4318
01:14:03,030 --> 01:14:03,040
as you improve your expertise right so
 

4319
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:04,870
as you improve your expertise right so
maybe you have a very approximate model

4320
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:04,880
maybe you have a very approximate model
 

4321
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:06,470
maybe you have a very approximate model
of the mechanics to begin with and as

4322
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:06,480
of the mechanics to begin with and as
 

4323
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,470
of the mechanics to begin with and as
you gain

4324
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:08,480
you gain
 

4325
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,110
you gain
expertise you get a more refined version

4326
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
expertise you get a more refined version
 

4327
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,229
expertise you get a more refined version
of that model you're aware of

4328
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:14,239
of that model you're aware of
 

4329
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,270
of that model you're aware of
muscles or balance components that you

4330
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
muscles or balance components that you
 

4331
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,830
muscles or balance components that you
just weren't even aware of before so how

4332
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:19,840
just weren't even aware of before so how
 

4333
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,590
just weren't even aware of before so how
do you scaffold that

4334
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:21,600
do you scaffold that
 

4335
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:24,630
do you scaffold that
yeah plus the fear of injury the

4336
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:24,640
yeah plus the fear of injury the
 

4337
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,790
yeah plus the fear of injury the
ambition of goals of excelling

4338
01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:28,800
ambition of goals of excelling
 

4339
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,830
ambition of goals of excelling
and uh fear of mortality

4340
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
and uh fear of mortality
 

4341
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,510
and uh fear of mortality
let's see what else is in there as the

4342
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:33,520
let's see what else is in there as the
 

4343
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,110
let's see what else is in there as the
motivations

4344
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:35,120
motivations
 

4345
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,390
motivations
uh overinflated ego in the beginning

4346
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:38,400
uh overinflated ego in the beginning
 

4347
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:41,750
uh overinflated ego in the beginning
uh like and then a crash of confidence

4348
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:41,760
uh like and then a crash of confidence
 

4349
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,790
uh like and then a crash of confidence
in the middle

4350
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:42,800
in the middle
 

4351
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:45,590
in the middle
all of those seem to be essential for

4352
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:45,600
all of those seem to be essential for
 

4353
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:46,630
all of those seem to be essential for
the learning process

4354
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:46,640
the learning process
 

4355
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,149
the learning process
and also and if all that's good then

4356
01:14:48,149 --> 01:14:48,159
and also and if all that's good then
 

4357
01:14:48,159 --> 01:14:49,830
and also and if all that's good then
you're probably optimizing energy

4358
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:49,840
you're probably optimizing energy
 

4359
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:50,470
you're probably optimizing energy
efficiency

4360
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:50,480
efficiency
 

4361
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:52,709
efficiency
yeah right so we have to get that right

4362
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
yeah right so we have to get that right
 

4363
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:54,390
yeah right so we have to get that right
uh so um

4364
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:54,400
uh so um
 

4365
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,310
uh so um
you know there was this idea that you

4366
01:14:56,310 --> 01:14:56,320
you know there was this idea that you
 

4367
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,590
you know there was this idea that you
would have

4368
01:14:57,590 --> 01:14:57,600
would have
 

4369
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,110
would have
uh robots play soccer better

4370
01:15:01,110 --> 01:15:01,120
uh robots play soccer better
 

4371
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:04,149
uh robots play soccer better
than human players by 2050 that was the

4372
01:15:04,149 --> 01:15:04,159
than human players by 2050 that was the
 

4373
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:04,950
than human players by 2050 that was the
goal

4374
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
goal
 

4375
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,070
goal
uh world basically was the goal to beat

4376
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:08,080
uh world basically was the goal to beat
 

4377
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:10,950
uh world basically was the goal to beat
world champion team to become a world

4378
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
world champion team to become a world
 

4379
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,270
world champion team to become a world
cup

4380
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:11,280
cup
 

4381
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,430
cup

mixed martial artist uh that's a robot
 

4401
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:35,750
mixed martial artist uh that's a robot
i mean it's very hard to to say one

4402
01:15:35,750 --> 01:15:35,760
i mean it's very hard to to say one
 

4403
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:36,790
i mean it's very hard to to say one
thing is a harder

4404
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
thing is a harder
 

4405
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,390
thing is a harder
one some problems harder than the other

4406
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
one some problems harder than the other
 

4407
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,709
one some problems harder than the other
what probably matters is

4408
01:15:40,709 --> 01:15:40,719
what probably matters is
 

4409
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,390
what probably matters is
um who who who started the organization

4410
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:44,400
um who who who started the organization
 

4411
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,990
um who who who started the organization
that that i mean i think robocup has a

4412
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:46,000
that that i mean i think robocup has a
 

4413
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,830
that that i mean i think robocup has a
pretty serious following and there

4414
01:15:47,830 --> 01:15:47,840
pretty serious following and there
 

4415
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:50,390
pretty serious following and there
is a history now of people playing that

4416
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
is a history now of people playing that
 

4417
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:51,990
is a history now of people playing that
game learning about that game building

4418
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
game learning about that game building
 

4419
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,990
game learning about that game building
robots to play that game building

4420
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
robots to play that game building
 

4421
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,669
robots to play that game building
increasingly more human robots

4422
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:55,679
increasingly more human robots
 

4423
01:15:55,679 --> 01:15:58,630
increasingly more human robots
it's got momentum and so if you want to

4424
01:15:58,630 --> 01:15:58,640
it's got momentum and so if you want to
 

4425
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,189
it's got momentum and so if you want to
uh

4426
01:15:59,189 --> 01:15:59,199
uh
 

4427
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:00,870
uh
to have mixed martial arts compete you

4428
01:16:00,870 --> 01:16:00,880
to have mixed martial arts compete you
 

4429
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,310
to have mixed martial arts compete you
better start your

4430
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:02,320
better start your
 

4431

i think almost independent of which
 

4435
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:08,709
i think almost independent of which
problem is technically harder because

4436
01:16:08,709 --> 01:16:08,719
problem is technically harder because
 

4437
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:09,430
problem is technically harder because
they're

4438
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:09,440
they're
 

4439
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,189
they're
both hard and they're both different

4440
01:16:11,189 --> 01:16:11,199
both hard and they're both different
 

4441
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,709
both hard and they're both different
that's a good point i mean

4442
01:16:12,709 --> 01:16:12,719
that's a good point i mean
 

4443
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,590
that's a good point i mean
those videos are just hilarious like uh

4444
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:15,600
those videos are just hilarious like uh
 

4445
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,830
those videos are just hilarious like uh
especially the humanoid robots trying to

4446
01:16:18,830 --> 01:16:18,840
especially the humanoid robots trying to
 

4447
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,110
especially the humanoid robots trying to
um trying to play soccer

robo one competitions
 

4457
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,310
robo one competitions
um where they do have these robots that

4458
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
um where they do have these robots that
 

4459
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,070
um where they do have these robots that
go on the table and basically fight so

mind for
 

4467
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:37,990
mind for
uh robocup just from a robotics

4468
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:38,000
uh robocup just from a robotics
 

4469
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:38,870
uh robocup just from a robotics
perspective

4470
01:16:38,870 --> 01:16:38,880
perspective
 

4471
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,110
perspective
it seems like a super exciting

it seems like a super exciting
 

4473
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:41,990
it seems like a super exciting
possibility

possibility
 

4475
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,750
possibility
that um like in the physical

4476
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:45,760
that um like in the physical
 

4477
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,990
that um like in the physical
space this is what's interesting i think

4478
01:16:47,990 --> 01:16:48,000
space this is what's interesting i think
 

4479
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,390
space this is what's interesting i think
the world is captivated

4480
01:16:50,390 --> 01:16:50,400
the world is captivated
 

4481

it inspires a huge number of people when
 

4485
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:00,630
it inspires a huge number of people when
a machine beats a human

4486
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:00,640
a machine beats a human
 

4487
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:02,790
a machine beats a human
at a game that humans are really damn

good at so you're talking about chess
 

4491
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:05,590
good at so you're talking about chess
and go

4492
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
and go
 

4493
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:08,630
and go
but that's in the in the world of uh

4494
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:08,640
but that's in the in the world of uh
 

4495
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,750
but that's in the in the world of uh
digital i don't think

4496
01:17:11,750 --> 01:17:11,760
digital i don't think
 

4497
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,390
digital i don't think
machines have beat humans at a game in

4498
01:17:14,390 --> 01:17:14,400
machines have beat humans at a game in
 

4499
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,550
machines have beat humans at a game in
the physical space yet but that would be

4500
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
the physical space yet but that would be
 

4501
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,510
the physical space yet but that would be
just

4502
01:17:17,510 --> 01:17:17,520
just
 

4503
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:18,790
just
you have to make the rules very

4504
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:18,800
you have to make the rules very
 

4505
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,950
you have to make the rules very
carefully right i mean if

4506
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:20,960
carefully right i mean if
 

4507
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,870
carefully right i mean if
if atlas kicked me in the shins i'm down

4508
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:22,880
if atlas kicked me in the shins i'm down
 

4509
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:23,990
if atlas kicked me in the shins i'm down
and uh you know

4510
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:24,000
and uh you know
 

4511
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,189
and uh you know
and and game over so there's you know

4512
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
and and game over so there's you know
 

4513
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:27,590
and and game over so there's you know
it's

4514
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
it's
 

4515
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,630
it's
it's very subtle on yeah i think that's

4516
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
it's very subtle on yeah i think that's
 

4517
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,630
it's very subtle on yeah i think that's
fair i think the fighting one is a weird

4518
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:32,640
fair i think the fighting one is a weird
 

4519
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:33,990
fair i think the fighting one is a weird
one yeah because uh

4520
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,000
one yeah because uh
 

4521
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,189
one yeah because uh
you're talking about a machine that's

4522
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
you're talking about a machine that's
 

4523
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,030
you're talking about a machine that's
much stronger than you but

4524
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:37,040
much stronger than you but
 

4525
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,110
much stronger than you but
yeah in terms of soccer basketball all

4526
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:39,120
yeah in terms of soccer basketball all
 

4527
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,630
yeah in terms of soccer basketball all
those kinds of soccer right i mean as

4528
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
those kinds of soccer right i mean as
 

4529
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,149
those kinds of soccer right i mean as
soon as there's contact

4530
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
soon as there's contact
 

4531
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,630
soon as there's contact
or whatever and there's there are some

4532
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:44,640
or whatever and there's there are some
 

4533
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:46,709
or whatever and there's there are some
things that the robot will do better i

4534
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
things that the robot will do better i
 

4535
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,830
things that the robot will do better i
think

4536
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:47,840
think
 

4537
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:50,630
think
if you really set yourself up to try to

4538
01:17:50,630 --> 01:17:50,640
if you really set yourself up to try to
 

4539
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:51,350
if you really set yourself up to try to
see

4540
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
see
 

4541
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,189
see
could robots win the game of soccer as

4542
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
could robots win the game of soccer as
 

4543
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,590
could robots win the game of soccer as
the rules were written

4544
01:17:55,590 --> 01:17:55,600
the rules were written
 

4545
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,950
the rules were written
the right thing for the robot to do is

4546
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:56,960
the right thing for the robot to do is
 

4547
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,870
the right thing for the robot to do is
to play very differently than a human

4548
01:17:58,870 --> 01:17:58,880
to play very differently than a human
 

4549
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:01,110
to play very differently than a human
would play it's you're not going to get

4550
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
would play it's you're not going to get
 

4551
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,550
would play it's you're not going to get
you know the perfect

4552
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:02,560
you know the perfect
 

4553
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:04,310
you know the perfect
soccer player robot you're going to get

4554
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:04,320
soccer player robot you're going to get
 

4555
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,830
soccer player robot you're going to get
something that

4556
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
something that
 

4557
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:09,990
something that
exploits the rules exploits its super

4558
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
exploits the rules exploits its super
 

4559
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,950
exploits the rules exploits its super
actuators it's super low bandwidth um

4560
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
actuators it's super low bandwidth um
 

4561
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,470
actuators it's super low bandwidth um
you know feedback loops or whatever and

4562
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
you know feedback loops or whatever and
 

4563
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,590
you know feedback loops or whatever and
it's going to play the game differently

4564
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:15,600
it's going to play the game differently
 

4565
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,430
it's going to play the game differently
than you want it to play yeah

4566
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:17,440
than you want it to play yeah
 

4567
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:19,910
than you want it to play yeah
um and it i bet there's ways there's i

4568
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:19,920
um and it i bet there's ways there's i
 

4569
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,030
um and it i bet there's ways there's i
bet there's loopholes

4570
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:21,040
bet there's loopholes
 

4571
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,350
bet there's loopholes
right we saw that in the in the darpa

4572
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:23,360
right we saw that in the in the darpa
 

4573
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,709
right we saw that in the in the darpa
challenge

4574
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:24,719
challenge
 

4575
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:27,510
challenge
that that it's very hard to write a set

4576
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:27,520
that that it's very hard to write a set
 

4577
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:29,830
that that it's very hard to write a set
of rules that someone can't find

4578
01:18:29,830 --> 01:18:29,840
of rules that someone can't find
 

4579
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,510
of rules that someone can't find
uh a way to exploit let me ask another

4580
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:33,520
uh a way to exploit let me ask another
 

4581
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:35,030
uh a way to exploit let me ask another
ridiculous question

4582
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
ridiculous question
 

4583
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,030

robots

4678
01:20:13,910 --> 01:20:13,920
robots
 

4679
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,590
robots
uh do you have a two questions one do

4680
01:20:17,590 --> 01:20:17,600
uh do you have a two questions one do
 

4681
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:19,189
uh do you have a two questions one do
you have an understanding of why people

4682
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
you have an understanding of why people

are afraid
 

4685
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:23,669
are afraid
of robots and the second question is

4686
01:20:23,669 --> 01:20:23,679
of robots and the second question is
 

4687
01:20:23,679 --> 01:20:25,830
of robots and the second question is
uh in black mirror just to tell you the

4688
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
uh in black mirror just to tell you the
 

4689
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,270
uh in black mirror just to tell you the
episode i don't even remember it that

4690

episode i don't even remember it that
 

4691
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:27,669
episode i don't even remember it that
much

4692
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
much
 

4693
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,390
much
anymore but these robots i think they

4694
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:30,400
anymore but these robots i think they
 

4695
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:31,510
anymore but these robots i think they
can shoot like a

4696
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:31,520
can shoot like a
 

4697
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,430
can shoot like a
pellet or something they basically have

4698
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
pellet or something they basically have
 

4699
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:36,470
pellet or something they basically have
it's basically a spot with a gun

4700
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:36,480
it's basically a spot with a gun
 

4701
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,950
it's basically a spot with a gun
and um how far are we away from

4702
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
and um how far are we away from
 

4703
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:43,750
and um how far are we away from
having robots that go rogue like that

4704
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
having robots that go rogue like that
 

4705
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,189
having robots that go rogue like that
you know basically spot

4706
01:20:45,189 --> 01:20:45,199
you know basically spot
 

4707
01:20:45,199 --> 01:20:48,310
you know basically spot
that goes rogue for some reason

4708
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
that goes rogue for some reason
 

4709
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:51,910
that goes rogue for some reason
and somehow finds a gun right

4710
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:51,920
and somehow finds a gun right
 

4711
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,750
and somehow finds a gun right
so i mean i'm i'm not a psychologist

4712
01:20:55,750 --> 01:20:55,760
so i mean i'm i'm not a psychologist
 

4713
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:59,750
so i mean i'm i'm not a psychologist
um i think i don't know exactly why

4714
01:20:59,750 --> 01:20:59,760
um i think i don't know exactly why
 

4715
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:03,510
um i think i don't know exactly why
people react the way they do

4716
01:21:03,510 --> 01:21:03,520

 

4717
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:06,950

i think i think we have to be careful

4718
01:21:06,950 --> 01:21:06,960
i think i think we have to be careful
 

4719
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,870
i think i think we have to be careful
about the way robots influence our

4720
01:21:08,870 --> 01:21:08,880
about the way robots influence our
 

4721
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:10,229
about the way robots influence our
society and the like i think that's

4722
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
society and the like i think that's
 

4723
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:11,750
society and the like i think that's
something that's a responsibility that

4724
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
something that's a responsibility that
 

4725
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,709
something that's a responsibility that
roboticists

4726
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:12,719
roboticists
 

4727
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,070
roboticists
need to embrace i don't think

4728
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:16,080
need to embrace i don't think
 

4729
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,669
need to embrace i don't think
robots are going to come after me with a

4730
01:21:17,669 --> 01:21:17,679
robots are going to come after me with a
 

4731
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,590
robots are going to come after me with a
kitchen knife or a pellet gun

4732
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:19,600
kitchen knife or a pellet gun
 

4733
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:21,750
kitchen knife or a pellet gun
right away and i mean if they were

4734
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:21,760
right away and i mean if they were
 

4735
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:23,910
right away and i mean if they were
programmed in such a way but

4736
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
programmed in such a way but
 

4737
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,110
programmed in such a way but
i used to joke with atlas that

4738
01:21:27,110 --> 01:21:27,120
i used to joke with atlas that
 

4739
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,629
i used to joke with atlas that
all i had to do was run for five minutes

4740
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,639
all i had to do was run for five minutes
 

4741
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,870
all i had to do was run for five minutes
and it's battery would run out but uh

4742
01:21:30,870 --> 01:21:30,880
and it's battery would run out but uh
 

4743
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,390
and it's battery would run out but uh
actually they've got a very big battery

4744
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:32,400
actually they've got a very big battery
 

4745
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,990
actually they've got a very big battery
in there by the end so it was over an

4746
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,000
in there by the end so it was over an
 

4747
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,830
in there by the end so it was over an
hour

4748
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:35,840
hour
 

4749
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,030
hour
um i think the fear is a bit cultural

4750
01:21:39,030 --> 01:21:39,040
um i think the fear is a bit cultural
 

4751
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:39,750
um i think the fear is a bit cultural
though because i

4752
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:39,760
though because i
 

4753
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:43,430
though because i
i mean you notice that like i think

4754
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:43,440
i mean you notice that like i think
 

4755
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:46,709
i mean you notice that like i think
in my age in the u.s we grew up watching

4756
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:46,719
in my age in the u.s we grew up watching
 

4757
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:47,910
in my age in the u.s we grew up watching
terminator

4758
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:47,920
terminator
 

4759
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,750
terminator
right if i had grown up at the same time

4760
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:49,760
right if i had grown up at the same time
 

4761
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:51,030
right if i had grown up at the same time
in japan i probably would have been

4762
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:51,040
in japan i probably would have been
 

4763
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:52,629
in japan i probably would have been
watching astro boy

4764
01:21:52,629 --> 01:21:52,639
watching astro boy
 

4765
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:54,790
watching astro boy
and there's a very different reaction to

4766
01:21:54,790 --> 01:21:54,800
and there's a very different reaction to
 

4767
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:55,750
and there's a very different reaction to
robots

4768
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:55,760
robots
 

4769
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,229
robots
in different countries right so i don't

4770
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
in different countries right so i don't
 

4771
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,110
in different countries right so i don't
know if it's a human

4772
01:21:59,110 --> 01:21:59,120
know if it's a human
 

4773
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,950
know if it's a human
innate fear of metal marvels or if it's

4774
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:04,960
innate fear of metal marvels or if it's
 

4775
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:06,229
innate fear of metal marvels or if it's
something that we've done to ourselves

4776
01:22:06,229 --> 01:22:06,239
something that we've done to ourselves
 

4777
01:22:06,239 --> 01:22:09,669
something that we've done to ourselves
with our sci-fi

4778
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:09,679

 

4779
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,189

i think there is a legitimate fear there

4854
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:33,679
i think there is a legitimate fear there
 

4855
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:34,070
i think there is a legitimate fear there
because

4856
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
because
 

4857
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,669
because
so much of our future is uncertain

4858
01:23:37,669 --> 01:23:37,679
so much of our future is uncertain
 

4859
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,430
so much of our future is uncertain
but at the same time technically

4860
01:23:39,430 --> 01:23:39,440
but at the same time technically
 

4861
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:41,189
but at the same time technically
speaking it seems like we're not there

4862
01:23:41,189 --> 01:23:41,199
speaking it seems like we're not there
 

4863
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:41,750
speaking it seems like we're not there
yet

4864
01:23:41,750 --> 01:23:41,760
yet
 

4865
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,030
yet
so what do you say i mean i think

4866
01:23:45,030 --> 01:23:45,040
so what do you say i mean i think
 

4867
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,390
so what do you say i mean i think
technology

4868
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
technology
 

4869
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,430
technology
is um complicated it can be used in many

4870
01:23:49,430 --> 01:23:49,440
is um complicated it can be used in many
 

4871
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,030
is um complicated it can be used in many
ways i think there are

4872
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:51,040
ways i think there are
 

4873
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:55,510
ways i think there are
purely software um

4874
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:55,520

 

4875
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:57,910

attacks that somebody could use to do

4876
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
attacks that somebody could use to do
 

4877
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:58,950
attacks that somebody could use to do
great damage

4878
01:23:58,950 --> 01:23:58,960
great damage
 

4879
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,430
great damage
maybe they have already um you know i

4880
01:24:01,430 --> 01:24:01,440
maybe they have already um you know i
 

4881
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:02,470
maybe they have already um you know i
think

4882
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:02,480
think
 

4883
01:24:02,480 --> 01:24:05,590
think
uh wheeled robots

4884
01:24:05,590 --> 01:24:05,600
uh wheeled robots
 

4885
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,030
uh wheeled robots
could be used in bad ways too

4886
01:24:09,030 --> 01:24:09,040
could be used in bad ways too
 

4887
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,189
could be used in bad ways too
drones right um

4888
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:13,199

 

4889
01:24:13,199 --> 01:24:16,229

i don't think that let's see

4890
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:16,239
i don't think that let's see
 

4891
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:19,189
i don't think that let's see
i don't want to be um building

4892
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:19,199
i don't want to be um building
 

4893
01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:20,310
i don't want to be um building
technology just

4894
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:20,320
technology just
 

4895
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,270
technology just
because i'm compelled to build

4896
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
because i'm compelled to build
 

4897
01:24:21,280 --> 01:24:23,430
because i'm compelled to build
technology and i don't think about it

4898
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:23,440
technology and i don't think about it
 

4899
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:26,229
technology and i don't think about it
but i would consider myself a

4900
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
but i would consider myself a
 

4901
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,669
but i would consider myself a
technological optimist

4902
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
technological optimist
 

4903
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:30,870
technological optimist
i guess um in the sense that

4904
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:30,880
i guess um in the sense that
 

4905
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:34,229
i guess um in the sense that
i think we should continue to create and

4906
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
i think we should continue to create and
 

4907
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:35,669
i think we should continue to create and
evolve and our

4908
01:24:35,669 --> 01:24:35,679
evolve and our
 

4909
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,030
evolve and our
world will change um and if we will

4910
01:24:39,030 --> 01:24:39,040
world will change um and if we will
 

4911
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,830
world will change um and if we will
introduce new challenges we'll screw

4912
01:24:41,830 --> 01:24:41,840
introduce new challenges we'll screw
 

4913
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,790
introduce new challenges we'll screw
something up maybe

4914
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:42,800
something up maybe
 

4915
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,149
something up maybe
but i think also we'll invent ourselves

4916
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
but i think also we'll invent ourselves
 

4917
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,470
but i think also we'll invent ourselves
out of those challenges and life will go

4918
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:48,480
out of those challenges and life will go
 

4919
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:49,270
out of those challenges and life will go
on

4920
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,280
on
 

4921
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,030
on
so it's interesting because you didn't

4922
01:24:51,030 --> 01:24:51,040
so it's interesting because you didn't
 

4923
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:52,390
so it's interesting because you didn't
mention like this is

4924
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:52,400
mention like this is
 

4925
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,030
mention like this is
technically too hard i don't think

4926
01:24:55,030 --> 01:24:55,040
technically too hard i don't think
 

4927
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:56,550
technically too hard i don't think
robots are i think people

4928
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:56,560
robots are i think people
 

4929
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,629
robots are i think people
attribute a robot that looks like an

4930
01:24:58,629 --> 01:24:58,639
attribute a robot that looks like an
 

4931
01:24:58,639 --> 01:25:00,310
attribute a robot that looks like an
animal as maybe having a level of

4932
01:25:00,310 --> 01:25:00,320
animal as maybe having a level of
 

4933
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:02,070
animal as maybe having a level of
self-awareness

4934
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:02,080
self-awareness
 

4935
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,149
self-awareness
or consciousness or something that they

4936
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:04,159
or consciousness or something that they
 

4937
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,350
or consciousness or something that they
don't have yet

4938
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:05,360
don't have yet
 

4939
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,790
don't have yet
right so it's not i think

4940
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:08,800
right so it's not i think
 

4941
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:10,709
right so it's not i think
our ability to anthropomorphize those

4942
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
our ability to anthropomorphize those
 

4943
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:13,189
our ability to anthropomorphize those
robots is probably

4944
01:25:13,189 --> 01:25:13,199
robots is probably
 

4945
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,830
robots is probably
um we're assuming that they have a level

4946
01:25:15,830 --> 01:25:15,840
um we're assuming that they have a level
 

4947
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,830
um we're assuming that they have a level
of intelligence that they don't yet have

4948
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
of intelligence that they don't yet have
 

4949
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:20,149
of intelligence that they don't yet have
and that might be part of the fear so in

4950
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:20,159
and that might be part of the fear so in
 

4951
01:25:20,159 --> 01:25:20,870
and that might be part of the fear so in
that sense

4952
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:20,880
that sense
 

4953
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:23,910
that sense
it's too hard but um

4954
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:23,920
it's too hard but um
 

4955
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,110
it's too hard but um
you know there are many scary things in

4956
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:25,120
you know there are many scary things in
 

4957
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,950
you know there are many scary things in
the world right so

4958
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:26,960
the world right so
 

4959
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,350
the world right so
i think we're right to ask those

4960
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
i think we're right to ask those
 

4961
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,110
i think we're right to ask those
questions we're right to

4962
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:31,120
questions we're right to
 

4963
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:32,950
questions we're right to
um think about the implications of our

4964
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:32,960
um think about the implications of our
 

4965
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:34,870
um think about the implications of our
work

4966
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:34,880
work
 

4967
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,830
work
right in the in this in the short term

4968
01:25:37,830 --> 01:25:37,840
right in the in this in the short term
 

4969
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:39,669
right in the in this in the short term
as we're working on it for sure

4970
01:25:39,669 --> 01:25:39,679
as we're working on it for sure
 

4971
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,189
as we're working on it for sure
is there something long-term that

4972
01:25:43,189 --> 01:25:43,199
is there something long-term that
 

4973
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:46,310
is there something long-term that
scares you about our future with ai and

4974
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:46,320
scares you about our future with ai and
 

4975
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:47,590
scares you about our future with ai and
robots

4976
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:47,600
robots
 

4977
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,430
robots
a lot of folks from elon musk to sam

4978
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:51,440
a lot of folks from elon musk to sam

harris
 

4981
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,430
harris
to a lot of folks talk about the

4982
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:55,440
to a lot of folks talk about the
 

4983
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,030
to a lot of folks talk about the
you know existential threats about

4984
01:25:57,030 --> 01:25:57,040
you know existential threats about
 

4985
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,870
you know existential threats about
artificial intelligence

4986
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:58,880
artificial intelligence
 

4987
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,390
artificial intelligence
oftentimes robots kind of um inspire

4988
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
oftentimes robots kind of um inspire
 

4989
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:03,590
oftentimes robots kind of um inspire
that the most

4990
01:26:03,590 --> 01:26:03,600
that the most
 

4991
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,830
that the most
because of the anthropomorphism do you

4992
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:05,840
because of the anthropomorphism do you
 

4993
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,189
because of the anthropomorphism do you
have any fears

4994
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
have any fears
 

4995
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:11,990
have any fears
it's an important question um

4996
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:12,000

 

4997
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,390

i actually i think i like rod brooks

4998
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:14,400
i actually i think i like rod brooks
 

4999
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,750
i actually i think i like rod brooks
answer maybe the best

5000
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:15,760
answer maybe the best
 

5001
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:18,229
answer maybe the best
on this i think and it's not the only

5002
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:18,239
on this i think and it's not the only
 

5003
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,350
on this i think and it's not the only
answer he's given over the years but

5004
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:19,360
answer he's given over the years but
 

5005
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,870
answer he's given over the years but
maybe one of my favorites is

5006
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:22,880

 

5007
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:25,669

he says it's not going to be he's got a

5008
01:26:25,669 --> 01:26:25,679
he says it's not going to be he's got a
 

5009
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,350
he says it's not going to be he's got a
book flesh and machines i believe

5010
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:29,360

 

5011
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,709

it's not going to be the robots versus

5012
01:26:30,709 --> 01:26:30,719
it's not going to be the robots versus
 

5013
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:32,709
it's not going to be the robots versus
the people we're all going to be robot

5014
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:32,719
the people we're all going to be robot
 

5015
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,149
the people we're all going to be robot
people

5016
01:26:34,149 --> 01:26:34,159
people
 

5017
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:37,110
people
because you know we already have

5018
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
because you know we already have
 

5019
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,870
because you know we already have
smartphones some of us have

5020
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
smartphones some of us have
 

5021
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,189
smartphones some of us have
um serious technology implanted in our

5022
01:26:41,189 --> 01:26:41,199
um serious technology implanted in our
 

5023
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:43,030
um serious technology implanted in our
bodies already whether we have a

5024
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,040
bodies already whether we have a
 

5025
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:45,590
bodies already whether we have a
hearing aid or a pacemaker or anything

5026
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
hearing aid or a pacemaker or anything
 

5027
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,229
hearing aid or a pacemaker or anything
like this

5028
01:26:46,229 --> 01:26:46,239
like this
 

5029
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:49,910
like this
um people with amputations might have

5030
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:49,920
um people with amputations might have
 

5031
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,110
um people with amputations might have
prosthetics

5032
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,120

 

5033
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,149

that's a trend i think that

5034
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
that's a trend i think that
 

5035
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:59,030
that's a trend i think that
is likely to continue i mean this is now

5036
01:26:59,030 --> 01:26:59,040
is likely to continue i mean this is now
 

5037
01:26:59,040 --> 01:26:59,430
is likely to continue i mean this is now
uh

5038
01:26:59,430 --> 01:26:59,440
uh
 

5039
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:02,790
uh
wild speculation but uh

5040
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:02,800
wild speculation but uh
 

5041
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,870
wild speculation but uh
i mean when do we get to cognitive

5042
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:04,880
i mean when do we get to cognitive
 

5043
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:06,070
i mean when do we get to cognitive
implants and the like

5044
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:06,080
implants and the like
 

5045
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,990
implants and the like
and yeah with neurolink brain computer

5046
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
and yeah with neurolink brain computer
 

5047
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,270
and yeah with neurolink brain computer
interfaces

5048
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:09,280
interfaces
 

5049
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:10,790
interfaces
that's interesting so there's a there's

5050
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:10,800
that's interesting so there's a there's
 

5051
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,950
that's interesting so there's a there's
a dance between humans and robots it's

5052
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:12,960
a dance between humans and robots it's
 

5053
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:15,910
a dance between humans and robots it's
going to be

5054
01:27:15,910 --> 01:27:15,920

 

5055
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,870

it's going to be impossible to be scared

5056
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:18,880
it's going to be impossible to be scared
 

5057
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,629
it's going to be impossible to be scared
of

5058
01:27:20,629 --> 01:27:20,639
of
 

5059
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,590
of
the other out there the robot because

5060
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:23,600
the other out there the robot because
 

5061
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,430
the other out there the robot because
the robot will be part of us

5062
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
the robot will be part of us
 

5063
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,830
the robot will be part of us
essentially it'd be so intricately sort

5064
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
essentially it'd be so intricately sort
 

5065
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:29,750
essentially it'd be so intricately sort
of part of our society

5066
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:29,760
of part of our society
 

5067
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:32,470
of part of our society
that and it might not even be implanted

5068
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:32,480
that and it might not even be implanted
 

5069
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,229
that and it might not even be implanted
part of us but just it's so much a part

5070
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
part of us but just it's so much a part
 

5071
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,270
part of us but just it's so much a part
of our

5072
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
of our
 

5073
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,830
of our
yeah our society so in that sense the

5074
01:27:37,830 --> 01:27:37,840
yeah our society so in that sense the
 

5075
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,350
yeah our society so in that sense the
smartphone is already the robot we

5076
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,360
smartphone is already the robot we
 

5077
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,189
smartphone is already the robot we
should be afraid of yeah

5078
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:41,199
should be afraid of yeah
 

5079
01:27:41,199 --> 01:27:43,990
should be afraid of yeah
uh i mean yeah and all the usual fears

5080
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,000
uh i mean yeah and all the usual fears
 

5081
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,350
uh i mean yeah and all the usual fears
arise

5082
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:45,360
arise
 

5083
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:50,070
arise
of the misinformation the

5084
01:27:50,070 --> 01:27:50,080

 

5085
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:52,950

manipulation all those kinds of things

5086
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:52,960
manipulation all those kinds of things
 

5087
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:55,430
manipulation all those kinds of things
that um

5088
01:27:55,430 --> 01:27:55,440
that um
 

5089
01:27:55,440 --> 01:27:57,270
that um
that the problems are all the same

5090
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:57,280
that the problems are all the same
 

5091
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,830
that the problems are all the same
they're all they're human problems

5092
01:27:58,830 --> 01:27:58,840
they're all they're human problems
 

5093
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,629
they're all they're human problems
essentially it feels like

5094
01:28:00,629 --> 01:28:00,639
essentially it feels like
 

5095
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:02,950
essentially it feels like
yeah i mean i think the the way we

5096
01:28:02,950 --> 01:28:02,960
yeah i mean i think the the way we
 

5097
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,550
yeah i mean i think the the way we
interact with each other online is

5098
01:28:04,550 --> 01:28:04,560
interact with each other online is
 

5099
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,350
interact with each other online is
changing

5100
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,360
changing
 

5101
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:08,229
changing
the value we put on you know personal

5102
01:28:08,229 --> 01:28:08,239
the value we put on you know personal
 

5103
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,070
the value we put on you know personal
interaction and that's a crazy big

5104
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:10,080
interaction and that's a crazy big
 

5105
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,110
interaction and that's a crazy big
change that's going to happen

5106
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:11,120
change that's going to happen
 

5107
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:12,629
change that's going to happen
and rip through our system has already

5108
01:28:12,629 --> 01:28:12,639
and rip through our system has already
 

5109
01:28:12,639 --> 01:28:14,149
and rip through our system has already
been ripping through our society right

5110
01:28:14,149 --> 01:28:14,159
been ripping through our society right
 

5111
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:17,430
been ripping through our society right
and that has implications that are

5112
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:17,440
and that has implications that are
 

5113
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,709
and that has implications that are
massive i don't know if they should be

5114
01:28:18,709 --> 01:28:18,719
massive i don't know if they should be
 

5115
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:22,550
massive i don't know if they should be
scared of it or go with the flow but

5116
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:22,560
scared of it or go with the flow but
 

5117
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,430
scared of it or go with the flow but
i don't see you know some battle lines

5118
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:25,440
i don't see you know some battle lines
 

5119
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:27,990
i don't see you know some battle lines
between humans and robots being

5120
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:28,000
between humans and robots being
 

5121
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,990
between humans and robots being
the first thing to worry about i mean i

5122
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:30,000
the first thing to worry about i mean i
 

5123
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,110
the first thing to worry about i mean i
do want to just

5124
01:28:31,110 --> 01:28:31,120
do want to just
 

5125
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,830
do want to just
as a kind of comment maybe you can

5126
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:33,840
as a kind of comment maybe you can
 

5127
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,830
as a kind of comment maybe you can
comment about your just feelings about

5128
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:35,840
comment about your just feelings about
 

5129
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:37,669
comment about your just feelings about
boston dynamics in general

5130
01:28:37,669 --> 01:28:37,679
boston dynamics in general
 

5131
01:28:37,679 --> 01:28:39,669
boston dynamics in general
but you know i love science i love

5132
01:28:39,669 --> 01:28:39,679
but you know i love science i love
 

5133
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,030
but you know i love science i love
engineering i think there's so many

5134
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,040
engineering i think there's so many
 

5135
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:41,990
engineering i think there's so many
beautiful ideas in

5136
01:28:41,990 --> 01:28:42,000
beautiful ideas in
 

5137
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,669
beautiful ideas in
it and when i look at boston dynamics or

5138
01:28:45,669 --> 01:28:45,679
it and when i look at boston dynamics or
 

5139
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,870
it and when i look at boston dynamics or
legged robots in general i think

5140
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
legged robots in general i think
 

5141
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,110
legged robots in general i think
they inspire people curiosity

5142
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:53,120
they inspire people curiosity
 

5143
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,390
they inspire people curiosity
and feelings in general excitement

5144
01:28:56,390 --> 01:28:56,400
and feelings in general excitement
 

5145
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,070
and feelings in general excitement
about engineering more than almost

5146
01:28:58,070 --> 01:28:58,080
about engineering more than almost
 

5147
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,550
about engineering more than almost
anything else in popular culture

5148
01:29:00,550 --> 01:29:00,560
anything else in popular culture
 

5149
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:03,669
anything else in popular culture
and i think that's such an exciting plus

5150
01:29:03,669 --> 01:29:03,679
and i think that's such an exciting plus
 

5151
01:29:03,679 --> 01:29:05,510
and i think that's such an exciting plus
like responsibility and possibility for

5152
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:05,520
like responsibility and possibility for
 

5153
01:29:05,520 --> 01:29:06,709
like responsibility and possibility for
robotics

5154
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:06,719
robotics
 

5155
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:09,510
robotics
and boston dynamics is riding that wave

5156
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:09,520
and boston dynamics is riding that wave
 

5157
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,189
and boston dynamics is riding that wave
pretty damn well like

5158
01:29:11,189 --> 01:29:11,199
pretty damn well like
 

5159
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,270
pretty damn well like
they've found it they've discovered that

5160
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:13,280
they've found it they've discovered that
 

5161
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:14,390
they've found it they've discovered that
hunger and

5162
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
hunger and
 

5163
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,669
hunger and
curiosity in the people and they're

5164
01:29:15,669 --> 01:29:15,679
curiosity in the people and they're
 

5165
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:17,430
curiosity in the people and they're
doing magic with it

5166
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
doing magic with it
 

5167
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:19,430
doing magic with it
i don't care if the i mean i guess their

5168
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
i don't care if the i mean i guess their
 

5169
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,270
i don't care if the i mean i guess their
company have to make money right

5170
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
company have to make money right
 

5171
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,990
company have to make money right
but uh they're already doing incredible

5172
01:29:23,990 --> 01:29:24,000
but uh they're already doing incredible
 

5173
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,830
but uh they're already doing incredible
work and inspiring the world about

5174
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:25,840
work and inspiring the world about
 

5175
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:26,790
work and inspiring the world about
technology

5176
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:26,800
technology
 

5177
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,430
technology
i mean do you have do you have thoughts

5178
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:29,440
i mean do you have do you have thoughts
 

5179
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,270
i mean do you have do you have thoughts
about boston dynamics maybe

5180
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
about boston dynamics maybe
 

5181
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,870
about boston dynamics maybe
others your own work and robotics and

5182
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:34,880
others your own work and robotics and
 

5183
01:29:34,880 --> 01:29:37,830
others your own work and robotics and
inspiring the world in that way i

5184
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:37,840
inspiring the world in that way i
 

5185
01:29:37,840 --> 01:29:39,350
inspiring the world in that way i
completely agree i think

5186
01:29:39,350 --> 01:29:39,360
completely agree i think
 

5187
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,550
completely agree i think
boston dynamics is absolutely awesome

5188
01:29:42,550 --> 01:29:42,560
boston dynamics is absolutely awesome
 

5189
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,750
boston dynamics is absolutely awesome
i think i show my kids those videos

5190
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
i think i show my kids those videos
 

5191
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,149
i think i show my kids those videos
you know and the best thing that happens

5192
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:48,159
you know and the best thing that happens
 

5193
01:29:48,159 --> 01:29:49,350
you know and the best thing that happens
is sometimes they've already seen them

5194
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:49,360
is sometimes they've already seen them
 

5195
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,390
is sometimes they've already seen them
you know uh

5196
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:50,400
you know uh
 

5197
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,510
you know uh
right i think i i just think

5198
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:53,520
right i think i i just think
 

5199
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:55,990
right i think i i just think
it's a pinnacle of success in robotics

5200
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:56,000
it's a pinnacle of success in robotics
 

5201
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,350
it's a pinnacle of success in robotics
that um

5202
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:57,360
that um
 

5203
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:58,790
that um
is just one of the best things that's

5204
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
is just one of the best things that's
 

5205
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:02,550
is just one of the best things that's
happened i absolutely completely agree

5206
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,560
happened i absolutely completely agree
 

5207
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,510
happened i absolutely completely agree
one of the heartbreaking things to me is

5208
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:05,520
one of the heartbreaking things to me is
 

5209
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:06,270
one of the heartbreaking things to me is
how many

5210
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:06,280
how many
 

5211
01:30:06,280 --> 01:30:09,510
how many
robotics companies fail

5250
01:30:53,350 --> 01:30:53,360
oh i think um you can't just look at the
 

5251
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:54,629
oh i think um you can't just look at the
failures you can all i mean boston

01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:00,960
doing amazingly good work in robotics
 

5259
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:03,430
doing amazingly good work in robotics
i mean this is the this is the

5260
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:03,440
i mean this is the this is the
 

5261
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,270
i mean this is the this is the
capitalist ecology or something right i

5262
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:05,280
capitalist ecology or something right i
 

5263

think you have many companies you have

5264
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:06,880
think you have many companies you have
 

5265
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:09,030
think you have many companies you have
many startups and they

5266
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:09,040
many startups and they
 

5267
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:10,950
many startups and they
push each other forward and many of them

5268
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:10,960
push each other forward and many of them
 

5269
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:12,470
push each other forward and many of them
fail and some of them get through and

5270
01:31:12,470 --> 01:31:12,480
fail and some of them get through and
 

5271
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:13,669
fail and some of them get through and
that's sort of

5272
01:31:13,669 --> 01:31:13,679
that's sort of
 

5273
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,470
that's sort of
the natural way of things the way of

5274
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:16,480
the natural way of things the way of
 

5275
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:18,709
the natural way of things the way of
those things i don't know that

5276
01:31:18,709 --> 01:31:18,719
those things i don't know that
 

5277
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,790
those things i don't know that
is robotics really that much worse i i

5278
01:31:20,790 --> 01:31:20,800
is robotics really that much worse i i

5282
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:22,960
time i
 

5283
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:25,990
time i
read one of these i um sometimes it's

5284
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:26,000
read one of these i um sometimes it's
 

5285
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,830
read one of these i um sometimes it's
friends and and i definitely

5286
01:31:29,830 --> 01:31:29,840
friends and and i definitely
 

5287
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,350
friends and and i definitely
wish it went better or would differently

5288
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:33,360
wish it went better or would differently
 

5289
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:35,350
wish it went better or would differently
but i think it's healthy and good to

5290
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:35,360
but i think it's healthy and good to
 

5291
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:36,950
but i think it's healthy and good to
have um

5292
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:36,960
have um
 

5293
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:39,910
have um
bursts of ideas burst of activities

5294
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:39,920
bursts of ideas burst of activities
 

5295

5297
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:41,910
ideas
if they are really aggressive they

5298
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:41,920
if they are really aggressive they
 

5299
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:45,110
if they are really aggressive they
should fail sometimes

5300
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:45,120

 

5301
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,629

certainly that's the research mantra

5302
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
certainly that's the research mantra
 

5303
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:48,149
certainly that's the research mantra
right if you're

5304
01:31:48,149 --> 01:31:48,159
right if you're
 

5305
01:31:48,159 --> 01:31:50,629
right if you're
succeeding at every problem you attempt

5306
01:31:50,629 --> 01:31:50,639
succeeding at every problem you attempt
 

5307
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:51,830
succeeding at every problem you attempt
then you're not

5308
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:51,840
then you're not
 

5309
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,590
then you're not
choosing aggressively enough is it

5310
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:53,600
choosing aggressively enough is it
 

5311
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,830
choosing aggressively enough is it
exciting to you uh the new spot

5312
01:31:55,830 --> 01:31:55,840
exciting to you uh the new spot
 

5313
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,830
exciting to you uh the new spot
oh it's okay it's so good what are you

5314
01:31:57,830 --> 01:31:57,840
oh it's okay it's so good what are you
 

5315
01:31:57,840 --> 01:31:58,950
oh it's okay it's so good what are you
getting him as a pet

5316
01:31:58,950 --> 01:31:58,960
getting him as a pet
 

5317
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:01,990
getting him as a pet
uh it yeah i mean i have to dig up

5318
01:32:01,990 --> 01:32:02,000
uh it yeah i mean i have to dig up
 

5319
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,950
uh it yeah i mean i have to dig up
75k right now it's so cool that there's

5320
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
75k right now it's so cool that there's
 

5321
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,229
75k right now it's so cool that there's
a price tag you can go

5322
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
a price tag you can go
 

5323
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,709
a price tag you can go
and and then actually buy it and i have

5324
01:32:08,709 --> 01:32:08,719
and and then actually buy it and i have
 

5325
01:32:08,719 --> 01:32:09,990
and and then actually buy it and i have
a skydio r1

about i i actually um
zach from boston dynamics would let my

5338
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
zach from boston dynamics would let my
 

5339

kid drive in one of their demos one time
 

5341
01:32:27,120 --> 01:32:30,229
kid drive in one of their demos one time
and uh that was just so good

5342
01:32:30,229 --> 01:32:30,239
and uh that was just so good
 

5343
01:32:30,239 --> 01:32:32,870
and uh that was just so good
so good and again forever be grateful

5344

so good and again forever be grateful
for that

5346
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:34,159
for that
 

5347
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,189
for that
and there's something magical about the

5348
01:32:36,189 --> 01:32:36,199
and there's something magical about the
 

5349
01:32:36,199 --> 01:32:38,870
and there's something magical about the
anthropomorphization of that arm

5350
01:32:38,870 --> 01:32:38,880
anthropomorphization of that arm
 

5351
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,270
anthropomorphization of that arm
it adds another level of human

5352
01:32:41,270 --> 01:32:41,280
it adds another level of human
 

5353
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:42,470
it adds another level of human

i'm not sure we understand from a

5356
01:32:45,189 --> 01:32:45,199
i'm not sure we understand from a
 

5357
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:45,990
i'm not sure we understand from a
control

5358
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,000
control
 

5359
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,270
control
aspect uh the value of

5360
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:48,280
aspect uh the value of
 

5361
01:32:48,280 --> 01:32:50,310
aspect uh the value of
anthropomorphization

5362
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:50,320
anthropomorphization
 

5363
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,390
anthropomorphization
um i i think that's an understudied and

5364
01:32:54,390 --> 01:32:54,400
um i i think that's an understudied and
 

5365
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,110
um i i think that's an understudied and
understood engineering problem there's

5366
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:57,120
understood engineering problem there's
 

5367
01:32:57,120 --> 01:32:58,229
understood engineering problem there's
been a psycho

5368
01:32:58,229 --> 01:32:58,239
been a psycho
 

5369
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,229
been a psycho
psychologists have been studying it i

5370
01:33:00,229 --> 01:33:00,239
psychologists have been studying it i
 

5371
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,350
psychologists have been studying it i
think it's part

5372
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:01,360
think it's part
 

5373
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:03,270
think it's part
like manipulating our mind to believe

5374
01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:03,280
like manipulating our mind to believe
 

5375
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:04,629
like manipulating our mind to believe
things uh

5376
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:04,639
things uh
 

5377
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:07,189
things uh
is a valuable engineering like this is

5378
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:07,199
is a valuable engineering like this is
 

5379
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:08,470
is a valuable engineering like this is
another degree of

5380
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
another degree of
 

5381
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,990
another degree of
freedom that can be controlled i like

5382
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
freedom that can be controlled i like
 

5383
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:13,669
freedom that can be controlled i like
that yeah i think that's right i think

5384
01:33:13,669 --> 01:33:13,679

 

5385
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:15,030

you know there's something that humans

5386
01:33:15,030 --> 01:33:15,040
you know there's something that humans
 

5387
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:17,189
you know there's something that humans
seem to do or maybe my

5388
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:17,199
seem to do or maybe my
 

5389
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:20,310
seem to do or maybe my
dangerous introspection is uh

5390
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:20,320
dangerous introspection is uh
 

5391
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,350
dangerous introspection is uh
i think we are able to make very simple

5392
01:33:23,350 --> 01:33:23,360
i think we are able to make very simple
 

5393
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:24,070
i think we are able to make very simple
models that

5394
01:33:24,070 --> 01:33:24,080
models that
 

5395
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:26,550
models that
assume a lot about the world very

5396
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
assume a lot about the world very
 

5397
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:27,750
assume a lot about the world very
quickly

5398
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:27,760
quickly
 

5399
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,070
quickly
and then uh it takes us a lot more time

5400
01:33:30,070 --> 01:33:30,080
and then uh it takes us a lot more time
 

5401
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:31,350
and then uh it takes us a lot more time
like you're wrestling you know you

5402
01:33:31,350 --> 01:33:31,360
like you're wrestling you know you
 

5403
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:32,149
like you're wrestling you know you
probably

5404
01:33:32,149 --> 01:33:32,159
probably
 

5405
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:33,189
probably
thought you knew what you're doing with

5406
01:33:33,189 --> 01:33:33,199
thought you knew what you're doing with
 

5407
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:35,270
thought you knew what you're doing with
wrestling and you were fairly functional

5408
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:35,280
wrestling and you were fairly functional
 

5409
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,870
wrestling and you were fairly functional
as a complete wrestler

5410
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:36,880
as a complete wrestler
 

5411
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,270
as a complete wrestler
and then you slowly got more expertise

5412
01:33:39,270 --> 01:33:39,280
and then you slowly got more expertise
 

5413
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,110
and then you slowly got more expertise
so maybe

5414
01:33:41,110 --> 01:33:41,120
so maybe
 

5415
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:44,550
so maybe
it's natural that our first

5416
01:33:44,550 --> 01:33:44,560
it's natural that our first
 

5417
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,390
it's natural that our first
first level of defense against seeing a

5418
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:46,400
first level of defense against seeing a
 

5419
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:48,070
first level of defense against seeing a
new robot is to think of it

5420
01:33:48,070 --> 01:33:48,080
new robot is to think of it
 

5421
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,030
new robot is to think of it
in our existing models of how humans and

5422
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:51,040
in our existing models of how humans and
 

5423
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,310
in our existing models of how humans and
animals behave

5424
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:52,320
animals behave
 

5425
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,709
animals behave
and it's just as you spend more time

5426
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:54,719
and it's just as you spend more time
 

5427
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:55,750
and it's just as you spend more time
with it then you'll develop more

5428
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:55,760
with it then you'll develop more
 

5429
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:58,070
with it then you'll develop more
sophisticated models that will

5430
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,080
sophisticated models that will
 

5431
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:01,590
sophisticated models that will
appreciate the differences exactly

5432
01:34:01,590 --> 01:34:01,600
appreciate the differences exactly
 

5433
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:03,510
appreciate the differences exactly
can you say what does it take to control

5434
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:03,520
can you say what does it take to control
 

5435
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,510
can you say what does it take to control
a robot

5436
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:05,520
a robot
 

5437
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:07,590
a robot
like what is the control problem of a

5438
01:34:07,590 --> 01:34:07,600
like what is the control problem of a
 

5439
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,310
like what is the control problem of a
robot and in general what is a robot

5440
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
robot and in general what is a robot
 

5441
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,750
robot and in general what is a robot
in your view like how do you think of

5442
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:11,760
in your view like how do you think of
 

5443
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,870
in your view like how do you think of
this system

5444
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:14,880
this system
 

5445
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:18,070
this system
what is a robot what is a robot i think

5446
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
what is a robot what is a robot i think
 

5447
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,390
what is a robot what is a robot i think
robotics ridiculous questions no no it's

5448
01:34:20,390 --> 01:34:20,400
robotics ridiculous questions no no it's
 

5449
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,350
robotics ridiculous questions no no it's
good um

5450
01:34:21,350 --> 01:34:21,360
good um
 

5451
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,669
good um
i mean there's standard definitions of

5452
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679
i mean there's standard definitions of
 

5453
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:24,709
i mean there's standard definitions of
combining

5454
01:34:24,709 --> 01:34:24,719
combining
 

5455
01:34:24,719 --> 01:34:27,590
combining
computation with some ability to do

5456
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:27,600
computation with some ability to do
 

5457
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:28,870
computation with some ability to do
mechanical work

5458
01:34:28,870 --> 01:34:28,880
mechanical work
 

5459
01:34:28,880 --> 01:34:31,189
mechanical work
i think that gets us pretty close but i

5460
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
i think that gets us pretty close but i
 

5461
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:32,709
i think that gets us pretty close but i
think

5462
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:32,719
think
 

5463
01:34:32,719 --> 01:34:35,510
think
robotics has this problem that once

5464
01:34:35,510 --> 01:34:35,520
robotics has this problem that once
 

5465
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,350
robotics has this problem that once
things really work

5466
01:34:37,350 --> 01:34:37,360
things really work
 

5467
01:34:37,360 --> 01:34:39,990
things really work
we don't call them robots anymore like

5468
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:40,000
we don't call them robots anymore like
 

5469
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,669
we don't call them robots anymore like
your my dishwasher at home is

5470
01:34:41,669 --> 01:34:41,679
your my dishwasher at home is
 

5471
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:44,390
your my dishwasher at home is
pretty sophisticated beautiful

5472
01:34:44,390 --> 01:34:44,400
pretty sophisticated beautiful
 

5473
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,430
pretty sophisticated beautiful
mechanisms

5474
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,440
mechanisms
 

5475
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,870
mechanisms
there's actually a pretty good computer

5476
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:46,880
there's actually a pretty good computer
 

5477
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:48,790
there's actually a pretty good computer
probably a couple chips in there doing

5478
01:34:48,790 --> 01:34:48,800
probably a couple chips in there doing
 

5479
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:50,149
probably a couple chips in there doing
amazing things we don't think of that as

5480
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
amazing things we don't think of that as
 

5481
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:51,430
amazing things we don't think of that as
a robot anymore

5482
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:51,440
a robot anymore
 

5483
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,189
a robot anymore
which isn't fair because then what

5484
01:34:53,189 --> 01:34:53,199
which isn't fair because then what
 

5485
01:34:53,199 --> 01:34:54,550
which isn't fair because then what
roughly it means that robots

5486
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:54,560
roughly it means that robots
 

5487
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:57,830
roughly it means that robots
robotics always has to solve the next

5488
01:34:57,830 --> 01:34:57,840
robotics always has to solve the next
 

5489
01:34:57,840 --> 01:34:58,550
robotics always has to solve the next
problem and

5490
01:34:58,550 --> 01:34:58,560
problem and
 

5491
01:34:58,560 --> 01:34:59,990
problem and
doesn't get to celebrate its past

5492
01:34:59,990 --> 01:35:00,000
doesn't get to celebrate its past
 

5493
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,950
doesn't get to celebrate its past
successes i mean even factory room

5494
01:35:02,950 --> 01:35:02,960
successes i mean even factory room
 

5495
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:06,790
successes i mean even factory room
floor robots are super successful

5496
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:06,800
floor robots are super successful
 

5497
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,350
floor robots are super successful
they're amazing but that's not the ones

5498
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:09,360
they're amazing but that's not the ones
 

5499
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:10,790
they're amazing but that's not the ones
i mean people think of them as robots

5500
01:35:10,790 --> 01:35:10,800
i mean people think of them as robots
 

5501
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:11,430
i mean people think of them as robots
but they don't

5502
01:35:11,430 --> 01:35:11,440
but they don't
 

5503
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,270
but they don't
if you ask what are the successes of

5504
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:13,280
if you ask what are the successes of
 

5505
01:35:13,280 --> 01:35:15,430
if you ask what are the successes of
robotics somehow

5506
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
robotics somehow
 

5507
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:17,750
robotics somehow
it doesn't come to your mind immediately

5508
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:17,760
it doesn't come to your mind immediately
 

5509
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,910
it doesn't come to your mind immediately
so the definition of robot is

5510
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:19,920
so the definition of robot is
 

5511
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,990
so the definition of robot is
a system with some level automation that

5512
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
a system with some level automation that
 

5513
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:23,430
a system with some level automation that
fails frequently

5514
01:35:23,430 --> 01:35:23,440
fails frequently
 

5515
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:25,830
fails frequently
something like it's it's the computation

5516
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
something like it's it's the computation
 

5517
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,189
something like it's it's the computation
plus mechanical

5518
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:27,199

01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:10,400
places where you're interacting more
 

5559
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:12,229
places where you're interacting more
you're doing more dynamic

you're doing more dynamic
 

5561
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:16,470
you're doing more dynamic
interactions with the world so walking

we've solved classically
 

5575
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,430
we've solved classically
right like modern control grew up

5576
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:31,440
right like modern control grew up
 

5577
01:36:31,440 --> 01:36:32,870
right like modern control grew up

is now so you mentioned contact like

5594
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:49,600
is now so you mentioned contact like
 

5595
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,950
is now so you mentioned contact like
what's contact so an airplane

5596
01:36:52,950 --> 01:36:52,960
what's contact so an airplane
 

5597
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,030
what's contact so an airplane
is of extremely complex system or a

things change relatively continuously
 

5605
01:37:03,440 --> 01:37:05,510
things change relatively continuously
that's an oversimplification but

5606
01:37:05,510 --> 01:37:05,520
that's an oversimplification but
 

5607
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,830
that's an oversimplification but
if i make a small change in the command

5608
01:37:07,830 --> 01:37:07,840
if i make a small change in the command
 

5609
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,990
if i make a small change in the command
i send to my actuator

5610
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:10,000
i send to my actuator

01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:13,910
then the path that the robot will take
tends to take a

complex ways i do think there's a little

contact is hard in robotics
 

5659
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,350
contact is hard in robotics
even to simulate um and i think there's

a little bit of a

01:38:08,560 --> 01:38:10,310
a little bit of a
there's truth to that but but maybe a

01:38:10,310 --> 01:38:10,320
there's truth to that but but maybe a
 

5665
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:13,510
there's truth to that but but maybe a

so what is limiting is that when we

01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
so what is limiting is that when we
 

5669
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,070
so what is limiting is that when we
think about our robots when we write our

5673
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:23,270

we often make an assumption that that

objects are rigid
 

5677
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,390
objects are rigid
and when it comes down you know that

5678
01:38:28,390 --> 01:38:28,400
and when it comes down you know that
 

5679
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,149
and when it comes down you know that
they that their mass moves all

they that their mass moves all
 

5681
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,070
they that their mass moves all
you know it stays in a constant position

01:38:32,070 --> 01:38:32,080
you know it stays in a constant position
 

5683
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:34,070
you know it stays in a constant position
relative to each other itself

5684
01:38:34,070 --> 01:38:34,080
relative to each other itself
 

5685
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:38,310
relative to each other itself
um and and that leads to

5686
01:38:38,310 --> 01:38:38,320
um and and that leads to
 

5687
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,990
um and and that leads to
some paradoxes when you go to try to

5688
01:38:39,990 --> 01:38:40,000
some paradoxes when you go to try to
 

5689
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,750
some paradoxes when you go to try to
talk about rigid body mechanics and

5690
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
talk about rigid body mechanics and
 

5691
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:43,109
talk about rigid body mechanics and
contact

or do some combination of the two

5844
01:41:16,950 --> 01:41:16,960
or do some combination of the two
 

5845
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,470
or do some combination of the two
but but anyways because of these kind of

5846
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:18,480
but but anyways because of these kind of
 

5847
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,470
but but anyways because of these kind of
paradoxes there's all kinds of

5848
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
paradoxes there's all kinds of
 

5849
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,350
paradoxes there's all kinds of
paradoxes in contact uh mostly due to

5850
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:23,360
paradoxes in contact uh mostly due to
 

5851
01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:25,350
paradoxes in contact uh mostly due to
these rigid body assumptions

5852
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:25,360
these rigid body assumptions
 

5853
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:27,990
these rigid body assumptions
it becomes very hard to like write the

5854
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:28,000
it becomes very hard to like write the
 

5855
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:29,590
it becomes very hard to like write the
same kind of control laws

5856
01:41:29,590 --> 01:41:29,600
same kind of control laws
 

5857
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,189
same kind of control laws
that we've been able to be successful

5859
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,750

with for like fighter jets

5860
01:41:33,750 --> 01:41:33,760

5861
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:35,189

we haven't been as successful writing

01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
we haven't been as successful writing

those controllers for
 

5865
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,709
those controllers for

at the moment of contact there are
 

5873
01:41:42,159 --> 01:41:43,910
at the moment of contact there are
situations absolutely where you

01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
situations absolutely where you
 

5875
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:46,390

where our laws don't tell us so the

i mean instead of having a differential

5880
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:50,320
i mean instead of having a differential

continuously i mean what

uh so when you're seeing like non-smooth

5902
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:11,920
uh so when you're seeing like non-smooth
 

5903
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:14,709
uh so when you're seeing like non-smooth
they're not only not smooth but this is

5904
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
they're not only not smooth but this is
 

5905
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,149
they're not only not smooth but this is
discontinuous

5906
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
discontinuous
 

5907
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,470
discontinuous
the non-smooth comes in when i make or

5908
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:18,480
the non-smooth comes in when i make or
 

5909
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:20,310
the non-smooth comes in when i make or
break a new contact first

5910
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
break a new contact first
 

5911
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,790
break a new contact first
or when i transition from stick to slip

5912
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:22,800
or when i transition from stick to slip
 

5913
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,189
or when i transition from stick to slip
so you typically have static friction

5914
01:42:25,189 --> 01:42:25,199
so you typically have static friction
 

5915
01:42:25,199 --> 01:42:26,470
so you typically have static friction
and then you'll start sliding and

5916
01:42:26,470 --> 01:42:26,480
and then you'll start sliding and
 

5917
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:29,189
and then you'll start sliding and
that'll be a discontinuous change in

5918
01:42:29,189 --> 01:42:29,199
that'll be a discontinuous change in
 

5919
01:42:29,199 --> 01:42:31,750
that'll be a discontinuous change in
in velocity for instance especially if

5920
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:31,760
in velocity for instance especially if
 

5921
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,270
in velocity for instance especially if
you come to rest or

5922
01:42:33,270 --> 01:42:33,280
you come to rest or
 

5923
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:36,070
you come to rest or
that's so fascinating okay so uh so what

01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,080
that's so fascinating okay so uh so what
 

5925
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:36,390
that's so fascinating okay so uh so what

01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,189
handful of years it's getting up there
but

6010
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:57,199
but
 

6011
01:43:57,199 --> 01:43:59,669
but
i haven't had time in my life to visit

6012
01:43:59,669 --> 01:43:59,679
i haven't had time in my life to visit

i haven't had time in my life to visit
all of the states

6014
01:44:00,629 --> 01:44:00,639
all of the states
 

6015
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:03,830
all of the states
in my system certainly all the contact

6016
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:03,840
in my system certainly all the contact
 

6017
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,109

configurations
 

6019
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:08,470

so if step one is to consider every

01:44:08,470 --> 01:44:08,480
so if step one is to consider every
 

6021
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:10,310
so if step one is to consider every
possible contact configuration that i've

01:44:10,310 --> 01:44:10,320
possible contact configuration that i've
 

6023
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:13,590
possible contact configuration that i've
i'll ever be in that's probably a

that's probably not a problem i need to

6026
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:15,040
that's probably not a problem i need to
 

6027
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:16,950
that's probably not a problem i need to
solve right

6028
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:16,960
solve right
 

6029
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:18,629
solve right
just as a small attention what's a

what like just so we can uh

6034
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:23,520
what like just so we can uh
 

6035
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:25,750
what like just so we can uh
yeah enumerate what are we talking about

6036
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
yeah enumerate what are we talking about
 

6037
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,510
yeah enumerate what are we talking about
yeah how many are there

6038
01:44:27,510 --> 01:44:27,520
yeah how many are there
 

6039
01:44:27,520 --> 01:44:29,910
yeah how many are there
the simplest example maybe would be

6040
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:29,920
the simplest example maybe would be
 

6041
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,709
the simplest example maybe would be
imagine a robot with a flat foot

6042
01:44:32,709 --> 01:44:32,719
imagine a robot with a flat foot
 

6043
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,350
imagine a robot with a flat foot
and we think about the phases of gate

6044
01:44:35,350 --> 01:44:35,360
and we think about the phases of gate
 

6045
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:36,390
and we think about the phases of gate
where the heel

6046
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:36,400
where the heel
 

6047
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,109
where the heel
strikes and then the four the front toe

6048
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
strikes and then the four the front toe
 

6049
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:39,910
strikes and then the four the front toe
strikes

6050
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:39,920
strikes
 

6051
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:43,590
strikes
and then you can heal up toe off

6052
01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:43,600
and then you can heal up toe off
 

6053
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,350
and then you can heal up toe off
those are each different contact

i only had two different contacts but i

6058
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:48,400
i only had two different contacts but i
 

6059
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,910
i only had two different contacts but i
ended up with four different

ended up with four different
 

6061
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,950
ended up with four different
contact configurations now of course

01:44:52,950 --> 01:44:52,960
contact configurations now of course

01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,149
i might have my my robot might actually
have bumps on it or other things so it

6066
01:44:58,149 --> 01:44:58,159
have bumps on it or other things so it
 

6067
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,750
have bumps on it or other things so it
could be much more subtle than that

could be much more subtle than that
 

6069
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,990
could be much more subtle than that

01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,870
that my hand came into contact with the

with the bottle
then i'm dead in the water my any

approach that we were able to get away

6102
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:34,960
approach that we were able to get away
 

6103
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,030
approach that we were able to get away
with that in walking

6104
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
with that in walking
 

6105
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:38,310
with that in walking
because we mostly touch the ground

6106
01:45:38,310 --> 01:45:38,320
because we mostly touch the ground
 

6107
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,830
because we mostly touch the ground
within a small number of points for

within a small number of points for

6111
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,870
instance
and we haven't been able to get dextrous

6112
01:45:42,870 --> 01:45:42,880
and we haven't been able to get dextrous
 

6113
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,030
and we haven't been able to get dextrous
hands that way

hands that way
 

6115
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,109
hands that way
so i mean you've mentioned that

6116
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:49,119
so i mean you've mentioned that
 

6117
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:52,390
so i mean you've mentioned that
people think that contact is really hard

6118
01:45:52,390 --> 01:45:52,400
people think that contact is really hard
 

6119
01:45:52,400 --> 01:45:56,790
people think that contact is really hard
and that that's the reason that

6120
01:45:56,790 --> 01:45:56,800
and that that's the reason that
 

6121
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,950
and that that's the reason that
robotic manipulation is problem is

6122
01:45:58,950 --> 01:45:58,960
robotic manipulation is problem is
 

6123
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:00,470
robotic manipulation is problem is
really hard

6124
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:00,480
really hard
 

6125
01:46:00,480 --> 01:46:05,109
really hard
is there any flaws in that

6126
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:05,119
is there any flaws in that
 

6127
01:46:05,119 --> 01:46:09,030
is there any flaws in that
thinking so i think simulating contact

6128
01:46:09,030 --> 01:46:09,040
thinking so i think simulating contact
 

6129
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:11,830
thinking so i think simulating contact
is one aspect i know people often say

6130
01:46:11,830 --> 01:46:11,840
is one aspect i know people often say
 

6131
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,790
is one aspect i know people often say
that we don't

6132
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:12,800
that we don't
 

6133
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,790
that we don't
that one of the reasons that we have a

6134
01:46:14,790 --> 01:46:14,800
that one of the reasons that we have a
 

6135
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,030
that one of the reasons that we have a
limit in robotics is because we do not

6136
01:46:17,030 --> 01:46:17,040
limit in robotics is because we do not
 

6137
01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:18,950
limit in robotics is because we do not
simulate contact accurately

6138
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:18,960
simulate contact accurately
 

6139
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:24,070
simulate contact accurately
in our simulators and i think that is

6140
01:46:24,070 --> 01:46:24,080

 

6141
01:46:24,080 --> 01:46:25,669

the extent to which that's true is

6142
01:46:25,669 --> 01:46:25,679
the extent to which that's true is
 

6143
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:27,189
the extent to which that's true is
partly because our

6144
01:46:27,189 --> 01:46:27,199
partly because our
 

6145
01:46:27,199 --> 01:46:29,109
partly because our
simulators we haven't got mature enough

6146
01:46:29,109 --> 01:46:29,119
simulators we haven't got mature enough
 

6147
01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:31,109
simulators we haven't got mature enough
simulators

6148
01:46:31,109 --> 01:46:31,119
simulators
 

6149
01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:32,310
simulators
there are some things that are still

6150
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,320
there are some things that are still
 

6151
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:38,070
there are some things that are still
hard difficult that has changed

6152
01:46:38,070 --> 01:46:38,080

 

6153
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:40,390

but but we actually we know what the

6154
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,400
but but we actually we know what the
 

6155
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,990
but but we actually we know what the
governing equations are they have some

01:46:41,990 --> 01:46:42,000
governing equations are they have some
 

6157
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:42,790
governing equations are they have some
foibles

6158
01:46:42,790 --> 01:46:42,800
foibles
 

6159
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:45,109
foibles
like this indeterminacy but we should be

6160
01:46:45,109 --> 01:46:45,119
like this indeterminacy but we should be
 

6161
01:46:45,119 --> 01:46:48,470
like this indeterminacy but we should be
able to simulate them accurately

6162
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480
able to simulate them accurately
 

6163
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,229
able to simulate them accurately
we have incredible open source community

6164
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:50,239
we have incredible open source community
 

6165
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:52,550
we have incredible open source community
in robotics but it actually just takes a

6166
01:46:52,550 --> 01:46:52,560
in robotics but it actually just takes a
 

6167
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,229
in robotics but it actually just takes a

01:46:54,239 --> 01:46:56,629
professional engineering team
a lot of work to write a very good

6170
01:46:56,629 --> 01:46:56,639
a lot of work to write a very good
 

6171
01:46:56,639 --> 01:46:58,550
a lot of work to write a very good
simulator like that

6172
01:46:58,550 --> 01:46:58,560
simulator like that
 

6173
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,270
simulator like that
uh now where does um i believe you've

6174
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:01,280
uh now where does um i believe you've
 

6175
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,189
uh now where does um i believe you've
written drake

6176
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:03,199
written drake
 

6177
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,350
written drake
there's a team of people i certainly

6178
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:05,360
there's a team of people i certainly
 

6179
01:47:05,360 --> 01:47:07,189
there's a team of people i certainly
spend a lot of hours on it myself

6180
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
spend a lot of hours on it myself
 

6181
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:10,149
spend a lot of hours on it myself
well what is drake and what um what does

6182
01:47:10,149 --> 01:47:10,159
well what is drake and what um what does
 

6183
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:11,189
well what is drake and what um what does
it take to

6184
01:47:11,189 --> 01:47:11,199
it take to
 

6185
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:15,350
it take to
to to create a simulation environment

6186
01:47:15,350 --> 01:47:15,360
to to create a simulation environment
 

6187
01:47:15,360 --> 01:47:18,149
to to create a simulation environment
uh for for the kind of difficult control

6188
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
uh for for the kind of difficult control
 

6189
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:20,629
uh for for the kind of difficult control
problems we're talking about

6190
01:47:20,629 --> 01:47:20,639
problems we're talking about
 

6191
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,709
problems we're talking about
right so drake is the simulator that

6192
01:47:22,709 --> 01:47:22,719
right so drake is the simulator that
 

6193
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:24,149
right so drake is the simulator that
that i've been working on

6194
01:47:24,149 --> 01:47:24,159
that i've been working on
 

6195
01:47:24,159 --> 01:47:25,910
that i've been working on
um there are other good simulators out

6196
01:47:25,910 --> 01:47:25,920
um there are other good simulators out
 

6197
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:27,910
um there are other good simulators out
there i don't like to think of drake as

6198
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:27,920
there i don't like to think of drake as
 

6199
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:29,590
there i don't like to think of drake as
just a simulator

6200
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:29,600
just a simulator
 

6201
01:47:29,600 --> 01:47:31,270
just a simulator
because because we write our controllers

6202
01:47:31,270 --> 01:47:31,280
because because we write our controllers
 

6203
01:47:31,280 --> 01:47:32,870
because because we write our controllers
in drake we write our perception systems

6204
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:32,880
in drake we write our perception systems
 

6205
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:34,149
in drake we write our perception systems
a little bit in drake

6206
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:34,159
a little bit in drake
 

6207
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:36,310
a little bit in drake
but we write all of our our you know low

6208
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
but we write all of our our you know low
 

6209
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:38,070
but we write all of our our you know low

absolutely yeah i mean drake is three
 

6217
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,910
absolutely yeah i mean drake is three

a bit like labview or simulink where you

6250
01:48:21,030 --> 01:48:21,040
a bit like labview or simulink where you
 

6251
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,510
a bit like labview or simulink where you
can make block diagrams out of complex

systems or it's like ross in that sense
where

6256
01:48:27,430 --> 01:48:27,440
where
 

6257
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:29,109
where
you might have lots of ross nodes that

6258
01:48:29,109 --> 01:48:29,119
you might have lots of ross nodes that
 

6259
01:48:29,119 --> 01:48:31,830
you might have lots of ross nodes that
are each doing some part of your system

are each doing some part of your system
 

6261
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:35,590
are each doing some part of your system
but to contrast it with ross

6262
01:48:35,590 --> 01:48:35,600

 

6263
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,270

we try to write if you write a drake

6264
01:48:37,270 --> 01:48:37,280
we try to write if you write a drake
 

6265
01:48:37,280 --> 01:48:39,910
we try to write if you write a drake
system then you have to

6266
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
system then you have to
 

6267
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,510
system then you have to
it asks you to describe a little bit

6268
01:48:41,510 --> 01:48:41,520
it asks you to describe a little bit
 

6269
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,950
it asks you to describe a little bit
more about the system

6270
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
more about the system
 

6271
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,510
more about the system
if you have any state for instance in

6272
01:48:45,510 --> 01:48:45,520
if you have any state for instance in
 

6273
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:46,950
if you have any state for instance in
the system there any variables that are

6274
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:46,960
the system there any variables that are
 

6275
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:48,310
the system there any variables that are
going to persist you have to declare

6276
01:48:48,310 --> 01:48:48,320
going to persist you have to declare
 

6277
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:48,950
going to persist you have to declare
them

6278
01:48:48,950 --> 01:48:48,960
them
 

6279
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:51,510
them
parameters can be declared and the like

6280
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
parameters can be declared and the like
 

6281
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:51,990
parameters can be declared and the like
but the

6282
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:52,000
but the
 

6283
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,070
but the
advantage of doing that is that you can

6284
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
advantage of doing that is that you can
 

6285
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:55,030
advantage of doing that is that you can
if you like

6286
01:48:55,030 --> 01:48:55,040
if you like
 

6287
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:57,590
if you like
run things all on one process but you

6288
01:48:57,590 --> 01:48:57,600
run things all on one process but you
 

6289
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,470
run things all on one process but you
can also

6290
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
can also
 

6291
01:48:58,480 --> 01:49:01,109
can also
do control design against it you can do

6292
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:01,119
do control design against it you can do
 

6293
01:49:01,119 --> 01:49:02,310
do control design against it you can do
i mean simple things like

6294
01:49:02,310 --> 01:49:02,320
i mean simple things like
 

6295
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:05,750
i mean simple things like
rewinding and playing back your your

6296
01:49:05,750 --> 01:49:05,760
rewinding and playing back your your
 

6297
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:07,830
rewinding and playing back your your
your simulations for instance you know

6298
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:07,840
your simulations for instance you know
 

6299
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,669
your simulations for instance you know
these things you get some rewards for

6300
01:49:09,669 --> 01:49:09,679
these things you get some rewards for
 

6301
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:11,270
these things you get some rewards for
spending a little bit more upfront cost

6302
01:49:11,270 --> 01:49:11,280
spending a little bit more upfront cost
 

6303
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,589
spending a little bit more upfront cost
in describing each system

6304
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:13,599
in describing each system
 

6305
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,790
in describing each system
and and i i was inspired to do that

6306
01:49:16,790 --> 01:49:16,800
and and i i was inspired to do that
 

6307
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:19,430
and and i i was inspired to do that
because i think the complexity of atlas

6308
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:19,440
because i think the complexity of atlas
 

6309
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:20,790
because i think the complexity of atlas
for instance

6310
01:49:20,790 --> 01:49:20,800
for instance
 

6311
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:23,430
for instance
um is just so great and i think although

6312
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:23,440
um is just so great and i think although
 

6313
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:24,070
um is just so great and i think although
i mean

6314
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:24,080
i mean
 

6315
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,189
i mean
ross has been incredible absolutely huge

6316
01:49:27,189 --> 01:49:27,199
ross has been incredible absolutely huge
 

6317
01:49:27,199 --> 01:49:28,550
ross has been incredible absolutely huge
fan of what it's done for the

6318
01:49:28,550 --> 01:49:28,560
fan of what it's done for the
 

6319
01:49:28,560 --> 01:49:33,030
fan of what it's done for the
robotics community but it um

6320
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:33,040
robotics community but it um
 

6321
01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:34,629
robotics community but it um
the ability to rapidly put different

6322
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:34,639
the ability to rapidly put different
 

6323
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:36,870
the ability to rapidly put different
pieces together and have a functioning

pieces together and have a functioning
 

6325
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:40,870
pieces together and have a functioning
thing is very good but i do think that

6326
01:49:40,870 --> 01:49:40,880
thing is very good but i do think that
 

6327
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:43,510
thing is very good but i do think that
it's hard to think clearly about a bag

6328
01:49:43,510 --> 01:49:43,520
it's hard to think clearly about a bag

6369
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:20,790
and that um we also have renderers and
other things but i think the

01:50:20,790 --> 01:50:20,800
other things but i think the
 

6371
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:23,189
other things but i think the

it was like helping you think i guess um

6416
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800
it was like helping you think i guess um
 

6417
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,750
it was like helping you think i guess um
what i um see you have this like awesome

6427
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:29,430
uh grasping it like for the first time
um that's just seems like so difficult

6428
01:51:29,430 --> 01:51:29,440
um that's just seems like so difficult
 

6429
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:33,430
um that's just seems like so difficult
what how do you simulate any of that

6430
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:33,440
what how do you simulate any of that
 

6431
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:35,189
what how do you simulate any of that
so it was really interesting that what

6432
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:35,199
so it was really interesting that what
 

6433
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:36,470
so it was really interesting that what
happened was that

6434
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:36,480
happened was that
 

6435
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:39,109
happened was that
um we started getting more professional

6436
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:39,119

that can pick up the dishes
 

6495
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,189
that can pick up the dishes
and there's also a team working on

6496
01:52:43,189 --> 01:52:43,199
and there's also a team working on
 

6497
01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:45,350
and there's also a team working on
manipulation there that is

6498
01:52:45,350 --> 01:52:45,360
manipulation there that is
 

6499
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:47,350
manipulation there that is
taking problems like loading the

6500
01:52:47,350 --> 01:52:47,360
taking problems like loading the
 

6501
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:48,870
taking problems like loading the
dishwasher

6502
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:48,880
dishwasher
 

6503
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:51,910
dishwasher
and we're using that to study these

6504
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:51,920
and we're using that to study these
 

6505
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:53,350
and we're using that to study these
really hard corner cases kind of

6506
01:52:53,350 --> 01:52:53,360
really hard corner cases kind of
 

6507
01:52:53,360 --> 01:52:55,189
really hard corner cases kind of
problems in manipulation

6508
01:52:55,189 --> 01:52:55,199
problems in manipulation
 

6509
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:59,030
problems in manipulation
so for me this you know simulating

6510
01:52:59,030 --> 01:52:59,040
so for me this you know simulating
 

6511
01:52:59,040 --> 01:53:00,550
so for me this you know simulating
the dishes we could actually write a

6512
01:53:00,550 --> 01:53:00,560
the dishes we could actually write a
 

6513
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:02,950
the dishes we could actually write a
controller if we just cared about

6514
01:53:02,950 --> 01:53:02,960
controller if we just cared about
 

6515
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:05,030
controller if we just cared about
picking up dishes in the sink once we

6516
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:05,040
picking up dishes in the sink once we
 

6517
01:53:05,040 --> 01:53:06,229
picking up dishes in the sink once we
could write a controller without any

6518
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:06,239
could write a controller without any
 

6519
01:53:06,239 --> 01:53:07,589
could write a controller without any
simulation whatsoever

6520
01:53:07,589 --> 01:53:07,599
simulation whatsoever
 

6521
01:53:07,599 --> 01:53:10,550
simulation whatsoever
and we could call it done but we want to

6522
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:10,560
and we could call it done but we want to
 

6523
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:12,070
and we could call it done but we want to
understand like

6524
01:53:12,070 --> 01:53:12,080
understand like
 

6525
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:14,790
understand like
what is the path you take to actually

6526
01:53:14,790 --> 01:53:14,800
what is the path you take to actually
 

6527
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:16,470
what is the path you take to actually
get to

6528
01:53:16,470 --> 01:53:16,480
get to
 

6529
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:18,629
get to
a robot that could perform that for any

6530
01:53:18,629 --> 01:53:18,639
a robot that could perform that for any
 

6531
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:19,589
a robot that could perform that for any

uh in anybody's kitchen with with enough
confidence that it could be

6536
01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:23,920
confidence that it could be
 

6537
01:53:23,920 --> 01:53:27,189
confidence that it could be
a commercial product right and and

6538
01:53:27,189 --> 01:53:27,199
a commercial product right and and
 

6539
01:53:27,199 --> 01:53:28,950
a commercial product right and and
it has deep learning perception in the

6540
01:53:28,950 --> 01:53:28,960
it has deep learning perception in the
 

6541
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,950
it has deep learning perception in the
loop it has complex dynamics in the loop

6542
01:53:30,950 --> 01:53:30,960

it has controller it has a planner
 

6545
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:34,550
it has controller it has a planner
and how do you take all of that

6546
01:53:34,550 --> 01:53:34,560
and how do you take all of that
 

6547
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,229
and how do you take all of that

enough confidence to deploy i mean the
 

6557
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,790

01:53:48,790 --> 01:53:48,800
darpa challenge
 

6559
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,470
darpa challenge
made me realize that that's not

6560
01:53:50,470 --> 01:53:50,480
made me realize that that's not
 

6561
01:53:50,480 --> 01:53:51,910
made me realize that that's not
something you throw over the fence and

6562
01:53:51,910 --> 01:53:51,920
something you throw over the fence and
 

6563
01:53:51,920 --> 01:53:53,510
something you throw over the fence and
hope that somebody will harden it

6564
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:53,520
hope that somebody will harden it
 

6565
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:55,270
hope that somebody will harden it
for you that there are really

6566
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,280
for you that there are really
 

6567
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,350
for you that there are really
fundamental challenges

6568
01:53:57,350 --> 01:53:57,360
fundamental challenges
 

6569
01:53:57,360 --> 01:53:59,990
fundamental challenges
in uh in closing that last gap they're

6570
01:53:59,990 --> 01:54:00,000
in uh in closing that last gap they're
 

6571
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,270
in uh in closing that last gap they're
doing the validation

6572
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:01,280
doing the validation
 

6573
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:04,709
doing the validation
and the testing i think it might even

6574
01:54:04,709 --> 01:54:04,719
and the testing i think it might even
 

6575
01:54:04,719 --> 01:54:06,629
and the testing i think it might even
change the way we have to think about

6576
01:54:06,629 --> 01:54:06,639
change the way we have to think about
 

6577
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:09,750
change the way we have to think about
the way we write systems

in in a real on a real robot do we have
 

6595
01:54:28,320 --> 01:54:29,750
in in a real on a real robot do we have
to be able to bring that

the corner cases
 

6699
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:22,870
the corner cases
so you basically imagine you're you're

01:56:22,870 --> 01:56:22,880
so you basically imagine you're you're
 

6701
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:26,070
so you basically imagine you're you're

around that
 

6719
01:56:40,480 --> 01:56:43,589

places where that can be
 

6723
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:48,310
places where that can be
where things can go wrong is very big so

where things can go wrong is very big so
 

6725
01:56:48,320 --> 01:56:50,390
where things can go wrong is very big so
it's hard to write those algorithms yeah

6726
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:50,400
it's hard to write those algorithms yeah
 

6727
01:56:50,400 --> 01:56:52,229
it's hard to write those algorithms yeah
rare event simulation is just like a

6728
01:56:52,229 --> 01:56:52,239
rare event simulation is just like a

01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:54,390
rare event simulation is just like a

6730
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:54,400
really compelling notion
 

6731
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:56,470
really compelling notion

01:56:56,470 --> 01:56:56,480
uh if it's possible we joked and we
 

6733
01:56:56,480 --> 01:56:57,990
uh if it's possible we joked and we
called we call it the black swan

6734
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000
called we call it the black swan

6737
01:56:58,719 --> 01:57:00,229

it's a black swan right because you

6738
01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:00,239
it's a black swan right because you
 

6739
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:01,910
it's a black swan right because you
don't just want the rare events you want

6740
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:01,920
don't just want the rare events you want
 

6741

don't just want the rare events you want
the ones that are

6742
01:57:02,709 --> 01:57:02,719
the ones that are
 

6743
01:57:02,719 --> 01:57:06,390
the ones that are
highly impactful i mean that's the most

6744
01:57:06,390 --> 01:57:06,400
highly impactful i mean that's the most
 

6745
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,229
highly impactful i mean that's the most
those are the most sort of profound

6746
01:57:08,229 --> 01:57:08,239
those are the most sort of profound
 

6747
01:57:08,239 --> 01:57:10,070
those are the most sort of profound
questions we ask of our world

6748
01:57:10,070 --> 01:57:10,080
questions we ask of our world
 

6749
01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:13,910
questions we ask of our world
like uh what's the

6750
01:57:13,910 --> 01:57:13,920
like uh what's the
 

6751
01:57:13,920 --> 01:57:16,550
like uh what's the
uh what's the worst that can happen uh

6752
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
uh what's the worst that can happen uh
 

6753
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:17,990
uh what's the worst that can happen uh
but what we're really asking

6754
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
but what we're really asking
 

6755
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,709
but what we're really asking
isn't some kind of like computer science

6756
01:57:20,709 --> 01:57:20,719
isn't some kind of like computer science
 

6757
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:22,470
isn't some kind of like computer science
worst case analysis

6758
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:22,480
worst case analysis
 

6759
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:24,790
worst case analysis
we're asking like what are the millions

6760
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:24,800
we're asking like what are the millions
 

6761
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:25,510
we're asking like what are the millions
of ways

6762
01:57:25,510 --> 01:57:25,520
of ways
 

6763
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,229
of ways
this can go wrong and that's like our

6764
01:57:28,229 --> 01:57:28,239
this can go wrong and that's like our
 

6765
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:31,109
this can go wrong and that's like our
curiosity

6766
01:57:31,109 --> 01:57:31,119

 

6767
01:57:31,119 --> 01:57:34,709

we humans i think are pretty bad at uh

6768
01:57:34,709 --> 01:57:34,719
we humans i think are pretty bad at uh
 

6769
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,270
we humans i think are pretty bad at uh
we just like run into it and i think

6770
01:57:37,270 --> 01:57:37,280
we just like run into it and i think
 

6771
01:57:37,280 --> 01:57:38,790
we just like run into it and i think
there's a distributed sense because

6772
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:38,800
there's a distributed sense because
 

6773
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,589
there's a distributed sense because
there's now like 7.5 billion of us

6774
01:57:41,589 --> 01:57:41,599
there's now like 7.5 billion of us
 

6775
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,270
there's now like 7.5 billion of us
and so there's a lot of them and then a

6776
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:43,280
and so there's a lot of them and then a
 

6777
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:45,430
and so there's a lot of them and then a
lot of them write blog posts about the

6778
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:45,440
lot of them write blog posts about the
 

6779
01:57:45,440 --> 01:57:47,430
lot of them write blog posts about the
stupid thing they've done so we learn

6780
01:57:47,430 --> 01:57:47,440
stupid thing they've done so we learn
 

6781
01:57:47,440 --> 01:57:50,709
stupid thing they've done so we learn
in a distributed way um there's there's

6782
01:57:50,709 --> 01:57:50,719
in a distributed way um there's there's
 

6783
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:51,830
in a distributed way um there's there's
something that's going to be important

6784
01:57:51,830 --> 01:57:51,840
something that's going to be important
 

6785
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:53,830
something that's going to be important
for robots too yeah i mean that's

6786
01:57:53,830 --> 01:57:53,840
for robots too yeah i mean that's
 

6787
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,950
for robots too yeah i mean that's
that's another massive theme at toyota

6788
01:57:56,950 --> 01:57:56,960
that's another massive theme at toyota
 

6789
01:57:56,960 --> 01:57:57,510
that's another massive theme at toyota

01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:57,520
research
 

6791
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:59,750
research
for robotics is this fleet learning

6792
01:57:59,750 --> 01:57:59,760
for robotics is this fleet learning
 

6793
01:57:59,760 --> 01:58:01,430
for robotics is this fleet learning
concept is

6794
01:58:01,430 --> 01:58:01,440
concept is
 

6795
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:04,310
concept is
um you know the idea that i as a

6796
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:04,320
um you know the idea that i as a
 

6797
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,030
um you know the idea that i as a
humanoid

6798
01:58:05,030 --> 01:58:05,040
humanoid
 

6799
01:58:05,040 --> 01:58:06,870

don't have enough time to visit all of

6800
01:58:06,870 --> 01:58:06,880
don't have enough time to visit all of
 

6801
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:08,550
don't have enough time to visit all of
my states right there's just a

6802
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:08,560
my states right there's just a
 

6803
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,149
my states right there's just a
it's very hard for one robot to

6804
01:58:10,149 --> 01:58:10,159
it's very hard for one robot to
 

6805
01:58:10,159 --> 01:58:12,470
it's very hard for one robot to
experience all the things

6806
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
experience all the things
 

6807
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,910
experience all the things
but that's not actually the problem we

6808
01:58:13,910 --> 01:58:13,920
but that's not actually the problem we
 

6809
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,390
but that's not actually the problem we
have to solve right um

6810
01:58:16,390 --> 01:58:16,400
have to solve right um
 

6811
01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:17,750
have to solve right um
we're gonna have fleets of robots that

6812
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:17,760
we're gonna have fleets of robots that
 

6813
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:20,629
we're gonna have fleets of robots that
can have very similar appendages

6814
01:58:20,629 --> 01:58:20,639
can have very similar appendages
 

6815
01:58:20,639 --> 01:58:24,070
can have very similar appendages
and at some point maybe collectively

6816
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:24,080
and at some point maybe collectively
 

6817
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:25,589
and at some point maybe collectively
they have

6818
01:58:25,589 --> 01:58:25,599
they have
 

6819
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,790
they have
enough data that their computational

6820
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:28,800
enough data that their computational
 

6821
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:30,070
enough data that their computational
processes should be set up differently

6822
01:58:30,070 --> 01:58:30,080
processes should be set up differently
 

6823
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:31,669
processes should be set up differently
than ours right

6824
01:58:31,669 --> 01:58:31,679
than ours right
 

6825
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:34,390
than ours right
it's a have this vision of just i mean

6826
01:58:34,390 --> 01:58:34,400
it's a have this vision of just i mean
 

6827
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:35,030
it's a have this vision of just i mean
all these

6828
01:58:35,030 --> 01:58:35,040
all these
 

6829
01:58:35,040 --> 01:58:38,790
all these
uh dishwasher unloading robots

6830
01:58:38,790 --> 01:58:38,800
uh dishwasher unloading robots
 

6831
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,470
uh dishwasher unloading robots
i mean um that robot dropping a plate

6832
01:58:42,470 --> 01:58:42,480
i mean um that robot dropping a plate
 

6833
01:58:42,480 --> 01:58:45,270
i mean um that robot dropping a plate
and a human looking at the robot

6834
01:58:45,270 --> 01:58:45,280
and a human looking at the robot
 

6835
01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:46,830
and a human looking at the robot
probably pissed off

6836
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:46,840
probably pissed off
 

6837
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:49,750
probably pissed off
yeah but uh that's a special moment to

6838
01:58:49,750 --> 01:58:49,760
yeah but uh that's a special moment to
 

6839
01:58:49,760 --> 01:58:51,109
yeah but uh that's a special moment to
record

6840
01:58:51,109 --> 01:58:51,119
record
 

6841
01:58:51,119 --> 01:58:53,109
record
i think one one thing in terms of fleet

6842
01:58:53,109 --> 01:58:53,119
i think one one thing in terms of fleet
 

6843
01:58:53,119 --> 01:58:54,390
i think one one thing in terms of fleet
learning

6844
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:54,400
learning
 

6845
01:58:54,400 --> 01:58:56,229
learning
and i've seen that because i i've talked

6846
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
and i've seen that because i i've talked
 

6847
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,669
and i've seen that because i i've talked
to a lot of folks um

6848
01:58:57,669 --> 01:58:57,679
to a lot of folks um
 

6849
01:58:57,679 --> 01:59:00,310
to a lot of folks um
just like like tesla users or tesla

6850
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:00,320
just like like tesla users or tesla
 

6851
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:01,109
just like like tesla users or tesla
drivers

6852
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:01,119
drivers
 

6853
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:02,870
drivers
they're not another another company

6854
01:59:02,870 --> 01:59:02,880
they're not another another company
 

6855
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:04,550
they're not another another company
that's using this kind of fleet learning

6856
01:59:04,550 --> 01:59:04,560
that's using this kind of fleet learning
 

6857
01:59:04,560 --> 01:59:05,109
that's using this kind of fleet learning
idea

6858
01:59:05,109 --> 01:59:05,119
idea
 

6859
01:59:05,119 --> 01:59:07,030
idea
and one hopeful thing i have about

6860
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:07,040
and one hopeful thing i have about
 

6861
01:59:07,040 --> 01:59:08,149
and one hopeful thing i have about
humans

6862
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
humans
 

6863
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:11,510
humans
is they really enjoy when a system

6864
01:59:11,510 --> 01:59:11,520
is they really enjoy when a system
 

6865
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,229
is they really enjoy when a system
improves learns so they enjoy fleet

6866
01:59:14,229 --> 01:59:14,239
improves learns so they enjoy fleet
 

6867
01:59:14,239 --> 01:59:15,510
improves learns so they enjoy fleet
learning and they're

6868
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:15,520
learning and they're
 

6869
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,750
learning and they're
the reason it's hopeful for me is

6870
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:17,760
the reason it's hopeful for me is
 

6871
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:19,750
the reason it's hopeful for me is
they're willing to put up with

6872
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:19,760
they're willing to put up with
 

6873
01:59:19,760 --> 01:59:22,550
they're willing to put up with
something that's kind of dumb right now

6874
01:59:22,550 --> 01:59:22,560
something that's kind of dumb right now
 

6875
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:23,510
something that's kind of dumb right now
and they're like

6876
01:59:23,510 --> 01:59:23,520
and they're like
 

6877
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,350
and they're like
if it's improving they almost like enjoy

6878
01:59:27,350 --> 01:59:27,360
if it's improving they almost like enjoy
 

6879
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,350
if it's improving they almost like enjoy
being part of the like teaching it

6880
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:29,360
being part of the like teaching it
 

6881
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,030
being part of the like teaching it
almost like we if you have kids like

6882
01:59:31,030 --> 01:59:31,040
almost like we if you have kids like
 

6883
01:59:31,040 --> 01:59:32,950
almost like we if you have kids like
you're teaching them something right

6884
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:32,960
you're teaching them something right
 

6885
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,030
you're teaching them something right
um i think that's a beautiful thing

6886
01:59:35,030 --> 01:59:35,040
um i think that's a beautiful thing
 

6887
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,470
um i think that's a beautiful thing
because that that gives me hope that we

6888
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:36,480
because that that gives me hope that we
 

6889
01:59:36,480 --> 01:59:37,109
because that that gives me hope that we
can put

6890
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:37,119
can put
 

6891
01:59:37,119 --> 01:59:40,229
can put
dumb robots out there uh as long i mean

6892
01:59:40,229 --> 01:59:40,239
dumb robots out there uh as long i mean
 

6893
01:59:40,239 --> 01:59:41,109
dumb robots out there uh as long i mean
the problem with

6894
01:59:41,109 --> 01:59:41,119
the problem with
 

6895
01:59:41,119 --> 01:59:43,830
the problem with
on the tesla side with cars cars can

6896
01:59:43,830 --> 01:59:43,840
on the tesla side with cars cars can
 

6897
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:45,189
on the tesla side with cars cars can
kill you

6898
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:45,199
kill you
 

6899
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:46,629
kill you
that's that makes the problem so much

6900
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
that's that makes the problem so much
 

6901
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,870
that's that makes the problem so much
harder dishwasher

6902
01:59:48,870 --> 01:59:48,880
harder dishwasher
 

6903
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:50,790
harder dishwasher
unloading is a little safe that's why

6904
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:50,800
unloading is a little safe that's why
 

6905
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:52,950
unloading is a little safe that's why
home robotics is uh

6906

vision of the home of the future 10 20
 

6979
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:03,750
vision of the home of the future 10 20
years from now

6980
02:01:03,750 --> 02:01:03,760
years from now
 

6981
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,669
years from now
50 years if you get crazy yeah i think

6982
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
50 years if you get crazy yeah i think
 

6983
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:10,629
50 years if you get crazy yeah i think
we already have roombas cruising around

6984
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:10,639
we already have roombas cruising around
 

6985
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:11,189
we already have roombas cruising around
we have

6986
02:01:11,189 --> 02:01:11,199
we have
 

6987
02:01:11,199 --> 02:01:13,589
we have
uh uh you know alexa's or google homes

6988
02:01:13,589 --> 02:01:13,599
uh uh you know alexa's or google homes
 

6989
02:01:13,599 --> 02:01:14,790
uh uh you know alexa's or google homes
on their our

6990
02:01:14,790 --> 02:01:14,800
on their our
 

6991
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:16,870
on their our
kitchen counter it's only a matter of

6992
02:01:16,870 --> 02:01:16,880
kitchen counter it's only a matter of
 

6993
02:01:16,880 --> 02:01:18,229
kitchen counter it's only a matter of
time till they spring arms and start

6994
02:01:18,229 --> 02:01:18,239
time till they spring arms and start
 

6995
02:01:18,239 --> 02:01:19,669
time till they spring arms and start
doing something

6996
02:01:19,669 --> 02:01:19,679
doing something
 

6997
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:22,709
doing something
useful like that um so

6998
02:01:22,709 --> 02:01:22,719
useful like that um so
 

6999
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,669
useful like that um so
i do think it's coming i think it's lots

7000
02:01:25,669 --> 02:01:25,679
i do think it's coming i think it's lots
 

7001
02:01:25,679 --> 02:01:27,589
i do think it's coming i think it's lots
of people have lots of motivations

7002
02:01:27,589 --> 02:01:27,599
of people have lots of motivations
 

7003
02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,790
of people have lots of motivations
for doing it it's been super interesting

7004
02:01:30,790 --> 02:01:30,800
for doing it it's been super interesting
 

7005
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,390
for doing it it's been super interesting
actually learning about

7006
02:01:32,390 --> 02:01:32,400
actually learning about
 

7007
02:01:32,400 --> 02:01:34,790
actually learning about
toyota's vision for it which is about

7008
02:01:34,790 --> 02:01:34,800
toyota's vision for it which is about
 

7009
02:01:34,800 --> 02:01:38,550
toyota's vision for it which is about
helping people age in place

7010
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560

 

7011
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,310

because i think that's not necessarily

7012
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:40,320
because i think that's not necessarily
 

7013
02:01:40,320 --> 02:01:43,270
because i think that's not necessarily
the first entry the most lucrative

7014
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:43,280
the first entry the most lucrative
 

7015
02:01:43,280 --> 02:01:45,189
the first entry the most lucrative
entry point but it's the problem maybe

7016
02:01:45,189 --> 02:01:45,199
entry point but it's the problem maybe
 

7017
02:01:45,199 --> 02:01:47,510
entry point but it's the problem maybe
that

7018
02:01:47,510 --> 02:01:47,520

 

7019
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,990

we really need to solve no matter what

7020
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:50,000
we really need to solve no matter what
 

7021
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,990
we really need to solve no matter what
and

7022
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:52,000
and
 

7023
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:53,270
and
so i think i think there's a real

7024
02:01:53,270 --> 02:01:53,280
so i think i think there's a real
 

7025
02:01:53,280 --> 02:01:55,270
so i think i think there's a real
opportunity it's a delicate

7026
02:01:55,270 --> 02:01:55,280
opportunity it's a delicate
 

7027
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:58,229
opportunity it's a delicate
problem how do you work with people help

7028
02:01:58,229 --> 02:01:58,239
problem how do you work with people help
 

7029
02:01:58,239 --> 02:01:59,270
problem how do you work with people help
people

7030
02:01:59,270 --> 02:01:59,280
people
 

7031
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,270
people
keep them active engaged you know

7032
02:02:03,270 --> 02:02:03,280
keep them active engaged you know
 

7033
02:02:03,280 --> 02:02:05,830
keep them active engaged you know
but improve their quality of life and uh

7034
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:05,840
but improve their quality of life and uh
 

7035
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,589
but improve their quality of life and uh
and and help them age in place for

7036
02:02:07,589 --> 02:02:07,599
and and help them age in place for
 

7037
02:02:07,599 --> 02:02:08,229
and and help them age in place for
instance

7038
02:02:08,229 --> 02:02:08,239
instance
 

7039
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:11,510
instance
it's interesting because older folks are

7040
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:11,520
it's interesting because older folks are
 

7041
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:13,669
it's interesting because older folks are
also i mean there's a contrast there

7042
02:02:13,669 --> 02:02:13,679
also i mean there's a contrast there
 

7043
02:02:13,679 --> 02:02:15,669
also i mean there's a contrast there
because um

7044
02:02:15,669 --> 02:02:15,679
because um
 

7045
02:02:15,679 --> 02:02:18,149
because um
they're not always the the folks who are

7046
02:02:18,149 --> 02:02:18,159
they're not always the the folks who are
 

7047
02:02:18,159 --> 02:02:19,589
they're not always the the folks who are
the most comfortable technology for

7048
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:19,599
the most comfortable technology for
 

7049
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:20,790
the most comfortable technology for
example

7050
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:20,800
example
 

7051
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,109
example
so there's a there's a there's a

7052
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:23,119
so there's a there's a there's a
 

7053
02:02:23,119 --> 02:02:24,870
so there's a there's a there's a
division that's interesting there that

7054
02:02:24,870 --> 02:02:24,880
division that's interesting there that
 

7055
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:28,149
division that's interesting there that
you can do so much good with a robot

7056
02:02:28,149 --> 02:02:28,159
you can do so much good with a robot
 

7057
02:02:28,159 --> 02:02:33,030
you can do so much good with a robot
for for older folks but there's a

7058
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,040
for for older folks but there's a
 

7059
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:36,310
for for older folks but there's a
there's a gap to feel of understanding i

7060
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:36,320
there's a gap to feel of understanding i
 

7061
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:36,629
there's a gap to feel of understanding i
mean

7062
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
mean
 

7063
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:39,830
mean
it's actually kind of beautiful um robot

7064
02:02:39,830 --> 02:02:39,840
it's actually kind of beautiful um robot
 

7065
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:41,270
it's actually kind of beautiful um robot
is learning about the human and the

7066
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:41,280
is learning about the human and the
 

7067
02:02:41,280 --> 02:02:43,669
is learning about the human and the
human is kind of learning about this

7068
02:02:43,669 --> 02:02:43,679
human is kind of learning about this
 

7069
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:48,149
human is kind of learning about this
new robot thing and it's uh also with um

7070
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
new robot thing and it's uh also with um
 

7071
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:50,310
new robot thing and it's uh also with um
at least with uh like when i talk to my

7072
02:02:50,310 --> 02:02:50,320
at least with uh like when i talk to my
 

7073
02:02:50,320 --> 02:02:51,750
at least with uh like when i talk to my
parents about robots there's a little

7074
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:51,760
parents about robots there's a little
 

7075
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:52,470
parents about robots there's a little
bit of a

7076
02:02:52,470 --> 02:02:52,480
bit of a
 

7077
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:55,510
bit of a
blank slate there too like

7078
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:55,520
blank slate there too like
 

7079
02:02:55,520 --> 02:02:57,910
blank slate there too like
you can i mean they don't know anything

7080
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:57,920
you can i mean they don't know anything
 

7081
02:02:57,920 --> 02:02:59,350
you can i mean they don't know anything
about robotics

7082
02:02:59,350 --> 02:02:59,360
about robotics
 

7083
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:02,470
about robotics
so it's completely like wide open

7084
02:03:02,470 --> 02:03:02,480
so it's completely like wide open
 

7085
02:03:02,480 --> 02:03:04,149
so it's completely like wide open
they don't have that they haven't my

7086
02:03:04,149 --> 02:03:04,159
they don't have that they haven't my
 

7087
02:03:04,159 --> 02:03:06,709
they don't have that they haven't my
parents haven't seen black mirror

7088
02:03:06,709 --> 02:03:06,719
parents haven't seen black mirror
 

7089
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:08,950
parents haven't seen black mirror
so like they they there's it's a blank

7090
02:03:08,950 --> 02:03:08,960
so like they they there's it's a blank
 

7091
02:03:08,960 --> 02:03:10,629
so like they they there's it's a blank
slate here's a cool thing like what can

7092
02:03:10,629 --> 02:03:10,639
slate here's a cool thing like what can
 

7093
02:03:10,639 --> 02:03:11,830
slate here's a cool thing like what can
you do for me

7094
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:11,840
you do for me
 

7095
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:14,550
you do for me
yeah so it's an exciting space i think

7096
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,560
yeah so it's an exciting space i think
 

7097
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:16,229
yeah so it's an exciting space i think
it's a really important space

7098
02:03:16,229 --> 02:03:16,239
it's a really important space
 

7099
02:03:16,239 --> 02:03:19,510
it's a really important space
i do feel like you know a few years ago

7100
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:19,520
i do feel like you know a few years ago
 

7101
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,070
i do feel like you know a few years ago
uh drones were successful enough in

7102
02:03:22,070 --> 02:03:22,080
uh drones were successful enough in
 

7103
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:23,430
uh drones were successful enough in
academia they kind of

7104
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:23,440
academia they kind of
 

7105
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,990
academia they kind of
broke out and started in industry and

7106
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,000
broke out and started in industry and
 

7107
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:27,030
broke out and started in industry and
autonomous cars

7108
02:03:27,030 --> 02:03:27,040
autonomous cars
 

7109
02:03:27,040 --> 02:03:29,669
autonomous cars
have been happening it does feel like

7110
02:03:29,669 --> 02:03:29,679
have been happening it does feel like
 

7111
02:03:29,679 --> 02:03:31,270
have been happening it does feel like
manipulation

7112
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,280
manipulation
 

7113
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:34,229
manipulation
in logistics of course first but in the

7114
02:03:34,229 --> 02:03:34,239
in logistics of course first but in the
 

7115
02:03:34,239 --> 02:03:34,870
in logistics of course first but in the
home

7116
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:34,880
home
 

7117
02:03:34,880 --> 02:03:36,550
home
shortly after seems like one of the next

7118
02:03:36,550 --> 02:03:36,560
shortly after seems like one of the next
 

7119
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:38,790
shortly after seems like one of the next
big things that's going to really

7120
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:38,800
big things that's going to really
 

7121
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,910
big things that's going to really
pop so uh i don't think we talked about

7122
02:03:41,910 --> 02:03:41,920
pop so uh i don't think we talked about
 

7123
02:03:41,920 --> 02:03:42,310
pop so uh i don't think we talked about
it but

7124
02:03:42,310 --> 02:03:42,320
it but
 

7125
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,109
it but
uh what's soft robotics so we talked

7126
02:03:45,109 --> 02:03:45,119
uh what's soft robotics so we talked
 

7127
02:03:45,119 --> 02:03:46,870
uh what's soft robotics so we talked
about

7128
02:03:46,870 --> 02:03:46,880
about
 

7129
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,149
about
like rigid bodies like if we can just

7130
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
like rigid bodies like if we can just
 

7131
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:51,350
like rigid bodies like if we can just
linger on this whole touch

7132
02:03:51,350 --> 02:03:51,360
linger on this whole touch
 

7133
02:03:51,360 --> 02:03:54,629
linger on this whole touch
thing um yeah so what's soft robotics

7134
02:03:54,629 --> 02:03:54,639
thing um yeah so what's soft robotics
 

7135
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:59,030
thing um yeah so what's soft robotics
so i told you that i

7136
02:03:59,030 --> 02:03:59,040
so i told you that i
 

7137
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:01,510
so i told you that i
really dislike the fact that robots are

7138
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:01,520
really dislike the fact that robots are
 

7139
02:04:01,520 --> 02:04:03,030
really dislike the fact that robots are
afraid of touching the world

7140
02:04:03,030 --> 02:04:03,040
afraid of touching the world
 

7141
02:04:03,040 --> 02:04:05,830
afraid of touching the world
all over their body so there's a couple

7142
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
all over their body so there's a couple
 

7143
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:06,790
all over their body so there's a couple
reasons for that

7144
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800
reasons for that
 

7145
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:08,629
reasons for that
if you look carefully at all the places

7146
02:04:08,629 --> 02:04:08,639
if you look carefully at all the places
 

7147
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:11,109
if you look carefully at all the places
that robots actually do touch the world

7148
02:04:11,109 --> 02:04:11,119
that robots actually do touch the world
 

7149
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:12,709
that robots actually do touch the world
they're almost always soft they have

7150
02:04:12,709 --> 02:04:12,719
they're almost always soft they have
 

7151
02:04:12,719 --> 02:04:14,870
they're almost always soft they have
some sort of pad on their fingers or a

7152
02:04:14,870 --> 02:04:14,880
some sort of pad on their fingers or a
 

7153
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:15,750
some sort of pad on their fingers or a
rubber

7154
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:15,760
rubber
 

7155
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,390

sole on their foot but if you look up

7156
02:04:18,390 --> 02:04:18,400
sole on their foot but if you look up
 

7157
02:04:18,400 --> 02:04:19,189
sole on their foot but if you look up
and down the arm

7158
02:04:19,189 --> 02:04:19,199
and down the arm
 

7159
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:22,830
and down the arm
we're just pure aluminum or something

7160
02:04:22,830 --> 02:04:22,840
we're just pure aluminum or something
 

7161
02:04:22,840 --> 02:04:26,790
we're just pure aluminum or something
so uh so that makes it hard actually in

7162
02:04:26,790 --> 02:04:26,800
so uh so that makes it hard actually in
 

7163
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:27,189
so uh so that makes it hard actually in
fact

7164
02:04:27,189 --> 02:04:27,199
fact
 

7165
02:04:27,199 --> 02:04:29,270
fact
hitting the table with your you know

your rigid arm or nearly rigid arm
 

7169
02:04:32,159 --> 02:04:34,550
your rigid arm or nearly rigid arm
is a is a has some of the problems that

02:04:35,189 --> 02:04:35,199
we talked about
 

7173
02:04:35,199 --> 02:04:37,750
we talked about
in terms of simulation i think it it

7174
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:37,760
in terms of simulation i think it it
 

7175
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:39,430
in terms of simulation i think it it
fundamentally changes the mechanics of

02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:39,440
fundamentally changes the mechanics of
 

7177
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:40,950
fundamentally changes the mechanics of
contact when you're soft

7178
02:04:40,950 --> 02:04:40,960
contact when you're soft
 

7179
02:04:40,960 --> 02:04:43,990
contact when you're soft
right you you turn point contacts into

7180
02:04:43,990 --> 02:04:44,000
right you you turn point contacts into
 

7181
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,990
right you you turn point contacts into
patch contacts which can have torsional

7182
02:04:45,990 --> 02:04:46,000
patch contacts which can have torsional
 

7183
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:46,870

want to pick up an egg

7188
02:04:51,589 --> 02:04:51,599
want to pick up an egg
 

7189
02:04:51,599 --> 02:04:54,229
want to pick up an egg
right if i pick it up with two points

7190
02:04:54,229 --> 02:04:54,239
right if i pick it up with two points
 

7191
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:54,629
right if i pick it up with two points
then

7192
02:04:54,629 --> 02:04:54,639
then
 

7193
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:56,550
then
in order to put enough force to sustain

7194
02:04:56,550 --> 02:04:56,560
in order to put enough force to sustain
 

7195
02:04:56,560 --> 02:04:58,470
in order to put enough force to sustain
the weight of the egg i might have to

7196
02:04:58,470 --> 02:04:58,480
the weight of the egg i might have to
 

7197
02:04:58,480 --> 02:05:00,629
the weight of the egg i might have to
put a lot of force to break the egg if i

7198
02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
put a lot of force to break the egg if i
 

7199
02:05:00,639 --> 02:05:02,149
put a lot of force to break the egg if i
envelop it with a

7200
02:05:02,149 --> 02:05:02,159
envelop it with a
 

7201
02:05:02,159 --> 02:05:05,350
envelop it with a
with contact all all around then i can

7202
02:05:05,350 --> 02:05:05,360
with contact all all around then i can
 

7203
02:05:05,360 --> 02:05:05,990
with contact all all around then i can
distribute my

7204
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:06,000
distribute my
 

7205
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:08,069
distribute my
force across the shell of the egg and

7206
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:08,079
force across the shell of the egg and
 

7207
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,470
force across the shell of the egg and
have a better chance of not breaking it

7208
02:05:10,470 --> 02:05:10,480
have a better chance of not breaking it
 

7209
02:05:10,480 --> 02:05:12,310
have a better chance of not breaking it
so soft robotics is for me a lot about

7210
02:05:12,310 --> 02:05:12,320
so soft robotics is for me a lot about
 

7211
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,990
so soft robotics is for me a lot about
changing the mechanics

7212
02:05:13,990 --> 02:05:14,000
changing the mechanics
 

7213
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,149
changing the mechanics
of contact does it make the problem a

7214
02:05:16,149 --> 02:05:16,159
of contact does it make the problem a
 

7215
02:05:16,159 --> 02:05:18,830
of contact does it make the problem a
lot harder

7216
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:18,840

 

7217
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:21,270

um

7218
02:05:21,270 --> 02:05:21,280
um
 

7219
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:24,870
um
quite the opposite uh it it changes the

7220
02:05:24,870 --> 02:05:24,880
quite the opposite uh it it changes the
 

7221
02:05:24,880 --> 02:05:26,629
quite the opposite uh it it changes the
computational problem

7222
02:05:26,629 --> 02:05:26,639
computational problem
 

7223
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:29,910
computational problem
i think because of the i think our

7224
02:05:29,910 --> 02:05:29,920
i think because of the i think our
 

7225
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:32,870
i think because of the i think our
world and our mathematics has biased us

7226
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:32,880
world and our mathematics has biased us
 

7227
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,390
world and our mathematics has biased us
towards ridgid

7228
02:05:34,390 --> 02:05:34,400
towards ridgid
 

7229
02:05:34,400 --> 02:05:35,990
towards ridgid
but it really should make things better

7230
02:05:35,990 --> 02:05:36,000
but it really should make things better
 

7231
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:38,470
but it really should make things better
in some ways right um

7232
02:05:38,470 --> 02:05:38,480
in some ways right um
 

7233
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:41,510
in some ways right um
it's it's a i think the the

7234
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:41,520
it's it's a i think the the
 

7235
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,790
it's it's a i think the the
the future is unwritten there um but the

7236
02:05:44,790 --> 02:05:44,800
the future is unwritten there um but the
 

7237
02:05:44,800 --> 02:05:45,589
the future is unwritten there um but the
other thing is

7238
02:05:45,589 --> 02:05:45,599
other thing is
 

7239
02:05:45,599 --> 02:05:47,189
other thing is
ultimately sorry to interrupt they think

7240
02:05:47,189 --> 02:05:47,199
ultimately sorry to interrupt they think
 

7241
02:05:47,199 --> 02:05:49,430
ultimately sorry to interrupt they think
ultimately it will make things simpler

7242
02:05:49,430 --> 02:05:49,440
ultimately it will make things simpler
 

7243
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,589
ultimately it will make things simpler
if we embrace the softness of the world

7244
02:05:51,589 --> 02:05:51,599
if we embrace the softness of the world
 

7245
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:52,470
if we embrace the softness of the world
it makes

7246
02:05:52,470 --> 02:05:52,480
it makes
 

7247
02:05:52,480 --> 02:05:55,669
it makes
um it makes things smoother right

7248
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
um it makes things smoother right
 

7249
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,709
um it makes things smoother right
so the the result of

7250
02:05:58,709 --> 02:05:58,719
so the the result of
 

7251
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:02,390
so the the result of
small actions is less discontinuous but

7252
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:02,400
small actions is less discontinuous but
 

7253
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:03,510
small actions is less discontinuous but
it also means

7254
02:06:03,510 --> 02:06:03,520
it also means
 

7255
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,950
it also means
potentially less you know

7256
02:06:04,950 --> 02:06:04,960
potentially less you know
 

7257
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,950
potentially less you know
instantaneously bad

7258
02:06:06,950 --> 02:06:06,960
instantaneously bad
 

7259
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:09,830
instantaneously bad
for instance i won't necessarily contact

7260
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:09,840
for instance i won't necessarily contact
 

7261
02:06:09,840 --> 02:06:13,270
for instance i won't necessarily contact
something and send it flying off

7262
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:13,280
something and send it flying off
 

7263
02:06:13,280 --> 02:06:14,790
something and send it flying off
the other aspect of it that just happens

7264
02:06:14,790 --> 02:06:14,800
the other aspect of it that just happens
 

7265
02:06:14,800 --> 02:06:16,310
the other aspect of it that just happens
to dovetail really well is that

7266
02:06:16,310 --> 02:06:16,320
to dovetail really well is that
 

7267
02:06:16,320 --> 02:06:18,229
to dovetail really well is that
if soft robotics tends to be a place

7268
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:18,239
if soft robotics tends to be a place
 

7269
02:06:18,239 --> 02:06:20,069
if soft robotics tends to be a place
where we can embed a lot of sensors to

7270
02:06:20,069 --> 02:06:20,079
where we can embed a lot of sensors to
 

7271
02:06:20,079 --> 02:06:23,669
where we can embed a lot of sensors to
so if you change your your hardware

7272
02:06:23,669 --> 02:06:23,679
so if you change your your hardware
 

7273
02:06:23,679 --> 02:06:24,950
so if you change your your hardware
and make it more soft then you can

7274
02:06:24,950 --> 02:06:24,960
and make it more soft then you can
 

7275
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:26,870
and make it more soft then you can
potentially have a tactile sensor which

7276
02:06:26,870 --> 02:06:26,880
potentially have a tactile sensor which
 

7277
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:27,510
potentially have a tactile sensor which
is

7278
02:06:27,510 --> 02:06:27,520
is
 

7279
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:30,550
is
measuring the deformation

7280
02:06:30,550 --> 02:06:30,560
measuring the deformation
 

7281
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:33,350
measuring the deformation
so there's a team at tri that's working

7282
02:06:33,350 --> 02:06:33,360
so there's a team at tri that's working

on
 

7285
02:06:33,679 --> 02:06:37,030
on
soft hands and and you get so much more

manipulation one of the things that
really

7302
02:06:51,589 --> 02:06:51,599
really
 

7303
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:54,069
really
is frustrating is if you work super hard

7304
02:06:54,069 --> 02:06:54,079
is frustrating is if you work super hard
 

7305
02:06:54,079 --> 02:06:54,950
is frustrating is if you work super hard
on your head mounted

7306
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:54,960
on your head mounted
 

7307
02:06:54,960 --> 02:06:56,310
on your head mounted
on your perception system for your head

7308
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
on your perception system for your head
 

7309
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,390
on your perception system for your head
mounted cameras and then you've

7310
02:06:58,390 --> 02:06:58,400
mounted cameras and then you've
 

7311
02:06:58,400 --> 02:06:59,910
mounted cameras and then you've
identified an object you reach down to

7312
02:06:59,910 --> 02:06:59,920
identified an object you reach down to
 

7313
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,350
identified an object you reach down to
touch it and the first the last thing

7314
02:07:01,350 --> 02:07:01,360
touch it and the first the last thing
 

7315
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:02,390
touch it and the first the last thing
that happens right before

7316
02:07:02,390 --> 02:07:02,400
that happens right before
 

7317
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,310
that happens right before
the most important time you stick your

7318
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
the most important time you stick your
 

7319
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,589
the most important time you stick your
hand and you're occluding

7320
02:07:05,589 --> 02:07:05,599
hand and you're occluding
 

7321
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:08,069
hand and you're occluding
your head mounted sensors right so in

7322
02:07:08,069 --> 02:07:08,079
your head mounted sensors right so in
 

7323
02:07:08,079 --> 02:07:10,149
your head mounted sensors right so in
all the part that really matters

7324
02:07:10,149 --> 02:07:10,159
all the part that really matters
 

7325
02:07:10,159 --> 02:07:12,069
all the part that really matters
all of your off board sensors are you

7326
02:07:12,069 --> 02:07:12,079
all of your off board sensors are you
 

7327
02:07:12,079 --> 02:07:13,510
all of your off board sensors are you
know are occluded

7328
02:07:13,510 --> 02:07:13,520
know are occluded
 

7329
02:07:13,520 --> 02:07:15,270
know are occluded
and really if you don't have tactile

7330
02:07:15,270 --> 02:07:15,280
and really if you don't have tactile
 

7331
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:16,870
and really if you don't have tactile
information then you're

7332
02:07:16,870 --> 02:07:16,880
information then you're
 

7333
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:19,990
information then you're
you're blind in an important way so

7334
02:07:19,990 --> 02:07:20,000
you're blind in an important way so
 

7335
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,669
you're blind in an important way so
it happens that soft robotics and

7336
02:07:21,669 --> 02:07:21,679
it happens that soft robotics and
 

7337
02:07:21,679 --> 02:07:23,030
it happens that soft robotics and
tactile sensing

7338
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
tactile sensing
 

7339
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,669
tactile sensing
tend to go hand in hand i think we've

7340
02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:25,679
tend to go hand in hand i think we've
 

7341
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:27,109
tend to go hand in hand i think we've
kind of talked about it but

7342
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:27,119
kind of talked about it but
 

7343
02:07:27,119 --> 02:07:29,990
kind of talked about it but
uh you taught a course on under actuator

7344
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
uh you taught a course on under actuator
 

7345
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:30,790
uh you taught a course on under actuator
robotics

7346
02:07:30,790 --> 02:07:30,800
robotics
 

7347
02:07:30,800 --> 02:07:32,310
robotics
i believe that was the name of it

7348
02:07:32,310 --> 02:07:32,320
i believe that was the name of it
 

7349
02:07:32,320 --> 02:07:34,870
i believe that was the name of it
actually that's right

7350
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:34,880
actually that's right
 

7351
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,270
actually that's right
can you talk about it in that context

7352
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:37,280
can you talk about it in that context
 

7353
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:38,069
can you talk about it in that context
what is

7354
02:07:38,069 --> 02:07:38,079
what is
 

7355
02:07:38,079 --> 02:07:41,270
what is
under actuated robotics right so

7356
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:41,280
under actuated robotics right so
 

7357
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,270
under actuated robotics right so
under-actuated robotics is my graduate

7358
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,280
under-actuated robotics is my graduate
 

7359
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:45,030
under-actuated robotics is my graduate
course it's it's online

7360
02:07:45,030 --> 02:07:45,040
course it's it's online
 

7361
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:47,030
course it's it's online
mostly now so i mean in the sense that

7362
02:07:47,030 --> 02:07:47,040
mostly now so i mean in the sense that
 

7363
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:48,950
mostly now so i mean in the sense that
the lecturer's versions of it i think

7364
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:48,960
the lecturer's versions of it i think
 

7365
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:50,149
the lecturer's versions of it i think
right the youtube really great i

7366
02:07:50,149 --> 02:07:50,159
right the youtube really great i
 

7367
02:07:50,159 --> 02:07:52,870
right the youtube really great i
recommend it highly look on youtube for

7368
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:52,880
recommend it highly look on youtube for
 

7369
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:53,430
recommend it highly look on youtube for
the

7370
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:53,440
the
 

7371
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:56,390
the
2020 versions until march and then you

7372
02:07:56,390 --> 02:07:56,400
2020 versions until march and then you
 

7373
02:07:56,400 --> 02:07:58,550
2020 versions until march and then you
have to go back to 2019 thanks to

7374
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
have to go back to 2019 thanks to
 

7375
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:02,550
have to go back to 2019 thanks to
covet um no i've poured my heart into

7376
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:02,560
covet um no i've poured my heart into
 

7377
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,030
covet um no i've poured my heart into
that

7378
02:08:03,030 --> 02:08:03,040
that
 

7379
02:08:03,040 --> 02:08:06,310
that
class and lecture one is basically

7380
02:08:06,310 --> 02:08:06,320
class and lecture one is basically
 

7381
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:07,830
class and lecture one is basically
explaining what the word underactuated

7382
02:08:07,830 --> 02:08:07,840
explaining what the word underactuated
 

7383
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,069
explaining what the word underactuated
means so people are very kind to show up

7384
02:08:10,069 --> 02:08:10,079
means so people are very kind to show up
 

7385
02:08:10,079 --> 02:08:11,189
means so people are very kind to show up
and then

7386
02:08:11,189 --> 02:08:11,199
and then
 

7387
02:08:11,199 --> 02:08:12,950
and then
maybe have to learn what the title of

7388
02:08:12,950 --> 02:08:12,960
maybe have to learn what the title of
 

7389
02:08:12,960 --> 02:08:14,310
maybe have to learn what the title of
the course means over the course of the

7390
02:08:14,310 --> 02:08:14,320
the course means over the course of the
 

7391
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:15,589
the course means over the course of the
first lecture

7392
02:08:15,589 --> 02:08:15,599
first lecture
 

7393
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:17,589
first lecture
that that first lecture is really good

7394
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
that that first lecture is really good
 

7395
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:19,990
that that first lecture is really good
you should watch it

7396
02:08:19,990 --> 02:08:20,000
you should watch it
 

7397
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:23,430
you should watch it
it's it's a strange name but um

7398
02:08:23,430 --> 02:08:23,440
it's it's a strange name but um
 

7399
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:26,229
it's it's a strange name but um
i thought it captured the essence of

7400
02:08:26,229 --> 02:08:26,239
i thought it captured the essence of
 

7401
02:08:26,239 --> 02:08:26,790
i thought it captured the essence of
what

7402
02:08:26,790 --> 02:08:26,800
what
 

7403
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:28,390
what
control was good at doing and what

7404
02:08:28,390 --> 02:08:28,400
control was good at doing and what
 

7405
02:08:28,400 --> 02:08:30,149
control was good at doing and what
control was bad at doing

7406
02:08:30,149 --> 02:08:30,159
control was bad at doing
 

7407
02:08:30,159 --> 02:08:33,589
control was bad at doing
so what do i mean by under actuated so

7408
02:08:33,589 --> 02:08:33,599
so what do i mean by under actuated so
 

7409
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,629
so what do i mean by under actuated so
a mechanical system

7410
02:08:36,629 --> 02:08:36,639
a mechanical system
 

7411
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:39,589
a mechanical system
has many degrees of freedom for instance

7412
02:08:39,589 --> 02:08:39,599
has many degrees of freedom for instance
 

7413
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:41,109
has many degrees of freedom for instance
i think of a joint as a degree of

7414
02:08:41,109 --> 02:08:41,119
i think of a joint as a degree of
 

7415
02:08:41,119 --> 02:08:42,069
i think of a joint as a degree of
freedom

7416
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079
freedom
 

7417
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:45,030
freedom
and it has some number of actuators

7418
02:08:45,030 --> 02:08:45,040
and it has some number of actuators
 

7419
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:46,390
and it has some number of actuators
motors

7420
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,400
motors
 

7421
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,229
motors
so if you have a robot that's bolted to

7422
02:08:48,229 --> 02:08:48,239
so if you have a robot that's bolted to
 

7423
02:08:48,239 --> 02:08:49,430
so if you have a robot that's bolted to
the table

7424
02:08:49,430 --> 02:08:49,440
the table
 

7425
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,709
the table
that has five degrees of freedom

7426
02:08:52,709 --> 02:08:52,719
that has five degrees of freedom
 

7427
02:08:52,719 --> 02:08:55,109
that has five degrees of freedom
and five motors then you have a fully

7428
02:08:55,109 --> 02:08:55,119
and five motors then you have a fully
 

7429
02:08:55,119 --> 02:08:57,350
and five motors then you have a fully
actuated robot

7430
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,360
actuated robot
 

7431
02:08:57,360 --> 02:08:59,510
actuated robot
if you have if you take away one of

7432
02:08:59,510 --> 02:08:59,520
if you have if you take away one of
 

7433
02:08:59,520 --> 02:09:00,709
if you have if you take away one of
those motors

7434
02:09:00,709 --> 02:09:00,719
those motors
 

7435
02:09:00,719 --> 02:09:03,350
those motors
then you have an under actuated robot

7436
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:03,360
then you have an under actuated robot
 

7437
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:04,390
then you have an under actuated robot
now why

7438
02:09:04,390 --> 02:09:04,400
now why
 

7439
02:09:04,400 --> 02:09:07,030
now why
on earth i i have a good friend who who

7440
02:09:07,030 --> 02:09:07,040
on earth i i have a good friend who who
 

7441
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,470
on earth i i have a good friend who who
likes to tease me he said russ if you

7442
02:09:08,470 --> 02:09:08,480
likes to tease me he said russ if you
 

7443
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,149
likes to tease me he said russ if you
had more research funding would you work

7444
02:09:10,149 --> 02:09:10,159
had more research funding would you work
 

7445
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:11,990
had more research funding would you work
on fully actuated robots

7446
02:09:11,990 --> 02:09:12,000
on fully actuated robots
 

7447
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,350
on fully actuated robots
yeah and uh the answer is no

7448
02:09:15,350 --> 02:09:15,360
yeah and uh the answer is no
 

7449
02:09:15,360 --> 02:09:17,589
yeah and uh the answer is no
the world gives us under-actuated robots

7450
02:09:17,589 --> 02:09:17,599
the world gives us under-actuated robots
 

7451
02:09:17,599 --> 02:09:19,990
the world gives us under-actuated robots
whether we like it or not i'm a human

7452
02:09:19,990 --> 02:09:20,000
whether we like it or not i'm a human
 

7453
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:22,069
whether we like it or not i'm a human
i'm an under actuated robot even though

7454
02:09:22,069 --> 02:09:22,079
i'm an under actuated robot even though
 

7455
02:09:22,079 --> 02:09:23,669
i'm an under actuated robot even though
i have more muscles

7456
02:09:23,669 --> 02:09:23,679
i have more muscles
 

7457
02:09:23,679 --> 02:09:25,750
i have more muscles
than my big degrees of freedom because i

7458
02:09:25,750 --> 02:09:25,760
than my big degrees of freedom because i
 

7459
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,910
than my big degrees of freedom because i
have in some places

7460
02:09:27,910 --> 02:09:27,920
have in some places
 

7461
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:29,430
have in some places
multiple muscles attached to the same

7462
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:29,440
multiple muscles attached to the same
 

7463
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,030

joint
 

7465
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:33,350
joint
but still there's a really important

7466
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:33,360
but still there's a really important
 

7467
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,950
but still there's a really important
degree of freedom that i have which is

7468
02:09:34,950 --> 02:09:34,960
degree of freedom that i have which is
 

7469
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,229
degree of freedom that i have which is
the location of my

7470
02:09:36,229 --> 02:09:36,239
the location of my
 

7471
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:39,669
the location of my
center of mass in space for instance

7472
02:09:39,669 --> 02:09:39,679
center of mass in space for instance
 

7473
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:42,709
center of mass in space for instance
all right i'm i can jump into the air

7474
02:09:42,709 --> 02:09:42,719
all right i'm i can jump into the air
 

7475
02:09:42,719 --> 02:09:44,629
all right i'm i can jump into the air
and there's no motor that connects my

7476
02:09:44,629 --> 02:09:44,639
and there's no motor that connects my
 

7477
02:09:44,639 --> 02:09:45,990
and there's no motor that connects my
center of mass to the ground

7478
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,000
center of mass to the ground
 

7479
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,310
center of mass to the ground
in that case so i have to think about

7480
02:09:48,310 --> 02:09:48,320
in that case so i have to think about
 

7481
02:09:48,320 --> 02:09:49,669
in that case so i have to think about
these the implications

7482
02:09:49,669 --> 02:09:49,679
these the implications
 

7483
02:09:49,679 --> 02:09:52,870
these the implications
of not having control over everything

7484
02:09:52,870 --> 02:09:52,880
of not having control over everything
 

7485
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:55,669
of not having control over everything
the passive dynamic walkers are the

the passive dynamic walkers are the
 

7487
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:57,189
the passive dynamic walkers are the
extreme view of that where you've taken

02:09:57,189 --> 02:09:57,199
extreme view of that where you've taken
 

7489
02:09:57,199 --> 02:09:58,629
extreme view of that where you've taken
away all the motors and you have to let

7490
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
away all the motors and you have to let
 

7491
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,149
away all the motors and you have to let
physics do the work

7492
02:10:00,149 --> 02:10:00,159
physics do the work
 

7493
02:10:00,159 --> 02:10:01,830
physics do the work
but it shows up in all the walking

7494
02:10:01,830 --> 02:10:01,840
but it shows up in all the walking
 

7495
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:03,589
but it shows up in all the walking
robots where you have to use some of the

robots where you have to use some of the
 

7497
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:04,709

that's referring to walking if you're
 

7507
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,270
that's referring to walking if you're
like falling forward

like falling forward
 

7509
02:10:13,280 --> 02:10:15,189
like falling forward
like is there a way to walk that's fully

02:10:15,189 --> 02:10:15,199
like is there a way to walk that's fully

7564
02:11:08,069 --> 02:11:08,079
actuated my even if my arm
 

7565
02:11:08,079 --> 02:11:10,870
actuated my even if my arm
is fully actuated i have a motor if my

7566
02:11:10,870 --> 02:11:10,880
is fully actuated i have a motor if my
 

7567
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:12,709
is fully actuated i have a motor if my
goal is to control

7568
02:11:12,709 --> 02:11:12,719
goal is to control
 

7569
02:11:12,719 --> 02:11:16,069
goal is to control
the position and orientation of this cup

7570
02:11:16,069 --> 02:11:16,079
the position and orientation of this cup
 

7571
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:18,709
the position and orientation of this cup
then i don't have an actuator for that

7572
02:11:18,709 --> 02:11:18,719
then i don't have an actuator for that
 

7573
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:20,550
then i don't have an actuator for that
directly so i have to use my actuators

7574
02:11:20,550 --> 02:11:20,560
directly so i have to use my actuators
 

7575
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:23,189
directly so i have to use my actuators
over here to control this thing

over here to control this thing
 

7577

over here to control this thing
now it gets even worse like what if i

7578
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:24,880
now it gets even worse like what if i
 

7579
02:11:24,880 --> 02:11:27,109
now it gets even worse like what if i
have to button my shirt

7580

have to button my shirt
 

7581
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:30,390
have to button my shirt
okay what are the degrees of freedom of

7582
02:11:30,390 --> 02:11:30,400
okay what are the degrees of freedom of
 

7583
02:11:30,400 --> 02:11:32,629
okay what are the degrees of freedom of
my shirt right i suddenly

7584
02:11:32,629 --> 02:11:32,639
my shirt right i suddenly
 

7585
02:11:32,639 --> 02:11:34,550
my shirt right i suddenly
that's a hard question to think about it

7586
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:34,560
that's a hard question to think about it
 

7587
02:11:34,560 --> 02:11:36,629
that's a hard question to think about it
kind of makes me queasy as a

kind of makes me queasy as a
 

7589
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:38,229
kind of makes me queasy as a

ideas
 

7593
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,910
ideas
but actually those are the problems that

7594
02:11:41,910 --> 02:11:41,920
but actually those are the problems that
 

7595
02:11:41,920 --> 02:11:44,069
but actually those are the problems that
make me so excited about manipulation

7596
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
make me so excited about manipulation
 

7597
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:45,350
make me so excited about manipulation
right now is that it

7598
02:11:45,350 --> 02:11:45,360
right now is that it
 

7599
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,629
right now is that it
it breaks some of the it breaks a lot of

7600
02:11:48,629 --> 02:11:48,639
it breaks some of the it breaks a lot of
 

7601
02:11:48,639 --> 02:11:50,229
it breaks some of the it breaks a lot of
the foundational control stuff that i've

7602
02:11:50,229 --> 02:11:50,239
the foundational control stuff that i've
 

7603
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,270
the foundational control stuff that i've
been thinking about

7604
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:51,280
been thinking about
 

7605
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:53,910
been thinking about
is there um what are some interesting

7606
02:11:53,910 --> 02:11:53,920
is there um what are some interesting
 

7607
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:54,470
is there um what are some interesting
insights

7608
02:11:54,470 --> 02:11:54,480
insights
 

7609
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,149
insights
you could say about trying to solve an

02:11:56,149 --> 02:11:56,159
you could say about trying to solve an
 

7611
02:11:56,159 --> 02:11:57,830
you could say about trying to solve an

under actuated
 

7613
02:11:57,840 --> 02:12:00,950
under actuated
like control in in an underactuated

7614
02:12:00,950 --> 02:12:00,960
like control in in an underactuated
 

7615
02:12:00,960 --> 02:12:02,229

system
 

7617
02:12:02,239 --> 02:12:05,030

so i think the philosophy there is let

7618
02:12:05,030 --> 02:12:05,040
so i think the philosophy there is let
 

7619
02:12:05,040 --> 02:12:06,069
so i think the philosophy there is let
physics do

7620
02:12:06,069 --> 02:12:06,079
physics do
 

7621
02:12:06,079 --> 02:12:10,149
physics do
more of the work the technical approach

7622
02:12:10,149 --> 02:12:10,159
more of the work the technical approach
 

7623
02:12:10,159 --> 02:12:12,709
more of the work the technical approach
has been optimization so you typically

7624
02:12:12,709 --> 02:12:12,719
has been optimization so you typically
 

7625
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:14,310
has been optimization so you typically

approach that has borne the most fruit
 

7653
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:38,950
approach that has borne the most fruit
in our

7654
02:12:38,950 --> 02:12:38,960
in our
 

7655
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,109
in our
at least in our line of work and there's

7656
02:12:41,109 --> 02:12:41,119
at least in our line of work and there's
 

7657
02:12:41,119 --> 02:12:41,990
at least in our line of work and there's
some

7658
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
some
 

7659
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,149
some
so in under actuator systems when you

7660
02:12:44,149 --> 02:12:44,159
so in under actuator systems when you
 

7661
02:12:44,159 --> 02:12:46,629
so in under actuator systems when you
say let physics do some of the work

7662
02:12:46,629 --> 02:12:46,639
say let physics do some of the work
 

7663
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,430
say let physics do some of the work
so there's a kind of feedback feedback

7664
02:12:49,430 --> 02:12:49,440
so there's a kind of feedback feedback
 

7665
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,149
so there's a kind of feedback feedback
loop

7666
02:12:50,149 --> 02:12:50,159
loop
 

7667
02:12:50,159 --> 02:12:52,870

that observes the state that the physics

7668
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:52,880
that observes the state that the physics
 

7669
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:54,390
that observes the state that the physics
brought you to

7670
02:12:54,390 --> 02:12:54,400
brought you to
 

7671
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,709
brought you to
so like you've there's a there's a

7672
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:56,719
so like you've there's a there's a
 

7673
02:12:56,719 --> 02:12:58,470
so like you've there's a there's a
perception there this is there's a

7674
02:12:58,470 --> 02:12:58,480
perception there this is there's a
 

7675
02:12:58,480 --> 02:12:59,430

7677
02:12:59,440 --> 02:13:02,470

that's not always the right
 

7765
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:36,390
that's not always the right

7791
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:01,750

02:15:01,760 --> 02:15:04,629
to the task there are many that are
unobservable and not not important to

the task
so you really need it begs new questions

7798
02:15:08,470 --> 02:15:08,480
so you really need it begs new questions
 

7799
02:15:08,480 --> 02:15:08,870
so you really need it begs new questions
about

02:15:08,870 --> 02:15:08,880
about

02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:11,669
about
state representation another example

state representation another example
 

7803
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:13,189
state representation another example
that we've been playing with in lab has

7804
02:15:13,189 --> 02:15:13,199
that we've been playing with in lab has
 

7805
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:14,149
that we've been playing with in lab has
been

7806
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
been
 

7807
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:17,510
been
just the idea of chopping onions okay

7808
02:15:17,510 --> 02:15:17,520
just the idea of chopping onions okay
 

7809
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:20,950
just the idea of chopping onions okay
or carrots turns out to be better so

7810
02:15:20,950 --> 02:15:20,960
or carrots turns out to be better so
 

7811
02:15:20,960 --> 02:15:23,750
or carrots turns out to be better so
the onions stink up the lab uh and

7812
02:15:23,750 --> 02:15:23,760
the onions stink up the lab uh and
 

7813
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:24,069
the onions stink up the lab uh and
they're

7814
02:15:24,069 --> 02:15:24,079
they're
 

7815
02:15:24,079 --> 02:15:27,510
they're
hard to see in a camera but uh

7816
02:15:27,510 --> 02:15:27,520
hard to see in a camera but uh
 

7817
02:15:27,520 --> 02:15:29,270
hard to see in a camera but uh
so details matter yeah details matter

7818
02:15:29,270 --> 02:15:29,280
so details matter yeah details matter
 

7819
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:32,950
so details matter yeah details matter
you know so um

7820
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:32,960

 

7821
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:35,030

moving around a particular object right

7822
02:15:35,030 --> 02:15:35,040
moving around a particular object right
 

7823
02:15:35,040 --> 02:15:36,310
moving around a particular object right
then i think about oh it's got a

7824
02:15:36,310 --> 02:15:36,320
then i think about oh it's got a
 

7825
02:15:36,320 --> 02:15:37,830
then i think about oh it's got a
position or an orientation in space

7826
02:15:37,830 --> 02:15:37,840
position or an orientation in space
 

7827
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:39,669
position or an orientation in space
that's the description i want

7828
02:15:39,669 --> 02:15:39,679
that's the description i want
 

7829
02:15:39,679 --> 02:15:42,790
that's the description i want
now when i'm chopping an onion okay the

7830
02:15:42,790 --> 02:15:42,800
now when i'm chopping an onion okay the
 

7831
02:15:42,800 --> 02:15:44,149
now when i'm chopping an onion okay the
first chop comes down

7832
02:15:44,149 --> 02:15:44,159
first chop comes down
 

7833
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:48,229
first chop comes down
i have now a hundred pieces of onion

7834
02:15:48,229 --> 02:15:48,239
i have now a hundred pieces of onion
 

7835
02:15:48,239 --> 02:15:49,750
i have now a hundred pieces of onion
does my control system really need to

7836
02:15:49,750 --> 02:15:49,760
does my control system really need to
 

7837
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:51,669
does my control system really need to
understand the position and orientation

7838
02:15:51,669 --> 02:15:51,679
understand the position and orientation
 

7839
02:15:51,679 --> 02:15:53,430
understand the position and orientation
and even the shape of the hundred pieces

7840
02:15:53,430 --> 02:15:53,440
and even the shape of the hundred pieces
 

7841
02:15:53,440 --> 02:15:55,990
and even the shape of the hundred pieces
of onion in order to make a decision

7842
02:15:55,990 --> 02:15:56,000
of onion in order to make a decision
 

7843
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:57,750

probably not you know and like if i keep

7844
02:15:57,750 --> 02:15:57,760
probably not you know and like if i keep
 

7845
02:15:57,760 --> 02:15:59,510

02:15:59,510 --> 02:15:59,520
going i'm just getting more and more is
 

7847
02:15:59,520 --> 02:16:02,310
going i'm just getting more and more is
my state space getting bigger as i cut

7848
02:16:02,310 --> 02:16:02,320
my state space getting bigger as i cut
 

7849
02:16:02,320 --> 02:16:05,430
my state space getting bigger as i cut
it's it um it it's not right

7850
02:16:05,430 --> 02:16:05,440
it's it um it it's not right
 

7851
02:16:05,440 --> 02:16:09,350
it's it um it it's not right
yes so there's a i think there's

7852
02:16:09,350 --> 02:16:09,360
yes so there's a i think there's
 

7853
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,950
yes so there's a i think there's
a richer uh idea of state

7854
02:16:12,950 --> 02:16:12,960
a richer uh idea of state
 

7855
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:15,510
a richer uh idea of state
it's not the state that is given to us

7856
02:16:15,510 --> 02:16:15,520
it's not the state that is given to us
 

7857
02:16:15,520 --> 02:16:17,030
it's not the state that is given to us

so um since you taught the course

7920
02:17:19,669 --> 02:17:19,679
so um since you taught the course
 

7921
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:22,870
so um since you taught the course
i've it kind of entered my mind um the

7922
02:17:22,870 --> 02:17:22,880
i've it kind of entered my mind um the
 

7923
02:17:22,880 --> 02:17:24,549
i've it kind of entered my mind um the
idea of under actuated as

7924
02:17:24,549 --> 02:17:24,559
idea of under actuated as
 

7925
02:17:24,559 --> 02:17:27,270
idea of under actuated as
really compelling to see the to see the

02:17:27,270 --> 02:17:27,280
really compelling to see the to see the
 

7927
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,030
really compelling to see the to see the

world in this kind of way
 

7929
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,830
world in this kind of way
um do you ever you know if we talk about

7930
02:17:31,830 --> 02:17:31,840
um do you ever you know if we talk about
 

7931
02:17:31,840 --> 02:17:33,190
um do you ever you know if we talk about
onions or you talk about

7932
02:17:33,190 --> 02:17:33,200
onions or you talk about
 

7933
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,349
onions or you talk about
the world with people in it in general

7934
02:17:35,349 --> 02:17:35,359
the world with people in it in general
 

7935
02:17:35,359 --> 02:17:37,030
the world with people in it in general
do you see the world

7936
02:17:37,030 --> 02:17:37,040
do you see the world
 

7937
02:17:37,040 --> 02:17:39,830
do you see the world
as a basically an underactuated system

7938
02:17:39,830 --> 02:17:39,840
as a basically an underactuated system
 

7939
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:40,790
as a basically an underactuated system
do you like often

7940
02:17:40,790 --> 02:17:40,800
do you like often
 

7941
02:17:40,800 --> 02:17:43,589
do you like often
look at the world in this way or is this

7942
02:17:43,589 --> 02:17:43,599
look at the world in this way or is this
 

7943
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:45,190
look at the world in this way or is this
uh overreach

7944
02:17:45,190 --> 02:17:45,200
uh overreach
 

7945
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:49,110
uh overreach
um under actuated as a way of life man

7946
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:49,120
um under actuated as a way of life man
 

7947
02:17:49,120 --> 02:17:50,790
um under actuated as a way of life man
exactly um i guess that's what i'm

7948
02:17:50,790 --> 02:17:50,800
exactly um i guess that's what i'm
 

7949
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:53,429
exactly um i guess that's what i'm
asking

7950
02:17:53,429 --> 02:17:53,439

 

7951
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:56,150

i do think it's everywhere i think some

7952
02:17:56,150 --> 02:17:56,160
i do think it's everywhere i think some
 

7953
02:17:56,160 --> 02:17:57,110
i do think it's everywhere i think some
in some places

7954
02:17:57,110 --> 02:17:57,120
in some places
 

7955
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:00,469
in some places
um we already have natural tools to deal

7956
02:18:00,469 --> 02:18:00,479
um we already have natural tools to deal
 

7957
02:18:00,479 --> 02:18:01,190
um we already have natural tools to deal
with it

7958
02:18:01,190 --> 02:18:01,200
with it
 

7959
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:02,549
with it
you know it rears its head i mean in

7960
02:18:02,549 --> 02:18:02,559
you know it rears its head i mean in
 

7961
02:18:02,559 --> 02:18:04,230
you know it rears its head i mean in
linear systems it's not a problem we

7962
02:18:04,230 --> 02:18:04,240
linear systems it's not a problem we
 

7963
02:18:04,240 --> 02:18:05,589
linear systems it's not a problem we
just we just

02:18:05,589 --> 02:18:05,599
just we just

02:18:05,599 --> 02:18:07,349
just we just
like an under actuated linear system is

7966
02:18:07,349 --> 02:18:07,359
like an under actuated linear system is
 

7967
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:09,270
like an under actuated linear system is
really not sufficiently distinct from a

02:18:12,639 --> 02:18:14,790
linear system it's it's a it's a subtle
point about when that becomes

7974
02:18:14,790 --> 02:18:14,800
point about when that becomes
 

7975
02:18:14,800 --> 02:18:16,230
point about when that becomes
a bottleneck and what we know how to do

7976
02:18:16,230 --> 02:18:16,240
a bottleneck and what we know how to do
 

7977
02:18:16,240 --> 02:18:17,910
a bottleneck and what we know how to do
with control it happens to be a

felt that that was the key bottleneck

everything i can
about how to make atlas do a backflip

7996
02:18:36,830 --> 02:18:36,840
about how to make atlas do a backflip
 

7997
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,309
about how to make atlas do a backflip
right

7998
02:18:38,309 --> 02:18:38,319
right
 

7999
02:18:38,319 --> 02:18:39,990
right
i have a second course now in that i

8000
02:18:39,990 --> 02:18:40,000
i have a second course now in that i
 

8001
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,669
i have a second course now in that i
teach in the other semesters which is

02:18:41,669 --> 02:18:41,679
teach in the other semesters which is
 

8003
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:44,230
teach in the other semesters which is
on on manipulation and that's where we

8004
02:18:44,230 --> 02:18:44,240
on on manipulation and that's where we
 

8005
02:18:44,240 --> 02:18:46,309
on on manipulation and that's where we
get into now more of the that's a newer

02:18:46,309 --> 02:18:46,319
get into now more of the that's a newer

i'm hoping to put it online this fall

8010
02:18:50,309 --> 02:18:50,319
i'm hoping to put it online this fall
 

8011
02:18:50,319 --> 02:18:52,790
i'm hoping to put it online this fall
completely and uh that's going to have

8012
02:18:52,790 --> 02:18:52,800
completely and uh that's going to have
 

8013
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,790
completely and uh that's going to have
much more aspects about these perception

8014
02:18:54,790 --> 02:18:54,800
much more aspects about these perception
 

8015
02:18:54,800 --> 02:18:56,549
much more aspects about these perception
problems and the state representation

8016
02:18:56,549 --> 02:18:56,559
problems and the state representation
 

8017
02:18:56,559 --> 02:18:59,110
problems and the state representation
questions and then how do you do control

8018
02:18:59,110 --> 02:18:59,120
questions and then how do you do control
 

8019
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,830
questions and then how do you do control
and the the thing that's a little bit

8020
02:19:01,830 --> 02:19:01,840
and the the thing that's a little bit
 

8021
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:02,549
and the the thing that's a little bit
sad

8022
02:19:02,549 --> 02:19:02,559
sad
 

8023
02:19:02,559 --> 02:19:05,990
sad
is that uh for me at least is there's a

8024
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,000
is that uh for me at least is there's a
 

8025
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,830
is that uh for me at least is there's a
lot of manipulation tasks that people

8026
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:07,840
lot of manipulation tasks that people
 

8027
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,270
lot of manipulation tasks that people
want to do and should want to do they

want to do and should want to do they

could

8030
02:19:09,990 --> 02:19:10,000
could
 

8031
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,429
could
start a company with it and make very

02:19:11,429 --> 02:19:11,439
start a company with it and make very
 

8033

02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:15,669
successful that don't actually
require you to think that much about

8036
02:19:15,669 --> 02:19:15,679
require you to think that much about
 

8037
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:17,910
require you to think that much about
under or dynamics at all even

8038
02:19:17,910 --> 02:19:17,920
under or dynamics at all even
 

8039
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:19,910
under or dynamics at all even
but certainly under actuated dynamics

8040
02:19:19,910 --> 02:19:19,920
but certainly under actuated dynamics

attached to my hand then i can do a lot

8048
02:19:26,309 --> 02:19:26,319
attached to my hand then i can do a lot
 

8049
02:19:26,319 --> 02:19:28,629
attached to my hand then i can do a lot
of interesting meaningful things with it

02:19:28,629 --> 02:19:28,639
of interesting meaningful things with it
 

8051
02:19:28,639 --> 02:19:30,150
of interesting meaningful things with it
without really ever thinking about the

so they built we've built systems that

02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:34,399
so they built we've built systems that

so they built we've built systems that
kind of

kind of
 

8059
02:19:36,639 --> 02:19:39,669
kind of
reduced the need for that enveloping

8060
02:19:39,669 --> 02:19:39,679
reduced the need for that enveloping

grasps and the like

8062
02:19:41,270 --> 02:19:41,280
grasps and the like
 

8063
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,509
grasps and the like
um but i think the really good problems

8064
02:19:43,509 --> 02:19:43,519
um but i think the really good problems
 

8065
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:45,509
um but i think the really good problems
in manipulation so

8066
02:19:45,509 --> 02:19:45,519
in manipulation so
 

8067
02:19:45,519 --> 02:19:47,270
in manipulation so
manipulation by the way is more than

02:19:47,270 --> 02:19:47,280
manipulation by the way is more than
 

8069
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:48,630
manipulation by the way is more than
just pick and

02:19:48,630 --> 02:19:48,640
just pick and
 

8071
02:19:48,640 --> 02:19:50,950
just pick and
place that's like a lot of people think

8072
02:19:50,950 --> 02:19:50,960
place that's like a lot of people think
 

8073
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,950
place that's like a lot of people think
of that just grasping

8074
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:52,960
of that just grasping
 

8075
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:55,110
of that just grasping
i don't mean that i mean buttoning my

how do you program a robot to tie

8080
02:19:59,670 --> 02:19:59,680
how do you program a robot to tie

02:19:59,680 --> 02:20:01,670
how do you program a robot to tie
shoelaces and not just one shoe but

02:20:08,389 --> 02:20:08,399
problem it's tempting to write down like
 

8087
02:20:08,399 --> 02:20:10,870
problem it's tempting to write down like
the infinite dimensional state of the

the infinite dimensional state of the

to write a good controller

8092
02:20:16,070 --> 02:20:16,080
to write a good controller
 

8093
02:20:16,080 --> 02:20:18,150
to write a good controller
i know we could hand design a controller

8094
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
i know we could hand design a controller
 

8095
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,349
i know we could hand design a controller
that would do it

8096
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,359
that would do it
 

8097
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:20,550
that would do it
but i don't want that i want to

8098
02:20:20,550 --> 02:20:20,560
but i don't want that i want to
 

8099
02:20:20,560 --> 02:20:22,710
but i don't want that i want to
understand the principles

8100
02:20:22,710 --> 02:20:22,720
understand the principles
 

8101
02:20:22,720 --> 02:20:24,150
understand the principles
that would allow me to solve another

that would allow me to solve another
 

8103
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:26,389
that would allow me to solve another

problem that's kind of like that
 

8105
02:20:26,399 --> 02:20:29,590
problem that's kind of like that
but i think if we can stay pure in our

02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:33,830
approach
then the challenge of tying anybody's

8110
02:20:33,830 --> 02:20:33,840
then the challenge of tying anybody's
 

8111
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:34,870
then the challenge of tying anybody's
shoes

8112
02:20:34,870 --> 02:20:34,880
shoes
 

8113
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:36,790
shoes
is a great challenge that's a great

8114
02:20:36,790 --> 02:20:36,800
is a great challenge that's a great
 

8115
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,110
is a great challenge that's a great
challenge i mean and the soft

8116
02:20:39,110 --> 02:20:39,120
challenge i mean and the soft
 

8117
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:40,950
challenge i mean and the soft
touch comes into play there that's

8118
02:20:40,950 --> 02:20:40,960
touch comes into play there that's
 

8119
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:43,030
touch comes into play there that's
really interesting

8120
02:20:43,030 --> 02:20:43,040
really interesting
 

8121
02:20:43,040 --> 02:20:45,030
really interesting
let me ask another ridiculous question

8122
02:20:45,030 --> 02:20:45,040
let me ask another ridiculous question
 

8123
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:47,429
let me ask another ridiculous question
on this topic um

8124
02:20:47,429 --> 02:20:47,439
on this topic um
 

8125
02:20:47,439 --> 02:20:50,230
on this topic um
how important is touch we haven't talked

8126
02:20:50,230 --> 02:20:50,240
how important is touch we haven't talked
 

8127
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:52,230
how important is touch we haven't talked
much about humans

8128
02:20:52,230 --> 02:20:52,240
much about humans
 

8129
02:20:52,240 --> 02:20:56,309
much about humans
but i have this argument with my dad

8130
02:20:56,309 --> 02:20:56,319
but i have this argument with my dad
 

8131
02:20:56,319 --> 02:20:58,550
but i have this argument with my dad
where like i think you can fall in love

8132
02:20:58,550 --> 02:20:58,560
where like i think you can fall in love
 

8133
02:20:58,560 --> 02:20:59,590
where like i think you can fall in love
with the robot

8134
02:20:59,590 --> 02:20:59,600
with the robot
 

8135
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:03,030
with the robot
based on uh language alone and he

8136
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:03,040
based on uh language alone and he
 

8137
02:21:03,040 --> 02:21:03,990
based on uh language alone and he
believes that

8138
02:21:03,990 --> 02:21:04,000
believes that
 

8139
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,270
believes that
touch is essential i touch and smell he

8140
02:21:07,270 --> 02:21:07,280
touch is essential i touch and smell he
 

8141
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:08,469
touch is essential i touch and smell he
says but

8142
02:21:08,469 --> 02:21:08,479
says but
 

8143
02:21:08,479 --> 02:21:11,590
says but
um so

8144
02:21:11,590 --> 02:21:11,600
um so
 

8145
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:14,230
um so
in terms of robots you know connecting

8146
02:21:14,230 --> 02:21:14,240
in terms of robots you know connecting
 

8147
02:21:14,240 --> 02:21:16,469
in terms of robots you know connecting
with humans

8148
02:21:16,469 --> 02:21:16,479
with humans
 

8149
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:18,950
with humans
and uh we can go philosophical in terms

8150
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:18,960
and uh we can go philosophical in terms
 

8151
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,550
and uh we can go philosophical in terms
of like a deep meaningful connection

8152
02:21:20,550 --> 02:21:20,560
of like a deep meaningful connection
 

8153
02:21:20,560 --> 02:21:20,950
of like a deep meaningful connection
like

8154
02:21:20,950 --> 02:21:20,960
like
 

8155
02:21:20,960 --> 02:21:23,990
like
love but even just like collaborating in

8156
02:21:23,990 --> 02:21:24,000
love but even just like collaborating in
 

8157
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,429
love but even just like collaborating in
an interesting way

8158
02:21:25,429 --> 02:21:25,439
an interesting way
 

8159
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:28,469
an interesting way
how important is touch like

8160
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479
how important is touch like
 

8161
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,710
how important is touch like
uh from the engineering perspective and

8162
02:21:30,710 --> 02:21:30,720
uh from the engineering perspective and
 

8163
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:32,710
uh from the engineering perspective and
the philosophical one

8164
02:21:32,710 --> 02:21:32,720
the philosophical one
 

8165
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:35,910
the philosophical one
i think it's super important let's even

8166
02:21:35,910 --> 02:21:35,920
i think it's super important let's even
 

8167
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:37,510
i think it's super important let's even
just in a practical sense if we forget

8168
02:21:37,510 --> 02:21:37,520
just in a practical sense if we forget
 

8169
02:21:37,520 --> 02:21:38,550
just in a practical sense if we forget
about the emotional

8170
02:21:38,550 --> 02:21:38,560
about the emotional
 

8171
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:42,630
about the emotional
part of it but for robots to interact

8172
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:42,640
part of it but for robots to interact
 

8173
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,710
part of it but for robots to interact
safely while they're doing

8174
02:21:44,710 --> 02:21:44,720
safely while they're doing
 

8175
02:21:44,720 --> 02:21:47,830
safely while they're doing
meaningful mechanical work in the pro

8176
02:21:47,830 --> 02:21:47,840
meaningful mechanical work in the pro
 

8177
02:21:47,840 --> 02:21:50,790
meaningful mechanical work in the pro
in the you know close contact with or

8178
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:50,800
in the you know close contact with or
 

8179
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:51,590
in the you know close contact with or
vicinity

8180
02:21:51,590 --> 02:21:51,600
vicinity
 

8181
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:54,070
vicinity
of people that need help i think we have

8182
02:21:54,070 --> 02:21:54,080
of people that need help i think we have
 

8183
02:21:54,080 --> 02:21:54,790
of people that need help i think we have
to have them

8184
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:54,800
to have them
 

8185
02:21:54,800 --> 02:21:55,750
to have them
they have we have to build them

8186
02:21:55,750 --> 02:21:55,760
they have we have to build them
 

8187
02:21:55,760 --> 02:21:58,389
they have we have to build them
differently um they have to be afraid

8188
02:21:58,389 --> 02:21:58,399
differently um they have to be afraid
 

8189
02:21:58,399 --> 02:21:59,910
differently um they have to be afraid
not afraid of touching the world

8190
02:21:59,910 --> 02:21:59,920
not afraid of touching the world
 

8191
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:02,710
not afraid of touching the world
so uh i think baymax is just awesome

8192
02:22:02,710 --> 02:22:02,720
so uh i think baymax is just awesome
 

8193
02:22:02,720 --> 02:22:03,270
so uh i think baymax is just awesome
that's just

8194
02:22:03,270 --> 02:22:03,280
that's just
 

8195
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,309
that's just
like the the the movie of big hero 6 and

8196
02:22:06,309 --> 02:22:06,319
like the the the movie of big hero 6 and
 

8197
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:06,710
like the the the movie of big hero 6 and
the

8198
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:06,720
the
 

8199
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:08,309
the
the concept of baymax that's just

8200
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:08,319
the concept of baymax that's just
 

8201
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:10,950
the concept of baymax that's just
awesome i think we should

8202
02:22:10,950 --> 02:22:10,960
awesome i think we should
 

8203
02:22:10,960 --> 02:22:13,110
awesome i think we should
and we have some folks at toyota that

8204
02:22:13,110 --> 02:22:13,120
and we have some folks at toyota that
 

8205
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:14,630
and we have some folks at toyota that
are trying to toyota research that are

8206
02:22:14,630 --> 02:22:14,640
are trying to toyota research that are
 

8207
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:16,870
are trying to toyota research that are
trying to build baymax roughly

8208
02:22:16,870 --> 02:22:16,880
trying to build baymax roughly
 

8209
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:20,230
trying to build baymax roughly
and i think it's just a fantastically

8210
02:22:20,230 --> 02:22:20,240
and i think it's just a fantastically
 

8211
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:21,750
and i think it's just a fantastically
good project

8212
02:22:21,750 --> 02:22:21,760
good project
 

8213
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:23,750
good project
i think it will change the way people

8214
02:22:23,750 --> 02:22:23,760
i think it will change the way people
 

8215
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:25,510
i think it will change the way people
physically interact

8216
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:25,520
physically interact
 

8217
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,190
physically interact
the same way i mean you gave a couple

8218
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:27,200
the same way i mean you gave a couple
 

8219
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:29,910
the same way i mean you gave a couple
examples earlier but but if i um

8220
02:22:29,910 --> 02:22:29,920
examples earlier but but if i um
 

8221
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:31,349
examples earlier but but if i um
if the robot that was walking around my

8222
02:22:31,349 --> 02:22:31,359
if the robot that was walking around my
 

8223
02:22:31,359 --> 02:22:33,830
if the robot that was walking around my
home looks more like a teddy bear

8224
02:22:33,830 --> 02:22:33,840
home looks more like a teddy bear
 

8225
02:22:33,840 --> 02:22:35,910
home looks more like a teddy bear
and a little less like the terminator

8226
02:22:35,910 --> 02:22:35,920
and a little less like the terminator
 

8227
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:37,910
and a little less like the terminator
that could change completely the way

8228
02:22:37,910 --> 02:22:37,920
that could change completely the way
 

8229
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:38,870
that could change completely the way
people perceive it

8230
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:38,880
people perceive it
 

8231
02:22:38,880 --> 02:22:41,670
people perceive it
and interact with it and maybe they'll

8232
02:22:41,670 --> 02:22:41,680
and interact with it and maybe they'll
 

8233
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:43,830
and interact with it and maybe they'll
even want to teach it like you said

8234
02:22:43,830 --> 02:22:43,840
even want to teach it like you said
 

8235
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:47,590
even want to teach it like you said
right you could um not quite gamify it

8236
02:22:47,590 --> 02:22:47,600
right you could um not quite gamify it
 

8237
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:48,710
right you could um not quite gamify it
but somehow

8238
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720
but somehow
 

8239
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:50,550
but somehow
instead of people judging it and looking

8240
02:22:50,550 --> 02:22:50,560
instead of people judging it and looking
 

8241
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:52,070
instead of people judging it and looking
at it as if uh

8242
02:22:52,070 --> 02:22:52,080
at it as if uh
 

8243
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:54,230
at it as if uh
it's not doing as well as a human

8244
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:54,240
it's not doing as well as a human
 

8245
02:22:54,240 --> 02:22:55,349
it's not doing as well as a human
they're going to try to help out the

8246
02:22:55,349 --> 02:22:55,359
they're going to try to help out the
 

8247
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:56,150
they're going to try to help out the
cute teddy bear

8248
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
cute teddy bear
 

8249
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:59,429
cute teddy bear
right who knows but i i think we're

8250
02:22:59,429 --> 02:22:59,439
right who knows but i i think we're
 

8251
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:01,270
right who knows but i i think we're
building robots wrong

8252
02:23:01,270 --> 02:23:01,280
building robots wrong
 

8253
02:23:01,280 --> 02:23:05,510
building robots wrong
and being more soft and more contact

8254
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
and being more soft and more contact
 

8255
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:08,630
and being more soft and more contact
is important right yeah and

8256
02:23:08,630 --> 02:23:08,640
is important right yeah and
 

8257
02:23:08,640 --> 02:23:10,070
is important right yeah and
like all the magical moments i can

8258
02:23:10,070 --> 02:23:10,080
like all the magical moments i can
 

8259
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:12,230
like all the magical moments i can
remember with robots

8260
02:23:12,230 --> 02:23:12,240
remember with robots
 

8261
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:14,950
remember with robots
well first of all just visiting your lab

8262
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:14,960
well first of all just visiting your lab
 

8263
02:23:14,960 --> 02:23:16,790
well first of all just visiting your lab
seeing atlas

8264
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:16,800
seeing atlas
 

8265
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:19,910
seeing atlas
but also spot menu when i first spot saw

8266
02:23:19,910 --> 02:23:19,920
but also spot menu when i first spot saw
 

8267
02:23:19,920 --> 02:23:22,710
but also spot menu when i first spot saw
spot many in person and hung out with

8268
02:23:22,710 --> 02:23:22,720
spot many in person and hung out with
 

8269
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:23,429
spot many in person and hung out with
him

8270
02:23:23,429 --> 02:23:23,439
him
 

8271
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:26,950
him
her uh it i don't have trouble

8272
02:23:26,950 --> 02:23:26,960
her uh it i don't have trouble
 

8273
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:29,110
her uh it i don't have trouble
engendering robots i feel robotics

8274
02:23:29,110 --> 02:23:29,120
engendering robots i feel robotics
 

8275
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:30,630
engendering robots i feel robotics
people really say always

8276
02:23:30,630 --> 02:23:30,640
people really say always
 

8277
02:23:30,640 --> 02:23:32,710
people really say always
it i kind of like the idea that it's a

8278
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:32,720
it i kind of like the idea that it's a
 

8279
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:33,910
it i kind of like the idea that it's a
her or

8280
02:23:33,910 --> 02:23:33,920
her or
 

8281
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:37,110
her or
him uh there's a magical moment but

8282
02:23:37,110 --> 02:23:37,120
him uh there's a magical moment but
 

8283
02:23:37,120 --> 02:23:39,110
him uh there's a magical moment but
there's no touching uh i guess the

8284
02:23:39,110 --> 02:23:39,120
there's no touching uh i guess the
 

8285
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:41,510
there's no touching uh i guess the
question i have have you ever been um

8286
02:23:41,510 --> 02:23:41,520
question i have have you ever been um
 

8287
02:23:41,520 --> 02:23:44,070
question i have have you ever been um
like have you had a human robot

8288
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:44,080
like have you had a human robot
 

8289
02:23:44,080 --> 02:23:46,469
like have you had a human robot
experience where like

8290
02:23:46,469 --> 02:23:46,479
experience where like
 

8291
02:23:46,479 --> 02:23:49,510
experience where like
a robot touched you

8292
02:23:49,510 --> 02:23:49,520
a robot touched you
 

8293
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:52,389
a robot touched you
and like it was like wait like was there

8294
02:23:52,389 --> 02:23:52,399
and like it was like wait like was there
 

8295
02:23:52,399 --> 02:23:54,230
and like it was like wait like was there
a moment that you've forgotten that a

8296
02:23:54,230 --> 02:23:54,240
a moment that you've forgotten that a
 

8297
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:54,950
a moment that you've forgotten that a
robot

8298
02:23:54,950 --> 02:23:54,960
robot
 

8299
02:23:54,960 --> 02:23:58,270
robot
is a robot and like the

8300
02:23:58,270 --> 02:23:58,280
is a robot and like the
 

8301
02:23:58,280 --> 02:23:59,510
is a robot and like the
anthropomorphization

8302
02:23:59,510 --> 02:23:59,520
anthropomorphization
 

8303
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:02,309
anthropomorphization
stepped in and for a second you forgot

8304
02:24:02,309 --> 02:24:02,319
stepped in and for a second you forgot
 

8305
02:24:02,319 --> 02:24:04,710
stepped in and for a second you forgot
that it's not human

8306
02:24:04,710 --> 02:24:04,720
that it's not human
 

8307
02:24:04,720 --> 02:24:06,870
that it's not human
i mean i think when you're in on the

8308
02:24:06,870 --> 02:24:06,880
i mean i think when you're in on the
 

8309
02:24:06,880 --> 02:24:07,830
i mean i think when you're in on the
details

8310
02:24:07,830 --> 02:24:07,840
details
 

8311
02:24:07,840 --> 02:24:11,349
details
then we we of course anthropomorphized

8312
02:24:11,349 --> 02:24:11,359
then we we of course anthropomorphized
 

8313
02:24:11,359 --> 02:24:14,630
then we we of course anthropomorphized
our work with atlas but in you know

8314
02:24:14,630 --> 02:24:14,640
our work with atlas but in you know
 

8315
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:17,110
our work with atlas but in you know
in verbal communication and the like i

8316
02:24:17,110 --> 02:24:17,120
in verbal communication and the like i
 

8317
02:24:17,120 --> 02:24:18,550
in verbal communication and the like i
think we were pretty aware

8318
02:24:18,550 --> 02:24:18,560
think we were pretty aware
 

8319
02:24:18,560 --> 02:24:20,950
think we were pretty aware
of it as a machine that needed to be

8320
02:24:20,950 --> 02:24:20,960
of it as a machine that needed to be
 

8321
02:24:20,960 --> 02:24:21,990
of it as a machine that needed to be
respected

8322
02:24:21,990 --> 02:24:22,000
respected
 

8323
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,190
respected
um i actually i worry more about the

8324
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200
um i actually i worry more about the
 

8325
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,870
um i actually i worry more about the
smaller robots that

8326
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:26,880
smaller robots that
 

8327
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:28,630
smaller robots that
could still you know move quickly if

8328
02:24:28,630 --> 02:24:28,640
could still you know move quickly if
 

8329
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:30,070
could still you know move quickly if
programmed wrong and uh

8330
02:24:30,070 --> 02:24:30,080
programmed wrong and uh
 

8331
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:31,750
programmed wrong and uh
and we have to be careful actually about

8332
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:31,760
and we have to be careful actually about
 

8333
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:33,670
and we have to be careful actually about
safety and the like right now

8334
02:24:33,670 --> 02:24:33,680
safety and the like right now
 

8335
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:35,590
safety and the like right now
and that if we build our robots

8336
02:24:35,590 --> 02:24:35,600
and that if we build our robots
 

8337
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:37,429
and that if we build our robots
correctly i think then

8338
02:24:37,429 --> 02:24:37,439
correctly i think then
 

8339
02:24:37,439 --> 02:24:39,030
correctly i think then
those a lot of those concerns could go

8340
02:24:39,030 --> 02:24:39,040
those a lot of those concerns could go
 

8341
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,270
those a lot of those concerns could go
away and we're seeing that trend we're

8342
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,280
away and we're seeing that trend we're
 

8343
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:41,990
away and we're seeing that trend we're
seeing the lower

8344
02:24:41,990 --> 02:24:42,000
seeing the lower
 

8345
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,389
seeing the lower
cost lighter weight arms now that could

8346
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
cost lighter weight arms now that could
 

8347
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:45,510
cost lighter weight arms now that could
be

8348
02:24:45,510 --> 02:24:45,520
be
 

8349
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:49,830
be
fundamentally safe um

8350
02:24:49,830 --> 02:24:49,840

 

8351
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:51,349

i mean i do think touch is so

8352
02:24:51,349 --> 02:24:51,359
i mean i do think touch is so
 

8353
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:52,870
i mean i do think touch is so

02:24:59,750 --> 02:24:59,760
at mit and he
 

8361
02:24:59,760 --> 02:25:01,590
at mit and he
studied vision most of his life and he

studied vision most of his life and he

02:25:01,600 --> 02:25:03,830
studied vision most of his life and he
said when i had

8364
02:25:03,830 --> 02:25:03,840
said when i had
 

8365
02:25:03,840 --> 02:25:06,150
said when i had
kids i expected to be fascinated by

8366
02:25:06,150 --> 02:25:06,160
kids i expected to be fascinated by
 

8367
02:25:06,160 --> 02:25:09,590
kids i expected to be fascinated by
their perceptual development

8368
02:25:09,590 --> 02:25:09,600
their perceptual development
 

8369
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:12,710
their perceptual development
but what really what he noticed was felt

8370
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:12,720
but what really what he noticed was felt
 

8371
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:14,389
but what really what he noticed was felt
more impressive more dominant was the

8372
02:25:14,389 --> 02:25:14,399
more impressive more dominant was the
 

8373
02:25:14,399 --> 02:25:15,429
more impressive more dominant was the
way that they would

8374
02:25:15,429 --> 02:25:15,439
way that they would
 

8375
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:17,030
way that they would
touch everything and lick everything and

8376
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:17,040
touch everything and lick everything and
 

8377
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:18,469
touch everything and lick everything and
pick things up stick it on their tongue

8378
02:25:18,469 --> 02:25:18,479
pick things up stick it on their tongue
 

8379
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:19,270
pick things up stick it on their tongue
and whatever

8380
02:25:19,270 --> 02:25:19,280
and whatever
 

8381
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:22,830
and whatever
and he said watching his daughter

8382
02:25:22,830 --> 02:25:22,840
and he said watching his daughter
 

8383
02:25:22,840 --> 02:25:26,070
and he said watching his daughter
uh convinced him that actually he needed

8384
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:26,080
uh convinced him that actually he needed
 

8385
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,469
uh convinced him that actually he needed
to study tactile sensing more

8386
02:25:28,469 --> 02:25:28,479
to study tactile sensing more
 

8387
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:31,910
to study tactile sensing more
so there's something very

8388
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:31,920
so there's something very
 

8389
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,710
so there's something very
important i think it's a little bit also

8390
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:34,720
important i think it's a little bit also
 

8391
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,270
important i think it's a little bit also
of the

8392
02:25:35,270 --> 02:25:35,280
of the
 

8393
02:25:35,280 --> 02:25:38,389
of the
passive versus active part of the world

8394
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
passive versus active part of the world
 

8395
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:39,590
passive versus active part of the world
right you can

8396
02:25:39,590 --> 02:25:39,600
right you can
 

8397
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:43,910
right you can
passively perceive the world

8398
02:25:43,910 --> 02:25:43,920

 

8399
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:45,110

but it's fundamentally different if you

8400
02:25:45,110 --> 02:25:45,120
but it's fundamentally different if you
 

8401
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:46,950
but it's fundamentally different if you
can do an experiment right

8402
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:46,960
can do an experiment right
 

8403
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:48,870
can do an experiment right
and if you can change the world and you

8404
02:25:48,870 --> 02:25:48,880
and if you can change the world and you
 

8405
02:25:48,880 --> 02:25:50,150
and if you can change the world and you
can learn a lot more

8406
02:25:50,150 --> 02:25:50,160
can learn a lot more
 

8407
02:25:50,160 --> 02:25:54,230
can learn a lot more
than a passive observer so

8408
02:25:54,230 --> 02:25:54,240
than a passive observer so
 

8409
02:25:54,240 --> 02:25:56,150
than a passive observer so
you can in dialogue that was your

8410
02:25:56,150 --> 02:25:56,160
you can in dialogue that was your
 

8411
02:25:56,160 --> 02:25:58,309
you can in dialogue that was your
initial example you could have an

8412
02:25:58,309 --> 02:25:58,319
initial example you could have an
 

8413
02:25:58,319 --> 02:26:00,710
initial example you could have an
active experiment exchange but i think

8414
02:26:00,710 --> 02:26:00,720
active experiment exchange but i think
 

8415
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:02,870
active experiment exchange but i think
if you're just a camera watching youtube

8416
02:26:02,870 --> 02:26:02,880
if you're just a camera watching youtube
 

8417
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:05,670
if you're just a camera watching youtube
i think that's a very different problem

8418
02:26:05,670 --> 02:26:05,680
i think that's a very different problem
 

8419
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:07,349
i think that's a very different problem
than if you're a

8420
02:26:07,349 --> 02:26:07,359
than if you're a
 

8421
02:26:07,359 --> 02:26:12,150
than if you're a
robot that can apply force and touch

8422
02:26:12,150 --> 02:26:12,160
robot that can apply force and touch
 

8423
02:26:12,160 --> 02:26:15,349
robot that can apply force and touch
i i i think it's important

8424
02:26:15,349 --> 02:26:15,359
i i i think it's important
 

8425
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:17,190
i i i think it's important
yeah i think it's just an exciting area

8426
02:26:17,190 --> 02:26:17,200
yeah i think it's just an exciting area
 

8427
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:18,790
yeah i think it's just an exciting area
of research i think you're probably

8428
02:26:18,790 --> 02:26:18,800
of research i think you're probably
 

8429
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:20,309
of research i think you're probably
right that this hasn't been

8430
02:26:20,309 --> 02:26:20,319
right that this hasn't been
 

8431
02:26:20,319 --> 02:26:23,670
right that this hasn't been
under researched it's uh

8432
02:26:23,670 --> 02:26:23,680
under researched it's uh
 

8433
02:26:23,680 --> 02:26:25,750
under researched it's uh
to me as a person who's captivated by

8434
02:26:25,750 --> 02:26:25,760
to me as a person who's captivated by
 

8435
02:26:25,760 --> 02:26:27,670
to me as a person who's captivated by
the idea of human robot interaction

8436
02:26:27,670 --> 02:26:27,680
the idea of human robot interaction
 

8437
02:26:27,680 --> 02:26:31,030
the idea of human robot interaction
it feels like such a rich

8438
02:26:31,030 --> 02:26:31,040
it feels like such a rich
 

8439
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,389
it feels like such a rich
opportunity to explore touch not even

8440
02:26:34,389 --> 02:26:34,399
opportunity to explore touch not even
 

8441
02:26:34,399 --> 02:26:36,230
opportunity to explore touch not even
from a safety perspective but like you

8442
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:36,240
from a safety perspective but like you
 

8443
02:26:36,240 --> 02:26:37,349
from a safety perspective but like you
said the emotional

8444
02:26:37,349 --> 02:26:37,359
said the emotional
 

8445
02:26:37,359 --> 02:26:41,110
said the emotional
too i mean safety comes first um

8446
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:41,120
too i mean safety comes first um
 

8447
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:44,389
too i mean safety comes first um
but the next step is like

8448
02:26:44,389 --> 02:26:44,399
but the next step is like
 

8449
02:26:44,399 --> 02:26:48,230
but the next step is like
you know uh like a real human connection

8450
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:48,240
you know uh like a real human connection
 

8451
02:26:48,240 --> 02:26:49,750
you know uh like a real human connection
even in the war like even in the

8452
02:26:49,750 --> 02:26:49,760
even in the war like even in the
 

8453
02:26:49,760 --> 02:26:51,270
even in the war like even in the
industrial setting

8454
02:26:51,270 --> 02:26:51,280
industrial setting
 

8455
02:26:51,280 --> 02:26:54,469
industrial setting
it just feels like uh it's nice for the

8456
02:26:54,469 --> 02:26:54,479
it just feels like uh it's nice for the
 

8457
02:26:54,479 --> 02:26:55,349
it just feels like uh it's nice for the
robot

8458
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:55,359
robot
 

8459
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:57,190
robot
i don't know i you know you might

8460
02:26:57,190 --> 02:26:57,200
i don't know i you know you might
 

8461
02:26:57,200 --> 02:26:59,750
i don't know i you know you might
disagree with this but um

8462
02:26:59,750 --> 02:26:59,760
disagree with this but um
 

8463
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:01,429
disagree with this but um
because i think it's important to see

8464
02:27:01,429 --> 02:27:01,439
because i think it's important to see
 

8465
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,030
because i think it's important to see
robots as tools

8466
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,040
robots as tools
 

8467
02:27:03,040 --> 02:27:06,550
robots as tools
often but i don't know i think they're

8468
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:06,560
often but i don't know i think they're
 

8469
02:27:06,560 --> 02:27:08,469
often but i don't know i think they're
just always going to be more effective

8470
02:27:08,469 --> 02:27:08,479
just always going to be more effective
 

8471
02:27:08,479 --> 02:27:11,110
just always going to be more effective
once you humanize them

8472
02:27:11,110 --> 02:27:11,120
once you humanize them
 

8473
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,670
once you humanize them
uh like it's convenient now to think of

8474
02:27:13,670 --> 02:27:13,680
uh like it's convenient now to think of
 

8475
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:15,030
uh like it's convenient now to think of
them as tools because we want to focus

8476
02:27:15,030 --> 02:27:15,040
them as tools because we want to focus
 

8477
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:15,990
them as tools because we want to focus
on the safety

8478
02:27:15,990 --> 02:27:16,000
on the safety
 

8479
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,830
on the safety
but i think ultimately to create

8480
02:27:19,830 --> 02:27:19,840
but i think ultimately to create
 

8481
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:23,110
but i think ultimately to create
like a good experience for the worker

8482
02:27:23,110 --> 02:27:23,120
like a good experience for the worker
 

8483
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,710
like a good experience for the worker
for the person

8484
02:27:24,710 --> 02:27:24,720
for the person
 

8485
02:27:24,720 --> 02:27:27,830
for the person
there has to be a human element

8486
02:27:27,830 --> 02:27:27,840
there has to be a human element
 

8487
02:27:27,840 --> 02:27:30,790
there has to be a human element
i don't know for me i i it feels like

8488
02:27:30,790 --> 02:27:30,800
i don't know for me i i it feels like
 

8489
02:27:30,800 --> 02:27:33,030
i don't know for me i i it feels like
like an industrial robotic arm

8490
02:27:33,030 --> 02:27:33,040
like an industrial robotic arm
 

8491
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:34,870
like an industrial robotic arm
would be better if as a human element i

8492
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:34,880
would be better if as a human element i
 

8493
02:27:34,880 --> 02:27:36,550
would be better if as a human element i
think like we think robotics had that

8494
02:27:36,550 --> 02:27:36,560
think like we think robotics had that
 

8495
02:27:36,560 --> 02:27:38,230
think like we think robotics had that
idea with

8496
02:27:38,230 --> 02:27:38,240
idea with
 

8497
02:27:38,240 --> 02:27:41,190
idea with
baxter and having eyes and so on having

8498
02:27:41,190 --> 02:27:41,200
baxter and having eyes and so on having
 

8499
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:43,190
baxter and having eyes and so on having
i don't know i'm a big believer in that

8500
02:27:43,190 --> 02:27:43,200
i don't know i'm a big believer in that
 

8501
02:27:43,200 --> 02:27:46,389
i don't know i'm a big believer in that
i it's not my area

8502
02:27:46,389 --> 02:27:46,399
i it's not my area
 

8503
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:49,349
i it's not my area
but i am also a big believer do you have

8504
02:27:49,349 --> 02:27:49,359
but i am also a big believer do you have
 

8505
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:53,670
but i am also a big believer do you have
an emotional connection to atlas

8506
02:27:53,670 --> 02:27:53,680

 

8507
02:27:53,680 --> 02:28:00,230

like yeah do you miss him i mean

8508
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:00,240

 

8509
02:28:00,240 --> 02:28:02,870

yes i i i don't know if i'd more so than

8510
02:28:02,870 --> 02:28:02,880
yes i i i don't know if i'd more so than
 

8511
02:28:02,880 --> 02:28:04,550
yes i i i don't know if i'd more so than
if i had a different science project

8512
02:28:04,550 --> 02:28:04,560
if i had a different science project
 

8513
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:05,349
if i had a different science project
that i'd worked on

8514
02:28:05,349 --> 02:28:05,359
that i'd worked on
 

8515
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:10,230
that i'd worked on
super hard right but uh um

8516
02:28:10,230 --> 02:28:10,240

 

8517
02:28:10,240 --> 02:28:13,429

yeah i mean the robot we basically had

8518
02:28:13,429 --> 02:28:13,439
yeah i mean the robot we basically had
 

8519
02:28:13,439 --> 02:28:14,950
yeah i mean the robot we basically had
to do heart surgery on the robot in the

8520
02:28:14,950 --> 02:28:14,960
to do heart surgery on the robot in the
 

8521
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:16,790
to do heart surgery on the robot in the
final competition because we melted the

8522
02:28:16,790 --> 02:28:16,800
final competition because we melted the
 

8523
02:28:16,800 --> 02:28:17,670
final competition because we melted the
core

8524
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:17,680
core
 

8525
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:21,190
core
um and uh and

8526
02:28:21,190 --> 02:28:21,200
um and uh and
 

8527
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:22,389
um and uh and
yeah there was something about watching

8528
02:28:22,389 --> 02:28:22,399
yeah there was something about watching
 

8529
02:28:22,399 --> 02:28:24,070
yeah there was something about watching
that robot hanging there we know we had

8530
02:28:24,070 --> 02:28:24,080
that robot hanging there we know we had
 

8531
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:25,910
that robot hanging there we know we had
to compete with it in an hour and it was

8532
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:25,920
to compete with it in an hour and it was
 

8533
02:28:25,920 --> 02:28:27,030
to compete with it in an hour and it was
getting its

8534
02:28:27,030 --> 02:28:27,040
getting its
 

8535
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:29,830
getting its
guts ripped out those are all historic

8536
02:28:29,830 --> 02:28:29,840
guts ripped out those are all historic
 

8537
02:28:29,840 --> 02:28:30,389
guts ripped out those are all historic
moments

8538
02:28:30,389 --> 02:28:30,399
moments
 

8539
02:28:30,399 --> 02:28:32,230
moments
i think if we look back like 100 years

8540
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:32,240
i think if we look back like 100 years
 

8541
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:33,750
i think if we look back like 100 years
from now

8542
02:28:33,750 --> 02:28:33,760
from now
 

8543
02:28:33,760 --> 02:28:37,110
from now
um yeah i think those are important

8544
02:28:37,110 --> 02:28:37,120
um yeah i think those are important
 

8545
02:28:37,120 --> 02:28:38,469
um yeah i think those are important
moments in robotics

8546
02:28:38,469 --> 02:28:38,479
moments in robotics
 

8547
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,230
moments in robotics
i mean these are the early day you look

8548
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:40,240
i mean these are the early day you look
 

8549
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,590
i mean these are the early day you look
at like the early days of a lot of

8550
02:28:41,590 --> 02:28:41,600
at like the early days of a lot of
 

8551
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:43,030
at like the early days of a lot of
scientific disciplines they look

8552
02:28:43,030 --> 02:28:43,040
scientific disciplines they look
 

8553
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,349
scientific disciplines they look
ridiculous they're full of failure

8554
02:28:45,349 --> 02:28:45,359
ridiculous they're full of failure
 

8555
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:47,670
ridiculous they're full of failure
but it feels like robotics will be

8556
02:28:47,670 --> 02:28:47,680
but it feels like robotics will be
 

8557
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:49,590
but it feels like robotics will be
important

8558
02:28:49,590 --> 02:28:49,600
important
 

8559
02:28:49,600 --> 02:28:52,950
important
in the coming uh 100 years and these are

8560
02:28:52,950 --> 02:28:52,960
in the coming uh 100 years and these are
 

8561
02:28:52,960 --> 02:28:55,670
in the coming uh 100 years and these are
the early days so

8562
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:55,680
the early days so
 

8563
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,550
the early days so
so i think a lot of people are look at

8564
02:28:58,550 --> 02:28:58,560
so i think a lot of people are look at
 

8565
02:28:58,560 --> 02:28:59,270
so i think a lot of people are look at
uh

8566
02:28:59,270 --> 02:28:59,280
uh
 

8567
02:28:59,280 --> 02:29:01,190
uh
a brilliant person such as yourself and

8568
02:29:01,190 --> 02:29:01,200
a brilliant person such as yourself and
 

8569
02:29:01,200 --> 02:29:03,270
a brilliant person such as yourself and
and are curious about the intellectual

8570
02:29:03,270 --> 02:29:03,280
and are curious about the intellectual
 

8571
02:29:03,280 --> 02:29:04,710
and are curious about the intellectual
journey they've took

8572
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:04,720
journey they've took
 

8573
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,230
journey they've took
um is there maybe three books

8574
02:29:08,230 --> 02:29:08,240
um is there maybe three books
 

8575
02:29:08,240 --> 02:29:12,070
um is there maybe three books
technical fiction philosophical that um

8576
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:12,080
technical fiction philosophical that um
 

8577
02:29:12,080 --> 02:29:13,990
technical fiction philosophical that um
had a big impact on your life that you

8578
02:29:13,990 --> 02:29:14,000
had a big impact on your life that you
 

8579
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,270
had a big impact on your life that you
would recommend

8580
02:29:15,270 --> 02:29:15,280
would recommend
 

8581
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:18,550
would recommend
perhaps others reading

8582
02:29:18,550 --> 02:29:18,560

 

8583
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:20,950

yeah so um i actually didn't read that

8584
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:20,960
yeah so um i actually didn't read that
 

8585
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:21,990
yeah so um i actually didn't read that
much as a kid but i

8586
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:22,000
much as a kid but i
 

8587
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:26,710
much as a kid but i
read fairly voraciously now um

8588
02:29:26,710 --> 02:29:26,720

 

8589
02:29:26,720 --> 02:29:28,230

there are some recent books that if

8590
02:29:28,230 --> 02:29:28,240
there are some recent books that if
 

8591
02:29:28,240 --> 02:29:31,429
there are some recent books that if
you're interested in this kind of topic

8592
02:29:31,429 --> 02:29:31,439
you're interested in this kind of topic
 

8593
02:29:31,439 --> 02:29:34,389
you're interested in this kind of topic
like ai superpowers by kaifuli is just a

8594
02:29:34,389 --> 02:29:34,399
like ai superpowers by kaifuli is just a
 

8595
02:29:34,399 --> 02:29:35,750
like ai superpowers by kaifuli is just a
fantastic read

8596

how to use it
 

8857
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:31,270
how to use it
yeah i've been um i've been

8858

02:34:40,800 --> 02:34:41,830
over that medium but i think that's
because it's

8866
02:34:41,830 --> 02:34:41,840
because it's
 

8867
02:34:41,840 --> 02:34:44,070
because it's
hasn't been explored fully and teaching

8868

hasn't been explored fully and teaching
 

8869
02:34:44,080 --> 02:34:45,670

powerful enough laptop or something to

8898
02:35:11,830 --> 02:35:11,840
powerful enough laptop or something to
 

8899
02:35:11,840 --> 02:35:13,750
powerful enough laptop or something to
watch zoom while i'm doing that while

8900
02:35:13,750 --> 02:35:13,760
watch zoom while i'm doing that while
 

8901
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:14,710
watch zoom while i'm doing that while
i'm giving a lecture

8902

i'm giving a lecture
 

8903
02:35:14,720 --> 02:35:17,750
i'm giving a lecture
that that's a that's a new communication

8904
02:35:17,750 --> 02:35:17,760
that that's a that's a new communication
 

8905
02:35:17,760 --> 02:35:19,590
that that's a that's a new communication
tool that i didn't have last year

8906
02:35:19,590 --> 02:35:19,600
tool that i didn't have last year
 

8907
02:35:19,600 --> 02:35:22,389
tool that i didn't have last year
right and uh i think robotics can

8908
02:35:22,389 --> 02:35:22,399
right and uh i think robotics can
 

8909
02:35:22,399 --> 02:35:23,429
right and uh i think robotics can
potentially

8910
02:35:23,429 --> 02:35:23,439
potentially
 

8911
02:35:23,439 --> 02:35:26,309
potentially
benefit a lot from teaching that way

8912
02:35:26,309 --> 02:35:26,319
benefit a lot from teaching that way
 

8913
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:27,670
benefit a lot from teaching that way
we'll see it's going to be an experiment

8914
02:35:27,670 --> 02:35:27,680
we'll see it's going to be an experiment
 

8915
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:28,630
we'll see it's going to be an experiment
this fall

you know it's like 80 percent of people
 

8931
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:43,990
you know it's like 80 percent of people
who started listening to our

8932
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:44,000
who started listening to our
 

8933
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:44,870
who started listening to our
conversation

8934
02:35:44,870 --> 02:35:44,880
conversation
 

8935
02:35:44,880 --> 02:35:46,870
conversation
are still listening to now which is

8936
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:46,880
are still listening to now which is
 

8937
02:35:46,880 --> 02:35:48,150
are still listening to now which is
crazy to me

8938
02:35:48,150 --> 02:35:48,160
crazy to me
 

8939
02:35:48,160 --> 02:35:50,309
crazy to me
but so there's a there's a patience and

8940
02:35:50,309 --> 02:35:50,319
but so there's a there's a patience and
 

8941
02:35:50,319 --> 02:35:52,550
but so there's a there's a patience and
a interest in long-form content

8942
02:35:52,550 --> 02:35:52,560
a interest in long-form content
 

8943
02:35:52,560 --> 02:35:55,590
a interest in long-form content
but at the same time there's a magic to

8944
02:35:55,590 --> 02:35:55,600
but at the same time there's a magic to
 

8945
02:35:55,600 --> 02:35:58,710
but at the same time there's a magic to
forcing yourself to condense an idea

8946
02:35:58,710 --> 02:35:58,720
forcing yourself to condense an idea
 

8947
02:35:58,720 --> 02:36:02,309
forcing yourself to condense an idea
to as short as possible

8948
02:36:02,309 --> 02:36:02,319
to as short as possible
 

8949
02:36:02,319 --> 02:36:04,790
to as short as possible
uh as short as possible like clip it can

8950
02:36:04,790 --> 02:36:04,800
uh as short as possible like clip it can
 

8951
02:36:04,800 --> 02:36:06,790
uh as short as possible like clip it can
be part of a longer thing but like just

8952
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:06,800
be part of a longer thing but like just
 

8953
02:36:06,800 --> 02:36:07,750
be part of a longer thing but like just
like really

8954
02:36:07,750 --> 02:36:07,760
like really
 

8955
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:09,910
like really
beautifully condensed idea there's a lot

8956
02:36:09,910 --> 02:36:09,920
beautifully condensed idea there's a lot
 

8957
02:36:09,920 --> 02:36:11,830
beautifully condensed idea there's a lot
of opportunity there

8958
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:11,840
of opportunity there
 

8959
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:15,830
of opportunity there
that's easier to do and remote with

8960
02:36:15,830 --> 02:36:15,840
that's easier to do and remote with
 

8961
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:18,950
that's easier to do and remote with
i don't know uh with editing too

8962

i don't know uh with editing too
 

8963
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:21,110
i don't know uh with editing too
editing is an interesting thing like

8964
02:36:21,110 --> 02:36:21,120
editing is an interesting thing like
 

8965
02:36:21,120 --> 02:36:22,950
editing is an interesting thing like
what uh

8966
02:36:22,950 --> 02:36:22,960
what uh
 

8967
02:36:22,960 --> 02:36:25,110
what uh
you know most professors don't get when

8968
02:36:25,110 --> 02:36:25,120
you know most professors don't get when
 

8969
02:36:25,120 --> 02:36:26,389

8976
02:36:35,030 --> 02:36:35,040
that's also it can do magic like if you
 

8977
02:36:35,040 --> 02:36:37,910

02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:06,790
in my opinion are going to be the ones
that can think deeply

9242
02:41:06,790 --> 02:41:06,800
that can think deeply
 

9243
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:11,110
that can think deeply
about problems

9244
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:11,120

 

9245
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:13,269

you have to be able to ask questions

9246
02:41:13,269 --> 02:41:13,279
you have to be able to ask questions
 

9247
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:14,870
you have to be able to ask questions
agilely and use the internet for

9248
02:41:14,870 --> 02:41:14,880
agilely and use the internet for
 

9249
02:41:14,880 --> 02:41:16,230
agilely and use the internet for
everything it's good for and stuff like

9250
02:41:16,230 --> 02:41:16,240
everything it's good for and stuff like
 

9251
02:41:16,240 --> 02:41:17,510
everything it's good for and stuff like
this and i think a lot of people will

9252
02:41:17,510 --> 02:41:17,520
this and i think a lot of people will
 

9253
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:19,349
this and i think a lot of people will
develop those skills

9254
02:41:19,349 --> 02:41:19,359
develop those skills
 

9255
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:23,590
develop those skills
i think the the leaders

9256
02:41:23,590 --> 02:41:23,600
i think the the leaders
 

9257
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:25,110
i think the the leaders
thought leaders you know robotics

9258
02:41:25,110 --> 02:41:25,120
thought leaders you know robotics
 

9259
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:26,630
thought leaders you know robotics
leaders whatever

9260
02:41:26,630 --> 02:41:26,640
leaders whatever
 

9261
02:41:26,640 --> 02:41:28,469
leaders whatever
are going to be the ones that can do

9262
02:41:28,469 --> 02:41:28,479
are going to be the ones that can do
 

9263
02:41:28,479 --> 02:41:30,389
are going to be the ones that can do
more and they can think very deeply and

9264
02:41:30,389 --> 02:41:30,399
more and they can think very deeply and
 

9265
02:41:30,399 --> 02:41:31,030
more and they can think very deeply and
critically

9266
02:41:31,030 --> 02:41:31,040
critically
 

9267
02:41:31,040 --> 02:41:34,870
critically
um and that's a harder thing to learn

9268
02:41:34,870 --> 02:41:34,880
um and that's a harder thing to learn
 

9269
02:41:34,880 --> 02:41:36,870
um and that's a harder thing to learn
i think one one path to learning that is

9270
02:41:36,870 --> 02:41:36,880
i think one one path to learning that is
 

9271
02:41:36,880 --> 02:41:37,990
i think one one path to learning that is
through mathematics

9272
02:41:37,990 --> 02:41:38,000
through mathematics
 

9273
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:41,590
through mathematics
through engineering

9274
02:41:41,590 --> 02:41:41,600

 

9275
02:41:41,600 --> 02:41:43,590

i would encourage people to start math

9276
02:41:43,590 --> 02:41:43,600
i would encourage people to start math
 

9277
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:45,670
i would encourage people to start math
early i mean i

9278
02:41:45,670 --> 02:41:45,680
early i mean i
 

9279
02:41:45,680 --> 02:41:48,309
early i mean i
didn't really start i mean i was always

9280
02:41:48,309 --> 02:41:48,319
didn't really start i mean i was always
 

9281
02:41:48,319 --> 02:41:49,349
didn't really start i mean i was always
in the

9282
02:41:49,349 --> 02:41:49,359
in the
 

9283
02:41:49,359 --> 02:41:50,710
in the
the better math classes that i could

9284
02:41:50,710 --> 02:41:50,720
the better math classes that i could
 

9285
02:41:50,720 --> 02:41:53,510
the better math classes that i could
take but i wasn't pursuing

9286
02:41:53,510 --> 02:41:53,520
take but i wasn't pursuing
 

9287
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:54,950
take but i wasn't pursuing
super advanced mathematics or anything

9288
02:41:54,950 --> 02:41:54,960
super advanced mathematics or anything
 

9289
02:41:54,960 --> 02:41:58,150
super advanced mathematics or anything
like that until i got to mit i think mit

9290
02:41:58,150 --> 02:41:58,160
like that until i got to mit i think mit
 

9291
02:41:58,160 --> 02:42:02,870
like that until i got to mit i think mit
lit me up and really started

9292
02:42:02,870 --> 02:42:02,880
lit me up and really started
 

9293
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:06,870
lit me up and really started
the life that i'm living now but

9294
02:42:06,870 --> 02:42:06,880
the life that i'm living now but
 

9295
02:42:06,880 --> 02:42:10,630
the life that i'm living now but
yeah i really want kids to to dig deep

9296
02:42:10,630 --> 02:42:10,640
yeah i really want kids to to dig deep
 

9297
02:42:10,640 --> 02:42:12,150
yeah i really want kids to to dig deep
really understand things building things

9298
02:42:12,150 --> 02:42:12,160
really understand things building things
 

9299
02:42:12,160 --> 02:42:13,910
really understand things building things
too i mean pull things apart

9300
02:42:13,910 --> 02:42:13,920
too i mean pull things apart
 

9301
02:42:13,920 --> 02:42:16,309
too i mean pull things apart
put them back together like that's just

9302
02:42:16,309 --> 02:42:16,319
put them back together like that's just
 

9303
02:42:16,319 --> 02:42:18,469
put them back together like that's just
such a good way to really

9304
02:42:18,469 --> 02:42:18,479
such a good way to really
 

9305
02:42:18,479 --> 02:42:21,670
such a good way to really
understand things and expect it to be

9306
02:42:21,670 --> 02:42:21,680
understand things and expect it to be
 

9307
02:42:21,680 --> 02:42:26,070
understand things and expect it to be
a long journey right it's uh you don't

9308
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:26,080
a long journey right it's uh you don't
 

9309
02:42:26,080 --> 02:42:27,110
a long journey right it's uh you don't
have to know everything

9310
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:27,120
have to know everything
 

9311
02:42:27,120 --> 02:42:29,590
have to know everything
you're never gonna know everything so

9312
02:42:29,590 --> 02:42:29,600
you're never gonna know everything so
 

9313
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:30,630
you're never gonna know everything so
think deeply and

9314
02:42:30,630 --> 02:42:30,640
think deeply and
 

9315
02:42:30,640 --> 02:42:33,830
think deeply and
stick with it enjoy the ride

9316
02:42:33,830 --> 02:42:33,840
stick with it enjoy the ride
 

9317
02:42:33,840 --> 02:42:37,510
stick with it enjoy the ride
but just make sure you're not um

9318
02:42:37,510 --> 02:42:37,520
but just make sure you're not um
 

9319
02:42:37,520 --> 02:42:39,269
but just make sure you're not um
yeah just just make sure you're you're

9320
02:42:39,269 --> 02:42:39,279
yeah just just make sure you're you're
 

9321
02:42:39,279 --> 02:42:41,990
yeah just just make sure you're you're
you're stopping to think about why

9322
02:42:41,990 --> 02:42:42,000
you're stopping to think about why
 

9323
02:42:42,000 --> 02:42:44,309
you're stopping to think about why
things work yeah it's true it's uh it's

9324
02:42:44,309 --> 02:42:44,319
things work yeah it's true it's uh it's
 

9325
02:42:44,319 --> 02:42:46,070
things work yeah it's true it's uh it's
easy to lose yourself in the

9326
02:42:46,070 --> 02:42:46,080
easy to lose yourself in the
 

9327
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:51,030
easy to lose yourself in the
in the in the distractions of the world

9328
02:42:51,030 --> 02:42:51,040

 

9329
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:52,830

we're overwhelmed with content right now

9330
02:42:52,830 --> 02:42:52,840
we're overwhelmed with content right now
 

9331
02:42:52,840 --> 02:42:54,630
we're overwhelmed with content right now
but

9332
02:42:54,630 --> 02:42:54,640
but
 

9333
02:42:54,640 --> 02:42:56,870
but
you have to stop and pick some of it and

9334
02:42:56,870 --> 02:42:56,880
you have to stop and pick some of it and
 

9335
02:42:56,880 --> 02:42:58,710
you have to stop and pick some of it and
really understand

9336
02:42:58,710 --> 02:42:58,720
really understand
 

9337
02:42:58,720 --> 02:43:01,990
really understand
yeah on the book point i've read

9338
02:43:01,990 --> 02:43:02,000
yeah on the book point i've read
 

9339
02:43:02,000 --> 02:43:04,950
yeah on the book point i've read
animal farm by george orwell a

9340
02:43:04,950 --> 02:43:04,960
animal farm by george orwell a
 

9341
02:43:04,960 --> 02:43:06,630
animal farm by george orwell a
ridiculous number of times so for me

9342
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:06,640
ridiculous number of times so for me
 

9343
02:43:06,640 --> 02:43:08,389
ridiculous number of times so for me
like that book i don't know if it's a

9344
02:43:08,389 --> 02:43:08,399
like that book i don't know if it's a
 

9345
02:43:08,399 --> 02:43:10,469
like that book i don't know if it's a
good book in general but for me it

9346
02:43:10,469 --> 02:43:10,479
good book in general but for me it
 

9347
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:12,630
good book in general but for me it
connects deeply somehow

9348
02:43:12,630 --> 02:43:12,640
connects deeply somehow
 

9349
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:15,750
connects deeply somehow
uh it somehow connects

9350
02:43:15,750 --> 02:43:15,760
uh it somehow connects
 

9351
02:43:15,760 --> 02:43:18,389
uh it somehow connects
so i was born in the soviet union so it

9352
02:43:18,389 --> 02:43:18,399
so i was born in the soviet union so it
 

9353
02:43:18,399 --> 02:43:19,990
so i was born in the soviet union so it
connects to me to the entire

9354
02:43:19,990 --> 02:43:20,000
connects to me to the entire
 

9355
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:22,389
connects to me to the entire
history of the soviet union and to world

9356
02:43:22,389 --> 02:43:22,399
history of the soviet union and to world
 

9357
02:43:22,399 --> 02:43:23,110
history of the soviet union and to world
war ii

9358
02:43:23,110 --> 02:43:23,120
war ii
 

9359
02:43:23,120 --> 02:43:26,389
war ii
and to the love and hatred and suffering

9360
02:43:26,389 --> 02:43:26,399
and to the love and hatred and suffering
 

9361
02:43:26,399 --> 02:43:27,990
and to the love and hatred and suffering
that went on there

9362
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:28,000
that went on there
 

9363
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,190
that went on there
and the uh the

9364
02:43:31,190 --> 02:43:31,200
and the uh the
 

9365
02:43:31,200 --> 02:43:34,309
and the uh the
corrupting nature of power and greed and

9366
02:43:34,309 --> 02:43:34,319
corrupting nature of power and greed and
 

9367
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,630
corrupting nature of power and greed and
just somehow i just that that that book

9368
02:43:36,630 --> 02:43:36,640
just somehow i just that that that book
 

9369
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,389
just somehow i just that that that book
has taught me more about life than like

9370
02:43:38,389 --> 02:43:38,399
has taught me more about life than like
 

9371
02:43:38,399 --> 02:43:39,269
has taught me more about life than like
anything else

9372
02:43:39,269 --> 02:43:39,279
anything else
 

9373
02:43:39,279 --> 02:43:41,910
anything else
even though it's just like a silly like

9374
02:43:41,910 --> 02:43:41,920
even though it's just like a silly like
 

9375

childlike book about
 

9377
02:43:44,399 --> 02:43:47,030
childlike book about
adam pigs it's like i don't know why it

9378
02:43:47,030 --> 02:43:47,040
adam pigs it's like i don't know why it
 

9379

9383
02:43:51,920 --> 02:43:53,670
uh the same there's a few um
yeah there's a few technical books too

9384
02:43:53,670 --> 02:43:53,680
yeah there's a few technical books too
 

9385
02:43:53,680 --> 02:43:55,510
yeah there's a few technical books too
and algorithms that just

9386
02:43:55,510 --> 02:43:55,520
and algorithms that just
 

9387
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:58,710
and algorithms that just
yeah you return too often right i'm i'm

9388
02:43:58,710 --> 02:43:58,720
yeah you return too often right i'm i'm
 

9389

9393
02:44:03,359 --> 02:44:03,990
uh yeah there's uh i don't and i've been
losing that

9394
02:44:03,990 --> 02:44:04,000
losing that
 

9395
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:06,070
losing that
because of the internet i've been like

9396
02:44:06,070 --> 02:44:06,080
because of the internet i've been like
 

9397
02:44:06,080 --> 02:44:07,190
because of the internet i've been like
uh going and

9398
