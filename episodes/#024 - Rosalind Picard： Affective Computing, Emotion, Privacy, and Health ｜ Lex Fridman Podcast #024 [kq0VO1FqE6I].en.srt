concept also encompassed machines that
 

91
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,440
concept also encompassed machines that
would have mechanisms that functioned

92
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,450
would have mechanisms that functioned
 

93
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,719
would have mechanisms that functioned
like human emotion does inside them it

100
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:01,840
human emotion
 

101
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,870
human emotion
so the human-computer interaction part

102
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:04,880
so the human-computer interaction part
 

103
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,020
so the human-computer interaction part
is the part that people tend to see like

104
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,030
is the part that people tend to see like
 

105
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,419
is the part that people tend to see like
if I'm you know really ticked off at my

if I'm you know really ticked off at my
 

107
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:12,520

had worked really hard on it actually

126
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,170
had worked really hard on it actually
 

127
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,020
had worked really hard on it actually
had some of the most sophisticated AI in

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,330
in Word 95 a 98 I remember when it was
 

141
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,100
in Word 95 a 98 I remember when it was
born but many people do you find

142
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,110
born but many people do you find
 

143
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,720

yourself with that reference that people
 

145
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,070
yourself with that reference that people
recognize what you're talking about

146

still to this point I don't expect the

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:02,810
still to this point I don't expect the
 

149
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,620
still to this point I don't expect the
newest students to these days but I've

150
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:05,630
newest students to these days but I've
 

151
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,149
newest students to these days but I've
mentioned it through a lot of audiences

152
00:03:07,149 --> 00:03:07,159
mentioned it through a lot of audiences
 

153
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,649
mentioned it through a lot of audiences
like how many of you know this clip

154
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:08,659
like how many of you know this clip
 

155
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,479
like how many of you know this clip
ething and still the majority people

156
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:10,489
ething and still the majority people
 

157
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:13,080
ething and still the majority people
seem to know it so Clippy kind of looks

158
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,090
seem to know it so Clippy kind of looks

computer scientists yeah well where

274
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:27,930
computer scientists yeah well where
 

275
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,450
computer scientists yeah well where
hasn't gotten bad let's just say there's

276
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:29,460
hasn't gotten bad let's just say there's
 

277
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,279
hasn't gotten bad let's just say there's
a lot more variety among computer

278
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:31,289
a lot more variety among computer
 

279
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,749
a lot more variety among computer
scientists these days it's computer

280
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:32,759
scientists these days it's computer
 

281
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,430

scientists are much more diverse group

282
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,440
scientists are much more diverse group
 

283
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,159
scientists are much more diverse group
today than they were 25 years ago and

284
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:37,169
today than they were 25 years ago and
 

285
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,520
today than they were 25 years ago and
that's good we need all kinds of people

286
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:40,530
that's good we need all kinds of people
 

287
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,200
that's good we need all kinds of people
to become computer scientists so that

288
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,210
to become computer scientists so that
 

289
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,090
to become computer scientists so that
computer science reflects more what

290
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:44,100
computer science reflects more what
 

291
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,820
computer science reflects more what
society needs and you know there's

292
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:46,830
society needs and you know there's
 

293
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,980
society needs and you know there's
brilliance among every personality type

294
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:48,990
brilliance among every personality type
 

295
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,159
brilliance among every personality type
so it need not be limited to people who

296
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,169
so it need not be limited to people who
 

297
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,320
so it need not be limited to people who
prefer computers to other people how

298
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,330
prefer computers to other people how
 

299
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,420
prefer computers to other people how
hard do you think it is how your view of

hard do you think it is how your view of
 

301
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,490
hard do you think it is how your view of
how difficult it is to recognize emotion

302
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:58,500
how difficult it is to recognize emotion
 

303

00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,920
intelligent interaction has it gotten
easier or harder as you've explored it

308
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:06,930
easier or harder as you've explored it
 

309
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:08,870
easier or harder as you've explored it
further and how far away away from

looking at the Turing test for emotional
 

317
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,570
looking at the Turing test for emotional
intelligence I think it is as difficult

00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,370
my prediction of its difficulty is
spot-on

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,380
spot-on

00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,870
spot-on
I think the time estimates are always

326
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:32,880
I think the time estimates are always
 

327
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,279
I think the time estimates are always
hard because they're always a function

328
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:34,289
hard because they're always a function
 

329
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:38,210
hard because they're always a function

it and that's causing some of us to put
 

397
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,879
it and that's causing some of us to put
the brakes on a little bit usually we're

the brakes on a little bit usually we're

let's go faster this is causing us to
 

403
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
let's go faster this is causing us to
pull back and put the brakes on and

404
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:13,610
pull back and put the brakes on and
 

405
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,050
pull back and put the brakes on and
that's the way that some of this

that's the way that some of this

that's the way that some of this
technology is being used in places like

technology is being used in places like
 

409
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,629
technology is being used in places like
China right now and that worries me so

China right now and that worries me so
 

411
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,930

myself on a lot of the things that we

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:32,149
myself on a lot of the things that we
could be doing and try to get the

could be doing and try to get the
 

417
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,500
could be doing and try to get the
community to think a little bit more

418
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,510
community to think a little bit more

that how can we do it in a way that puts
 

423

that how can we do it in a way that puts

the technology were referring to is just

00:08:43,699 --> 00:08:43,709
the technology were referring to is just
 

427
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:46,310
the technology were referring to is just
when a computer senses the human being

428
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
when a computer senses the human being
 

429
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,800
when a computer senses the human being
like the human face yeah right yeah so

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:48,810
like the human face yeah right yeah so

what there's a lot of exciting things
 

433
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,210
what there's a lot of exciting things
there like forming a deep connection of

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:53,220
there like forming a deep connection of
 

435
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,860
there like forming a deep connection of
the human being book so what are your

436
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:54,870
the human being book so what are your
 

437
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,340
the human being book so what are your
worries how that could go wrong is it in

439
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,540
worries how that could go wrong is it in

and if you don't like it you better not
 

533
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,540
and if you don't like it you better not
scowl in the direction of any censors so

534
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:08,550
scowl in the direction of any censors so
 

535
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,850
scowl in the direction of any censors so
one let me just comment on a small

536
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:10,860
one let me just comment on a small
 

537
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,320
one let me just comment on a small
tangent do you know with the idea of

538
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,330
tangent do you know with the idea of
 

539
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,820
tangent do you know with the idea of
adversarial examples and deep fakes and

540
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:16,830
adversarial examples and deep fakes and
 

541
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:19,850
adversarial examples and deep fakes and
so on yeah what you bring up is actually

542
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:19,860
so on yeah what you bring up is actually
 

543
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,420
so on yeah what you bring up is actually
the the in that one sense deep fake

544
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:22,430
the the in that one sense deep fake
 

545
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:26,620
the the in that one sense deep fake
provide a comforting protection that

546
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:26,630
provide a comforting protection that
 

547
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:30,830
provide a comforting protection that
they you can no longer really trust that

548
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:30,840
they you can no longer really trust that
 

549
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,130
they you can no longer really trust that
the video of your face was legitimate

550
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:34,140
the video of your face was legitimate
 

551
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,230
the video of your face was legitimate
and therefore you always have an escape

552
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:36,240
and therefore you always have an escape
 

553
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,820
and therefore you always have an escape
clause if a government is trying if a

554
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:39,830
clause if a government is trying if a
 

555
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,870
clause if a government is trying if a
stable balanced ethical government is

556
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
stable balanced ethical government is
 

557
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,280
stable balanced ethical government is
trying to accuse the or something at

558
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,290
trying to accuse the or something at
 

559
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,450
trying to accuse the or something at
least you have protection you could say

560
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:47,460
least you have protection you could say
 

561
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,010
least you have protection you could say
was fake news as it's a popular term now

562
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:51,020
was fake news as it's a popular term now
 

563
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:53,660
was fake news as it's a popular term now
thinking of it we we know how to go into

564
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:53,670
thinking of it we we know how to go into
 

565
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,240
thinking of it we we know how to go into
the video and see for example your heart

566
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,250
the video and see for example your heart
 

567
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,600
the video and see for example your heart
rate and respiration and whether or not

568
00:11:59,600 --> 00:11:59,610
rate and respiration and whether or not
 

569
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,760
rate and respiration and whether or not
they've been tampered with

570
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:01,770
they've been tampered with
 

571
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,280
they've been tampered with
and we also can put like fake heart rate

572
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:04,290
and we also can put like fake heart rate
 

573
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,769
and we also can put like fake heart rate
and respiration in your video now too we

574
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:06,779
and respiration in your video now too we
 

575
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:09,730
and respiration in your video now too we
decided we needed to do that after we

576
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:09,740
decided we needed to do that after we
 

577
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,590
decided we needed to do that after we
after we developed a way to extract it

578
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:12,600
after we developed a way to extract it
 

579
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,660
after we developed a way to extract it
we decided we also needed a way to jam

580
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:14,670
we decided we also needed a way to jam
 

581
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:18,019
we decided we also needed a way to jam
it Hey and so the fact that we took time

582
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:18,029
it Hey and so the fact that we took time
 

583
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:21,199
it Hey and so the fact that we took time
to do that other step to write that was

584
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:21,209
to do that other step to write that was
 

585
00:12:21,209 --> 00:12:23,120
to do that other step to write that was
time that I wasn't spending making the

586
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:23,130
time that I wasn't spending making the
 

587
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:25,130
time that I wasn't spending making the
machine more effectively intelligent and

588
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:25,140
machine more effectively intelligent and
 

589
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,590
machine more effectively intelligent and
there's a choice and how we spend our

590
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:27,600
there's a choice and how we spend our
 

591
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,410
there's a choice and how we spend our
time which is now being swayed a little

592
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:30,420
time which is now being swayed a little
 

593
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,930
time which is now being swayed a little
bit less by this goal and a little bit

594
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:32,940
bit less by this goal and a little bit
 

595
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,820
bit less by this goal and a little bit
more like by concern about what's

596
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:34,830
more like by concern about what's
 

597
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,190
more like by concern about what's
happening in society and what kind of

598
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:37,200
happening in society and what kind of
 

599
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,410
happening in society and what kind of
future do we want to build and as we

600
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:39,420
future do we want to build and as we
 

601
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,769
future do we want to build and as we
step back and say okay we don't just

602
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:42,779
step back and say okay we don't just

that's that's the wrong ethic why are we

00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:53,459
that's that's the wrong ethic why are we
 

611
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:56,000
that's that's the wrong ethic why are we

building it what what is the point of

now we realize that this is enabling

now we realize that this is enabling
rich people to get vastly richer the

rich people to get vastly richer the

right now you can't use the lie detector

right now you can't use the lie detector

for a job I think similarly we need to
 

707
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:58,320
for a job I think similarly we need to
put in place protection around reading

925
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,729
problem with loneliness that's growing
and so there's a longing for connection

926
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:46,739
and so there's a longing for connection
 

927
00:19:46,739 --> 00:19:50,190
and so there's a longing for connection
do you if you're lonely you're part of a

00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,760
want to use AI to extend people's
ability to build you want to build AI

1420
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:20,770
ability to build you want to build AI
 

1421
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,039
ability to build you want to build AI
that extends human intelligence that

1422
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:23,049
that extends human intelligence that
 

1423
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:26,880
that extends human intelligence that
empowers the weak and helps balance the

1424
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:26,890
empowers the weak and helps balance the
 

1425
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,200
empowers the weak and helps balance the
power between the weak and the strong

1426
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,210
power between the weak and the strong
 

1427
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,580
power between the weak and the strong
not that gives more power to the strong

1428
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:31,590
not that gives more power to the strong
 

1429
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,840
not that gives more power to the strong
so in in this process of empowering

1430
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:36,850
so in in this process of empowering
 

1431
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:39,870
so in in this process of empowering
people in sensing people and what is

1432
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:39,880
people in sensing people and what is
 

1433
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,610
people in sensing people and what is
your sense on emotion in terms of

1434
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:41,620
your sense on emotion in terms of
 

1435
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,020
your sense on emotion in terms of
recognizing emotion the difference

1436
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,030
recognizing emotion the difference
 

1437
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,730
recognizing emotion the difference
between emotion that is shown and

1438
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:44,740
between emotion that is shown and
 

1439
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,770
between emotion that is shown and
emotion that is felt so yeah yeah

1440
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:49,780
emotion that is felt so yeah yeah
 

1441
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:52,230
emotion that is felt so yeah yeah
emotion that is expressed on the surface

1442
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:52,240
emotion that is expressed on the surface
 

1443
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,289
emotion that is expressed on the surface
through your face your body and not

1444
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:55,299
through your face your body and not
 

1445
00:30:55,299 --> 00:30:57,270
through your face your body and not
various other things and what's actually

1446
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:57,280
various other things and what's actually
 

1447
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,730
various other things and what's actually
going on deep inside on the biological

1448
00:30:59,730 --> 00:30:59,740
going on deep inside on the biological
 

1449
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:02,039
going on deep inside on the biological
level on the neuroscience level or some

1450
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:02,049
level on the neuroscience level or some
 

1451
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:06,270
level on the neuroscience level or some
kind of cognitive level yeah whoa no

1452
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:06,280
kind of cognitive level yeah whoa no
 

1453
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:08,789
kind of cognitive level yeah whoa no
easy questions here boy yeah I'm sure

1454
00:31:08,789 --> 00:31:08,799
easy questions here boy yeah I'm sure
 

1455
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,980
easy questions here boy yeah I'm sure
there's no there's no definitive answer

1456
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:10,990
there's no there's no definitive answer
 

1457
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,200
there's no there's no definitive answer
but what's your sense how far can we get

1458
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,210
but what's your sense how far can we get
 

1459
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:16,500
but what's your sense how far can we get
by just looking at the face we're very

1460
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:16,510
by just looking at the face we're very
 

1461
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,820
by just looking at the face we're very
limited when we just look at the face

1462
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:17,830
limited when we just look at the face
 

1463
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,860
limited when we just look at the face
but we can get further than most people

1464
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:19,870
but we can get further than most people
 

1465
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,539
but we can get further than most people
think we can get people think hey I have

1466
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:24,549
think we can get people think hey I have
 

1467
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,880
think we can get people think hey I have
a great poker face therefore all you're

1468
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:26,890
a great poker face therefore all you're
 

1469
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,409
a great poker face therefore all you're
ever gonna get from me is neutral well

1470
00:31:28,409 --> 00:31:28,419
ever gonna get from me is neutral well
 

1471
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,380
ever gonna get from me is neutral well
that's naive we can read with the

1472
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:31,390
that's naive we can read with the
 

1473
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,990
that's naive we can read with the
ordinary camera on your laptop or on

1474
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:34,000
ordinary camera on your laptop or on
 

1475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,750
ordinary camera on your laptop or on
your phone we can read from a neutral

1476
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:36,760
your phone we can read from a neutral
 

1477
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:39,900
your phone we can read from a neutral
face if your heart is racing we can read

1478
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:39,910
face if your heart is racing we can read
 

1479
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,570
face if your heart is racing we can read
from a neutral face if your breathing is

1480
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:42,580
from a neutral face if your breathing is
 

1481
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,780
from a neutral face if your breathing is
becoming irregular and showing signs of

1482
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:45,790
becoming irregular and showing signs of
 

1483
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,490
becoming irregular and showing signs of
stress we can read under some conditions

1484
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:50,500
stress we can read under some conditions
 

1485
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,380
stress we can read under some conditions
that maybe I won't give you details on

1486
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,390
that maybe I won't give you details on
 

1487
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:54,269
that maybe I won't give you details on
how your heart rate variable

1488
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:54,279
how your heart rate variable
 

1489
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:57,629
how your heart rate variable
the power is changing that could be a

1490
00:31:57,629 --> 00:31:57,639
the power is changing that could be a
 

1491
00:31:57,639 --> 00:31:59,879
the power is changing that could be a
sign of stress even when your heart rate

1492
00:31:59,879 --> 00:31:59,889
sign of stress even when your heart rate
 

1493
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:03,509
sign of stress even when your heart rate
is not necessarily accelerating so I'm

1494
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:03,519
is not necessarily accelerating so I'm
 

1495
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,759
is not necessarily accelerating so I'm
sorry from physio sensitive from the

1496
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:05,769
sorry from physio sensitive from the
 

1497
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,070
sorry from physio sensitive from the
face from the color changes that you

1498
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
face from the color changes that you
 

1499
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,759
face from the color changes that you
cannot even see but the camera can see

1500
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:10,769
cannot even see but the camera can see
 

1501
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:13,859
cannot even see but the camera can see
that's amazing so so you can get a lot

1502
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:13,869
that's amazing so so you can get a lot
 

1503
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:16,049
that's amazing so so you can get a lot
of signal but so we get things people

1504
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:16,059
of signal but so we get things people
 

1505
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,209
of signal but so we get things people
can't see using a regular camera and

1506
00:32:18,209 --> 00:32:18,219
can't see using a regular camera and
 

1507
00:32:18,219 --> 00:32:20,999
can't see using a regular camera and
from that we can tell things about your

1508
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:21,009
from that we can tell things about your
 

1509
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:24,629
from that we can tell things about your
stress so if you are just sitting there

1510
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:24,639
stress so if you are just sitting there
 

1511
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:26,430
stress so if you are just sitting there
with a blank face thinking nobody can

1512
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:26,440
with a blank face thinking nobody can
 

1513
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,509
with a blank face thinking nobody can
read my emotion while you're wrong right

1514
00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:29,519
read my emotion while you're wrong right
 

1515
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,070
read my emotion while you're wrong right
so that's really interesting but that's

1516
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,080
so that's really interesting but that's
 

1517
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,719
so that's really interesting but that's
from sort of visual information from the

1518
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:33,729
from sort of visual information from the
 

1519
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:36,719
from sort of visual information from the
face that's almost like cheating your

1520
00:32:36,719 --> 00:32:36,729
face that's almost like cheating your
 

1521
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,669
face that's almost like cheating your
way just the physiological state of the

1522
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:38,679
way just the physiological state of the
 

1523
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:42,329
way just the physiological state of the
body by being very clever with when you

1524
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:42,339
body by being very clever with when you
 

1525
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:43,709
body by being very clever with when you
can do as a tional processing signal

1526
00:32:43,709 --> 00:32:43,719
can do as a tional processing signal
 

1527
00:32:43,719 --> 00:32:45,299
can do as a tional processing signal
processing so that's a really impressive

1528
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:45,309
processing so that's a really impressive
 

1529
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:47,249
processing so that's a really impressive
but if you just look at the stuff we

1530
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:47,259
but if you just look at the stuff we
 

1531
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:51,329
but if you just look at the stuff we
humans can see the bulk of the smile

1532
00:32:51,329 --> 00:32:51,339
humans can see the bulk of the smile
 

1533
00:32:51,339 --> 00:32:54,599
humans can see the bulk of the smile
smirks the subtle all the face so then

1534
00:32:54,599 --> 00:32:54,609
smirks the subtle all the face so then
 

1535
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,159
smirks the subtle all the face so then
you can hide that on your face for a

1536
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:56,169
you can hide that on your face for a
 

1537
00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:58,169
you can hide that on your face for a
limited amount of time now if you if

1538
00:32:58,169 --> 00:32:58,179
limited amount of time now if you if
 

1539
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,969
limited amount of time now if you if
you're just going in for a brief

1540
00:32:59,969 --> 00:32:59,979
you're just going in for a brief
 

1541
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,560
you're just going in for a brief
interview and you're hiding it that's

1542
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,570
interview and you're hiding it that's
 

1543
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,349
interview and you're hiding it that's
pretty easy for most people if you are

1544
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:04,359
pretty easy for most people if you are
 

1545
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:07,859
pretty easy for most people if you are
however surveilled constantly everywhere

1546
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:07,869
however surveilled constantly everywhere
 

1547
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:10,789
however surveilled constantly everywhere
you go then it's gonna say gee you know

1548
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:10,799
you go then it's gonna say gee you know
 

1549
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,190
you go then it's gonna say gee you know
Lex used to smile a lot and now I'm not

1550
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:14,200
Lex used to smile a lot and now I'm not
 

1551
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,079
Lex used to smile a lot and now I'm not
seeing so many smiles and Roz used to

1552
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,089
seeing so many smiles and Roz used to
 

1553
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:21,060
seeing so many smiles and Roz used to
you know laugh a lot and smile a lot

1554
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,070
you know laugh a lot and smile a lot
 

1555
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,950
you know laugh a lot and smile a lot
very spontaneously and now I'm only

1556
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:22,960
very spontaneously and now I'm only
 

1557
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,649
very spontaneously and now I'm only
seeing these not so spontaneous looking

1558
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:25,659
seeing these not so spontaneous looking
 

1559
00:33:25,659 --> 00:33:27,899
seeing these not so spontaneous looking
smiles and only when she's asked these

1560
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:27,909
smiles and only when she's asked these
 

1561
00:33:27,909 --> 00:33:33,839
smiles and only when she's asked these
questions you know that's some sleep we

1562
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:33,849
questions you know that's some sleep we
 

1563
00:33:33,849 --> 00:33:36,269
questions you know that's some sleep we
could look at that too so now I have to

1564
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:36,279
could look at that too so now I have to
 

1565
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:39,570
could look at that too so now I have to
be a little careful - when I say we you

1566
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:39,580
be a little careful - when I say we you
 

1567
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,070
be a little careful - when I say we you
think we can't read your emotion and we

1568
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,080
think we can't read your emotion and we
 

1569
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,079
think we can't read your emotion and we
can it's not that binary what we're

1570
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:43,089
can it's not that binary what we're
 

1571
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,329
can it's not that binary what we're
reading is more some physiological

1572
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:45,339
reading is more some physiological
 

1573
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:47,159
reading is more some physiological
changes that relate to the your

1574
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:47,169
changes that relate to the your
 

1575
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:50,759
changes that relate to the your
activation now that doesn't mean that we

1576
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:50,769
activation now that doesn't mean that we
 

1577
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:52,680
activation now that doesn't mean that we
know everything about how you feel in

1578
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:52,690
know everything about how you feel in
 

1579
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:54,269
know everything about how you feel in
fact we still know very little about how

1580
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:54,279
fact we still know very little about how
 

1581
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:56,399
fact we still know very little about how
you feel your thoughts are still private

1582
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:56,409
you feel your thoughts are still private
 

1583
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,669
you feel your thoughts are still private
you're nuanced feelings are still

1584
00:33:59,669 --> 00:33:59,679
you're nuanced feelings are still
 

1585
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,609
you're nuanced feelings are still
completely private we can't read any of

1586
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:02,619
completely private we can't read any of
 

1587
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:05,310
completely private we can't read any of
that so there's some relief that we

1588
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:05,320
that so there's some relief that we
 

1589
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,919
that so there's some relief that we
can't read that even brain

1590
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:07,929
can't read that even brain
 

1591
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,859
can't read that even brain
ding can't read that wearables can't

1592
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:10,869
ding can't read that wearables can't
 

1593
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:14,129
ding can't read that wearables can't
read that however as we read your body

1594
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:14,139
read that however as we read your body
 

1595
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:17,069
read that however as we read your body
state changes and we know what's going

1596
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:17,079
state changes and we know what's going
 

1597
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,290
state changes and we know what's going
on in your environment and we look at

1598
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:19,300
on in your environment and we look at
 

1599
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,200
on in your environment and we look at
patterns of those over time we can start

1600
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:22,210
patterns of those over time we can start
 

1601
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:25,589
patterns of those over time we can start
to make some inferences about what you

1602
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
to make some inferences about what you
 

1603
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,369
to make some inferences about what you
might be feeling and that is where it's

1604
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:29,379
might be feeling and that is where it's
 

1605
00:34:29,379 --> 00:34:31,680
might be feeling and that is where it's
not just the momentary feeling but it's

1606
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:31,690
not just the momentary feeling but it's
 

1607
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,649
not just the momentary feeling but it's
more your stance towards things and that

1608
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:34,659
more your stance towards things and that
 

1609
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,299
more your stance towards things and that
could actually be a little bit more

1610
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:36,309
could actually be a little bit more
 

1611
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:40,609
could actually be a little bit more
scary with certain kinds of governmental

1612
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:40,619
scary with certain kinds of governmental
 

1613
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,069
scary with certain kinds of governmental
control freak people who want to know

1614
00:34:44,069 --> 00:34:44,079
control freak people who want to know
 

1615
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,129
control freak people who want to know
more about are you on their team or are

1616
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:47,139
more about are you on their team or are
 

1617
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,020
more about are you on their team or are
you not and getting that information

1618
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,030
you not and getting that information
 

1619
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,879
you not and getting that information
through overtime so you're saying

1620
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:50,889
through overtime so you're saying
 

1621
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,409
through overtime so you're saying
there's a lot of things by looking at

1622
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:52,419
there's a lot of things by looking at
 

1623
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,869
there's a lot of things by looking at
the change over time yeah so you've done

1624
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
the change over time yeah so you've done
 

1625
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,420
the change over time yeah so you've done
a lot of exciting work both in computer

1626
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:57,430
a lot of exciting work both in computer
 

1627
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,520
a lot of exciting work both in computer
vision and physiological sense like

1628
00:34:59,520 --> 00:34:59,530
vision and physiological sense like
 

1629
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,500
vision and physiological sense like
wearables what do you think is the best

1630
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:01,510
wearables what do you think is the best
 

1631
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:05,700
wearables what do you think is the best
modality for what's the the the best

1632
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:05,710
modality for what's the the the best
 

1633
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,490
modality for what's the the the best
window into the emotional soul like is

1634
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:08,500
window into the emotional soul like is
 

1635
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,120
window into the emotional soul like is
it the face is that the voice it's a

1636
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,130
it the face is that the voice it's a
 

1637
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:13,770
it the face is that the voice it's a
body you want to know without you know

1638
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:13,780
body you want to know without you know
 

1639
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,140

everything is informative everything we

1640
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,150
everything is informative everything we
 

1641
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,299
everything is informative everything we
do is informative so for health and

1642
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:18,309
do is informative so for health and
 

1643
00:35:18,309 --> 00:35:19,859
do is informative so for health and
well-being and things like that

1644

define the wearable physio techno some

1646
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:22,569
define the wearable physio techno some

define the wearable physio techno some
measuring physiological signals is the

1648
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:25,390
measuring physiological signals is the
 

1649
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:30,210
measuring physiological signals is the
best for health based stuff so here I'm

1650
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:30,220
best for health based stuff so here I'm
 

1651
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:33,000
best for health based stuff so here I'm
gonna answer empirically with data and

1652
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:33,010
gonna answer empirically with data and
 

1653
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:34,980
gonna answer empirically with data and
studies we've been doing we've been

1654
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:34,990
studies we've been doing we've been
 

1655
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:37,890
studies we've been doing we've been
doing studies now these are currently

1656
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:37,900
doing studies now these are currently
 

1657
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,270
doing studies now these are currently
running with lots of different kinds of

00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:39,280
running with lots of different kinds of
 

1659
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,950
running with lots of different kinds of
people but where we've published data

1660
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:40,960
people but where we've published data
 

1661
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,400
people but where we've published data
and I can speak publicly to it the data

1662
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:44,410
and I can speak publicly to it the data
 

1663
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,870
and I can speak publicly to it the data
are limited right now to New England

1664
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:45,880
are limited right now to New England
 

1665
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:49,670
are limited right now to New England
college students so that's a small group

1666
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:49,680
college students so that's a small group
 

1667
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,710
college students so that's a small group
among New England college students when

1668
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
among New England college students when
 

1669
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,460
among New England college students when
they are wearing a wearable like like

1670
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:56,470
they are wearing a wearable like like
 

1671
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,260
they are wearing a wearable like like
the impact embrace here that's measuring

1672
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:58,270
the impact embrace here that's measuring
 

1673
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:00,960
the impact embrace here that's measuring
skin conductance movement temperature

1674

skin conductance movement temperature
 

1675
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:04,890
skin conductance movement temperature
and when they are using a smartphone

1676
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:04,900
and when they are using a smartphone
 

1677
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,450
and when they are using a smartphone
that is collecting their time of day of

just it right now but looking at your
 

1693
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,680
just it right now but looking at your
rhythm of behaviors over about a week

1694
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:27,690
rhythm of behaviors over about a week
 

1695
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,450
rhythm of behaviors over about a week
when we look at that we are very

1696
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:30,460
when we look at that we are very
 

1697
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,340
when we look at that we are very
accurate of forecasting tomorrow's

1698
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,350
accurate of forecasting tomorrow's
 

1699
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,470
accurate of forecasting tomorrow's
stress mood and happy sad mood and

1700
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
stress mood and happy sad mood and
 

1701
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,980
stress mood and happy sad mood and
health and when we look at which pieces

1702
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:40,990
health and when we look at which pieces
 

1703
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,310
health and when we look at which pieces
of that are most useful first of all if

1704
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
of that are most useful first of all if
 

1705
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,110
of that are most useful first of all if
you have all the pieces you get the best

1706
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:46,120
you have all the pieces you get the best
 

1707
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:50,190
you have all the pieces you get the best
results if you have only the wearable

1708
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:50,200
results if you have only the wearable
 

1709
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,000
results if you have only the wearable
you get the next best results and that's

1710
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,010
you get the next best results and that's
 

1711
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,460
you get the next best results and that's
still better than 80% accurate at

1712
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:56,470
still better than 80% accurate at
 

1713
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,300
still better than 80% accurate at
forecasting tomorrow's levels it's not

1714
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,310
forecasting tomorrow's levels it's not
 

1715
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,940
forecasting tomorrow's levels it's not
exciting because the wearable stuff with

1716
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:02,950
exciting because the wearable stuff with
 

1717
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,820
exciting because the wearable stuff with
physiological information it feels like

1718
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:05,830
physiological information it feels like
 

1719
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,460
physiological information it feels like
it violates privacy less than the

1720
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,470
it violates privacy less than the
 

1721
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,200
it violates privacy less than the
non-contact face based methods yeah it's

1722
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,210
non-contact face based methods yeah it's
 

1723
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,180
non-contact face based methods yeah it's
it's interesting I think what people

1724
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,190
it's interesting I think what people
 

1725
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,030
it's interesting I think what people
sometimes don't you know it's fine the

1726
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,040
sometimes don't you know it's fine the
 

1727
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,410
sometimes don't you know it's fine the
early days people would say oh wearing

1728
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:19,420
early days people would say oh wearing
 

1729
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,660
early days people would say oh wearing
something or giving blood is invasive

1730
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:21,670
something or giving blood is invasive
 

1731
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:24,030
something or giving blood is invasive
right whereas a camera is less invasive

1732
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,040
right whereas a camera is less invasive
 

1733
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,360
right whereas a camera is less invasive
because it's not touching you I think on

1734
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:27,370
because it's not touching you I think on
 

1735
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,460
because it's not touching you I think on
the contrary the things that are not

1736
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,470
the contrary the things that are not
 

1737
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:30,720
the contrary the things that are not
touching you or maybe the scariest

1738
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:30,730
touching you or maybe the scariest
 

1739
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,640
touching you or maybe the scariest
because you don't know when they're on

1740
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:32,650
because you don't know when they're on
 

1741
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,200
because you don't know when they're on
or off and you don't know when people

1742
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:37,210
or off and you don't know when people
 

1743
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,970
or off and you don't know when people
and you don't know who's behind it right

1744
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:38,980
and you don't know who's behind it right
 

1745
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,050
and you don't know who's behind it right
a wearable depending upon what's

1746
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:43,060
a wearable depending upon what's
 

1747
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:45,750
a wearable depending upon what's
happening to the data on it if it's just

1748
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:45,760
happening to the data on it if it's just
 

1749
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,440
happening to the data on it if it's just
stored locally or if it's streaming and

1750
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:48,450
stored locally or if it's streaming and
 

1751
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:53,100
stored locally or if it's streaming and
what it is being attached to in in a

1752
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,110
what it is being attached to in in a
 

1753
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,690
what it is being attached to in in a
sense you have the most control over it

1754
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:54,700
sense you have the most control over it
 

1755
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,390
sense you have the most control over it
because it's also very easy to just take

1756
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:57,400
because it's also very easy to just take
 

1757
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,910
because it's also very easy to just take
it off take it off right now it's not

1758
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
it off take it off right now it's not
 

1759
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,150
it off take it off right now it's not
sensing me so if I'm uncomfortable with

1760
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:03,160
sensing me so if I'm uncomfortable with
 

1761
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,360
sensing me so if I'm uncomfortable with
what it's sensing now I'm free yeah

1762
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:06,370
what it's sensing now I'm free yeah
 

1763
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,610
what it's sensing now I'm free yeah
right if I'm comfortable with what it's

1764
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:08,620
right if I'm comfortable with what it's
 

1765
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,850
right if I'm comfortable with what it's
sensing then and I happen to know

1766
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:11,860
sensing then and I happen to know
 

1767
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,080
sensing then and I happen to know
everything about this one what it's

1768
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,090
everything about this one what it's
 

1769
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,250
everything about this one what it's
doing with it so I'm quite comfortable

1770
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:14,260
doing with it so I'm quite comfortable
 

1771
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,990
doing with it so I'm quite comfortable
with it then I'm you know I have control

1772
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:19,000
with it then I'm you know I have control
 

1773
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,600
with it then I'm you know I have control
I'm comfortable control is one of the

1774
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:21,610
I'm comfortable control is one of the
 

1775
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:24,650
I'm comfortable control is one of the
biggest factors for an individual in

1776
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:24,660
biggest factors for an individual in
 

1777
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,330
biggest factors for an individual in
reducing their stress if I have control

1778
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:27,340
reducing their stress if I have control
 

1779
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,130
reducing their stress if I have control
over it if I know all there is to know

1780
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,140
over it if I know all there is to know
 

1781
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,620
over it if I know all there is to know
about it then my stress is a lot lower

1782
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:31,630
about it then my stress is a lot lower
 

1783
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,340
about it then my stress is a lot lower
and I'm making an informed choice about

1784
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,350
and I'm making an informed choice about
 

1785
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,200
and I'm making an informed choice about
whether to wear it or not or winter wear

1786
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:37,210
whether to wear it or not or winter wear
 

1787
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,580
whether to wear it or not or winter wear
it or not I wanna wear it sometimes

1788
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:38,590
it or not I wanna wear it sometimes
 

1789
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:41,010
it or not I wanna wear it sometimes
maybe not others right this is that

1790
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:41,020
maybe not others right this is that
 

1791
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,520
maybe not others right this is that
control that I'm with you that control

1792
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:43,530
control that I'm with you that control
 

1793
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:46,860
control that I'm with you that control
even if you had the ability to turn it

1794
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:46,870
even if you had the ability to turn it
 

1795
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:49,890
even if you had the ability to turn it
off yeah is a really important and we

1796
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:49,900
off yeah is a really important and we
 

1797
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,740
off yeah is a really important and we
need to maybe you know if there's

1798
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:52,750
need to maybe you know if there's
 

1799
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,630
need to maybe you know if there's
regulations maybe that's number one to

1800
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:54,640
regulations maybe that's number one to
 

1801
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,960
regulations maybe that's number one to
protect is people's ability to it's easy

1802
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:57,970
protect is people's ability to it's easy
 

1803
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:01,640
protect is people's ability to it's easy
to opt out as to opt in right so you've

1804
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:01,650
to opt out as to opt in right so you've
 

1805
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,020
to opt out as to opt in right so you've
studied a bit of neuroscience as well

1806
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,030
studied a bit of neuroscience as well
 

1807
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:08,610
studied a bit of neuroscience as well
how if looking at our own minds of the

1808
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:08,620
how if looking at our own minds of the
 

1809
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:12,180
how if looking at our own minds of the
biological stuff or the neurobiological

1810
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:12,190
biological stuff or the neurobiological
 

1811
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,670
biological stuff or the neurobiological
the neuroscience to get the signals in

1812
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:14,680
the neuroscience to get the signals in
 

1813
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,270
the neuroscience to get the signals in
our brain helped you understand the

1814
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:18,280
our brain helped you understand the
 

1815
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,800
our brain helped you understand the
problem in the approach of effective

1816
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:19,810
problem in the approach of effective
 

1817
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,830
problem in the approach of effective
computing so originally I was the

1818
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:22,840
computing so originally I was the
 

1819
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,120
computing so originally I was the
computer architect that I was building

1820
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:24,130
computer architect that I was building
 

1821
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,580
computer architect that I was building
hardware and computer designs and I

1822
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:26,590
hardware and computer designs and I
 

1823
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,900
hardware and computer designs and I
wanted to build ones that work like the

1824
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:27,910
wanted to build ones that work like the
 

1825
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:29,400
wanted to build ones that work like the
brain so I've been studying the brain as

1826
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:29,410
brain so I've been studying the brain as
 

1827
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,440
brain so I've been studying the brain as
long as I've been studying how to build

1828
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:31,450
long as I've been studying how to build
 

1829
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:34,680
long as I've been studying how to build
computers have you figured out anything

1830
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:34,690
computers have you figured out anything
 

1831
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:40,470
computers have you figured out anything
yet it's so amazing you know they used

1832
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,480
yet it's so amazing you know they used
 

1833
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,940
yet it's so amazing you know they used
to think like oh if you remove this

1834
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:41,950
to think like oh if you remove this
 

1835
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,530
to think like oh if you remove this
chunk of the brain and you find this

1836
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:43,540
chunk of the brain and you find this
 

1837
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,180
chunk of the brain and you find this
function goes away well that's the part

1838
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:45,190
function goes away well that's the part
 

1839
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,680
function goes away well that's the part
of the brain that did it and then later

1840
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:46,690
of the brain that did it and then later
 

1841
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,000
of the brain that did it and then later
they realize if you remove this other

1842
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,010
they realize if you remove this other
 

1843
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,440
they realize if you remove this other
chunk of the brain that function comes

1844
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:49,450
chunk of the brain that function comes
 

1845
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,540
chunk of the brain that function comes
back and oh no we really don't

1846
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:51,550
back and oh no we really don't
 

1847
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,420
back and oh no we really don't
understand it brains are so interesting

1848
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:54,430
understand it brains are so interesting
 

1849
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:57,480
understand it brains are so interesting
and changing all the time and able to

00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:57,490
and changing all the time and able to
 

1851
00:39:57,490 --> 00:39:59,820
and changing all the time and able to
change in ways that will probably

1852
00:39:59,820 --> 00:39:59,830
change in ways that will probably
 

1853
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,630
change in ways that will probably
continue to surprise us when we were

1854
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:03,640
continue to surprise us when we were
 

1855
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,640
continue to surprise us when we were
measuring stress you may know the story

1856
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:05,650
measuring stress you may know the story
 

1857
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,240
measuring stress you may know the story
where we found an unusual big skin

1858
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,250
where we found an unusual big skin
 

1859
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,310
where we found an unusual big skin

of our kids with autism and in trying to

1862
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,040
of our kids with autism and in trying to
 

1863
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,110
of our kids with autism and in trying to
figure out how on earth you could be

1864
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,120
figure out how on earth you could be
 

1865
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,880
figure out how on earth you could be
stressed on one wrist and not the you

1866
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:17,890
stressed on one wrist and not the you
 

1867
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:19,350
stressed on one wrist and not the you
know that like how can you get sweaty on

1868
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:19,360
know that like how can you get sweaty on
 

1869
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,390
know that like how can you get sweaty on
one wrist right when you when you get

1870
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:21,400
one wrist right when you when you get
 

1871
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,590
one wrist right when you when you get
stressed but that sympathetic

fight-or-flight response like you he
 

1875
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,740
fight-or-flight response like you he
kind of should like sweat more in some

1876
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:25,750
kind of should like sweat more in some
 

1877
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:27,360
kind of should like sweat more in some
places than others but not more on one

1878

00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:28,930
wrist than the other that didn't make
 

1881
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:32,700
wrist than the other that didn't make
any sense we learned that what had

1882
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:32,710
any sense we learned that what had
 

1883
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,770
any sense we learned that what had
actually happened was a part of his

1884
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:34,780
actually happened was a part of his
 

1885
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,050
actually happened was a part of his
brain had unusual electrical activity

1886
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:37,060
brain had unusual electrical activity
 

1887
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:40,680
brain had unusual electrical activity
and that caused an unusually large sweat

1888
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:40,690
and that caused an unusually large sweat
 

1889
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:44,090
and that caused an unusually large sweat
response on one wrist and not the other

1890
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:44,100
response on one wrist and not the other
 

1891
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,950
response on one wrist and not the other
and since then we've learned that

1892
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:45,960
and since then we've learned that
 

1893
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,770
and since then we've learned that
seizures caused this unusual electrical

1894
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:48,780
seizures caused this unusual electrical
 

1895
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,930
seizures caused this unusual electrical
activity and depending where the seizure

1896
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:50,940
activity and depending where the seizure
 

1897
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,450
activity and depending where the seizure
is if it's in one place and it's staying

1898
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:53,460
is if it's in one place and it's staying
 

1899
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,490
is if it's in one place and it's staying
there you can have a big electrical

1900
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:55,500
there you can have a big electrical
 

1901
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,870
there you can have a big electrical
response we can pick up with a wearable

at one part of the body you can also

1904
00:40:59,210 --> 00:40:59,220
at one part of the body you can also
 

1905
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,470
at one part of the body you can also
have a seizure that spreads over the

1906
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
have a seizure that spreads over the

seizure and that response spreads and we

1910
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:04,620
seizure and that response spreads and we
 

1911
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,910
seizure and that response spreads and we
can pick it up pretty much anywhere as

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,680
are also surgeons and they're going in
and they're implanting electrodes not

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,470
just to momentarily read the strange
 

1933
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:32,870
just to momentarily read the strange
patterns of brain activity that we'd

1934
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:32,880
patterns of brain activity that we'd
 

1935
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,900
patterns of brain activity that we'd
like to see return to normal but also to

1936
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:35,910
like to see return to normal but also to
 

1937
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,670
like to see return to normal but also to
read out continuously what's happening

1938
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:37,680
read out continuously what's happening
 

1939
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,870
read out continuously what's happening
in some of these deep regions of the

1940
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:38,880
in some of these deep regions of the
 

1941
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,610
in some of these deep regions of the
brain during most of life when these

1942
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:40,620
brain during most of life when these
 

1943
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,440
brain during most of life when these
patients are not seizing most of the

1944
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,450
patients are not seizing most of the
 

1945
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:43,730
patients are not seizing most of the
time they're not seizing most of the

1946
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:43,740
time they're not seizing most of the
 

1947
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:46,550
time they're not seizing most of the
time they're fine and so we are now

1948
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
time they're fine and so we are now
 

1949
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,160
time they're fine and so we are now
working on mapping those deep brain

1950
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:49,170
working on mapping those deep brain
 

1951
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,500
working on mapping those deep brain
regions that you can't even usually get

1952
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:51,510
regions that you can't even usually get
 

1953
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:55,190
regions that you can't even usually get
with EEG scalp electrodes because the

00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
with EEG scalp electrodes because the
 

1955
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,470
with EEG scalp electrodes because the

surface but interesting when some of
 

1959
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,240
surface but interesting when some of
those regions are activated we see a big

1960
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,250
those regions are activated we see a big
 

1961
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,970
those regions are activated we see a big
skin conductance response who would have

00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:04,980
skin conductance response who would have
 

1963
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,370

00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:07,380
thunk it right like nothing here but
 

1965
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,520
thunk it right like nothing here but
something here in fact right after

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:09,530
something here in fact right after
 

1967
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,300
something here in fact right after
seizures that we think are the most

1968
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:11,310
seizures that we think are the most
 

1969
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:13,670
seizures that we think are the most
dangerous ones that precede what's

00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:15,570
called pseudo sudden unexpected death in
 

1973
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,440
called pseudo sudden unexpected death in
epilepsy there's a period where the

1974
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:18,450
epilepsy there's a period where the
 

1975
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,510
epilepsy there's a period where the
brain waves go flat and it looks like

1976
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:20,520
brain waves go flat and it looks like
 

1977
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,100
brain waves go flat and it looks like
the person's brain has stopped but it

1978
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:22,110
the person's brain has stopped but it
 

1979
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,520
the person's brain has stopped but it
hasn't the activity has has gone deep

1980
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:25,530
hasn't the activity has has gone deep
 

1981
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:27,830
hasn't the activity has has gone deep
into a region that can make the cortical

1982
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:27,840
into a region that can make the cortical
 

1983
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,410
into a region that can make the cortical
activity look flat like a quick shutdown

1984
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:30,420
activity look flat like a quick shutdown
 

1985
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,370

signal here it can unfortunately cause

1986
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:34,380
signal here it can unfortunately cause
 

1987
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,740
signal here it can unfortunately cause
breathing to stop if it progresses long

1988
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:36,750
breathing to stop if it progresses long
 

1989
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,250
breathing to stop if it progresses long
enough before that happens we see a big

1990
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:40,260
enough before that happens we see a big
 

1991
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,470
enough before that happens we see a big
skin conductance response in the data

1992
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:42,480
skin conductance response in the data
 

1993
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,900
skin conductance response in the data
that we have the longer this flattening

1994
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,910
that we have the longer this flattening
 

1995
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:47,570
that we have the longer this flattening
the bigger our response here so we have

1996
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:47,580
the bigger our response here so we have
 

1997
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,400
the bigger our response here so we have
been trying to learn you know initially

1998
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:49,410
been trying to learn you know initially
 

1999
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,020
been trying to learn you know initially
like why why are we getting a big

2000
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:51,030
like why why are we getting a big
 

2001
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,370
like why why are we getting a big
response here when there's nothing here

2002
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:52,380
response here when there's nothing here
 

2003
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,650
response here when there's nothing here
well it turns out there's something much

2004
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:54,660
well it turns out there's something much
 

2005
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,810
well it turns out there's something much
deeper so we can now go inside the

2006
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:56,820
deeper so we can now go inside the
 

2007
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,630
deeper so we can now go inside the
brains

2008
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:57,640
brains
 

2009
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,450
brains
of some of these individuals fabulous

2010
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:00,460
of some of these individuals fabulous
 

2011
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:03,200
of some of these individuals fabulous
people who usually aren't seizing and

2012
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:03,210
people who usually aren't seizing and
 

2013
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,700
people who usually aren't seizing and
get this data and start to map it so

2014
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:05,710
get this data and start to map it so
 

2015
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:06,990
get this data and start to map it so
that's active research that we're doing

2016
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,000
that's active research that we're doing
 

2017
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,940
that's active research that we're doing
right now with with top medical partners

2018
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:08,950
right now with with top medical partners
 

2019
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:11,640
right now with with top medical partners
so this this wearable sensor this

2020
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:11,650
so this this wearable sensor this
 

2021
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:13,349
so this this wearable sensor this
looking skin conductance can capture

2022
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
looking skin conductance can capture
 

2023
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,519
looking skin conductance can capture
sort of the ripples of the complexity of

2024
00:43:16,519 --> 00:43:16,529
sort of the ripples of the complexity of
 

2025
00:43:16,529 --> 00:43:19,470
sort of the ripples of the complexity of
what's going on in our brain so you this

2026
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:19,480
what's going on in our brain so you this
 

2027
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:22,259
what's going on in our brain so you this
this little device you have a hope that

2028
00:43:22,259 --> 00:43:22,269
this little device you have a hope that
 

2029
00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:25,430
this little device you have a hope that
you can start to get the signal from the

2030
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
you can start to get the signal from the
 

2031
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,450
you can start to get the signal from the
from the interesting things happening in

2032
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:27,460
from the interesting things happening in
 

2033
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,130
from the interesting things happening in
the brain yeah we've already published

2034
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:29,140
the brain yeah we've already published
 

2035
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,319
the brain yeah we've already published
the strong correlations between the size

2036
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:31,329
the strong correlations between the size
 

2037
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:33,210
the strong correlations between the size
of this response and the flattening that

00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:33,220
of this response and the flattening that
 

2039
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,720
of this response and the flattening that
happens after words and unfortunately

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:36,730
happens after words and unfortunately
 

2041
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,640
happens after words and unfortunately
also in a real suit up case where the

2042
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:38,650
also in a real suit up case where the
 

2043
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,490
also in a real suit up case where the
patient died because the well we don't

know why we don't know if somebody was

00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:43,299
know why we don't know if somebody was
 

2047
00:43:43,299 --> 00:43:45,089
know why we don't know if somebody was
there it would have definitely prevented

00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:45,099
there it would have definitely prevented
 

2049
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:47,009
there it would have definitely prevented
it but we know that most students happen

2050
00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:47,019
it but we know that most students happen
 

2051
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:51,690
it but we know that most students happen
when the person's alone and in this suit

2052
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:51,700
when the person's alone and in this suit

up is an acronym su DEP and it stands

2054
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:54,910
up is an acronym su DEP and it stands
 

2055
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,019
up is an acronym su DEP and it stands
for the number two cause of years of

for the number two cause of years of

actually I'll plug my TED talk it's on

2066
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:08,079
actually I'll plug my TED talk it's on
 

2067
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:10,049
actually I'll plug my TED talk it's on
the front page of Ted right now that

2068
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:10,059
the front page of Ted right now that
 

2069
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:13,859
the front page of Ted right now that
talks about this and we hope to change

2070
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:13,869
talks about this and we hope to change
 

2071
00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:16,019
talks about this and we hope to change
that I hope everybody who's heard of

2072
00:44:16,019 --> 00:44:16,029
that I hope everybody who's heard of
 

2073
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,259
that I hope everybody who's heard of
SIDS and stroke will now hear of suit up

2074
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:19,269
SIDS and stroke will now hear of suit up
 

2075
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:20,819
SIDS and stroke will now hear of suit up
because we think in most cases it's

2076
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:20,829
because we think in most cases it's
 

2077
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:23,370
because we think in most cases it's
preventable if people take their meds

2078
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:23,380
preventable if people take their meds
 

2079
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,170
preventable if people take their meds
and aren't alone when they have a

2080
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:25,180
and aren't alone when they have a
 

2081
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,539
and aren't alone when they have a
seizure not guaranteed to be preventable

2082
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:27,549
seizure not guaranteed to be preventable
 

2083
00:44:27,549 --> 00:44:30,150
seizure not guaranteed to be preventable
there are some exceptions but we think

2084
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
there are some exceptions but we think
 

2085
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,039
there are some exceptions but we think
most cases probably are so you have this

2086
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:32,049
most cases probably are so you have this
 

2087
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:34,890
most cases probably are so you have this

right for epilepsy management that's the

2090
00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:39,759
right for epilepsy management that's the
 

2091
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:42,930
right for epilepsy management that's the
one that's FDA approved yes and which is

2092
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:42,940
one that's FDA approved yes and which is
 

2093
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,009
one that's FDA approved yes and which is
kind of weird weird yes that's okay it

2094
00:44:47,009 --> 00:44:47,019
kind of weird weird yes that's okay it
 

2095
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,749
kind of weird weird yes that's okay it
essentially means it's approved for

2096
00:44:48,749 --> 00:44:48,759
essentially means it's approved for
 

2097
00:44:48,759 --> 00:44:51,450
essentially means it's approved for
marketing got it just a side note how

2098
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:51,460
marketing got it just a side note how
 

2099
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,549
marketing got it just a side note how
difficult is that to do it's essentially

2100
00:44:53,549 --> 00:44:53,559
difficult is that to do it's essentially
 

2101
00:44:53,559 --> 00:44:55,769
difficult is that to do it's essentially
getting FDA it's organized computer

2102
00:44:55,769 --> 00:44:55,779
getting FDA it's organized computer
 

2103
00:44:55,779 --> 00:44:57,630
getting FDA it's organized computer
science technology it's so agonizing

2104
00:44:57,630 --> 00:44:57,640
science technology it's so agonizing
 

2105
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,349
science technology it's so agonizing
it's much harder than publishing

2106
00:45:00,349 --> 00:45:00,359
it's much harder than publishing
 

2107
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:03,390
it's much harder than publishing
multiple papers and top medical journals

2108
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:03,400
multiple papers and top medical journals
 

2109
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,089
multiple papers and top medical journals
yeah we published peer-reviewed top

2110
00:45:06,089 --> 00:45:06,099
yeah we published peer-reviewed top
 

2111
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:08,640
yeah we published peer-reviewed top
medical journal Neurology best results

2112
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:08,650
medical journal Neurology best results
 

2113
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,170
medical journal Neurology best results
and that's not good enough for the FDA

2114
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:10,180
and that's not good enough for the FDA
 

2115
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,740
and that's not good enough for the FDA
is that system

2116
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:11,750
is that system
 

2117
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,870
is that system
so if we look at the peer review of

2118
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:13,880
so if we look at the peer review of
 

2119
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,849
so if we look at the peer review of
medical journals there's flaws the

2120
00:45:15,849 --> 00:45:15,859
medical journals there's flaws the
 

2121
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:18,810
medical journals there's flaws the
strengths is the FDA approval process

2122
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:18,820
strengths is the FDA approval process
 

2123
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,070
strengths is the FDA approval process
how does it compare to the peer review

2124
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:21,080
how does it compare to the peer review
 

2125
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,260
how does it compare to the peer review
process is it have a strengthened I

2126
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:23,270
process is it have a strengthened I
 

2127
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:24,940
process is it have a strengthened I
think we peer review over FDA any day

2128
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:24,950
think we peer review over FDA any day
 

2129
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:27,099
think we peer review over FDA any day
but is that a good thing is that a good

2130
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:27,109
but is that a good thing is that a good
 

2131
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:29,410
but is that a good thing is that a good
thing for FDA are you saying does it

2132
00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:29,420
thing for FDA are you saying does it
 

2133
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,359
thing for FDA are you saying does it
stop some amazing technology from

2134
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:31,369
stop some amazing technology from
 

2135
00:45:31,369 --> 00:45:34,030
stop some amazing technology from
getting through yeah it does the FDA

2136
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:34,040
getting through yeah it does the FDA
 

2137
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,250
getting through yeah it does the FDA
performs a very important good role in

2138
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:36,260
performs a very important good role in
 

2139
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:39,099
performs a very important good role in
keeping people safe they keep things

2140
00:45:39,099 --> 00:45:39,109
keeping people safe they keep things
 

2141
00:45:39,109 --> 00:45:41,440
keeping people safe they keep things
they put you through tons of safety

2142
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:41,450
they put you through tons of safety
 

2143
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:43,000
they put you through tons of safety
testing and that's wonderful and that's

2144
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:43,010
testing and that's wonderful and that's
 

2145
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:45,520
testing and that's wonderful and that's
great I'm all in favor of the safety

2146
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:45,530
great I'm all in favor of the safety
 

2147
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:49,720
great I'm all in favor of the safety
testing sometimes they put you through

2148
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:49,730
testing sometimes they put you through
 

2149
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,820
testing sometimes they put you through
additional testing that they don't have

2150
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:51,830
additional testing that they don't have
 

2151
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:53,710
additional testing that they don't have
to explain why they put you through it

2152
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:53,720
to explain why they put you through it
 

2153
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,839
to explain why they put you through it
and you don't understand why you're

2154
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:55,849
and you don't understand why you're
 

2155
00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:57,430
and you don't understand why you're
going through it and it doesn't make

2156
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:57,440
going through it and it doesn't make
 

2157
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,609
going through it and it doesn't make
sense and that's very frustrating and

2158
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:00,619
sense and that's very frustrating and
 

2159
00:46:00,619 --> 00:46:03,900
sense and that's very frustrating and
maybe they have really good reasons and

2160
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:03,910
maybe they have really good reasons and
 

2161
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:07,450
maybe they have really good reasons and
they just would it would do people a

2162
00:46:07,450 --> 00:46:07,460
they just would it would do people a
 

2163
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,720
they just would it would do people a
service to articulate those reasons be

2164
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:10,730
service to articulate those reasons be
 

2165
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:13,599
service to articulate those reasons be
more transparent so as part of them

2166
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:13,609
more transparent so as part of them
 

2167
00:46:13,609 --> 00:46:16,329
more transparent so as part of them
Pataca you have sensors so what kind of

2168
00:46:16,329 --> 00:46:16,339
Pataca you have sensors so what kind of
 

2169
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:18,430
Pataca you have sensors so what kind of
problems can we crack what kind of

2170
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:18,440
problems can we crack what kind of
 

2171
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:25,599
problems can we crack what kind of
things from seizures to autism - I think

2172
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:25,609
things from seizures to autism - I think

yeah can you go to jail for turning off

00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:22,240
scientific method assuming that we can
 

2543
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,450
scientific method assuming that we can
uncover the mysteries of this world by

uncover the mysteries of this world by
 

2545
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,370
uncover the mysteries of this world by
the mechanisms of measurement that we

2546
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:27,380
the mechanisms of measurement that we
 

2547
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:31,030
the mechanisms of measurement that we
currently have but we easily forget that

2548
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040
currently have but we easily forget that
 

2549
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,270
currently have but we easily forget that
we've made this assumption so what do

2550
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:34,280
we've made this assumption so what do
 

2551
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,130
we've made this assumption so what do
you think we missed out on by making

2552
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:36,140
you think we missed out on by making
 

2553
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:39,930
you think we missed out on by making
that assumption that hmm it's fine to

2554
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:39,940
that assumption that hmm it's fine to
 

2555
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,270
that assumption that hmm it's fine to
limit the scientific method to things we

2556
00:54:43,270 --> 00:54:43,280
limit the scientific method to things we
 

2557
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,550
limit the scientific method to things we
can measure and reason about and

2558
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:45,560
can measure and reason about and
 

2559
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,200
can measure and reason about and
reproduce that's fine I think we have to

2560
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:50,210
reproduce that's fine I think we have to
 

2561
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,240
reproduce that's fine I think we have to
recognize that sometimes we scientists

2562
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:52,250
recognize that sometimes we scientists
 

2563
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:53,950
recognize that sometimes we scientists
also believe in things that happen

2564
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:53,960
also believe in things that happen
 

2565
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,380
also believe in things that happen
historically you know like I believe the

2566
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:56,390
historically you know like I believe the
 

2567
00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,670
historically you know like I believe the
Holocaust happened I can't prove events

2568
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:00,680
Holocaust happened I can't prove events
 

2569
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,940
Holocaust happened I can't prove events
from past history scientifically you

2570
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:03,950
from past history scientifically you
 

2571
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:05,710
from past history scientifically you
prove them with historical evidence

2572
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:05,720
prove them with historical evidence
 

2573
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:07,510
prove them with historical evidence
right it was the impact they had on

2574
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:07,520
right it was the impact they had on
 

2575
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,420
right it was the impact they had on
people with eyewitness testimony and and

2576
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:10,430
people with eyewitness testimony and and
 

2577
00:55:10,430 --> 00:55:13,859
people with eyewitness testimony and and
things like that so a good thinker

2578
00:55:13,859 --> 00:55:13,869
things like that so a good thinker
 

2579
00:55:13,869 --> 00:55:16,510
things like that so a good thinker
recognizes that science is one of many

2580
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:16,520
recognizes that science is one of many
 

2581
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:20,500
recognizes that science is one of many
ways to get knowledge it's not the only

2582
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:20,510
ways to get knowledge it's not the only
 

2583
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:23,020
ways to get knowledge it's not the only
way and there there's been some really

2584
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,030
way and there there's been some really
 

2585
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:25,450
way and there there's been some really
bad philosophy and bad thinking recently

2586
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:25,460
bad philosophy and bad thinking recently
 

2587
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:28,270
bad philosophy and bad thinking recently
you can call it scientism where people

2588
00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:28,280
you can call it scientism where people
 

2589
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,309
you can call it scientism where people
say science is the only way to get to

2590
00:55:30,309 --> 00:55:30,319
say science is the only way to get to
 

2591
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:33,370
say science is the only way to get to
truth and it's not it just isn't there

2592
00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:33,380
truth and it's not it just isn't there
 

2593
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,099
truth and it's not it just isn't there
are other ways that work also like

2594
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:36,109
are other ways that work also like
 

2595
00:55:36,109 --> 00:55:38,710
are other ways that work also like
knowledge of love with someone you don't

2596
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:38,720
knowledge of love with someone you don't
 

2597
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,050
knowledge of love with someone you don't
you don't prove your love through

2598
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:41,060
you don't prove your love through
 

2599
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:47,140
you don't prove your love through
science right so history philosophy love

2600
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:47,150
science right so history philosophy love
 

2601
00:55:47,150 --> 00:55:50,710
science right so history philosophy love
a lot of other things in life show us

2602
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:50,720
a lot of other things in life show us
 

2603
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,309
a lot of other things in life show us
that there's more ways to gain knowledge

2604
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:54,319
that there's more ways to gain knowledge
 

2605
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:56,980
that there's more ways to gain knowledge
and truth if you're willing to believe

2606
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:56,990
and truth if you're willing to believe
 

2607
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:58,690
and truth if you're willing to believe
there is such a thing and I believe

2608
00:55:58,690 --> 00:55:58,700
there is such a thing and I believe
 

2609
00:55:58,700 --> 00:55:59,880
there is such a thing and I believe
there is

2610
00:55:59,880 --> 00:55:59,890
there is
 

2611
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,640
there is
than science I do I am a scientist

2612
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:02,650
than science I do I am a scientist
 

2613
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:05,070
than science I do I am a scientist
however and in my science I do limit my

2614
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:05,080
however and in my science I do limit my
 

2615
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,470
however and in my science I do limit my
science to the things that the

2616
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:07,480
science to the things that the
 

2617
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,990
science to the things that the
scientific method can can do but I

2618
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,000
scientific method can can do but I
 

2619
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,720
scientific method can can do but I
recognize that it's myopic to say that

2620
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:12,730
recognize that it's myopic to say that
 

2621
00:56:12,730 --> 00:56:14,610
recognize that it's myopic to say that
that's all there is right there's just

2622
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:14,620
that's all there is right there's just
 

2623
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,680
that's all there is right there's just
like you listed there's all the why

2624
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:16,690
like you listed there's all the why
 

2625
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:19,650
like you listed there's all the why
questions and really we know for being

2626
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:19,660
questions and really we know for being
 

2627
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,420
questions and really we know for being
honest with ourselves the percent of

2628
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:21,430
honest with ourselves the percent of
 

2629
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:25,440
honest with ourselves the percent of
what we really know is is basically zero

2630
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:25,450
what we really know is is basically zero
 

2631
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,650
what we really know is is basically zero
relative to the full mystery of this

2632
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:27,660
relative to the full mystery of this

2636
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,050
I have a finite amount of knowledge
 

2637
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,030
I have a finite amount of knowledge
which I do so you said that you believe

2638
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:36,040
which I do so you said that you believe
 

2639
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,350
which I do so you said that you believe
in truth so let me ask that old question

2640
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:40,360
in truth so let me ask that old question
 

2641
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,150
in truth so let me ask that old question
what do you think this thing is all

2642
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
what do you think this thing is all
 

2643
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:42,480
what do you think this thing is all
about

2644
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:42,490
about
 

2645
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,960
about
life on Earth life the universe and

2646
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:45,970
life on Earth life the universe and
 

2647

the exact same number for our house we
 

2655
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,650
the exact same number for our house we
got to pick it there's a reason we

2656
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:58,660
got to pick it there's a reason we
 

2657
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,680
got to pick it there's a reason we
picked 42 yeah so is it just 40 tours

could read proverbs and find from end s
 

2683

scientifically proven but when you read
 

2687
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,970

and when you when you encounter those
 

2707
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,670

truths there's something in you that
 

2709

truths there's something in you that
sings and knows that there is more than

it's inspiring right we want to do more

2720
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:18,940
it's inspiring right we want to do more

none of the squashes my desire to do
 

2723
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:22,860
none of the squashes my desire to do
science or to get knowledge through

2724
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:22,870
science or to get knowledge through
 

2725
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:25,500
science or to get knowledge through
science I'm not I'm not dissing the

2726
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:25,510
science I'm not I'm not dissing the
 

2727
00:58:25,510 --> 00:58:28,380
science I'm not I'm not dissing the
science at all I grow even more in awe

2728
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,390
science at all I grow even more in awe
 

2729
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:30,240
science at all I grow even more in awe
of what the science can do because I'm

2730
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,250
of what the science can do because I'm
 

2731
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:32,250
of what the science can do because I'm
more in awe of all there is we don't

2732
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:32,260
more in awe of all there is we don't
 

2733
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,580
more in awe of all there is we don't
know and really at the heart of science

2734
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:35,590
know and really at the heart of science
 

2735
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:37,680
know and really at the heart of science
you have to have a belief that there's

2736
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:37,690
you have to have a belief that there's
 

2737
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,900
you have to have a belief that there's
truth that there's something greater to

2738
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:39,910
truth that there's something greater to
 

2739
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:43,260
truth that there's something greater to
be discovered and some scientists may

2740
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:43,270
be discovered and some scientists may
 

2741
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,000
be discovered and some scientists may
not want to use the face word but it's

2742
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:45,010
not want to use the face word but it's
 

2743
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:48,090
not want to use the face word but it's
faith that drives us to do science it's

2744
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:48,100
faith that drives us to do science it's
 

2745
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,460
faith that drives us to do science it's
faith that there is truth that there's

2746
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:50,470
faith that there is truth that there's
 

2747
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,930
faith that there is truth that there's
something to know that we don't know

2748
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:51,940
something to know that we don't know
 

2749
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,690
something to know that we don't know
that it's worth knowing that it's worth

2750
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:54,700
that it's worth knowing that it's worth
 

2751
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:58,320
that it's worth knowing that it's worth
working hard and that there is meaning

2752
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:58,330
working hard and that there is meaning
 

2753
00:58:58,330 --> 00:58:59,790
working hard and that there is meaning
that there is such a thing as meaning

2754
00:58:59,790 --> 00:58:59,800
that there is such a thing as meaning
 

2755
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,380
that there is such a thing as meaning
which by the way science can't prove

2756
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,390
which by the way science can't prove
 

2757
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:04,050
which by the way science can't prove
either we have to kind of start with

2758
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:04,060
either we have to kind of start with
 

2759
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:05,490
either we have to kind of start with
some assumptions that there's things

2760
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:05,500
some assumptions that there's things
 

2761
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,680
some assumptions that there's things
like truth and meaning and these are

2762
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:07,690
like truth and meaning and these are
 

2763
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:10,740
like truth and meaning and these are
really questions philosophers own right

2764
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:10,750
really questions philosophers own right
 

2765
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:12,540
really questions philosophers own right
this is their space of philosophers and

2766
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:12,550
this is their space of philosophers and
 

2767
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:15,510
this is their space of philosophers and
theologians at some level so these are

2768
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:15,520
theologians at some level so these are
 

2769
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,320
theologians at some level so these are
things science you know if we when

2770
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:19,330
things science you know if we when
 

2771
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,930
things science you know if we when
people claim that science will tell you

2772
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:21,940
people claim that science will tell you
 

2773
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,700
people claim that science will tell you
all truth that's there's a name for that

2774
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:23,710
all truth that's there's a name for that
 

2775
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:25,770
all truth that's there's a name for that
it's it's its own kind of face it's

2776
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:25,780
it's it's its own kind of face it's
 

2777
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:29,190
it's it's its own kind of face it's
scientism and it's very myopic yeah

2778
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:29,200
scientism and it's very myopic yeah
 

2779
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:31,290
scientism and it's very myopic yeah
there's a much bigger world out there to

2780
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:31,300
there's a much bigger world out there to
 

2781
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,930
there's a much bigger world out there to
be explored in in ways that science may

2782
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:33,940
be explored in in ways that science may
 

2783
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:36,870
be explored in in ways that science may
not at least for now allow us to explore

2784
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:36,880
not at least for now allow us to explore
 

2785
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,300
not at least for now allow us to explore
yeah and there's meaning and purpose and

2786
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:39,310
yeah and there's meaning and purpose and

awesome things that make it all
 

2791
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:44,520
awesome things that make it all
worthwhile too

2792
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:44,530
worthwhile too
 

2793
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,830
worthwhile too
I don't think there's a better way to
