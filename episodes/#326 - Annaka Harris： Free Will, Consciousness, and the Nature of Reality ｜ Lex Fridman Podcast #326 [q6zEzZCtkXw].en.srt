when we use the term free will we're

when we use the term free will we're
talking about this feeling that

in your book conscious you described
evidence that Free Will is an illusion

48
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:57,600
evidence that Free Will is an illusion
 

49
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,569
evidence that Free Will is an illusion
and that Consciousness is used to

50
00:00:59,569 --> 00:00:59,579
and that Consciousness is used to
 

51
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,910
and that Consciousness is used to
construct this illusion and convince

52
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:01,920
construct this illusion and convince
 

53
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,950
construct this illusion and convince
ourselves that we are in fact deciding

54
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:03,960
ourselves that we are in fact deciding
 

55
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,990
ourselves that we are in fact deciding
our actions uh can you can you explain

56
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,000
our actions uh can you can you explain
 

57
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,090
our actions uh can you can you explain
this I think this is chapter three first

58
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:08,100
this I think this is chapter three first
 

59
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,010
this I think this is chapter three first
of all I I really think it's important

60
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,020
of all I I really think it's important
 

61
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,469
of all I I really think it's important
to make a distinction between Free Will

62
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:12,479
to make a distinction between Free Will
 

63
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,450
to make a distinction between Free Will
and conscious will and we'll get into

64
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:14,460
and conscious will and we'll get into
 

65
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,210
and conscious will and we'll get into
that in a moment so free will in terms

66
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:17,220
that in a moment so free will in terms
 

67
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,910
that in a moment so free will in terms
of our brain as a system in nature

68
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:19,920
of our brain as a system in nature
 

69
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,210
of our brain as a system in nature
making complex decisions and doing all

70
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:23,220
making complex decisions and doing all
 

71
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,850
making complex decisions and doing all
the complex processing it does there is

72
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:25,860
the complex processing it does there is
 

73
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,429
the complex processing it does there is
a decision-making process in nature that

74
00:01:28,429 --> 00:01:28,439
a decision-making process in nature that
 

75
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,969
a decision-making process in nature that
our brains undergo that we can call Free

76
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:31,979
our brains undergo that we can call Free
 

77
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,950
our brains undergo that we can call Free
Will that's that's fine to use that

78
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:33,960
Will that's that's fine to use that
 

79
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,109
Will that's that's fine to use that
shorthand for that although once once we

80
00:01:36,109 --> 00:01:36,119
shorthand for that although once once we
 

81
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,810
shorthand for that although once once we
get into the details I I might

82
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:38,820
get into the details I I might
 

83
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,370
get into the details I I might
um convince you that it's not so free

84
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:40,380
um convince you that it's not so free
 

85
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,590
um convince you that it's not so free
but that the decision-making process is

86
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:42,600
but that the decision-making process is
 

87
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,770
but that the decision-making process is
a process in nature the feeling our

88
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:45,780
a process in nature the feeling our
 

89
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,990
a process in nature the feeling our
conscious experience of feeling like

90
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:48,000
conscious experience of feeling like
 

91
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,469
conscious experience of feeling like
Consciousness is the thing that is

92
00:01:51,469 --> 00:01:51,479
Consciousness is the thing that is
 

93
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:53,710
Consciousness is the thing that is
driving the behavior

94
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:53,720
driving the behavior
 

95
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,289
driving the behavior
that is I would say in most cases an

96
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:57,299
that is I would say in most cases an
 

97
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:00,649
that is I would say in most cases an
illusion and usually when we talk about

98
00:02:00,649 --> 00:02:00,659
illusion and usually when we talk about
 

99
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,630
illusion and usually when we talk about
Free Will that's the thing we're talking

100
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:02,640
Free Will that's the thing we're talking
 

101
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,249
Free Will that's the thing we're talking
about I mean sometimes it's in

102
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,259
about I mean sometimes it's in
 

103
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:05,630
about I mean sometimes it's in
conjunction with the decision-making

104
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,640
conjunction with the decision-making
 

105
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,089
conjunction with the decision-making
process but for the most part when we

106
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:08,099
process but for the most part when we
 

107
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:09,770
process but for the most part when we
use the term free will we're talking

108
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,780
use the term free will we're talking
 

109
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,110
use the term free will we're talking
about this feeling that Consciousness

110
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,120
about this feeling that Consciousness
 

111
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,210
about this feeling that Consciousness
that that we have a self that this

112
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:14,220
that that we have a self that this
 

113
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,190
that that we have a self that this
there's this concrete thing that's

114
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,200
there's this concrete thing that's
 

115
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,570
there's this concrete thing that's
separate from

separate from

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,910

um in large part if not in its entirety

124
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:28,920
um in large part if not in its entirety
 

125
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,430
um in large part if not in its entirety
and illusion so conscious will is an

126
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
and illusion so conscious will is an
 

127
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,290
and illusion so conscious will is an
illusion and then we can try to Free

128
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,300
illusion and then we can try to Free
 

129
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,050
illusion and then we can try to Free
Will I would say is a good shorthand for

130
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:36,060
Will I would say is a good shorthand for
 

131
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,970
Will I would say is a good shorthand for
a process in nature which is a

132
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:37,980
a process in nature which is a
 

133
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,130
a process in nature which is a
decision-making process of of the brain

134
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:40,140
decision-making process of of the brain
 

135
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,290
decision-making process of of the brain
but decisions are still being made so

136
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:42,300
but decisions are still being made so
 

137
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,470
but decisions are still being made so
there's a

138
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:44,480
there's a
 

139
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,809
there's a
uh if you ran the universe over again

140
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:47,819
uh if you ran the universe over again
 

141
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:49,250
uh if you ran the universe over again
hmm

142
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:49,260
hmm
 

143
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,550
hmm
is there would it turn out the same way

144
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,560
is there would it turn out the same way
 

145
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,530
is there would it turn out the same way
I mean maybe I'm trying to sneak up to

146
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:54,540
I mean maybe I'm trying to sneak up to
 

147
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,309
I mean maybe I'm trying to sneak up to
like

148
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:55,319
like
 

149
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:57,710
like
what does it mean to make a decision in

150
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,720
what does it mean to make a decision in
 

151
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,589
what does it mean to make a decision in
a way that's almost uh that means

152
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:00,599
a way that's almost uh that means
 

153
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,509
a way that's almost uh that means
something so right so this is where our

154
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,519
something so right so this is where our
 

155
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:04,430
something so right so this is where our
intuitions get challenged I've been

156
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:04,440
intuitions get challenged I've been
 

157
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,350
intuitions get challenged I've been
thinking about some new examples for

158
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:06,360
thinking about some new examples for
 

159
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,750
thinking about some new examples for
this just because I talk about it a lot

160
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:08,760
this just because I talk about it a lot
 

161
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,089
this just because I talk about it a lot
and and the truth is most of the things

162
00:03:11,089 --> 00:03:11,099
and and the truth is most of the things
 

163
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,770
and and the truth is most of the things
I write about and talk about and think

164
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:12,780
I write about and talk about and think
 

165
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,990
I write about and talk about and think
about are so counter-intuitive I mean

166
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,000
about are so counter-intuitive I mean
 

167
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,270
about are so counter-intuitive I mean
that that's really what my game is is

168
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
that that's really what my game is is
 

169
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,250
that that's really what my game is is
breaking intuitions shaking up

170
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:19,260
breaking intuitions shaking up
 

171
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,229
breaking intuitions shaking up
intuitions in order to get a deeper

172
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:21,239
intuitions in order to get a deeper
 

173
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,869
intuitions in order to get a deeper
understanding of reality

174
00:03:23,869 --> 00:03:23,879
understanding of reality
 

175
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:26,690
understanding of reality
I'm often even though I've thought about

176
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:26,700
I'm often even though I've thought about
 

177
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,610
I'm often even though I've thought about
this for 20 years and think about it all

178
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:28,620
this for 20 years and think about it all
 

179
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,050
this for 20 years and think about it all
the time it's an obsession of mine

180
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,060
the time it's an obsession of mine
 

181
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,949
the time it's an obsession of mine
really I have to get back into that mind

182
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
really I have to get back into that mind
 

183
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,570
really I have to get back into that mind
frame

184
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:35,580
frame
 

185
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,190
frame
to be able to think clearly about it

186
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:37,200
to be able to think clearly about it
 

187
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,930
to be able to think clearly about it
because it is so counter-intuitive how

188
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:38,940
because it is so counter-intuitive how
 

189
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,250
because it is so counter-intuitive how
long does that take

190
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,260
long does that take
 

191
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,229
long does that take
how hard is that depends on if there are

192
00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:42,239
how hard is that depends on if there are
 

193
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,089
how hard is that depends on if there are
kids around or if I'm alone or if I've

194
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:44,099
kids around or if I'm alone or if I've
 

195
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:46,190
kids around or if I'm alone or if I've
been meditating but what I was going to

196
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,200
been meditating but what I was going to
 

197
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,750
been meditating but what I was going to
say actually I felt like we need to just

198
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:47,760
say actually I felt like we need to just
 

199
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,910
say actually I felt like we need to just
take one step back

200
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:49,920
take one step back
 

201
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,830
take one step back
and talk a little bit just because I

202
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:51,840
and talk a little bit just because I
 

203
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,809
and talk a little bit just because I
think the the importance of shaking up

204
00:03:53,809 --> 00:03:53,819
think the the importance of shaking up
 

205
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:56,509
think the the importance of shaking up
intuitions for scientific and

206
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:56,519
intuitions for scientific and
 

207
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:00,350
intuitions for scientific and
advancement is such an important piece

208
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:00,360
advancement is such an important piece
 

209
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,930
advancement is such an important piece
of the scientific process

210
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:02,940
of the scientific process
 

211
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,910
of the scientific process
um and I think we've reached a point in

212
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:04,920
um and I think we've reached a point in
 

213
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,369
um and I think we've reached a point in
Consciousness studies where

214
00:04:07,369 --> 00:04:07,379
Consciousness studies where
 

215
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,270
Consciousness studies where
it's very difficult to move forward and

216
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
it's very difficult to move forward and
 

217
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,550
it's very difficult to move forward and
usually that's a sign that we need to

218
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:13,560
usually that's a sign that we need to
 

219
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,710
usually that's a sign that we need to
start shaking up our intuition so you

220
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:15,720
start shaking up our intuition so you
 

221
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,569
start shaking up our intuition so you
know throughout history the the huge

222
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:17,579
know throughout history the the huge
 

223
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,129
know throughout history the the huge
breakthroughs the things that have

224
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:19,139
breakthroughs the things that have
 

225
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,409
breakthroughs the things that have
really shifted our view of the universe

226
00:04:21,409 --> 00:04:21,419
really shifted our view of the universe
 

227
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:23,570
really shifted our view of the universe
and and our place in the universe and

228
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:23,580
and and our place in the universe and
 

229
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,730
and and our place in the universe and
all of that those almost always if not

230
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:25,740
all of that those almost always if not
 

231
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,870
all of that those almost always if not
always require that we at the very least

232
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:29,880
always require that we at the very least
 

233
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,330
always require that we at the very least
shift our intuitions

234
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:32,340
shift our intuitions
 

235
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,189
shift our intuitions
um update our intuitions but many of

236
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:34,199
um update our intuitions but many of
 

237
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,629
um update our intuitions but many of
them we just have to let go of

238
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:35,639
them we just have to let go of
 

239
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,430
them we just have to let go of
intuitions that are feeding us false

240
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
intuitions that are feeding us false
 

241
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,409
intuitions that are feeding us false
information about the way the world

242
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:39,419
information about the way the world
 

243
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:41,210
information about the way the world
works well the weirdest thing here is

244
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,220
works well the weirdest thing here is
 

245
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,570
works well the weirdest thing here is
that here we're looking at our own mind

246
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:44,580
that here we're looking at our own mind
 

247
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,810
that here we're looking at our own mind
yeah you have to uh let go of your

248
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:47,820
yeah you have to uh let go of your
 

249
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,969
yeah you have to uh let go of your
intuitions

250
00:04:49,969 --> 00:04:49,979
intuitions
 

251
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,030
intuitions
about your own intuitions yeah right

252
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,040
about your own intuitions yeah right
 

253
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,730
about your own intuitions yeah right
exactly it's very meta and makes it hard

254
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:55,740
exactly it's very meta and makes it hard
 

255
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,590
exactly it's very meta and makes it hard
and it's part of the reason why

256
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:57,600
and it's part of the reason why
 

257
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,409
and it's part of the reason why
doing interviews for me feels so

258
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:00,419
doing interviews for me feels so
 

259
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,330
doing interviews for me feels so
difficult aside from the fact that I

260
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,340
difficult aside from the fact that I
 

261
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,670
difficult aside from the fact that I
just have social anxiety in general

262
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:04,680
just have social anxiety in general
 

263
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,230
just have social anxiety in general
what's good because I took mushrooms

264
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,240
what's good because I took mushrooms
 

265
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,710
what's good because I took mushrooms
just before you started so it worked

266
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:08,720
just before you started so it worked
 

267
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,450
just before you started so it worked
we're on this journey together let's go

268
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:11,460
we're on this journey together let's go
 

269
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,909
we're on this journey together let's go
uh so what what where do we take a step

270
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:13,919
uh so what what where do we take a step
 

271
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,590
uh so what what where do we take a step
backwards well I was I was going to say

272
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:15,600
backwards well I was I was going to say
 

273
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,330
backwards well I was I was going to say
I mean this leads into the point I was

274
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:17,340
I mean this leads into the point I was
 

275
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,070
I mean this leads into the point I was
going to make but what I was going to

276
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:19,080
going to make but what I was going to
 

277
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,650
going to make but what I was going to
say is I mean also just for me I feel

278
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:21,660
say is I mean also just for me I feel
 

279
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,689
say is I mean also just for me I feel
like I

280
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:23,699
like I
 

281
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:26,450
like I
I'm not as good at speaking as I am at

282
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:26,460
I'm not as good at speaking as I am at
 

283
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,670
I'm not as good at speaking as I am at
writing that I'm clear in my writing and

284
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:28,680
writing that I'm clear in my writing and
 

285
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,710
writing that I'm clear in my writing and
because these topics are so difficult to

286
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,720
because these topics are so difficult to
 

287
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,930
because these topics are so difficult to
get our minds around

288
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:32,940
get our minds around
 

289
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,050
get our minds around
um it's hard to kind of

290
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:36,060
um it's hard to kind of
 

291
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,170
um it's hard to kind of
get to any real conclusion in real time

292
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,180
get to any real conclusion in real time
 

293
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,330
get to any real conclusion in real time
it's actually how I started writing my

294
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,340
it's actually how I started writing my
 

295
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,350
it's actually how I started writing my
book

296
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360
book
 

297
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,270
book
um was just writing for myself I decided

298
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,280
um was just writing for myself I decided
 

299
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,249
um was just writing for myself I decided
that I needed to spend some time writing

300
00:05:46,249 --> 00:05:46,259
that I needed to spend some time writing
 

301
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,990
that I needed to spend some time writing
down all of my thoughts in order to get

302
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
down all of my thoughts in order to get
 

303
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,170
down all of my thoughts in order to get
clear about how I think about them so

304
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,180
clear about how I think about them so
 

305
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,730
clear about how I think about them so
you write down a sentence and you think

306
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:52,740
you write down a sentence and you think
 

307
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,150
you write down a sentence and you think
he's in the in the silence

308
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,160
he's in the in the silence
 

309
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,249
he's in the in the silence
paragraphs and yeah and you just and

310
00:05:58,249 --> 00:05:58,259
paragraphs and yeah and you just and
 

311
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:59,930
paragraphs and yeah and you just and
then I see if that makes sense and then

312
00:05:59,930 --> 00:05:59,940
then I see if that makes sense and then
 

313
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,430
then I see if that makes sense and then
I check it with my intuitions which is

314
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:01,440
I check it with my intuitions which is
 

315
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,110
I check it with my intuitions which is
really the scientific process and I

316
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,120
really the scientific process and I
 

317
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,749
really the scientific process and I
really in many ways I feel like I'm a

318
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:05,759
really in many ways I feel like I'm a
 

319
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,110
really in many ways I feel like I'm a
physicist at heart all of my inquiry all

320
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,120
physicist at heart all of my inquiry all
 

321
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,330
physicist at heart all of my inquiry all
of my career everything I'm interested

322
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,340
of my career everything I'm interested
 

323
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,450
of my career everything I'm interested
in actually going back to being a child

324
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,460
in actually going back to being a child
 

325
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,290
in actually going back to being a child
it's just deep curiosity about how the

326
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,300
it's just deep curiosity about how the
 

327
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,110
it's just deep curiosity about how the
world Works what this place is what it's

328
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,120
world Works what this place is what it's
 

329
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,189
world Works what this place is what it's
made of

330
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:22,199
made of
 

331
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,409
made of
how we got here

332
00:06:24,409 --> 00:06:24,419
how we got here
 

333
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,510
how we got here
um just being amazed at the fact that

334
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:26,520
um just being amazed at the fact that
 

335
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,309
um just being amazed at the fact that
I'm having an experience over here and

336
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
I'm having an experience over here and
 

337
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,170
I'm having an experience over here and
you're having one over there and we're

338
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:30,180
you're having one over there and we're
 

339
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,570
you're having one over there and we're
in this moment of time and

340
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:32,580
in this moment of time and
 

341
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,309
in this moment of time and
you know what does that all mean my

342
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
you know what does that all mean my
 

343
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,230
you know what does that all mean my
interest in Consciousness really came

344
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
interest in Consciousness really came
 

345
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,809
interest in Consciousness really came
out of originally an interest in physics

346
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:38,819
out of originally an interest in physics
 

347
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:40,490
out of originally an interest in physics
and I guess that the two were always

348
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:40,500
and I guess that the two were always
 

349
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,110
and I guess that the two were always
side by side and I didn't really connect

350
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,120
side by side and I didn't really connect
 

351
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,749
side by side and I didn't really connect
them until I was older but

352
00:06:44,749 --> 00:06:44,759
them until I was older but
 

353
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,570
them until I was older but
um I've always been really interested in

354
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:47,580
um I've always been really interested in
 

355
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,230
um I've always been really interested in
just understanding the nature of reality

356
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:51,240
just understanding the nature of reality
 

357
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,529
just understanding the nature of reality
before I even had language to describe

358
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:54,539
before I even had language to describe
 

359
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,770
before I even had language to describe
you talked about sort of laying down and

360
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:57,780
you talked about sort of laying down and
 

361
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,710
you talked about sort of laying down and
looking up at the stars and yeah sort of

362
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:00,720
looking up at the stars and yeah sort of
 

363
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,689
looking up at the stars and yeah sort of
trying to let go of the intuition that

364
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:02,699
trying to let go of the intuition that
 

365
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,629
trying to let go of the intuition that
there's a ground below us yeah which is

366
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:05,639
there's a ground below us yeah which is
 

367
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,070
there's a ground below us yeah which is
a really interesting exercise and

368
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,080
a really interesting exercise and
 

369
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,930
a really interesting exercise and
there's many exercises of this sort you

370
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:08,940
there's many exercises of this sort you
 

371
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,730
there's many exercises of this sort you
can do but that's a really good one well

372
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:10,740
can do but that's a really good one well
 

373
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,670
can do but that's a really good one well
and I think you know scientists and

374
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
and I think you know scientists and
 

375
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,469
and I think you know scientists and
children who are who will become

376
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:15,479
children who are who will become
 

377
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,150
children who are who will become
scientists or just kind of scientists at

378
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:17,160
scientists or just kind of scientists at
 

379
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,570
scientists or just kind of scientists at
heart really enjoy that feeling of

380
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:20,580
heart really enjoy that feeling of
 

381
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:23,270
heart really enjoy that feeling of
breaking through their intuitions and I

382
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,280
breaking through their intuitions and I
 

383
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,350
breaking through their intuitions and I
remember the first time it happened

384
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:24,360
remember the first time it happened
 

385
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,050
remember the first time it happened
actually I was

386
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:27,060
actually I was
 

387
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,589
actually I was
um playing with marbles and you know

388
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:30,599
um playing with marbles and you know
 

389
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,270
um playing with marbles and you know
marbles have all these different shapes

390
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,280
marbles have all these different shapes
 

391
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,070
marbles have all these different shapes
each one is unique and they're all the

392
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:34,080
each one is unique and they're all the
 

393
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,770
each one is unique and they're all the
it looks like there's liquid inside them

394
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:36,780
it looks like there's liquid inside them
 

395
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:40,010
it looks like there's liquid inside them
and I remember asking my father how they

396
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:40,020
and I remember asking my father how they
 

397
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,110
and I remember asking my father how they
got the liquid inside the glass ball and

398
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:42,120
got the liquid inside the glass ball and
 

399
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,730
got the liquid inside the glass ball and
he said actually it's solid all the way

400
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:43,740
he said actually it's solid all the way
 

401
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,370
he said actually it's solid all the way
through It's All Glass

402
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:45,380
through It's All Glass
 

403
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,809
through It's All Glass
and I had such a hard time imagine it

404
00:07:47,809 --> 00:07:47,819
and I had such a hard time imagine it
 

405
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:49,010
and I had such a hard time imagine it
just didn't seem right to me I was very

406
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,020
just didn't seem right to me I was very
 

407
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,589
just didn't seem right to me I was very
young when I but he he's a complicated

408
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:51,599
young when I but he he's a complicated
 

409
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,629
young when I but he he's a complicated
person but he was wonderful in this way

410
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:53,639
person but he was wonderful in this way
 

411
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:56,570
person but he was wonderful in this way
and that he would kind of entertain my

412
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:56,580
and that he would kind of entertain my
 

413
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,490
and that he would kind of entertain my
curiosity and so he's he said let's

414
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
curiosity and so he's he said let's
 

415
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,070
curiosity and so he's he said let's
let's open them up and he got a towel

416
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,080
let's open them up and he got a towel
 

417
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,510
let's open them up and he got a towel
and we put the marbles on the towel and

418
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
and we put the marbles on the towel and
 

419
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,249
and we put the marbles on the towel and
got a hammer and he smashed them all and

420
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:04,259
got a hammer and he smashed them all and
 

421
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,670
got a hammer and he smashed them all and
lo and behold it was all glass and I

422
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:07,680
lo and behold it was all glass and I
 

423
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,469
lo and behold it was all glass and I
remember it's like the first time I had

424
00:08:09,469 --> 00:08:09,479
remember it's like the first time I had
 

425
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,890
remember it's like the first time I had
that feeling of

426
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:11,900
that feeling of
 

427
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,629
that feeling of
realizing wow the truth was so different

428
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
realizing wow the truth was so different
 

429
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,409
realizing wow the truth was so different
from what I expected and I like that

430
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:18,419
from what I expected and I like that
 

431
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,029
from what I expected and I like that
feeling and of course we need to be able

432
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:20,039
feeling and of course we need to be able
 

433
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,670
feeling and of course we need to be able
to do that to understand that the Earth

434
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,680
to do that to understand that the Earth
 

435
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,890
to do that to understand that the Earth
is flat to understand the germ theory of

436
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:24,900
is flat to understand the germ theory of
 

437
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,950
is flat to understand the germ theory of
disease to understand long processes in

438
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:27,960
disease to understand long processes in
 

439
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,050
disease to understand long processes in
nature like Evolution I mean we just can

440
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:30,060
nature like Evolution I mean we just can
 

441
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,570
nature like Evolution I mean we just can
never really Intuit that we share genes

442
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:32,580
never really Intuit that we share genes
 

443
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,269
never really Intuit that we share genes
with ants did you just say the Earth is

444
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
with ants did you just say the Earth is
 

445
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,490
with ants did you just say the Earth is
flat I mean the Earth is not flat did I

446
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:37,500
flat I mean the Earth is not flat did I
 

447
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,649
flat I mean the Earth is not flat did I
say that yeah this is great but I

448
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:39,659
say that yeah this is great but I
 

449
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,149
say that yeah this is great but I
actually like to think about see this is

450
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:41,159
actually like to think about see this is
 

451
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,550
actually like to think about see this is
why I need to write and not speak well I

452
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:43,560
why I need to write and not speak well I
 

453
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,410
why I need to write and not speak well I
actually really like uh you know

454
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:45,420
actually really like uh you know
 

455
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,150
actually really like uh you know
conspiracy theories and so on I really

456
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:47,160
conspiracy theories and so on I really
 

457
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,310
conspiracy theories and so on I really
like flat Earth uh people that believe

458
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:49,320
like flat Earth uh people that believe
 

459
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,050
like flat Earth uh people that believe
the Earth is flat or yeah not believe

460
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,060
the Earth is flat or yeah not believe
 

461
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,269
the Earth is flat or yeah not believe
but argue for the Earth is flat I well

462
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
but argue for the Earth is flat I well
 

463
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,710
but argue for the Earth is flat I well
it's interesting because you can see I

464
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
it's interesting because you can see I
 

465
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,269
it's interesting because you can see I
mean the intuition is so strong I just

466
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:56,279
mean the intuition is so strong I just
 

467
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:59,090
mean the intuition is so strong I just
said it the thing I love about folks who

468
00:08:59,090 --> 00:08:59,100
said it the thing I love about folks who
 

469
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,370
said it the thing I love about folks who
argue for Flat Earth is they are

470
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,380
argue for Flat Earth is they are
 

471
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,650
argue for Flat Earth is they are
thinking

472
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:02,660
thinking
 

473
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,570
thinking
deeply they're questioning actually what

474
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580
deeply they're questioning actually what
 

475
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,509
deeply they're questioning actually what
has now become intuition are it's it's

476
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:08,519
has now become intuition are it's it's
 

477
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,250
has now become intuition are it's it's
become the mainstream narrative that the

478
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:10,260
become the mainstream narrative that the
 

479
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,230
become the mainstream narrative that the
Earth is round where people actually

480
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
Earth is round where people actually
 

481
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,050
Earth is round where people actually
don't

482
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:15,060
don't
 

483
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,410
don't
you know yeah don't think actually how

484
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,420
you know yeah don't think actually how
 

485
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,970
you know yeah don't think actually how
crazy it is that the Earth is round

486
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:19,980
crazy it is that the Earth is round
 

487
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,030
crazy it is that the Earth is round
right we're in a ball yeah yeah and like

488
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
right we're in a ball yeah yeah and like
 

489
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,470
right we're in a ball yeah yeah and like
that's exactly what you're doing you're

490
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:24,480
that's exactly what you're doing you're
 

491
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,290
that's exactly what you're doing you're
looking out at the space it's really

492
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:27,300
looking out at the space it's really
 

493
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,509
looking out at the space it's really
humbling because I think the basic

494
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:29,519
humbling because I think the basic
 

495
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,070
humbling because I think the basic
intuition when you're walking around the

496
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:31,080
intuition when you're walking around the
 

497
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,910
intuition when you're walking around the
ground you kind of there's a underlying

498
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:34,920
ground you kind of there's a underlying
 

499
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,430
ground you kind of there's a underlying
belief that Earth is the center of the

500
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:37,440
belief that Earth is the center of the
 

501
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,350
belief that Earth is the center of the
universe there's a kind of feeling yeah

502
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:39,360
universe there's a kind of feeling yeah
 

503
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,110
universe there's a kind of feeling yeah
like this is the only world that exists

504
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,120
like this is the only world that exists
 

505
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,230
like this is the only world that exists
and you kind of know that there's a huge

506
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:45,240
and you kind of know that there's a huge
 

507
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,430
and you kind of know that there's a huge
Universe out there but you don't really

508
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:46,440
Universe out there but you don't really
 

509
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,350
Universe out there but you don't really
load that information in right I think

510
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:48,360
load that information in right I think
 

511
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,230
load that information in right I think
right flat earthers are really

512
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:50,240
right flat earthers are really
 

513
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,670
right flat earthers are really
contending with those idea with those

514
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:52,680
contending with those idea with those
 

515
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,710
contending with those idea with those
big Ideas yeah no and I think I mean the

516
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
big Ideas yeah no and I think I mean the
 

517
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,710
big Ideas yeah no and I think I mean the
truth is that when those observations

518
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:57,720
truth is that when those observations
 

519
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,449
truth is that when those observations
were first made when the celestial

520
00:09:59,449 --> 00:09:59,459
were first made when the celestial
 

521
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,550
were first made when the celestial
observations were made that revealed

522
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:01,560
observations were made that revealed
 

523
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,250
observations were made that revealed
this fact to us I can't remember how

524
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,260
this fact to us I can't remember how
 

525
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,870
this fact to us I can't remember how
long it took but I think it was close to

526
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:05,880
long it took but I think it was close to
 

527
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,790
long it took but I think it was close to
100 years before

528
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:07,800
100 years before
 

529
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,090
100 years before
it was actually accepted as common

530
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,100
it was actually accepted as common
 

531
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,949
it was actually accepted as common
knowledge that we're no longer the

532
00:10:12,949 --> 00:10:12,959
knowledge that we're no longer the
 

533
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,690
knowledge that we're no longer the
center of the universe or of course we

534
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:14,700
center of the universe or of course we
 

535
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,210
center of the universe or of course we
never were but and and that's true

536
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:17,220
never were but and and that's true
 

537
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,150
never were but and and that's true
almost every time we have a breakthrough

538
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,160
almost every time we have a breakthrough
 

539
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,730
almost every time we have a breakthrough
like that that challenges our intuitions

540
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:22,740
like that that challenges our intuitions
 

541
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,790
like that that challenges our intuitions
there's usually a period of time

542
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:25,800
there's usually a period of time
 

543
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,090
there's usually a period of time
um where we have to and and this is an

544
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:29,100
um where we have to and and this is an
 

545
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,170
um where we have to and and this is an
important part of the process because

546
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:30,180
important part of the process because
 

547
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,210
important part of the process because
often our intuitions give us good

548
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,220
often our intuitions give us good
 

549
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,329
often our intuitions give us good
information and so when the science goes

550
00:10:35,329 --> 00:10:35,339
information and so when the science goes
 

551
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:37,070
information and so when the science goes
against when our scientific observations

552
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,080
against when our scientific observations
 

553
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,769
against when our scientific observations
go against our intuitions it's important

554
00:10:39,769 --> 00:10:39,779
go against our intuitions it's important
 

555
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:42,230
go against our intuitions it's important
for us to

556
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
for us to
 

557
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,990
for us to
let that in and to see you know which

558
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,000
let that in and to see you know which
 

559
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,030
let that in and to see you know which
side is going to win and once it's clear

560
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,040
side is going to win and once it's clear
 

561
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,610
side is going to win and once it's clear
that the evidence is winning

562
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:49,620
that the evidence is winning
 

563
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,870
that the evidence is winning
um then there's this period of time

564
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:50,880
um then there's this period of time
 

565
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,730
um then there's this period of time
where we have to Grapple with our

566
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:52,740
where we have to Grapple with our
 

567
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,790
where we have to Grapple with our
intuitions and shift the way we frame

568
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:55,800
intuitions and shift the way we frame
 

569
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,370
intuitions and shift the way we frame
our world view and go through that

570
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:58,380
our world view and go through that
 

571
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,130
our world view and go through that
process but free will Free Will is a

572
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,140
process but free will Free Will is a
 

573
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,829
process but free will Free Will is a
hard one so it's a hard one so here we

574
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
hard one so it's a hard one so here we
 

575
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,350
hard one so it's a hard one so here we
are still you know in Consciousness

576
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:06,360
are still you know in Consciousness
 

577
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,290
are still you know in Consciousness
studies pretty stuck at least in terms

578
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:09,300
studies pretty stuck at least in terms
 

579
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,829
studies pretty stuck at least in terms
of the neuroscience and so that's why I

580
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:12,839
of the neuroscience and so that's why I
 

581
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,269
of the neuroscience and so that's why I
started thinking more deeply about that

582
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:14,279
started thinking more deeply about that
 

583
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,190
started thinking more deeply about that
that's why a lot of scientists right now

584
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
that's why a lot of scientists right now
 

585
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,690
that's why a lot of scientists right now
are actually interested in studying

586
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:17,700
are actually interested in studying
 

587
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,190
are actually interested in studying
Consciousness

588
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
Consciousness
 

589
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,410
Consciousness
um where it was very taboo before and so

590
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:21,420
um where it was very taboo before and so
 

591
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,210
um where it was very taboo before and so
we're at this really interesting turning

592
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:23,220
we're at this really interesting turning
 

593
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,970
we're at this really interesting turning
point and and it's wonderful but I it

594
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:25,980
point and and it's wonderful but I it
 

595
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,090
point and and it's wonderful but I it
will require that we shake up our

596
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,100
will require that we shake up our
 

597
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,550
will require that we shake up our
intuitions a bit and reframe some things

598
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:31,560
intuitions a bit and reframe some things
 

599
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,430
intuitions a bit and reframe some things
and look at what the Neuroscience is

600
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:34,440
and look at what the Neuroscience is
 

601
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,769
and look at what the Neuroscience is
telling us and there are a lot of

602
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:36,779
telling us and there are a lot of
 

603
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,930
telling us and there are a lot of
questions we have more questions than

604
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:38,940
questions we have more questions than
 

605
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:42,170
questions we have more questions than
answers but I think it's time I think

606
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,180
answers but I think it's time I think
 

607
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,150
answers but I think it's time I think
we're going to make progress in

608
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:44,160
we're going to make progress in
 

609
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,610
we're going to make progress in
Consciousness studies we need to start

610
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:46,620
Consciousness studies we need to start
 

611
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,509
Consciousness studies we need to start
really looking at the Illusions and

612
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:50,519
really looking at the Illusions and
 

613
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,370
really looking at the Illusions and
false intuitions that are getting in our

614
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,380
false intuitions that are getting in our
 

615
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,110
false intuitions that are getting in our
way do you think studying the brain can

616
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:54,120
way do you think studying the brain can
 

617
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,150
way do you think studying the brain can
give us clues about free like some of

618
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
give us clues about free like some of
 

619
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,190
give us clues about free like some of
these absolutely I think it already has

620
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:58,200
these absolutely I think it already has
 

621
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,769
these absolutely I think it already has
and I think many facts that have come

622
00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:00,779
and I think many facts that have come
 

623
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:04,190
and I think many facts that have come
out of Neuroscience are still barely

624
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:04,200
out of Neuroscience are still barely
 

625
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,110
out of Neuroscience are still barely
seeping into the culture I mean they're

626
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:06,120
seeping into the culture I mean they're
 

627
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,970
seeping into the culture I mean they're
we're I think this is going to be a long

628
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:07,980
we're I think this is going to be a long
 

629
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,250
we're I think this is going to be a long
process so so part of my work is really

630
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:10,260
process so so part of my work is really
 

631
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,769
process so so part of my work is really
just looking at areas where we already

632
00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:12,779
just looking at areas where we already
 

633
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:15,590
just looking at areas where we already
know some of our intuitions are wrong

634
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
know some of our intuitions are wrong
 

635
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,389
know some of our intuitions are wrong
and

636
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:17,399
and
 

637
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,190
and
starting to accept them and starting to

638
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,200
starting to accept them and starting to
 

639
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,329
starting to accept them and starting to
let them in and starting to ask

640
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:20,339
let them in and starting to ask
 

641
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,310
let them in and starting to ask
questions about what does this mean then

642
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
questions about what does this mean then
 

643
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,430
questions about what does this mean then
about the nature of Consciousness let's

644
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:25,440
about the nature of Consciousness let's
 

645
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,829
about the nature of Consciousness let's
try to actually get into this at this

646
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
try to actually get into this at this
 

647
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,090
try to actually get into this at this
question of Free Will and conscious will

648
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,100
question of Free Will and conscious will
 

649
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,230
question of Free Will and conscious will
I I have my intuitions here are I mean

650
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:33,240
I I have my intuitions here are I mean
 

651
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,710
I I have my intuitions here are I mean
I'm a human being yeah it's it's really

652
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm a human being yeah it's it's really
 

653
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,509
I'm a human being yeah it's it's really
I mean I approached it from two aspects

654
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:38,519
I mean I approached it from two aspects
 

655
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:41,090
I mean I approached it from two aspects
from one is a human being and two from a

656
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:41,100
from one is a human being and two from a
 

657
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,129
from one is a human being and two from a
robotics perspective right right and I

658
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:43,139
robotics perspective right right and I
 

659
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:45,650
robotics perspective right right and I
wonder how big the gap between the two

660
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:45,660
wonder how big the gap between the two
 

661
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,449
wonder how big the gap between the two
is

662
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:47,459
is
 

663
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,490
is
um and that's that's a useful from an

664
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:49,500
um and that's that's a useful from an
 

665
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,750
um and that's that's a useful from an
engineering perspective is another

666
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:50,760
engineering perspective is another
 

667
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,750
engineering perspective is another
perspective that's useful and helpful to

668
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:53,760
perspective that's useful and helpful to
 

669
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,389
perspective that's useful and helpful to
take on this it's like are we really so

670
00:12:56,389 --> 00:12:56,399
take on this it's like are we really so
 

671
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,090
take on this it's like are we really so
different you and I the robot and and

672
00:12:59,090 --> 00:12:59,100
different you and I the robot and and
 

673
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,790
different you and I the robot and and
the human uh you'd like to believe so

674
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
the human uh you'd like to believe so
 

675
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,910
the human uh you'd like to believe so
but you don't exactly see where the

676
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:04,920
but you don't exactly see where the
 

677
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,129
but you don't exactly see where the
differences Research into Ai and just

678
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:07,139
differences Research into Ai and just
 

679
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:09,050
differences Research into Ai and just
the fact that it's entered our

680
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,060
the fact that it's entered our
 

681
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,509
the fact that it's entered our
Consciousness at the level of of stories

682
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
Consciousness at the level of of stories
 

683
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,850
Consciousness at the level of of stories
and film and and all of these questions

684
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:13,860
and film and and all of these questions
 

685
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,250
and film and and all of these questions
that it's raising

686
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:16,260
that it's raising
 

687
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:20,389
that it's raising
um is facing us with that it's almost

688
00:13:20,389 --> 00:13:20,399
um is facing us with that it's almost
 

689
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,730
um is facing us with that it's almost
like the zombie experiment experiment is

690
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:22,740
like the zombie experiment experiment is
 

691
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,530
like the zombie experiment experiment is
coming to life for us you know we're

692
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:24,540
coming to life for us you know we're
 

693
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,990
coming to life for us you know we're
we're more and more looking at

694
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,000
we're more and more looking at
 

695
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,670
we're more and more looking at
human-like

696
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:28,680
human-like
 

697
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,850
human-like
systems and wondering is there an

698
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:31,860
systems and wondering is there an
 

699
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,710
systems and wondering is there an
experience in there and how can we

700
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:33,720
experience in there and how can we
 

701
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,210
experience in there and how can we
figure that out

702
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,220
figure that out
 

703
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,889
figure that out
um when you were talking about your

704
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:36,899
um when you were talking about your
 

705
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,990
um when you were talking about your
experience of looking at robots it

706
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,000
experience of looking at robots it
 

707
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,629
experience of looking at robots it
reminds me of how I for many years have

708
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:41,639
reminds me of how I for many years have
 

709
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:43,790
reminds me of how I for many years have
been looking at plants

710
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:43,800
been looking at plants
 

711
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,350
been looking at plants
um because the plant behavior and

712
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:45,360
um because the plant behavior and
 

713
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,030
um because the plant behavior and
actually this is the example maybe we'll

714
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,040
actually this is the example maybe we'll
 

715
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,889
actually this is the example maybe we'll
just try it out it may not work this is

716
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:48,899
just try it out it may not work this is
 

717
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:50,690
just try it out it may not work this is
an example I was thinking of recently

718
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:50,700
an example I was thinking of recently
 

719
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,810
an example I was thinking of recently
because I was reading back on the work

720
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:53,820
because I was reading back on the work
 

721
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,509
because I was reading back on the work
of Mark Jaffe who did this research with

722
00:13:56,509 --> 00:13:56,519
of Mark Jaffe who did this research with
 

723
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,090
of Mark Jaffe who did this research with
P10 rules I'm sure he did many other

724
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,100
P10 rules I'm sure he did many other
 

725
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,590
P10 rules I'm sure he did many other
plant studies but this is the one I was

726
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:00,600
plant studies but this is the one I was
 

727
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,690
plant studies but this is the one I was
reading about and I'm hoping this

728
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:02,700
reading about and I'm hoping this
 

729
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,730
reading about and I'm hoping this
analogy I'll just set it up I'm hoping

730
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:04,740
analogy I'll just set it up I'm hoping
 

731
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,530
analogy I'll just set it up I'm hoping
that this analogy will be something that

732
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:06,540
that this analogy will be something that
 

733
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,090
that this analogy will be something that
we can keep coming back to as we move

734
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:08,100
we can keep coming back to as we move
 

735
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,670
we can keep coming back to as we move
forward because we you know as we shake

736
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
forward because we you know as we shake
 

737
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,290
forward because we you know as we shake
up our intuitions and get confused and

738
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:12,300
up our intuitions and get confused and
 

739
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,550
up our intuitions and get confused and
then our in we come back to our

740
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:13,560
then our in we come back to our
 

741
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,050
then our in we come back to our
intuitions and say no that just can't be

742
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:15,060
intuitions and say no that just can't be
 

743
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,790
intuitions and say no that just can't be
I think this analogy might might be

744
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
I think this analogy might might be
 

745
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,410
I think this analogy might might be
helpful but what kind of plant was he

746
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:18,420
helpful but what kind of plant was he
 

747
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,230
helpful but what kind of plant was he
working on uh P tendrils so p a p plant

748
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:21,240
working on uh P tendrils so p a p plant
 

749
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,150
working on uh P tendrils so p a p plant
has these tendrils you can you can

750
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,160
has these tendrils you can you can
 

751
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,769
has these tendrils you can you can
picture them they they

752
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:24,779
picture them they they
 

753
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:26,870
picture them they they
um coil

754
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:26,880
um coil
 

755
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,790
um coil
so

756
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:28,800
so
 

757
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,350
so
I don't I don't know what year this

758
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:30,360
I don't I don't know what year this
 

759
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,990
I don't I don't know what year this
research was done I'm I'm guessing in

760
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,000
research was done I'm I'm guessing in
 

761
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,050
research was done I'm I'm guessing in
the 80s but you know some but P10 just

762
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:36,060
the 80s but you know some but P10 just
 

763
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,970
the 80s but you know some but P10 just
have been around long before that yes of

764
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:37,980
have been around long before that yes of
 

765
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:44,569
have been around long before that yes of
course

766
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:44,579

 

767
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:45,949

right

768
00:14:45,949 --> 00:14:45,959
right
 

769
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:49,910
right
P tendrils as a system

770
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
P tendrils as a system
 

771
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,650
P tendrils as a system
generally there are a few more things

772
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:51,660
generally there are a few more things
 

773
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,569
generally there are a few more things
they can do but generally they can

774
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:53,579
they can do but generally they can
 

775
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,030
they can do but generally they can
behave in two ways they can grow in a

776
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,040
behave in two ways they can grow in a
 

777
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,009
behave in two ways they can grow in a
straight line slowly

778
00:14:58,009 --> 00:14:58,019
straight line slowly
 

779
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:01,730
straight line slowly
or they can grow in this coil form more

780
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:01,740
or they can grow in this coil form more
 

781
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,689
or they can grow in this coil form more
quickly

782
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:02,699
quickly
 

783
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:05,990
quickly
and what happens is when they are

784
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
and what happens is when they are
 

785
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,829
and what happens is when they are
growing in a straight Manner and they

786
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:08,839
growing in a straight Manner and they
 

787
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:11,689
growing in a straight Manner and they
encounter a branch or a pole or

788
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:11,699
encounter a branch or a pole or
 

789
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,129
encounter a branch or a pole or
something else that it can wrap itself

790
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:13,139
something else that it can wrap itself
 

791
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,129
something else that it can wrap itself
around to gain more stability when it

792
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:16,139
around to gain more stability when it
 

793
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,750
around to gain more stability when it
senses a branch there that gives it the

794
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:17,760
senses a branch there that gives it the
 

795
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,910
senses a branch there that gives it the
cue to start growing at a more rapid

796
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:19,920
cue to start growing at a more rapid
 

797
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,889
cue to start growing at a more rapid
pace and to start coiling instead of

798
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:21,899
pace and to start coiling instead of
 

799
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,230
pace and to start coiling instead of
growing straight so it has these two

800
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,240
growing straight so it has these two
 

801
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,150
growing straight so it has these two
behaviors as a system it's capable of

802
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:26,160
behaviors as a system it's capable of
 

803
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,769
behaviors as a system it's capable of
growing straight and it's capable of

804
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:27,779
growing straight and it's capable of
 

805
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:29,329
growing straight and it's capable of
coiling

806
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:29,339
coiling
 

807
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,370
coiling
one interesting thing actually I'll just

808
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:31,380
one interesting thing actually I'll just
 

809
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,990
one interesting thing actually I'll just
add this it's not totally relevant but

810
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:33,000
add this it's not totally relevant but
 

811
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,790
add this it's not totally relevant but
one interesting thing is

812
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:34,800
one interesting thing is
 

813
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,030
one interesting thing is
um Mark jaffe's work so he um cut a P10

814
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,040
um Mark jaffe's work so he um cut a P10
 

815
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,829
um Mark jaffe's work so he um cut a P10
drill he was curious to see if it could

816
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:39,839
drill he was curious to see if it could
 

817
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:41,629
drill he was curious to see if it could
do this on its own separate from the

818
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:41,639
do this on its own separate from the
 

819
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:44,030
do this on its own separate from the
rest of the plant so he cut a pitendril

820
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:44,040
rest of the plant so he cut a pitendril
 

821
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,710
rest of the plant so he cut a pitendril
off the plant

822
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:45,720
off the plant
 

823
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,329
off the plant
um if you keep it in a moist warm

824
00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:47,339
um if you keep it in a moist warm
 

825
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,550
um if you keep it in a moist warm
environment it will continue to to

826
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:49,560
environment it will continue to to
 

827
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,189
environment it will continue to to
behave in these ways so it will continue

828
00:15:51,189 --> 00:15:51,199
behave in these ways so it will continue
 

829
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,930
behave in these ways so it will continue
to coil if he he noticed that if he

830
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:53,940
to coil if he he noticed that if he
 

831
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,970
to coil if he he noticed that if he
touched one end of it if he rubbed one

832
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:55,980
touched one end of it if he rubbed one
 

833
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,009
touched one end of it if he rubbed one
side of it that gave it enough of a cue

834
00:15:58,009 --> 00:15:58,019
side of it that gave it enough of a cue
 

835
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,710
side of it that gave it enough of a cue
that it would start to coil and then he

836
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:00,720
that it would start to coil and then he
 

837
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,710
that it would start to coil and then he
noticed that it needed light to perform

838
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:03,720
noticed that it needed light to perform
 

839
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,769
noticed that it needed light to perform
this action so in the dark when he

840
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:06,779
this action so in the dark when he
 

841
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:09,290
this action so in the dark when he
rubbed the the edge of the tendril it

842
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:09,300
rubbed the the edge of the tendril it
 

843
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,910
rubbed the the edge of the tendril it
did not coil

844
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:10,920
did not coil
 

845
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,189
did not coil
um in the light it would and then he

846
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:13,199
um in the light it would and then he
 

847
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,530
um in the light it would and then he
recognized this further fact which was

848
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:15,540
recognized this further fact which was
 

849
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,290
recognized this further fact which was
that the P tendril that he rubbed in the

850
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:18,300
that the P tendril that he rubbed in the
 

851
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,810
that the P tendril that he rubbed in the
dark that was still straight if he

852
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:20,820
dark that was still straight if he
 

853
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,310
dark that was still straight if he
brought it out into the light and this

854
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
brought it out into the light and this
 

855
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,230
brought it out into the light and this
could be hours later it would start to

856
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,240
could be hours later it would start to
 

857
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,030
could be hours later it would start to
coil it has a primitive form of memory

858
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,040
coil it has a primitive form of memory
 

859
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,030
coil it has a primitive form of memory
where it's it's has the sensation and

860
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
where it's it's has the sensation and
 

861
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,430
where it's it's has the sensation and
then it holds on to that information and

862
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:34,440
then it holds on to that information and
 

863
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,710
then it holds on to that information and
as soon as there's light it acts on that

864
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:36,720
as soon as there's light it acts on that
 

865
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,749
as soon as there's light it acts on that
but also in the kind of distributed

866
00:16:38,749 --> 00:16:38,759
but also in the kind of distributed
 

867
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,850
but also in the kind of distributed
intelligence because you can separate it

868
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:40,860
intelligence because you can separate it
 

869
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,990
intelligence because you can separate it
from the main

870
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,000
from the main
 

871
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,210
from the main
right in the main part right like if you

872
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,220
right in the main part right like if you
 

873
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,889
right in the main part right like if you
chop off a human arm it's not gonna

874
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:45,899
chop off a human arm it's not gonna
 

875
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,990
chop off a human arm it's not gonna
right keep

876
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:48,000
right keep
 

877
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,030
right keep
growing even if you keep it in a moist

878
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,040
growing even if you keep it in a moist
 

879
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,069
growing even if you keep it in a moist
warm environment it's not going to reach

880
00:16:52,069 --> 00:16:52,079
warm environment it's not going to reach
 

881
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,509
warm environment it's not going to reach
out for the cup of coffee when you come

882
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:53,519
out for the cup of coffee when you come
 

883
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,129
out for the cup of coffee when you come
in with Starbucks maybe maybe in the

884
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:55,139
in with Starbucks maybe maybe in the
 

885
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,410
in with Starbucks maybe maybe in the
correct environment maybe we just

886
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:57,420
correct environment maybe we just
 

887
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,790
correct environment maybe we just
haven't found the environment but anyway

888
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
haven't found the environment but anyway
 

889
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,650
haven't found the environment but anyway
that's pretty amazing so that's the

890
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,660
that's pretty amazing so that's the
 

891
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,810
that's pretty amazing so that's the
separate fact but anyway so so if you

892
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:02,820
separate fact but anyway so so if you
 

893
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,449
separate fact but anyway so so if you
just use the analogy of a p tendril and

894
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:05,459
just use the analogy of a p tendril and
 

895
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,429
just use the analogy of a p tendril and
if you imagine which is something I like

896
00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:07,439
if you imagine which is something I like
 

897
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,710
if you imagine which is something I like
to do a lot if you imagine

898
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:09,720
to do a lot if you imagine
 

899
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,750
to do a lot if you imagine
um this plant has some kind of conscious

900
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:11,760
um this plant has some kind of conscious
 

901
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,130
um this plant has some kind of conscious
experience of course it doesn't have

902
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,140
experience of course it doesn't have
 

903
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,530
experience of course it doesn't have
complex thought it doesn't have anything

904
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,540
complex thought it doesn't have anything
 

905
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,750
complex thought it doesn't have anything
like a human experience but if it were

906
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:17,760
like a human experience but if it were
 

907
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,990
like a human experience but if it were
possible for a plant to have some felt

908
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
possible for a plant to have some felt
 

909
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,490
possible for a plant to have some felt
experience you can imagine that when it

910
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:25,500
experience you can imagine that when it
 

911
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,309
experience you can imagine that when it
comes into contact with a branch and

912
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:28,319
comes into contact with a branch and
 

913
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,530
comes into contact with a branch and
starts to coil that that feeling could

914
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:30,540
starts to coil that that feeling could
 

915
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,370
starts to coil that that feeling could
be one of deciding to do that or that it

916
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:34,380
be one of deciding to do that or that it
 

917
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,470
be one of deciding to do that or that it
feels good to do that or kind of wanting

918
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
feels good to do that or kind of wanting
 

919
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,510
feels good to do that or kind of wanting
I mean it's that's too complex that's

920
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:38,520
I mean it's that's too complex that's
 

921
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,610
I mean it's that's too complex that's
that's anthropomorphizing but there's a

922
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:40,620
that's anthropomorphizing but there's a
 

923
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,830
that's anthropomorphizing but there's a
way in which you could imagine this P

924
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:42,840
way in which you could imagine this P
 

925
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,270
way in which you could imagine this P
tendril under those circumstances

926
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:44,280
tendril under those circumstances
 

927
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,250
tendril under those circumstances
suddenly wants to start coiling so

928
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,260
suddenly wants to start coiling so
 

929
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,350
suddenly wants to start coiling so
you're saying you try to meditate potato

930
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:48,360
you're saying you try to meditate potato
 

931
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,010
you're saying you try to meditate potato
what it's like to be a p tendril a plant

932
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,020
what it's like to be a p tendril a plant
 

933
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,590
what it's like to be a p tendril a plant
like that's what's required here

934
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:54,600
like that's what's required here
 

935
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,150
like that's what's required here
it's like you have to empathize with a

936
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,160
it's like you have to empathize with a
 

937
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,070
it's like you have to empathize with a
plant or with another organism that's

938
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,080
plant or with another organism that's
 

939
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,570
plant or with another organism that's
not human yeah and you don't actually

940
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,580
not human yeah and you don't actually
 

941
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,430
not human yeah and you don't actually
need that for this analogy that have the

942
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:01,440
need that for this analogy that have the
 

943
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,930
need that for this analogy that have the
larger analogy that I'm getting at but I

944
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:02,940
larger analogy that I'm getting at but I
 

945
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,250
larger analogy that I'm getting at but I
think that's an interesting piece to

946
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:04,260
think that's an interesting piece to
 

947
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,990
think that's an interesting piece to
keep in mind that you could imagine that

948
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
keep in mind that you could imagine that
 

949
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,570
keep in mind that you could imagine that
in nature if there's a conscious

950
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:08,580
in nature if there's a conscious
 

951
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,850
in nature if there's a conscious
experience associated with a p tendril

952
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860
experience associated with a p tendril
 

953
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,890
experience associated with a p tendril
that at that moment what that feels like

954
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:12,900
that at that moment what that feels like
 

955
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,930
that at that moment what that feels like
is

956
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:14,940
is
 

957
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,390
is
a want to start moving in a different

958
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:17,400
a want to start moving in a different
 

959
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,370
a want to start moving in a different
way so you you want to imagine that

960
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
way so you you want to imagine that
 

961
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:21,710
way so you you want to imagine that
without anthropomorphizing so without

962
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:21,720
without anthropomorphizing so without
 

963
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,930
without anthropomorphizing so without
projecting The Human Experience but

964
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:23,940
projecting The Human Experience but
 

965
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,150
projecting The Human Experience but
rather sort of humbling yourself that

966
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,160
rather sort of humbling yourself that
 

967
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,610
rather sort of humbling yourself that
we're just another plant with more

968
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:28,620
we're just another plant with more
 

969
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,549
we're just another plant with more
complexity yes like trying to see where

970
00:18:31,549 --> 00:18:31,559
complexity yes like trying to see where
 

971
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,169
complexity yes like trying to see where
exactly so that yeah that's where I'm

972
00:18:33,169 --> 00:18:33,179
exactly so that yeah that's where I'm
 

973
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:36,230
exactly so that yeah that's where I'm
going with this sure so and and when you

974
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
going with this sure so and and when you
 

975
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,029
going with this sure so and and when you
start making that connection you can see

976
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:38,039
start making that connection you can see
 

977
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,970
start making that connection you can see
where there are a few points at which

978
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:40,980
where there are a few points at which
 

979
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,370
where there are a few points at which
there's room for an illusion to come in

980
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:43,380
there's room for an illusion to come in
 

981
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,770
there's room for an illusion to come in
for our own feelings of will so when we

982
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:45,780
for our own feelings of will so when we
 

983
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,990
for our own feelings of will so when we
move from the P tendril to human

984
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
move from the P tendril to human
 

985
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,230
move from the P tendril to human

going on in a p tendril I mean it is the

992
00:18:59,029 --> 00:18:59,039
going on in a p tendril I mean it is the
 

993
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,710
going on in a p tendril I mean it is the
brain is actually the most complex thing

an infinite number of factors and then
in that particular moment whatever the

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:20,580
in that particular moment whatever the
 

1011
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,390
in that particular moment whatever the

capable of almost an infinite number of
 

1015
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,690
capable of almost an infinite number of

1016
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:29,700
outputs right so if you if I walked in
 

1017
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,610
outputs right so if you if I walked in
here this morning and you said um would

1018
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:31,620
here this morning and you said um would
 

1019
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:34,669
here this morning and you said um would
you like water or tea

1020
00:19:34,669 --> 00:19:34,679
you like water or tea
 

1021
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,230
you like water or tea
um and that's you know simple decision

1022
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
um and that's you know simple decision
 

1023
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,090
um and that's you know simple decision
for me massive aggressive way of telling

1024
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:38,100
for me massive aggressive way of telling
 

1025
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,890
for me massive aggressive way of telling
me I should have offered

1026
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:39,900
me I should have offered
 

1027
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,770
me I should have offered
some tea but yes go on no I wanted water

1028
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:42,780
some tea but yes go on no I wanted water
 

1029
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,110
some tea but yes go on no I wanted water
okay all right I actually asked for

1030
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
okay all right I actually asked for
 

1031
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,870
okay all right I actually asked for
water okay all right and you didn't have

1032
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:47,880
water okay all right and you didn't have
 

1033
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,070
water okay all right and you didn't have
any free will anyway so it doesn't

1034
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:49,080
any free will anyway so it doesn't
 

1035
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,510
any free will anyway so it doesn't
matter I don't I don't hope you're

1036
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,520
matter I don't I don't hope you're
 

1037
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,850
matter I don't I don't hope you're
responsible for any of it exactly I was

1038
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:52,860
responsible for any of it exactly I was
 

1039
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,289
responsible for any of it exactly I was
just running an algorithm

00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:56,690
just running an algorithm
so deterministically you can you give me

1042
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:56,700
so deterministically you can you give me
 

1043
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,610
so deterministically you can you give me
this decision right to make water or tea

1044
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:58,620
this decision right to make water or tea
 

1045
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,010
this decision right to make water or tea

responses to that question even though
 

1057
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,270
responses to that question even though
you've given me you know two options you

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,280
you've given me you know two options you
 

1059
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,549
you've given me you know two options you
could offer me water or tea and I could

00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:16,559
could offer me water or tea and I could
 

1061
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,529
could offer me water or tea and I could
just run out of the room screaming if I

1062
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:18,539
just run out of the room screaming if I
 

1063
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,970
just run out of the room screaming if I
wanted to right happens to me all the

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:19,980
wanted to right happens to me all the
 

1065
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,370
wanted to right happens to me all the
time never mind I don't want to do this

1066
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,380
time never mind I don't want to do this
 

1067
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,770
time never mind I don't want to do this
yes the fact that the brain is capable

1068
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:27,780
yes the fact that the brain is capable
 

1069
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,049
yes the fact that the brain is capable
that there's so many inputs and then the

1070
00:20:30,049 --> 00:20:30,059
that there's so many inputs and then the
 

1071
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:33,409
that there's so many inputs and then the
brain is capable of so many outputs as a

1072
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:33,419
brain is capable of so many outputs as a
 

1073
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:36,289
brain is capable of so many outputs as a
system what it's hard for us to get our

1074
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:36,299
system what it's hard for us to get our
 

1075
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,150
system what it's hard for us to get our
minds around is that it may not be

1076
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,160
minds around is that it may not be
 

1077
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:43,130
minds around is that it may not be
capable of any behavior in every moment

1078
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:43,140
capable of any behavior in every moment
 

1079
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,010
capable of any behavior in every moment
in time so as a system it's capable of

1080
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:46,020
in time so as a system it's capable of
 

1081
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,529
in time so as a system it's capable of
doing all kinds of things

1082
00:20:48,529 --> 00:20:48,539
doing all kinds of things
 

1083
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,610
doing all kinds of things
and the points I'm making is that

1084
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:52,620
and the points I'm making is that
 

1085
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,370
and the points I'm making is that
if we could see all of the factors

1086
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:55,380
if we could see all of the factors
 

1087
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,230
if we could see all of the factors
leading up to the moment where I chose

1088
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,240
leading up to the moment where I chose
 

1089
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,510
leading up to the moment where I chose
water or where I ran screaming from the

1090
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
water or where I ran screaming from the
 

1091
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,950
water or where I ran screaming from the
room

1092

room
 

1093
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,250
room
um we could in fact see that there's

1094
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,260
um we could in fact see that there's
 

1095
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,950
um we could in fact see that there's
there was no other Behavior I was going

1096
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:06,960
there was no other Behavior I was going
 

1097
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,830
there was no other Behavior I was going
to or could have exhibited in that

1098
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:09,840
to or could have exhibited in that
 

1099
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,570
to or could have exhibited in that
moment in the same way that when the P

00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:18,900
interesting in robotics with with fish
 

1107
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,310
interesting in robotics with with fish
and water so you could see they've

1108
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:22,320
and water so you could see they've
 

1109
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,810
and water so you could see they've
experienced with like dead fish and they

1110
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:23,820
experienced with like dead fish and they
 

1111
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,630
experienced with like dead fish and they
keep swimming so

1112
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:26,640
keep swimming so
 

1113
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,090
keep swimming so
the fish is capable of all kinds of

1114
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,100
the fish is capable of all kinds of
 

1115
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,810
the fish is capable of all kinds of
complicated movements as a system but

1116
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:32,820
complicated movements as a system but
 

1117
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,870
complicated movements as a system but
in any one moment the river the full

1118
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:35,880
in any one moment the river the full
 

1119
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,210
in any one moment the river the full
complexity of the River defines the

1120
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:38,220
complexity of the River defines the
 

1121
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,430
complexity of the River defines the
actual movement of the fish that's

1122
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:40,440
actual movement of the fish that's
 

1123
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,830
actual movement of the fish that's
sufficient well and I I should also I

1124
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:42,840
sufficient well and I I should also I
 

1125
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,210
sufficient well and I I should also I
mean this brings up another point which

1126
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:44,220
mean this brings up another point which
 

1127
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,250
mean this brings up another point which
is that there is a difference between

1128
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:46,260
is that there is a difference between
 

1129
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,890
is that there is a difference between
voluntary and involuntary Behavior so of

1130
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:48,900
voluntary and involuntary Behavior so of
 

1131
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,310
voluntary and involuntary Behavior so of
course we have reflexes and it is a

1132
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
course we have reflexes and it is a
 

1133
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,289
course we have reflexes and it is a
different there's different brain

1134
00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:54,299
different there's different brain
 

1135
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:57,710
different there's different brain
processing in action when I make a

1136
00:21:57,710 --> 00:21:57,720
processing in action when I make a
 

1137
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:02,029
processing in action when I make a
decision about water or tea then there

1138
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:02,039
decision about water or tea then there
 

1139
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,250
decision about water or tea then there
is you know if my behavior is forced

1140
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:04,260
is you know if my behavior is forced
 

1141
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,430
is you know if my behavior is forced
from the outside or if I have a brain

1142
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
from the outside or if I have a brain
 

1143
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,010
from the outside or if I have a brain
tumor that's causing me to make certain

1144
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,020
tumor that's causing me to make certain
 

1145
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,930
tumor that's causing me to make certain
decisions or feel certain feelings and

1146
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:11,940
decisions or feel certain feelings and
 

1147
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,430
decisions or feel certain feelings and
so

1148
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
so
 

1149
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,409
so
um the point is that at bottom it's all

1150
00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:15,419
um the point is that at bottom it's all
 

1151
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,190
um the point is that at bottom it's all
brain processing and behavior but the

1152
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
brain processing and behavior but the
 

1153
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,610
brain processing and behavior but the
reason why certain actions feel willed

1154
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:22,620
reason why certain actions feel willed
 

1155
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,230
reason why certain actions feel willed
there's a good reason why it feels that

1156
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,240
there's a good reason why it feels that
 

1157
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,070
there's a good reason why it feels that
way

1158
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,080
way
 

1159
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,430
way
and it's to distinguish our own

1160
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:27,440
and it's to distinguish our own
 

1161
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,529
and it's to distinguish our own
self-generated behavior based on

1162
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:30,539
self-generated behavior based on
 

1163
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,770
self-generated behavior based on
thinking and you know possibly weighing

1164
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:33,780
thinking and you know possibly weighing
 

1165
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,850
thinking and you know possibly weighing
the different results of different

1166
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:34,860
the different results of different
 

1167
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,830
the different results of different
things I already had caffeine today I

1168
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:36,840
things I already had caffeine today I
 

1169
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,029
things I already had caffeine today I
don't want more you know they're all

1170
00:22:38,029 --> 00:22:38,039
don't want more you know they're all
 

1171
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,350
don't want more you know they're all
these

1172
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:39,360
these
 

1173
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,990
these
um processes things that we can point to

1174
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:42,000
um processes things that we can point to
 

1175
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,909
um processes things that we can point to
and things that we can't things I'm

1176
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:43,919
and things that we can't things I'm
 

1177
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,090
and things that we can't things I'm
affected by at a subconscious level

1178
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:47,100
affected by at a subconscious level
 

1179
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,110
affected by at a subconscious level
um

1180
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:48,120
um
 

1181
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,950
um
and that is very different from an

1182
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:51,960
and that is very different from an
 

1183
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,990
and that is very different from an
unwilled action or reflex or something

1184
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,000
unwilled action or reflex or something
 

1185
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,789
unwilled action or reflex or something
like that and so some some people I can

1186
00:22:55,789 --> 00:22:55,799
like that and so some some people I can
 

1187
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,289
like that and so some some people I can
imagine I haven't used the P tendril

1188
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:57,299
imagine I haven't used the P tendril
 

1189
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,490
imagine I haven't used the P tendril
example but I can imagine they wouldn't

1190
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:58,500
example but I can imagine they wouldn't
 

1191
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,310
example but I can imagine they wouldn't
like that because the p tendril

1192
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:01,320
like that because the p tendril
 

1193
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,649
like that because the p tendril
um sounds more to them like a reflex and

1194
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:03,659
um sounds more to them like a reflex and
 

1195
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,070
um sounds more to them like a reflex and
that doesn't address the question of a

1196
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:07,080
that doesn't address the question of a
 

1197
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,710
that doesn't address the question of a
much more complex

1198
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:08,720
much more complex
 

1199
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,210
much more complex
decision-making process but I think at

1200
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:11,220
decision-making process but I think at
 

1201
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,950
decision-making process but I think at
bottom

1202
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:12,960
bottom
 

1203
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,049
bottom
um that is that is what it is and that's

1204
00:23:15,049 --> 00:23:15,059
um that is that is what it is and that's
 

1205
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,970
um that is that is what it is and that's
really where the illusion of Free Will

1206
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:16,980
really where the illusion of Free Will
 

1207
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,649
really where the illusion of Free Will
and the illusion of self which I think

1208
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:18,659
and the illusion of self which I think
 

1209
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:20,330
and the illusion of self which I think
is they're kind of two sides of the same

1210
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,340
is they're kind of two sides of the same
 

1211
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:22,669
is they're kind of two sides of the same
coin come from so even when we

1212
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:22,679
coin come from so even when we
 

1213
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:24,770
coin come from so even when we
intellectually understand

1214
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:24,780
intellectually understand
 

1215
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,630
intellectually understand
that everything we're feeling everything

1216
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:26,640
that everything we're feeling everything
 

1217
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,529
that everything we're feeling everything
we're doing is is based on our brain

1218
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:29,539
we're doing is is based on our brain
 

1219
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:31,610
we're doing is is based on our brain
processing and brain Behavior if you're

1220
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:31,620
processing and brain Behavior if you're
 

1221
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,289
processing and brain Behavior if you're
a physicalist you you've bought into

1222
00:23:33,289 --> 00:23:33,299
a physicalist you you've bought into
 

1223
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:34,669
a physicalist you you've bought into
that

1224
00:23:34,669 --> 00:23:34,679
that
 

1225
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,590
that
um even when you intellectually

1226
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:36,600
um even when you intellectually
 

1227
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,230
um even when you intellectually
understand that we and I could include

1228
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:39,240
understand that we and I could include
 

1229
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,090
understand that we and I could include
myself in this we still have this

1230
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:41,100
myself in this we still have this
 

1231
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,490
myself in this we still have this
feeling that there's something that

1232
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:43,500
feeling that there's something that
 

1233
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,830
feeling that there's something that
stands outside of the brain processing

1234
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
stands outside of the brain processing
 

1235
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,049
stands outside of the brain processing
that can intervene and that's the

1236
00:23:48,049 --> 00:23:48,059
that can intervene and that's the
 

1237
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,190
that can intervene and that's the
illusion

1238
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
illusion
 

1239
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,230
illusion
I was tweeting with someone recently

1240
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,240
I was tweeting with someone recently
 

1241
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,789
I was tweeting with someone recently
which I almost never do but we're

1242
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:52,799
which I almost never do but we're
 

1243
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,370
which I almost never do but we're
working in the Ted documentary that I'm

1244
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:55,380
working in the Ted documentary that I'm
 

1245
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,870
working in the Ted documentary that I'm
making right now we're working on the

1246
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:56,880
making right now we're working on the
 

1247
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,330
making right now we're working on the
episode on free will so I was allowing

1248
00:23:59,330 --> 00:23:59,340
episode on free will so I was allowing
 

1249
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,850
episode on free will so I was allowing
myself to go back and forth in a way

1250
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:01,860
myself to go back and forth in a way
 

1251
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,890
myself to go back and forth in a way
that I don't usually on Twitter like

1252
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:03,900
that I don't usually on Twitter like
 

1253
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,990
that I don't usually on Twitter like
argue without free will it was it was a

1254
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:06,000
argue without free will it was it was a
 

1255
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,669
argue without free will it was it was a
friendly debate gonna go into the

1256
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:07,679
friendly debate gonna go into the
 

1257
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,289
friendly debate gonna go into the
reasons why I'm not crazy about Twitter

1258
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:09,299
reasons why I'm not crazy about Twitter
 

1259
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,070
reasons why I'm not crazy about Twitter
but let's leave that for another time

1260
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:12,080
but let's leave that for another time
 

1261
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,750
but let's leave that for another time
I mean talk about how hard it is to have

1262
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:14,760
I mean talk about how hard it is to have
 

1263
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,549
I mean talk about how hard it is to have
this conversation when we have as many

1264
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:16,559
this conversation when we have as many
 

1265
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,770
this conversation when we have as many
hours as as we like you know trying to

1266
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:18,780
hours as as we like you know trying to
 

1267
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,870
hours as as we like you know trying to
do it in sound bites over Twitter see I

1268
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:20,880
do it in sound bites over Twitter see I
 

1269
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,730
do it in sound bites over Twitter see I
like how you made the decision now not

1270
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:22,740
like how you made the decision now not
 

1271
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,850
like how you made the decision now not
to talk about Twitter that's uh well my

1272
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:25,860
to talk about Twitter that's uh well my
 

1273
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,649
to talk about Twitter that's uh well my
brain Road Less Traveled that was one of

1274
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:27,659
brain Road Less Traveled that was one of
 

1275
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:30,350
brain Road Less Traveled that was one of
the things I I said to this person was

1276
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:30,360
the things I I said to this person was
 

1277
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,930
the things I I said to this person was
um because someone someone chimed in and

1278
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:32,940
um because someone someone chimed in and
 

1279
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,850
um because someone someone chimed in and
said you said I what do you mean by I

1280
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:34,860
said you said I what do you mean by I
 

1281
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,830
said you said I what do you mean by I
and and so actually that's another point

1282
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:36,840
and and so actually that's another point
 

1283
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,710
and and so actually that's another point
I could make which is

1284
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:39,720
I could make which is
 

1285
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,169
I could make which is
um first my response to that was well

1286
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:42,179
um first my response to that was well
 

1287
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,090
um first my response to that was well
people tend to get creeped out when I

1288
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:44,100
people tend to get creeped out when I
 

1289
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,970
people tend to get creeped out when I
say the system that is my brain and body

1290
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:46,980
say the system that is my brain and body
 

1291
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,090
say the system that is my brain and body
that we call Annika recommends you know

1292
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:50,100
that we call Annika recommends you know
 

1293
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,610
that we call Annika recommends you know
why do you get freaked out

1294
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:52,620
why do you get freaked out
 

1295
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,350
why do you get freaked out

1298
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:56,520
instead of like never saying I yeah
 

1299
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,850
instead of like never saying I yeah
always well you're just being I always

1300

always well you're just being I always
 

1301
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,250
always well you're just being I always
refer to you as the brain and body we

1302
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:01,260
refer to you as the brain and body we
 

1303
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:05,149
refer to you as the brain and body we
call Lex yes um well I don't know that's

1304
00:25:05,149 --> 00:25:05,159
call Lex yes um well I don't know that's
 

1305
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:06,830
call Lex yes um well I don't know that's
kind of that's kind of charming in a way

1306
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:06,840
kind of that's kind of charming in a way
 

1307
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,890
kind of that's kind of charming in a way
alleged brain so I and you are very

1308
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:09,900
alleged brain so I and you are very
 

1309
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,169
alleged brain so I and you are very
useful shorthand even though at some

1310
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:12,179
useful shorthand even though at some
 

1311
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:13,909
useful shorthand even though at some
level they're Illusions

1312
00:25:13,909 --> 00:25:13,919
level they're Illusions
 

1313
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,669
level they're Illusions
um they're very useful shorthand for the

1314
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:16,679
um they're very useful shorthand for the
 

1315
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,610
um they're very useful shorthand for the
the system of my brain really and you

1316
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:19,620
the system of my brain really and you
 

1317
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,649
the system of my brain really and you
know and my body the the whole system

1318
00:25:21,649 --> 00:25:21,659
know and my body the the whole system
 

1319
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:23,630
know and my body the the whole system
that I is useful for that but the

1320
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:23,640
that I is useful for that but the
 

1321
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,610
that I is useful for that but the
illusion is when we feel like there's

1322
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:25,620
illusion is when we feel like there's
 

1323
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,710
illusion is when we feel like there's
something outside of that system that

1324
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:27,720
something outside of that system that
 

1325
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,630
something outside of that system that
can intervene that is free that's

1326
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:29,640
can intervene that is free that's
 

1327
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,450
can intervene that is free that's
somehow free from the physical world

1328
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:32,460
somehow free from the physical world
 

1329
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,450
somehow free from the physical world
um I can have the thought

1330
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:35,460
um I can have the thought
 

1331
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,909
um I can have the thought
um yeah I really not crazy about having

1332
00:25:37,909 --> 00:25:37,919
um yeah I really not crazy about having
 

1333
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,310
um yeah I really not crazy about having
intellectual back and forth on Twitter

1334
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,320
intellectual back and forth on Twitter
 

1335
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,990
intellectual back and forth on Twitter
and then

1336
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,000
and then
 

1337
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,570
and then
feel like I decide to not follow that

1338
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:44,580
feel like I decide to not follow that
 

1339
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,070
feel like I decide to not follow that
thought right and the feeling that's

1340
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:46,080
thought right and the feeling that's
 

1341
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,649
thought right and the feeling that's
that that's the feeling

1342
00:25:48,649 --> 00:25:48,659
that that's the feeling
 

1343
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,269
that that's the feeling
um where the illusion comes in because

1344
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:50,279
um where the illusion comes in because
 

1345
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:53,990
um where the illusion comes in because
it really feels as if sure my brain had

1346
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,000
it really feels as if sure my brain had
 

1347
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,630
it really feels as if sure my brain had
that original thought and then I came in

1348
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
that original thought and then I came in
 

1349
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,210
that original thought and then I came in
and made a different decision but of

1350
00:25:59,210 --> 00:25:59,220
and made a different decision but of
 

1351
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,310
and made a different decision but of
course the truth is it was just further

1352
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:01,320
course the truth is it was just further
 

1353
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,890
course the truth is it was just further
brain processing that got me to decide

1354
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:03,900
brain processing that got me to decide
 

1355
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,169
brain processing that got me to decide
not to go down that path how much is

1356
00:26:06,169 --> 00:26:06,179
not to go down that path how much is
 

1357
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:08,890
not to go down that path how much is
that feeling of conscious will is

1358
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:08,900
that feeling of conscious will is
 

1359
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:12,289
that feeling of conscious will is
culturally constructed shorthand so like

1360
00:26:12,289 --> 00:26:12,299
culturally constructed shorthand so like
 

1361
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:16,730
culturally constructed shorthand so like
uh I and you is a is a you could say a

1362
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:16,740
uh I and you is a is a you could say a
 

1363
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,130
uh I and you is a is a you could say a
culturally constructed shorthand

1364
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:19,140
culturally constructed shorthand
 

1365
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,409
culturally constructed shorthand
how much of that

1366
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:21,419
how much of that
 

1367
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,409
how much of that
affects how we think so our parents say

1368
00:26:24,409 --> 00:26:24,419
affects how we think so our parents say
 

1369
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:27,710
affects how we think so our parents say
I and you I and you and then we start to

1370
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:27,720
I and you I and you and then we start to
 

1371
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,769
I and you I and you and then we start to
believe in I in you and is that or are

1372
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:30,779
believe in I in you and is that or are
 

1373
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:33,130
believe in I in you and is that or are
we is that fundamental to the human

1374
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:33,140
we is that fundamental to the human
 

1375
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,310
we is that fundamental to the human
brain machine yeah that we I think I

1376
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:37,320
brain machine yeah that we I think I
 

1377
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,930
brain machine yeah that we I think I
think it goes very deep I think it's

1378
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:38,940
think it goes very deep I think it's
 

1379
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,450
think it goes very deep I think it's
fundamental and I think it probably some

1380
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:41,460
fundamental and I think it probably some
 

1381
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,390
fundamental and I think it probably some
form of feeling like a self goes

1382
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:44,400
form of feeling like a self goes
 

1383
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,230
form of feeling like a self goes
as deep as cats and dogs and it's

1384
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:48,240
as deep as cats and dogs and it's
 

1385
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,330
as deep as cats and dogs and it's
possible I mean if consciousness

1386
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:50,340
possible I mean if consciousness
 

1387
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,029
possible I mean if consciousness
does go down to the level of cells or

1388
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:53,039
does go down to the level of cells or
 

1389
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,590
does go down to the level of cells or
however far down you want to take it

1390
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:54,600
however far down you want to take it
 

1391
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,990
however far down you want to take it
worms or I think any any system that's

1392
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:57,000
worms or I think any any system that's
 

1393
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,250
worms or I think any any system that's
navigating

1394
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:58,260
navigating
 

1395
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,630
navigating
um itself that kind of has boundaries

1396
00:26:59,630 --> 00:26:59,640
um itself that kind of has boundaries
 

1397
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,590
um itself that kind of has boundaries
and is navigating itself in the world

1398
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:03,600
and is navigating itself in the world
 

1399
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,250
and is navigating itself in the world
um my guess is that it's it's an

1400
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:07,260
um my guess is that it's it's an
 

1401
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,710
um my guess is that it's it's an
intrinsic part of that's why I imagined

1402
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:09,720
intrinsic part of that's why I imagined
 

1403
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,570
intrinsic part of that's why I imagined
that the P tendril would have this

1404
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:11,580
that the P tendril would have this
 

1405
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,250
that the P tendril would have this
feeling

1406
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:13,260
feeling
 

1407
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,190
feeling
um and so you know

1408
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:16,200
um and so you know
 

1409
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,190
um and so you know
we use the word I I think you're right

1410
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:19,200
we use the word I I think you're right
 

1411
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,930
we use the word I I think you're right
first of all that the way we talk about

1412
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:20,940
first of all that the way we talk about
 

1413
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,690
first of all that the way we talk about
things affects our intuitions about them

1414
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:23,700
things affects our intuitions about them
 

1415
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,430
things affects our intuitions about them
and how we feel about them and so there

1416
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:25,440
and how we feel about them and so there
 

1417
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,490
and how we feel about them and so there
are other cultures who are more open

1418
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:28,500
are other cultures who are more open
 

1419
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,250
are other cultures who are more open
to breaking through these Illusions than

1420
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,260
to breaking through these Illusions than
 

1421
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:34,610
to breaking through these Illusions than
others for sure just because of their

1422
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:34,620
others for sure just because of their
 

1423
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,769
others for sure just because of their
um their belief sets the way they talk I

1424
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:36,779
um their belief sets the way they talk I
 

1425
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,510
um their belief sets the way they talk I
mean I'm sure I don't I don't I'm not a

1426
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:38,520
mean I'm sure I don't I don't I'm not a
 

1427
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,549
mean I'm sure I don't I don't I'm not a
linguist and I don't even speak a second

1428
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
linguist and I don't even speak a second
 

1429
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,529
linguist and I don't even speak a second
language so I can't I can't speak to it

1430
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:42,539
language so I can't I can't speak to it
 

1431
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:44,630
language so I can't I can't speak to it
but I you know if if there were a

1432
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
but I you know if if there were a
 

1433
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,669
but I you know if if there were a
language that

1434
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:46,679
language that
 

1435
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:49,070
language that
um

1436
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:49,080

 

1437
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,930

that framed

1438
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:50,940
that framed
 

1439
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,909
that framed
who we are differently in everyday

1440
00:27:52,909 --> 00:27:52,919
who we are differently in everyday
 

1441
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:54,950
who we are differently in everyday
language I mean in our everyday

1442
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
language I mean in our everyday
 

1443
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,630
language I mean in our everyday
communication I would think that would

1444
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
communication I would think that would
 

1445
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,730
communication I would think that would
have an effect yeah language does affect

1446
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:58,740
have an effect yeah language does affect
 

1447
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:02,149
have an effect yeah language does affect
things I mean just knowing Uh Russian in

1448
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
things I mean just knowing Uh Russian in
 

1449
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,549
things I mean just knowing Uh Russian in
the history of the Soviet Union in the

1450
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:04,559
the history of the Soviet Union in the
 

1451
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,669
the history of the Soviet Union in the
20th century obviously it lived under

1452
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:07,679
20th century obviously it lived under
 

1453
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,590
20th century obviously it lived under
communism for a long time so your

1454
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:09,600
communism for a long time so your
 

1455
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,990
communism for a long time so your
conception of individualism is different

1456
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,000
conception of individualism is different
 

1457
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,730
conception of individualism is different
and that reflects itself from the

1458
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:13,740
and that reflects itself from the
 

1459
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,890
and that reflects itself from the
language yeah um you could probably have

1460
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:15,900
language yeah um you could probably have
 

1461
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,930
language yeah um you could probably have
this similar kind of thing

1462
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:17,940
this similar kind of thing
 

1463
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,090
this similar kind of thing
within the language

1464
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,100
within the language
 

1465
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,310
within the language
in terms of how we talk about I and we

1466
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:22,320
in terms of how we talk about I and we
 

1467
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,470
in terms of how we talk about I and we
and so on yeah and I yeah I'm sure

1468
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
and so on yeah and I yeah I'm sure
 

1469
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,230
and so on yeah and I yeah I'm sure
there's like um certain countries or

1470
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:27,240
there's like um certain countries or
 

1471
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,730
there's like um certain countries or
maybe even villages with certain

1472
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:28,740
maybe even villages with certain
 

1473
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,850
maybe even villages with certain
dialects that uh

1474
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:30,860
dialects that uh
 

1475
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:34,130
dialects that uh
like let go of the individualism that's

1476
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,140
like let go of the individualism that's
 

1477
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,870
like let go of the individualism that's
inherent yeah I mean there there must be

1478
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:35,880
inherent yeah I mean there there must be
 

1479
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,090
inherent yeah I mean there there must be
a range but I do think that it's pretty

1480
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:38,100
a range but I do think that it's pretty
 

1481
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,330
a range but I do think that it's pretty
deep and I think

1482
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:41,340
deep and I think
 

1483
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,470
deep and I think
um

1484
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:42,480
um
 

1485
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,130
um
there's also a difference between the

1486
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:45,140
there's also a difference between the
 

1487
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,930
there's also a difference between the
autobiographical me and then this more

1488
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:47,940
autobiographical me and then this more
 

1489
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,330
autobiographical me and then this more
fundamental me that we're talking about

1490
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:50,340
fundamental me that we're talking about
 

1491
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,010
fundamental me that we're talking about
where that I'm pointing to is the

1492
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:52,020
where that I'm pointing to is the
 

1493
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,610
where that I'm pointing to is the
illusion so in my book I talk about if

1494
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:55,620
illusion so in my book I talk about if
 

1495
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,690
illusion so in my book I talk about if
someone

1496
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:56,700
someone
 

1497
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,909
someone
um wakes up with amnesia if they have

1498
00:28:58,909 --> 00:28:58,919
um wakes up with amnesia if they have
 

1499
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,250
um wakes up with amnesia if they have
brain injury and suddenly have amnesia

1500
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:01,260
brain injury and suddenly have amnesia
 

1501
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,769
brain injury and suddenly have amnesia
and can't remember anything about their

1502
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:03,779
and can't remember anything about their
 

1503
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,330
and can't remember anything about their
lives can't remember their name don't

1504
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:05,340
lives can't remember their name don't
 

1505
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:08,690
lives can't remember their name don't
recognize people they're related to

1506
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:08,700
recognize people they're related to
 

1507
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,730
recognize people they're related to
um

1508
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:10,740
um
 

1509
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,470
um
they would have lost their

1510
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
they would have lost their
 

1511
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,169
they would have lost their
autobiographical self but they would

1512
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:15,179
autobiographical self but they would
 

1513
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:17,269
autobiographical self but they would
still feel like an eye they would still

1514
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
still feel like an eye they would still
 

1515
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,750
still feel like an eye they would still
have that basic sense of I'm a person I

1516
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:20,760
have that basic sense of I'm a person I
 

1517

um you still it goes very deep this
 

1525
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,830
um you still it goes very deep this
feeling that I am a single entity

1526
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:33,840
feeling that I am a single entity
 

1527
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,430

um that is somehow
 

1529
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:39,710
um that is somehow
not completely Reliant upon the cause

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,190
that the question maybe I missed no no
no no you understood it perfectly but

1582
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:43,200
no no you understood it perfectly but
 

1583
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,090
no no you understood it perfectly but
yeah

1584
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:44,100
yeah
 

1585
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,029
yeah
you you know sorry for the dark question

1586
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:47,039
you you know sorry for the dark question
 

1587
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,970
you you know sorry for the dark question
but the people you love in your life if

1588
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:49,980
but the people you love in your life if
 

1589
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,730
but the people you love in your life if
you lost all your memory of everything

1590
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:52,740
you lost all your memory of everything
 

1591
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,950
you lost all your memory of everything
do you think you would still love them

1592
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:54,960
do you think you would still love them
 

1593
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,230
do you think you would still love them
like you show up you don't know I don't

1594
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:57,240
like you show up you don't know I don't
 

1595
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,669
like you show up you don't know I don't
know to roll the die I mean it would not

1596
00:30:58,669 --> 00:30:58,679
know to roll the die I mean it would not
 

1597
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,970
know to roll the die I mean it would not
in the way that I do right just some

1598
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:01,980
in the way that I do right just some
 

1599
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,190
in the way that I do right just some
deep aspect of Love is the history you

1600
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:04,200
deep aspect of Love is the history you
 

1601
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,870
deep aspect of Love is the history you
have together oh absolutely well and

1602
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:05,880
have together oh absolutely well and
 

1603
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,130
have together oh absolutely well and
this gets to an interesting point

1604
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,140
this gets to an interesting point
 

1605
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,289
this gets to an interesting point
actually which I think a lot about which

1606
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:09,299
actually which I think a lot about which
 

1607
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:10,909
actually which I think a lot about which
is memory

1608
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:10,919
is memory
 

1609
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,830
is memory
um and we won't go into this yet but

1610
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:12,840
um and we won't go into this yet but
 

1611
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:15,529
um and we won't go into this yet but
I'll just plant a flag here memory is

1612
00:31:15,529 --> 00:31:15,539
I'll just plant a flag here memory is
 

1613
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,769
I'll just plant a flag here memory is
yeah memories um obviously related to

1614
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:18,779
yeah memories um obviously related to
 

1615
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,570
yeah memories um obviously related to
time and time is something that I'm

1616
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:20,580
time and time is something that I'm
 

1617
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,310
time and time is something that I'm
fascinated with and and for this project

1618
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:22,320
fascinated with and and for this project
 

1619
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,649
fascinated with and and for this project
I'm working on now I've mostly been

1620
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:24,659
I'm working on now I've mostly been
 

1621
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:26,029
I'm working on now I've mostly been
speaking to physicists who are

1622
00:31:26,029 --> 00:31:26,039
speaking to physicists who are
 

1623
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:28,250
speaking to physicists who are
interested in Consciousness

1624
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:28,260
interested in Consciousness
 

1625
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,769
interested in Consciousness
um and it's partly because of this link

1626
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:30,779
um and it's partly because of this link
 

1627
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:35,330
um and it's partly because of this link
between memory and time and you know all

1628
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,340
between memory and time and you know all
 

1629
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,810
between memory and time and you know all
of these new fascinating

1630
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:38,820
of these new fascinating
 

1631
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:41,750
of these new fascinating
um theories and thoughts around the

1632
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:41,760
um theories and thoughts around the
 

1633
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,549
um theories and thoughts around the
different interpretations of quantum

1634
00:31:43,549 --> 00:31:43,559
different interpretations of quantum
 

1635
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:45,049
different interpretations of quantum
mechanics and

1636
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:45,059
mechanics and
 

1637
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,029
mechanics and
looking at you know the thing that I've

1638
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,039
looking at you know the thing that I've
 

1639
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,070
looking at you know the thing that I've
always been looking for is is really the

1640
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:49,080
always been looking for is is really the
 

1641
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,450
always been looking for is is really the
fundamental nature of reality and why

1642
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:52,460
fundamental nature of reality and why
 

1643
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:56,330
fundamental nature of reality and why
my questions about Consciousness lead me

1644
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:56,340
my questions about Consciousness lead me
 

1645
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,669
my questions about Consciousness lead me
to wonder if Consciousness is a more

1646
00:31:58,669 --> 00:31:58,679
to wonder if Consciousness is a more
 

1647
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:01,370
to wonder if Consciousness is a more
fundamental aspect of the universe than

1648
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:01,380
fundamental aspect of the universe than
 

1649
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,889
fundamental aspect of the universe than
than we previously thought and certainly

1650
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:03,899
than we previously thought and certainly
 

1651
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,289
than we previously thought and certainly
I previously thought

1652
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:06,299
I previously thought
 

1653
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:10,130
I previously thought
um and so memory but memory is is tied

1654
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:10,140
um and so memory but memory is is tied
 

1655
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,430
um and so memory but memory is is tied
to so many things I mean even

1656
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:12,440
to so many things I mean even
 

1657
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,990
to so many things I mean even
basic functions in nature actually so so

1658
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,000
basic functions in nature actually so so
 

1659
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,049
basic functions in nature actually so so
the the pitendril as I mentioned memory

1660
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:18,059
the the pitendril as I mentioned memory
 

1661
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:19,970
the the pitendril as I mentioned memory
comes into play there and that's so

1662
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:19,980
comes into play there and that's so
 

1663
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,169
comes into play there and that's so
fascinating

1664
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:21,179
fascinating
 

1665
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:24,529
fascinating
um and there is no sense of self without

1666
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:24,539
um and there is no sense of self without
 

1667
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:26,930
um and there is no sense of self without
memory even if you're starting from

1668
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:26,940
memory even if you're starting from
 

1669
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,950
memory even if you're starting from
scratch as you said with amnesia

1670
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:30,960
scratch as you said with amnesia
 

1671
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,889
scratch as you said with amnesia
um if you truly couldn't lay down any

1672
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:33,899
um if you truly couldn't lay down any
 

1673
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,090
um if you truly couldn't lay down any
new memories

1674
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,100
new memories
 

1675
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,190
new memories
I think you would then that sense of

1676
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:37,200
I think you would then that sense of
 

1677
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,169
I think you would then that sense of
self would begin to disintegrate because

1678
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:39,179
self would begin to disintegrate because
 

1679
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:43,010
self would begin to disintegrate because
the sense of self is one of a concrete

1680
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:43,020
the sense of self is one of a concrete
 

1681
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,409
the sense of self is one of a concrete
entity Through Time

1682
00:32:45,409 --> 00:32:45,419
entity Through Time
 

1683
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:48,769
entity Through Time
and if each moment if you really were

1684
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:48,779
and if each moment if you really were
 

1685
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,169
and if each moment if you really were
stuck in the present moment

1686
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:51,179
stuck in the present moment
 

1687
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:52,789
stuck in the present moment
eternally you'd be basically be

1688
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:52,799
eternally you'd be basically be
 

1689
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,250
eternally you'd be basically be
meditating

1690
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:54,260
meditating
 

1691
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,990
meditating
and in meditation is a very common

1692
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,000
and in meditation is a very common
 

1693
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,990
and in meditation is a very common
experience is losing that sense of self

1694
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
experience is losing that sense of self
 

1695
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,909
experience is losing that sense of self
that sense of free will that those

1696
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:01,919
that sense of free will that those
 

1697
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,710
that sense of free will that those
Illusions

1698
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:03,720
Illusions
 

1699
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,769
Illusions
um more easily drop away in meditation

1700
00:33:06,769 --> 00:33:06,779
um more easily drop away in meditation
 

1701
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,930
um more easily drop away in meditation
and I would say for most people who

1702
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:08,940
and I would say for most people who
 

1703
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,970
and I would say for most people who
meditate long enough they do drop away

1704
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:10,980
meditate long enough they do drop away
 

1705
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,470
meditate long enough they do drop away
and there's actually an explanation of

1706
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:12,480
and there's actually an explanation of
 

1707
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,570
and there's actually an explanation of
the level of the brain as well the

1708
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:14,580
the level of the brain as well the
 

1709
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,509
the level of the brain as well the
default mode network is circuitry in the

1710
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
default mode network is circuitry in the
 

1711
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,669
default mode network is circuitry in the
brain that neuroscientists don't

1712
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
brain that neuroscientists don't
 

1713
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,590
brain that neuroscientists don't
completely understand but no is is

1714
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
completely understand but no is is
 

1715
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,810
completely understand but no is is
largely largely responsible for this

1716
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:23,820
largely largely responsible for this
 

1717
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,310
largely largely responsible for this
feeling of being a self and when that

1718
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,320
feeling of being a self and when that
 

1719
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,230
feeling of being a self and when that
circuit gets quieted down which it does

1720
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
circuit gets quieted down which it does
 

1721
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,690
circuit gets quieted down which it does
in meditation and also does

1722
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:32,700
in meditation and also does
 

1723
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,750
in meditation and also does
um with the use of psychedelic drugs

1724
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:35,760
um with the use of psychedelic drugs
 

1725
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,190
um with the use of psychedelic drugs
um and there are other ways to quiet

1726
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:37,200
um and there are other ways to quiet
 

1727
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,889
um and there are other ways to quiet
down the default mode Network

1728
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:39,899
down the default mode Network
 

1729
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:44,210
down the default mode Network
um people have this experience of losing

1730
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:44,220
um people have this experience of losing
 

1731
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,250
um people have this experience of losing
this this illusion of being a self they

1732
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:46,260
this this illusion of being a self they
 

1733
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,870
this this illusion of being a self they
no longer feel that they're self in the

1734
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:47,880
no longer feel that they're self in the
 

1735
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,389
no longer feel that they're self in the
way that they usually do so there's uh

1736
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
way that they usually do so there's uh
 

1737
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,269
way that they usually do so there's uh
the autobiographical self is connected

1738
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:53,279
the autobiographical self is connected
 

1739
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:57,470
the autobiographical self is connected
to the the sense of self oh absolutely

1740
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:57,480
to the the sense of self oh absolutely
 

1741
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,389
to the the sense of self oh absolutely
through the memory and then you're

1742
00:33:59,389 --> 00:33:59,399
through the memory and then you're
 

1743
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,090
through the memory and then you're
thinking that the solution to that lies

1744
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,100
thinking that the solution to that lies
 

1745
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,110
thinking that the solution to that lies
in physics not just Neuroscience like

1746
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,120
in physics not just Neuroscience like
 

1747
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,909
in physics not just Neuroscience like
ultimately Consciousness and the

1748
00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:07,919
ultimately Consciousness and the
 

1749
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,669
ultimately Consciousness and the
experience the conscious will

1750
00:34:10,669 --> 00:34:10,679
experience the conscious will
 

1751
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,550
experience the conscious will
is uh a question of physics

1752
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:13,560
is uh a question of physics
 

1753
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,190
is uh a question of physics
I may have said something misleading

1754
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:16,200
I may have said something misleading
 

1755
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,710
I may have said something misleading
because I was connecting too many dots

1756
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:18,720
because I was connecting too many dots
 

1757
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:21,050
because I was connecting too many dots
um that's the things I say are

1758
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,060
um that's the things I say are
 

1759
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,369
um that's the things I say are
misleading

1760
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:22,379
misleading
 

1761
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:24,589
misleading
um let us mislead each other I just got

1762
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:24,599
um let us mislead each other I just got
 

1763
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:26,270
um let us mislead each other I just got
I got excited when memory came up

1764
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,280
I got excited when memory came up
 

1765
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,389
I got excited when memory came up
because I love talking about time so you

1766
00:34:29,389 --> 00:34:29,399
because I love talking about time so you
 

1767
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:30,770
because I love talking about time so you
mentioned a project you working on a

1768
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:30,780
mentioned a project you working on a
 

1769
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,109
mentioned a project you working on a
couple times what what's that about uh I

1770
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
couple times what what's that about uh I
 

1771
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:34,790
couple times what what's that about uh I
think you said Ted is involved you're

1772
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
think you said Ted is involved you're
 

1773
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,109
think you said Ted is involved you're
interviewing a bunch of people what's

1774
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:36,119
interviewing a bunch of people what's
 

1775
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:38,629
interviewing a bunch of people what's
going on what's the topic

1776
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
going on what's the topic
 

1777
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,450
going on what's the topic
um so I'm working on an audio

1778
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:40,460
um so I'm working on an audio
 

1779
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,190
um so I'm working on an audio
documentary about Consciousness

1780
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,200
documentary about Consciousness
 

1781
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,050
documentary about Consciousness
um and it picks up where my book left

1782
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,060
um and it picks up where my book left
 

1783
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,369
um and it picks up where my book left
off

1784
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:46,379
off
 

1785
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,409
off
um so all of the questions that were

1786
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:48,419
um so all of the questions that were
 

1787
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,450
um so all of the questions that were
still lingering for me um and research

1788
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:50,460
still lingering for me um and research
 

1789
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,210
still lingering for me um and research
that I still wanted to do I just started

1790
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:53,220
that I still wanted to do I just started
 

1791
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,530
that I still wanted to do I just started
conducting so I've done about 30

1792
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:54,540
conducting so I've done about 30
 

1793
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,450
conducting so I've done about 30
interviews so far

1794
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:56,460
interviews so far
 

1795
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,210
interviews so far
um and I it's not totally clear what the

1796
00:34:59,210 --> 00:34:59,220
um and I it's not totally clear what the
 

1797
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,310
um and I it's not totally clear what the
end result will be I'm currently

1798
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:01,320
end result will be I'm currently
 

1799
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,589
end result will be I'm currently
collaborating with Ted and I'm having a

1800
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
collaborating with Ted and I'm having a
 

1801
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,130
collaborating with Ted and I'm having a
lot of fun creating a pilot with them

1802
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:07,140
lot of fun creating a pilot with them
 

1803
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,690
lot of fun creating a pilot with them
um and so we'll we'll see where it goes

1804
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:08,700
um and so we'll we'll see where it goes
 

1805
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,150
um and so we'll we'll see where it goes
but the idea is that it's a narrated

1806
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,160
but the idea is that it's a narrated
 

1807
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,069
but the idea is that it's a narrated
um documentary it's like a series a

1808
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:13,079
um documentary it's like a series a
 

1809
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:15,230
um documentary it's like a series a
series it'll be a 10 part series it's an

1810
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:15,240
series it'll be a 10 part series it's an
 

1811
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,790
series it'll be a 10 part series it's an
unclear oh you already know the number

1812
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
unclear oh you already know the number
 

1813
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,770
unclear oh you already know the number
of Parts uh sorry in my mind it's a

1814
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:18,780
of Parts uh sorry in my mind it's a
 

1815
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,109
of Parts uh sorry in my mind it's a
10-part series Amanda being 8 or 11 or

1816
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
10-part series Amanda being 8 or 11 or
 

1817
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,150
10-part series Amanda being 8 or 11 or
12. I don't know why listen I'm very

1818
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:23,160
12. I don't know why listen I'm very
 

1819
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,310
12. I don't know why listen I'm very
comforted by the number zero and one as

1820
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:25,320
comforted by the number zero and one as
 

1821
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,710
comforted by the number zero and one as
well about ten I like the confidence of

1822
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:27,720
well about ten I like the confidence of
 

1823
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,670
well about ten I like the confidence of
10.

1824
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:28,680
10.
 

1825
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,530
10.
um

1826
00:35:29,530 --> 00:35:29,540
um
 

1827
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,089
um
so and you're not sure what the title

1828
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:32,099
so and you're not sure what the title
 

1829
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,250
so and you're not sure what the title
like not the title but the topic it will

1830
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:34,260
like not the title but the topic it will
 

1831
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,630
like not the title but the topic it will
there be Consciousness or something

1832
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:35,640
there be Consciousness or something
 

1833
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,609
there be Consciousness or something
bigger or something smaller yeah I mean

1834
00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:37,619
bigger or something smaller yeah I mean
 

1835
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:39,470
bigger or something smaller yeah I mean
it's mine so at the end of my book I I

1836
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:39,480
it's mine so at the end of my book I I
 

1837
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,829
it's mine so at the end of my book I I
kind of get to the place where I've

1838
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
kind of get to the place where I've
 

1839
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,690
kind of get to the place where I've
convinced myself at least that this

1840
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:44,700
convinced myself at least that this
 

1841
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,310
convinced myself at least that this
question about whether Consciousness is

1842
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:46,320
question about whether Consciousness is
 

1843
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,130
question about whether Consciousness is
fundamental is a legitimate one and then

1844
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,140
fundamental is a legitimate one and then
 

1845
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,650
fundamental is a legitimate one and then
I just start spending a lot of time

1846
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:51,660
I just start spending a lot of time
 

1847
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,990
I just start spending a lot of time
thinking about what that would mean if

1848
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:54,000
thinking about what that would mean if
 

1849
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,550
thinking about what that would mean if
it's even possible to study

1850
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:55,560
it's even possible to study
 

1851
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,230
it's even possible to study
scientifically

1852
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:57,240
scientifically
 

1853
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,030
scientifically
um so I mostly talk to physicists

1854
00:35:59,030 --> 00:35:59,040
um so I mostly talk to physicists
 

1855
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,050
um so I mostly talk to physicists
actually

1856
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:00,060
actually
 

1857
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,150
actually
um because I really think ultimately

1858
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
um because I really think ultimately
 

1859
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,089
um because I really think ultimately
this is a question for for physics if

1860
00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:05,099
this is a question for for physics if
 

1861
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:06,589
this is a question for for physics if
Consciousness is fundamental I think it

1862
00:36:06,589 --> 00:36:06,599
Consciousness is fundamental I think it
 

1863
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,329
Consciousness is fundamental I think it
needs to be strongly informed by

1864
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:08,339
needs to be strongly informed by
 

1865
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,430
needs to be strongly informed by
Neuroscience but

1866
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:10,440
Neuroscience but
 

1867
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,310
Neuroscience but
um it's yeah if it's part of the fabric

1868
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,320
um it's yeah if it's part of the fabric
 

1869
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,109
um it's yeah if it's part of the fabric
of reality it is a question for a

1870
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:15,119
of reality it is a question for a
 

1871
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,150
of reality it is a question for a
physicist so I speak to different

1872
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:17,160
physicist so I speak to different
 

1873
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,230
physicist so I speak to different
physicists about different

1874
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
physicists about different
 

1875
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,450
physicists about different
interpretations of quantum mechanics so

1876
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:20,460
interpretations of quantum mechanics so
 

1877
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,089
interpretations of quantum mechanics so
getting at the fundamentals so string

1878
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,099
getting at the fundamentals so string
 

1879
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:25,130
getting at the fundamentals so string
theory in many worlds I spoke to Sean

1880
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:25,140
theory in many worlds I spoke to Sean
 

1881
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,569
theory in many worlds I spoke to Sean
Carroll had a great conversation with

1882
00:36:26,569 --> 00:36:26,579
Carroll had a great conversation with
 

1883
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,550
Carroll had a great conversation with
Sean Carroll he's so generous because he

1884
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:28,560
Sean Carroll he's so generous because he
 

1885
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,950
Sean Carroll he's so generous because he
clearly doesn't agree with me about

1886
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:30,960
clearly doesn't agree with me about
 

1887
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,250
clearly doesn't agree with me about
many things but he has a curious mind

1888
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:34,260
many things but he has a curious mind
 

1889
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,510
many things but he has a curious mind
and he's willing to have these

1890
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
and he's willing to have these
 

1891
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,890
and he's willing to have these
conversations and I was really

1892
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:36,900
conversations and I was really
 

1893
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,230
conversations and I was really
interested in understanding many worlds

1894
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:39,240
interested in understanding many worlds
 

1895
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,510
interested in understanding many worlds
better and if Consciousness is

1896
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
better and if Consciousness is
 

1897
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,510
better and if Consciousness is
fundamental what the implications are

1898
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,520
fundamental what the implications are
 

1899
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,950
fundamental what the implications are
um so I that was where I started

1900
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:45,960
um so I that was where I started
 

1901
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,410
um so I that was where I started
actually was with many worlds and then

1902
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:48,420
actually was with many worlds and then
 

1903
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,690
actually was with many worlds and then
uh we had conversations about string

1904
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:50,700
uh we had conversations about string
 

1905
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:54,290
uh we had conversations about string
theory and the holographic principle I

1906
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:54,300
theory and the holographic principle I
 

1907
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:57,230
theory and the holographic principle I
spoke to Lee smullen and

1908
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:57,240
spoke to Lee smullen and
 

1909
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,170
spoke to Lee smullen and
um Brian Greene and Jan 11 and Carlo

1910
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:00,180
um Brian Greene and Jan 11 and Carlo
 

1911
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,849
um Brian Greene and Jan 11 and Carlo
rivelli actually have you had Carlo on

1912
00:37:01,849 --> 00:37:01,859
rivelli actually have you had Carlo on
 

1913
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,849
rivelli actually have you had Carlo on
no no he's he's great also and fun to

1914
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:04,859
no no he's he's great also and fun to
 

1915
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,890
no no he's he's great also and fun to
talk to because he's just endlessly

1916
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:06,900
talk to because he's just endlessly
 

1917
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,290
talk to because he's just endlessly
curious yeah are you doing audio it's

1918
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:09,300
curious yeah are you doing audio it's
 

1919
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,150
curious yeah are you doing audio it's
all audio Yeah but it's in the format of

1920
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:11,160
all audio Yeah but it's in the format of
 

1921
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,430
all audio Yeah but it's in the format of
a documentary so I'm narrating it and

1922
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,440
a documentary so I'm narrating it and
 

1923
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,870
a documentary so I'm narrating it and
kind of telling the story of what

1924
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
kind of telling the story of what
 

1925
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,849
kind of telling the story of what
questions came up for me what I was

1926
00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:16,859
questions came up for me what I was
 

1927
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:18,589
questions came up for me what I was
interested in exploring and then you

1928
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:18,599
interested in exploring and then you
 

1929
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,510
interested in exploring and then you
know why I talked to each person I I

1930
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:20,520
know why I talked to each person I I
 

1931
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,970
know why I talked to each person I I
talk to by the way I highly recommend

1932
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:22,980
talk to by the way I highly recommend
 

1933
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,730
talk to by the way I highly recommend
Sean Carroll's mindscape podcast I think

1934
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:25,740
Sean Carroll's mindscape podcast I think
 

1935
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,349
Sean Carroll's mindscape podcast I think
it's called yeah

1936
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:27,359
it's called yeah
 

1937
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,609
it's called yeah
um it's amazing one of my favorite

1938
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:28,619
um it's amazing one of my favorite
 

1939
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,470
um it's amazing one of my favorite
things when he interviews physicists

1940
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:30,480
things when he interviews physicists
 

1941
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,410
things when he interviews physicists
it's great but any topic his aim is but

1942
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:33,420
it's great but any topic his aim is but
 

1943
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,390
it's great but any topic his aim is but
one of my favorite things is how

1944
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:35,400
one of my favorite things is how
 

1945
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,870
one of my favorite things is how
frustrated he gets with pan psychism

1946
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:37,880
frustrated he gets with pan psychism
 

1947
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,310
frustrated he gets with pan psychism
but he's still like it's like a fly

1948
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
but he's still like it's like a fly
 

1949
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,950
but he's still like it's like a fly
towards the light for some reason he

1950
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:42,960
towards the light for some reason he
 

1951
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,349
towards the light for some reason he
can't like make sense of it but like he

1952
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
can't like make sense of it but like he
 

1953
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,609
can't like make sense of it but like he
still struggles with it and I think

1954
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:46,619
still struggles with it and I think
 

1955
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,150
still struggles with it and I think
that's the that's the sign of a good

1956
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,160
that's the that's the sign of a good
 

1957
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,069
that's the that's the sign of a good
scientist really struggling uh

1958
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
scientist really struggling uh
 

1959
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,810
scientist really struggling uh
struggling with these ideas

1960
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:53,820
struggling with these ideas
 

1961
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:56,810
struggling with these ideas
and yes that's what I appreciate in him

1962
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:56,820
and yes that's what I appreciate in him
 

1963
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,630
and yes that's what I appreciate in him
and and many scientists like that who

1964
00:37:59,630 --> 00:37:59,640
and and many scientists like that who
 

1965
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,510
and and many scientists like that who
has the craziest most radical ideas who

1966
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:02,520
has the craziest most radical ideas who
 

1967
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,370
has the craziest most radical ideas who
you talk with currently so you can go

1968
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:04,380
you talk with currently so you can go
 

1969
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,690
you talk with currently so you can go
either direction

1970
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:05,700
either direction
 

1971
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,790
either direction
you can go like pan psychism

1972
00:38:07,790 --> 00:38:07,800
you can go like pan psychism
 

1973
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,730
you can go like pan psychism
Consciousness permeates everything yeah

1974
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:10,740
Consciousness permeates everything yeah
 

1975
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,190
Consciousness permeates everything yeah
I I don't know how far you can go down

1976
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
I I don't know how far you can go down
 

1977
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,250
I I don't know how far you can go down
that direction or you could uh say that

1978
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:16,260
that direction or you could uh say that
 

1979
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,650
that direction or you could uh say that
you know what's the what would be the

1980
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:18,660
you know what's the what would be the
 

1981
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,510
you know what's the what would be the
other direction that there's a there

1982
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:20,520
other direction that there's a there
 

1983
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,890
other direction that there's a there
isn't real the problem is they're all

1984
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:21,900
isn't real the problem is they're all
 

1985
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,730
isn't real the problem is they're all
crazy they're all crazy

1986
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:24,740
crazy they're all crazy
 

1987
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:28,010
crazy they're all crazy
and my own I mean my own thoughts now I

1988
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:28,020
and my own I mean my own thoughts now I
 

1989
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,589
and my own I mean my own thoughts now I
I have to be

1990
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:30,599
I have to be
 

1991
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,710
I have to be
um very careful about the words I choose

1992
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:33,720
um very careful about the words I choose
 

1993
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,450
um very careful about the words I choose
because

1994
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:35,460
because
 

1995
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,690
because
I mean it's it's just like talking about

1996
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:38,700
I mean it's it's just like talking about
 

1997
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,069
I mean it's it's just like talking about
um the different interpretations of

1998
00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:40,079
um the different interpretations of
 

1999
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,430
um the different interpretations of
quantum mechanics it's once you get deep

2000
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:43,440
quantum mechanics it's once you get deep
 

2001
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,870
quantum mechanics it's once you get deep
enough

2002
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:44,880
enough
 

2003
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,910
enough
um it's so counter-intuitive and it's so

2004
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:46,920
um it's so counter-intuitive and it's so
 

2005
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,329
um it's so counter-intuitive and it's so
beyond anything we understand that they

2006
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:50,339
beyond anything we understand that they
 

2007
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,250
beyond anything we understand that they
all sound crazy many worlds sounds crazy

2008
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:52,260
all sound crazy many worlds sounds crazy
 

2009
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:53,990
all sound crazy many worlds sounds crazy
string theory I mean these are things we

2010
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,000
string theory I mean these are things we
 

2011
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,530
string theory I mean these are things we
just cannot get our minds around really

2012
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:56,540
just cannot get our minds around really
 

2013
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,990
just cannot get our minds around really
and so that's kind of that's the realm I

2014
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:00,000
and so that's kind of that's the realm I
 

2015
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,170
and so that's kind of that's the realm I
love to live in and love to explore in

2016
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:03,180
love to live in and love to explore in
 

2017
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,410
love to live in and love to explore in
and the realm that to my surprise my

2018
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,420
and the realm that to my surprise my
 

2019
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,030
and the realm that to my surprise my
interest in Consciousness has taken me

2020
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:08,040
interest in Consciousness has taken me
 

2021
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,950
interest in Consciousness has taken me
back to can I ask you a question on that

2022
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:09,960
back to can I ask you a question on that
 

2023
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,069
back to can I ask you a question on that
yeah uh just a side tangent how do you

2024
00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:13,079
yeah uh just a side tangent how do you
 

2025
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,810
yeah uh just a side tangent how do you
prevent when you're imagining yourself

2026
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:14,820
prevent when you're imagining yourself
 

2027
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,510
prevent when you're imagining yourself
to be a p tendril how do you prevent

2028
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:17,520
to be a p tendril how do you prevent
 

2029
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,430
to be a p tendril how do you prevent
from going crazy I mean this is kind of

2030
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:19,440
from going crazy I mean this is kind of
 

2031
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,770
from going crazy I mean this is kind of
the Nietzsche question of like uh you

2032
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:21,780
the Nietzsche question of like uh you
 

2033
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,589
the Nietzsche question of like uh you
have to be very careful thinking outside

2034
00:39:24,589 --> 00:39:24,599
have to be very careful thinking outside
 

2035
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:27,349
have to be very careful thinking outside
the Norms of society

2036
00:39:27,349 --> 00:39:27,359
the Norms of society
 

2037
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,569
the Norms of society
because you might fall off like mentally

2038
00:39:29,569 --> 00:39:29,579
because you might fall off like mentally
 

2039
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:32,450
because you might fall off like mentally
you're so connected as a human to the

2040
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:32,460
you're so connected as a human to the
 

2041
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,910
you're so connected as a human to the
the collective intelligence yeah that in

2042
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:34,920
the collective intelligence yeah that in
 

2043
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,530
the collective intelligence yeah that in
order to question intuitions you have to

2044
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:36,540
order to question intuitions you have to
 

2045
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,109
order to question intuitions you have to
step aside step outside of it for a

2046
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:39,119
step aside step outside of it for a
 

2047
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,510
step aside step outside of it for a
brief moment how do you prevent yourself

2048
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:41,520
brief moment how do you prevent yourself
 

2049
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,349
brief moment how do you prevent yourself
from going crazy I think I used to think

2050
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:45,359
from going crazy I think I used to think
 

2051
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:47,930
from going crazy I think I used to think
that was a concern

2052
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:47,940
that was a concern
 

2053
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,730
that was a concern
um and then you can learn so much about

2054
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:49,740
um and then you can learn so much about
 

2055
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:52,010
um and then you can learn so much about
the brain no and I've and I've had and

2056
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,020
the brain no and I've and I've had and
 

2057
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:54,050
the brain no and I've and I've had and
I've had experiences of deep depression

2058
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:54,060
I've had experiences of deep depression
 

2059
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,849
I've had experiences of deep depression
and I struggled with anxiety my whole

2060
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:55,859
and I struggled with anxiety my whole
 

2061
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:57,109
and I struggled with anxiety my whole
life

2062
00:39:57,109 --> 00:39:57,119
life
 

2063
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,670
life
I think in order to be a good scientist

2064
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:01,680
I think in order to be a good scientist
 

2065
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:06,410
I think in order to be a good scientist
and in order to be a truthfully you know

2066
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:06,420
and in order to be a truthfully you know
 

2067
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:08,870
and in order to be a truthfully you know
let's say um

2068
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:08,880
let's say um
 

2069
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,750
let's say um
to allow yourself to be curious and

2070
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:11,760
to allow yourself to be curious and
 

2071
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:14,329
to allow yourself to be curious and
honest in your curiosity I think it's

2072
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:14,339
honest in your curiosity I think it's
 

2073
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,990
honest in your curiosity I think it's
inevitable that lots of ideas and

2074
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
inevitable that lots of ideas and
 

2075
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,290
inevitable that lots of ideas and
theories and hypotheses will just sound

2076
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:21,300
theories and hypotheses will just sound
 

2077
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:25,430
theories and hypotheses will just sound
crazy and that is always how we've

2078
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
crazy and that is always how we've
 

2079
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:28,130
crazy and that is always how we've
Advanced science and maybe you know nine

2080
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:28,140
Advanced science and maybe you know nine
 

2081
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,490
Advanced science and maybe you know nine
out of ten ideas are crazy and you crazy

2082
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:31,500
out of ten ideas are crazy and you crazy
 

2083
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,609
out of ten ideas are crazy and you crazy
meaning they're actually not correct

2084
00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:34,619
meaning they're actually not correct
 

2085
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:35,210
meaning they're actually not correct
um

2086
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,220
um
 

2087
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,089
um
but all of I mean it's as I said all of

2088
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:38,099
but all of I mean it's as I said all of
 

2089
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,250
but all of I mean it's as I said all of
the big scientific breakthroughs all of

2090
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:40,260
the big scientific breakthroughs all of
 

2091
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:43,970
the big scientific breakthroughs all of
the truths we've uncovered that are the

2092
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:43,980
the truths we've uncovered that are the
 

2093
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,829
the truths we've uncovered that are the
um

2094
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:44,839
um
 

2095
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,150
um
earth-shattering truths that we uncover

2096
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:47,160
earth-shattering truths that we uncover
 

2097
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,150
earth-shattering truths that we uncover
they really do sound crazy at first so I

2098
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
they really do sound crazy at first so I
 

2099
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,390
they really do sound crazy at first so I
don't think one necessarily leads to a

2100
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:53,400
don't think one necessarily leads to a
 

2101
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,190
don't think one necessarily leads to a
type of mental illness I see mental

2102
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:55,200
type of mental illness I see mental
 

2103
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,829
type of mental illness I see mental
illness in a very different category and

2104
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:57,839
illness in a very different category and
 

2105
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:00,770
illness in a very different category and
I think some people

2106
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:00,780
I think some people
 

2107
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:03,190
I think some people
are more susceptible to being

2108
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:03,200
are more susceptible to being
 

2109
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,750
are more susceptible to being
destabilized by this type of thinking

2110
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
destabilized by this type of thinking
 

2111
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,210
destabilized by this type of thinking
and that might be a legitimate concern

2112
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:08,220
and that might be a legitimate concern
 

2113
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,710
and that might be a legitimate concern
for some people that kind of being

2114
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:09,720
for some people that kind of being
 

2115
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,870
for some people that kind of being
grounded in everyday life

2116
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:11,880
grounded in everyday life
 

2117
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,230
grounded in everyday life
is important for my psychological health

2118
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:15,240
is important for my psychological health
 

2119
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,470
is important for my psychological health
the more time I spend thinking about the

2120
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:18,480
the more time I spend thinking about the
 

2121
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,450
the more time I spend thinking about the
bigger picture and

2122
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:20,460
bigger picture and
 

2123
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:24,589
bigger picture and
outside of everyday life the more

2124
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:24,599
outside of everyday life the more
 

2125
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:29,089
outside of everyday life the more
happy I I am the more expansive I feel

2126
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:29,099
happy I I am the more expansive I feel
 

2127
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,310
happy I I am the more expansive I feel
um I mean it feels it feels nourishing

2128
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:31,320
um I mean it feels it feels nourishing
 

2129
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,750
um I mean it feels it feels nourishing
to me it feels like it makes me more

2130
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:32,760
to me it feels like it makes me more
 

2131
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,870
to me it feels like it makes me more
sane not less well that's a happiness

2132
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:35,880
sane not less well that's a happiness
 

2133
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,150
sane not less well that's a happiness
but in terms of your ability to see the

2134
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
but in terms of your ability to see the
 

2135
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:42,410
but in terms of your ability to see the
truth that you can be happy and uh guess

2136
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:42,420
truth that you can be happy and uh guess
 

2137
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,510
truth that you can be happy and uh guess
I don't see mental illness necessarily

2138
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:44,520
I don't see mental illness necessarily
 

2139
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,470
I don't see mental illness necessarily
being linked to Truth Or Not truth so we

2140
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
being linked to Truth Or Not truth so we
 

2141
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,210
being linked to Truth Or Not truth so we
were talking about minimizing mental

2142
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,220
were talking about minimizing mental
 

2143
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,450
were talking about minimizing mental
illness yeah but also truth is a

2144
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:53,460
illness yeah but also truth is a
 

2145
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,790
illness yeah but also truth is a
different dimension so you have to you

2146
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:55,800
different dimension so you have to you
 

2147
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,829
different dimension so you have to you
can go crazy in both directions you can

2148
00:41:57,829 --> 00:41:57,839
can go crazy in both directions you can
 

2149
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:01,430
can go crazy in both directions you can
uh like you know you could be extremely

2150
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
uh like you know you could be extremely
 

2151
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,329
uh like you know you could be extremely
happy and they are uh flat earthers you

2152
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:05,339
happy and they are uh flat earthers you
 

2153
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:06,829
happy and they are uh flat earthers you
can believe the Earth is flat right

2154
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:06,839
can believe the Earth is flat right
 

2155
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:09,710
can believe the Earth is flat right
because there actually I mean I'm sure

2156
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:09,720
because there actually I mean I'm sure
 

2157
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,030
because there actually I mean I'm sure
there's good books on this but it's

2158
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,040
there's good books on this but it's
 

2159
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,730
there's good books on this but it's
somehow really comforting it's fun and

2160
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:13,740
somehow really comforting it's fun and
 

2161
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,250
somehow really comforting it's fun and
comforting to believe you've figured out

2162
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:16,260
comforting to believe you've figured out
 

2163
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,829
comforting to believe you've figured out
the thing that everybody else hasn't

2164
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:18,839
the thing that everybody else hasn't
 

2165
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:20,510
the thing that everybody else hasn't
figured out I think that's what

2166
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:20,520
figured out I think that's what
 

2167
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,730
figured out I think that's what
conspiracy theories always provide

2168
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:22,740
conspiracy theories always provide
 

2169
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,089
conspiracy theories always provide
people why is this so fun is so fun it's

2170
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:26,099
people why is this so fun is so fun it's
 

2171
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:29,089
people why is this so fun is so fun it's
it's except when it's dangerous uh you

2172
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:29,099
it's except when it's dangerous uh you
 

2173
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,829
it's except when it's dangerous uh you
know yeah but even then it's probably

2174
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:30,839
know yeah but even then it's probably
 

2175
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,329
know yeah but even then it's probably
fun but then you shouldn't do it because

2176
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:32,339
fun but then you shouldn't do it because
 

2177
00:42:32,339 --> 00:42:33,609
fun but then you shouldn't do it because
it's unethical

2178
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:33,619
it's unethical
 

2179
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:36,470
it's unethical
uh anyway so it's not true I'm not a fan

2180
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:36,480
uh anyway so it's not true I'm not a fan
 

2181
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,870
uh anyway so it's not true I'm not a fan
of following

2182
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:37,880
of following
 

2183
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,990
of following
well that makes one of us I don't know I

2184
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:42,000
well that makes one of us I don't know I
 

2185
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,210
well that makes one of us I don't know I
there's probably a fascinating story to

2186
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:44,220
there's probably a fascinating story to
 

2187
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:47,510
there's probably a fascinating story to
what why conspiracy theories are so

2188
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
what why conspiracy theories are so
 

2189
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,490
what why conspiracy theories are so
um so compelling to us human beings

2190
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:49,500
um so compelling to us human beings
 

2191
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,310
um so compelling to us human beings
that's deeper than just fun internet

2192
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:52,320
that's deeper than just fun internet
 

2193
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,310
that's deeper than just fun internet
stuff yeah I'm very interested in why

2194
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:55,320
stuff yeah I'm very interested in why
 

2195
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,930
stuff yeah I'm very interested in why
they're so compelling to some people and

2196
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:56,940
they're so compelling to some people and
 

2197
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,670
they're so compelling to some people and
not others I feel like there must be

2198
00:42:58,670 --> 00:42:58,680
not others I feel like there must be
 

2199
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,130
not others I feel like there must be
some difference that at some point will

2200
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,140
some difference that at some point will
 

2201
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,349
some difference that at some point will
be able to discover

2202
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:03,359
be able to discover
 

2203
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,710
be able to discover
um yeah yeah and because some people are

2204
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:06,720
um yeah yeah and because some people are
 

2205
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,630
um yeah yeah and because some people are
just not susceptible to them and some

2206
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:08,640
just not susceptible to them and some
 

2207
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,250
just not susceptible to them and some
people are and I wonder really

2208
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:10,260
people are and I wonder really
 

2209
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,349
people are and I wonder really
correlation drawn to them because I feel

2210
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:12,359
correlation drawn to them because I feel
 

2211
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:15,710
correlation drawn to them because I feel
like the kind of thinking that allows

2212
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:15,720
like the kind of thinking that allows
 

2213
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,349
like the kind of thinking that allows
for you to be open to conspiracy

2214
00:43:18,349 --> 00:43:18,359
for you to be open to conspiracy
 

2215
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:20,210
for you to be open to conspiracy
theories is also the kind of thinking

2216
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:20,220
theories is also the kind of thinking
 

2217
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,849
theories is also the kind of thinking
that leads to brilliant breakthroughs in

2218
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:22,859
that leads to brilliant breakthroughs in
 

2219
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,170
that leads to brilliant breakthroughs in
science

2220
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:24,180
science
 

2221
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,190
science
sort of willingness to go to Crazy Land

2222
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:30,200

 

2223
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,710

really yeah

2224
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:33,720
really yeah
 

2225
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,349
really yeah
see you don't see the connection between

2226
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:36,359
see you don't see the connection between
 

2227
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:39,950
see you don't see the connection between
thinking the Earth is flat and

2228
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:39,960
thinking the Earth is flat and
 

2229
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,370
thinking the Earth is flat and
um coming up with this flat is following

2230
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:43,380
um coming up with this flat is following
 

2231
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:47,530
um coming up with this flat is following
your intuitions and not being open to

2232
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:47,540
your intuitions and not being open to
 

2233
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:50,150
your intuitions and not being open to
counter-intuitive ideas it's like it's a

2234
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
counter-intuitive ideas it's like it's a
 

2235
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,490
counter-intuitive ideas it's like it's a
close it's a very closed way of viewing

2236
00:43:52,490 --> 00:43:52,500
close it's a very closed way of viewing
 

2237
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,349
close it's a very closed way of viewing
things saying it's actually it's not the

2238
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:54,359
things saying it's actually it's not the
 

2239
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,270
things saying it's actually it's not the
way you feel there's a there's there's

2240
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:56,280
way you feel there's a there's there's
 

2241
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,069
way you feel there's a there's there's
information that tells us this is

2242
00:43:58,069 --> 00:43:58,079
information that tells us this is
 

2243
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,230
information that tells us this is
there's something else going on and

2244
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:00,240
there's something else going on and
 

2245
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,210
there's something else going on and
that type of person will say no it's

2246
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:02,220
that type of person will say no it's
 

2247
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:05,089
that type of person will say no it's
exact it's the way it feels to me no no

2248
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:05,099
exact it's the way it feels to me no no
 

2249
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:07,190
exact it's the way it feels to me no no
but wait a minute there's a mainstream

2250
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
but wait a minute there's a mainstream
 

2251
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,910
but wait a minute there's a mainstream
Narrative of science that says the Earth

2252
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:10,920
Narrative of science that says the Earth
 

2253
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,829
Narrative of science that says the Earth
is round right like and I think a flat

2254
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
is round right like and I think a flat
 

2255
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,470
is round right like and I think a flat
Earth see I admire the very first step

2256
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:18,480
Earth see I admire the very first step
 

2257
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,170
Earth see I admire the very first step
of a flatter I don't I don't admire the

2258
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:21,180
of a flatter I don't I don't admire the
 

2259
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,630
of a flatter I don't I don't admire the
the full Journey but the first step is

2260
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:23,640
the full Journey but the first step is
 

2261
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,609
the full Journey but the first step is
think if you're open to evidence then

2262
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:25,619
think if you're open to evidence then
 

2263
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:27,890
think if you're open to evidence then
the evidence clearly takes you in One

2264
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:27,900
the evidence clearly takes you in One
 

2265
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,809
the evidence clearly takes you in One
Direction right but you have to ask the

2266
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:29,819
Direction right but you have to ask the
 

2267
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,450
Direction right but you have to ask the
question you have to ask

2268
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:32,460
question you have to ask
 

2269
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:34,609
question you have to ask
to me this is like first principles

2270
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:34,619
to me this is like first principles
 

2271
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,970
to me this is like first principles
thinking yeah the earth looks flat so

2272
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:37,980
thinking yeah the earth looks flat so
 

2273
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,069
thinking yeah the earth looks flat so
I'm gonna look around here and I I like

2274
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:43,079
I'm gonna look around here and I I like
 

2275
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,910
I'm gonna look around here and I I like
how crazy is it that the Earth is round

2276
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:46,920
how crazy is it that the Earth is round
 

2277
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,430
how crazy is it that the Earth is round
and there's a thing called gravity that

2278
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:49,440
and there's a thing called gravity that
 

2279
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,370
and there's a thing called gravity that
operates between objects that's

2280
00:44:52,370 --> 00:44:52,380
operates between objects that's
 

2281
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,890
operates between objects that's
related to the mass of the object right

2282
00:44:54,890 --> 00:44:54,900
related to the mass of the object right
 

2283
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,290
related to the mass of the object right
that's crazy yes the truth is often

2284
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:57,300
that's crazy yes the truth is often
 

2285
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,450
that's crazy yes the truth is often
crazier than what what the situation

2286
00:44:59,450 --> 00:44:59,460
crazier than what what the situation
 

2287
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,550
crazier than what what the situation
feels it could be a good step is to

2288
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:01,560
feels it could be a good step is to
 

2289
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,170
feels it could be a good step is to
question what everyone is saying and

2290
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:03,180
question what everyone is saying and
 

2291
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,270
question what everyone is saying and
then I know what you mean to be

2292
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
then I know what you mean to be
 

2293
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,309
then I know what you mean to be
skeptical about the it's the authority

2294
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:07,319
skeptical about the it's the authority
 

2295
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,650
skeptical about the it's the authority
yeah but I think that the and the

2296
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:09,660
yeah but I think that the and the
 

2297
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:12,309
yeah but I think that the and the
authority in not in some kind of weird

2298
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:12,319
authority in not in some kind of weird
 

2299
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,690
authority in not in some kind of weird
uh current where everyone questions

2300
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:14,700
uh current where everyone questions
 

2301
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,550
uh current where everyone questions
institutions but more like the authority

2302
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:16,560
institutions but more like the authority
 

2303
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,430
institutions but more like the authority
of the senior scientists the the junior

2304
00:45:19,430 --> 00:45:19,440
of the senior scientists the the junior
 

2305
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,230
of the senior scientists the the junior
scientists coming up wait a minute why

2306
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,240
scientists coming up wait a minute why
 

2307
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,329
scientists coming up wait a minute why
have we been doing things this way and

2308
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:23,339
have we been doing things this way and
 

2309
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,210
have we been doing things this way and
that that first step I feel like

2310
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:26,220
that that first step I feel like
 

2311
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:28,370
that that first step I feel like
that rebelliousness or that

2312
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:28,380
that rebelliousness or that
 

2313
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:31,190
that rebelliousness or that
open-mindedness or maybe like resistance

2314
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:31,200
open-mindedness or maybe like resistance
 

2315
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,870
open-mindedness or maybe like resistance
to or maybe curiosity that's uh

2316
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:35,880
to or maybe curiosity that's uh
 

2317
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,410
to or maybe curiosity that's uh
uh that is not affected by whatever the

2318
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:39,420
uh that is not affected by whatever the
 

2319
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,990
uh that is not affected by whatever the
mainstream science says of today yes I

2320
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:42,000
mainstream science says of today yes I
 

2321
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:42,910
mainstream science says of today yes I
feel like

2322
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:42,920
feel like
 

2323
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,290
feel like
mainstream science has never been

2324
00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:45,300
mainstream science has never been
 

2325
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,089
mainstream science has never been
mainstream and it's always a struggle

2326
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:47,099
mainstream and it's always a struggle
 

2327
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,010
mainstream and it's always a struggle
for science to become mainstream it's

2328
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:49,020
for science to become mainstream it's
 

2329
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,329
for science to become mainstream it's
part of the reason why I started doing

2330
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:50,339
part of the reason why I started doing
 

2331
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:51,650
part of the reason why I started doing
the work I did actually helping

2332
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:51,660
the work I did actually helping
 

2333
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,630
the work I did actually helping
scientists make their work more

2334
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:53,640
scientists make their work more
 

2335
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,670
scientists make their work more
accessible is that

2336
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
accessible is that
 

2337
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,550
accessible is that
it's usually not yeah it's usually not

2338
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:58,560
it's usually not yeah it's usually not
 

2339
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,010
it's usually not yeah it's usually not
here's advice for scientists be more

2340
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:01,020
here's advice for scientists be more
 

2341
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,710
here's advice for scientists be more
interesting and much more important be

2342
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:03,720
interesting and much more important be
 

2343
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,089
interesting and much more important be
less arrogant

2344
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:05,099
less arrogant
 

2345
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,390
less arrogant
so arrogance uh there's a there's a uh

2346
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
so arrogance uh there's a there's a uh
 

2347
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,130
so arrogance uh there's a there's a uh
there's very little money in science and

2348
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:10,140
there's very little money in science and
 

2349
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,510
there's very little money in science and
so everyone is fighting for that money

2350
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
so everyone is fighting for that money
 

2351
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,010
so everyone is fighting for that money
and they become more and more arrogant

2352
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:13,020
and they become more and more arrogant
 

2353
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,530
and they become more and more arrogant
and siled I don't know why I will say

2354
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:15,540
and siled I don't know why I will say
 

2355
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,990
and siled I don't know why I will say
that the scientists I know and some of

2356
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:18,000
that the scientists I know and some of
 

2357
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,670
that the scientists I know and some of
them are very well known very famous

2358
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
them are very well known very famous
 

2359
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,530
them are very well known very famous
scientists are the least arrogant people

2360
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:21,540
scientists are the least arrogant people
 

2361
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:25,609
scientists are the least arrogant people
I've ever met that scientists in general

2362
00:46:25,609 --> 00:46:25,619
I've ever met that scientists in general
 

2363
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:28,430
I've ever met that scientists in general
their personalities are

2364
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:28,440
their personalities are
 

2365
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,329
their personalities are
more open more humble more likely to say

2366
00:46:32,329 --> 00:46:32,339
more open more humble more likely to say
 

2367
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:34,670
more open more humble more likely to say
they say they just don't know

2368
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:34,680
they say they just don't know
 

2369
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,849
they say they just don't know
because I've been involved a lot in the

2370
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:37,859
because I've been involved a lot in the
 

2371
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:40,190
because I've been involved a lot in the
science writing and how the media

2372
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:40,200
science writing and how the media
 

2373
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,089
science writing and how the media
portrays so one of scientists the

2374
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,099
portrays so one of scientists the
 

2375
00:46:44,099 --> 00:46:45,710
portrays so one of scientists the
scientific community's greatest

2376
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:45,720
scientific community's greatest
 

2377
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,569
scientific community's greatest
frustration

2378
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:47,579
frustration
 

2379
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,670
frustration
is how their work gets presented in the

2380
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,680
is how their work gets presented in the
 

2381
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,690
is how their work gets presented in the
media

2382
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:50,700
media
 

2383
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,270
media
and a lot of the time that is the for I

2384
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,280
and a lot of the time that is the for I
 

2385
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,430
and a lot of the time that is the for I
would say that's the main frustration is

2386
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:55,440
would say that's the main frustration is
 

2387
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,410
would say that's the main frustration is
there's some new breakthrough there's

2388
00:46:57,410 --> 00:46:57,420
there's some new breakthrough there's
 

2389
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,730
there's some new breakthrough there's
something and the scientists will be

2390
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:58,740
something and the scientists will be
 

2391
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:01,130
something and the scientists will be
saying we're not sure where you know

2392
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:01,140
saying we're not sure where you know
 

2393
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,630
saying we're not sure where you know
it's going to take five years and the me

2394
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
it's going to take five years and the me
 

2395
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,490
it's going to take five years and the me
you know no one likes to write a story

2396
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:04,500
you know no one likes to write a story
 

2397
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,990
you know no one likes to write a story
about something that may or may not be

2398
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,000
about something that may or may not be
 

2399
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,609
about something that may or may not be
true they think it's true they're going

2400
00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:07,619
true they think it's true they're going
 

2401
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:09,829
true they think it's true they're going
to take five years testing it and so the

2402
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:09,839
to take five years testing it and so the
 

2403
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,829
to take five years testing it and so the
headline will be

2404
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:11,839
headline will be
 

2405
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:14,750
headline will be
neuroscientists discovered you know they

2406
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:14,760
neuroscientists discovered you know they
 

2407
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,809
neuroscientists discovered you know they
want The Sensational and so I think the

2408
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:17,819
want The Sensational and so I think the
 

2409
00:47:17,819 --> 00:47:20,930
want The Sensational and so I think the
public often gets the false impression

2410
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:20,940
public often gets the false impression
 

2411
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:25,250
public often gets the false impression
that the scientists are arrogant and I

2412
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:25,260
that the scientists are arrogant and I
 

2413
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,109
that the scientists are arrogant and I
really don't find that to be the case

2414
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:27,119
really don't find that to be the case
 

2415
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,809
really don't find that to be the case
and I've worked with all kinds of people

2416
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:29,819
and I've worked with all kinds of people
 

2417
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:32,569
and I've worked with all kinds of people
artists and

2418
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:32,579
artists and
 

2419
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,990
artists and
my life path has has taken a

2420
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
my life path has has taken a
 

2421
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,849
my life path has has taken a
strange you've met some incredible

2422
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:37,859
strange you've met some incredible
 

2423
00:47:37,859 --> 00:47:39,410
strange you've met some incredible
people you work with some incredible

2424
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:39,420
people you work with some incredible
 

2425
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:43,430
people you work with some incredible
people so let's the the crazy topic of

2426
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
people so let's the the crazy topic of
 

2427
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,829
people so let's the the crazy topic of
free will I mean I just we have to link

2428
00:47:45,829 --> 00:47:45,839
free will I mean I just we have to link
 

2429
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:47,230
free will I mean I just we have to link
up on this because okay

2430
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:47,240
up on this because okay
 

2431
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,750
up on this because okay
uh so the plant all right can you can

2432
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:50,760
uh so the plant all right can you can
 

2433
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,030
uh so the plant all right can you can
you try to steal man the case that

2434
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,040
you try to steal man the case that
 

2435
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,530
you try to steal man the case that
there's something really special about

2436
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:54,540
there's something really special about
 

2437
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:56,329
there's something really special about
humans

2438
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:56,339
humans
 

2439
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,069
humans
that there is a fundamental difference

2440
00:47:58,069 --> 00:47:58,079
that there is a fundamental difference
 

2441
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:02,030
that there is a fundamental difference
between us and the the P tendril you

2442
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:02,040
between us and the the P tendril you
 

2443
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,630
between us and the the P tendril you
know humans are clearly very special in

2444
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:05,640
know humans are clearly very special in
 

2445
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,089
know humans are clearly very special in
the evolution of organisms on Earth

2446
00:48:08,089 --> 00:48:08,099
the evolution of organisms on Earth
 

2447
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:10,190
the evolution of organisms on Earth
absolutely yeah could that have been the

2448
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:10,200
absolutely yeah could that have been the
 

2449
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,569
absolutely yeah could that have been the
magic leap

2450
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:11,579
magic leap
 

2451
00:48:11,579 --> 00:48:14,990
magic leap
could Consciousness been like the

2452
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:15,000
could Consciousness been like the
 

2453
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,470
could Consciousness been like the
invention of the the eukaryotic cell or

2454
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:18,480
invention of the the eukaryotic cell or
 

2455
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,790
invention of the the eukaryotic cell or
something like that well then I mean so

2456
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:19,800
something like that well then I mean so
 

2457
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,109
something like that well then I mean so
I have to get clear on what you're

2458
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:21,119
I have to get clear on what you're
 

2459
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:23,809
I have to get clear on what you're
asking so so are you

2460
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:23,819
asking so so are you
 

2461
00:48:23,819 --> 00:48:26,390
asking so so are you
are you coming from a place of wondering

2462
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:26,400
are you coming from a place of wondering
 

2463
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,530
are you coming from a place of wondering
if we are the only conscious mammals yes

2464
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:30,540
if we are the only conscious mammals yes
 

2465
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,290
if we are the only conscious mammals yes
do you really think that's a question

2466
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:33,300
do you really think that's a question
 

2467
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,630
do you really think that's a question
can you make a case for it

2468
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:35,640
can you make a case for it
 

2469
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,150
can you make a case for it
do you really think that's a question

2470
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:38,160
do you really think that's a question
 

2471
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,250
do you really think that's a question
take one step back we look out at the

2472
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:40,260
take one step back we look out at the
 

2473
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,530
take one step back we look out at the
universe

2474
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:42,540
universe
 

2475
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,950
universe
um at this point in in our scientific

2476
00:48:45,950 --> 00:48:45,960
um at this point in in our scientific
 

2477
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,809
um at this point in in our scientific
understanding we know that essentially

2478
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:47,819
understanding we know that essentially
 

2479
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:49,190
understanding we know that essentially
if we're all made of the same

2480
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:49,200
if we're all made of the same
 

2481
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,829
if we're all made of the same
ingredients right they're they're atoms

2482
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:51,839
ingredients right they're they're atoms
 

2483
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:54,710
ingredients right they're they're atoms
in the universe doing their thing they

2484
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:54,720
in the universe doing their thing they
 

2485
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,210
in the universe doing their thing they
find themselves in different

2486
00:48:56,210 --> 00:48:56,220
find themselves in different
 

2487
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,309
find themselves in different
configurations based on the laws of

2488
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,319
configurations based on the laws of
 

2489
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,990
configurations based on the laws of
physics

2490
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
physics
 

2491
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,510
physics
um and then the question is if we look

2492
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:02,520
um and then the question is if we look
 

2493
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,730
um and then the question is if we look
out at all of the configurations of

2494
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:04,740
out at all of the configurations of
 

2495
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,130
out at all of the configurations of
atoms in the universe and ask

2496
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:07,140
atoms in the universe and ask
 

2497
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,710
atoms in the universe and ask
which of these entail conscious

2498
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:09,720
which of these entail conscious
 

2499
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:11,750
which of these entail conscious
experiences which of these have a felt

2500
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:11,760
experiences which of these have a felt
 

2501
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,170
experiences which of these have a felt
experience of being the matter they are

2502
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:15,180
experience of being the matter they are
 

2503
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,410
experience of being the matter they are
and there are really only two broadly

2504
00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:18,420
and there are really only two broadly
 

2505
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:21,530
and there are really only two broadly
speaking they're really only two

2506
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:21,540
speaking they're really only two
 

2507
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,109
speaking they're really only two
um assumptions to make here and the

2508
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:24,119
um assumptions to make here and the
 

2509
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:26,510
um assumptions to make here and the
first one is the one that science has

2510
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:26,520
first one is the one that science has
 

2511
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,849
first one is the one that science has
has taken and that I have for most of my

2512
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:28,859
has taken and that I have for most of my
 

2513
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:30,710
has taken and that I have for most of my
career as well and that in many ways

2514
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:30,720
career as well and that in many ways
 

2515
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,349
career as well and that in many ways
makes the most sense which is

2516
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
makes the most sense which is
 

2517
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,690
makes the most sense which is
electrons aren't conscious tables aren't

2518
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:35,700
electrons aren't conscious tables aren't
 

2519
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,730
electrons aren't conscious tables aren't
there's no felt experience there but at

2520
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:37,740
there's no felt experience there but at
 

2521
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:41,030
there's no felt experience there but at
a certain point in complex processing

2522
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
a certain point in complex processing
 

2523
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,190
a certain point in complex processing
um that processing entails an experience

2524
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:43,200
um that processing entails an experience
 

2525
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,290
um that processing entails an experience
of being that processing now that that's

2526
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:45,300
of being that processing now that that's
 

2527
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,329
of being that processing now that that's
just a fascinating fact all on its own

2528
00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:47,339
just a fascinating fact all on its own
 

2529
00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:49,130
just a fascinating fact all on its own
and I love to spend time thinking about

2530
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,140
and I love to spend time thinking about
 

2531
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,650
and I love to spend time thinking about
that but the so the question is does

2532
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
that but the so the question is does
 

2533
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:53,930
that but the so the question is does
Consciousness Arise at some point are

2534
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:53,940
Consciousness Arise at some point are
 

2535
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,030
Consciousness Arise at some point are
some of these collections of atoms

2536
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:56,040
some of these collections of atoms
 

2537
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,950
some of these collections of atoms
conscious

2538
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:57,960
conscious
 

2539
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,990
conscious
um or are all of them because we know

2540
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
um or are all of them because we know
 

2541
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,730
um or are all of them because we know
the answer isn't none you know I know

2542
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:01,740
the answer isn't none you know I know
 

2543
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:03,829
the answer isn't none you know I know
that I'm at least having a conscious

2544
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
that I'm at least having a conscious
 

2545
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,089
that I'm at least having a conscious
experience I know the conscious

2546
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:05,099
experience I know the conscious
 

2547
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,390
experience I know the conscious
experiences exist in the universe

2548
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:08,400
experiences exist in the universe
 

2549
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,290
experiences exist in the universe
um

2550
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:09,300
um
 

2551
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,930
um
and so the answer isn't none so so the

2552
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:11,940
and so the answer isn't none so so the
 

2553
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,530
and so the answer isn't none so so the
answer has to be all or some and this is

2554
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:15,540
answer has to be all or some and this is
 

2555
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:19,309
answer has to be all or some and this is
a starting assumption that you're really

2556
00:50:19,309 --> 00:50:19,319
a starting assumption that you're really
 

2557
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:22,370
a starting assumption that you're really
kind of forced to to make and that it's

2558
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:22,380
kind of forced to to make and that it's
 

2559
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,010
kind of forced to to make and that it's
all or some all or some I would say one

2560
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:25,020
all or some all or some I would say one
 

2561
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,990
all or some all or some I would say one
is some also we either need an

2562
00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:27,000
is some also we either need an
 

2563
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,430
is some also we either need an
explanation for why there's

2564
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:28,440
explanation for why there's
 

2565
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,410
explanation for why there's
non-conscious matter in the universe and

2566
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:30,420
non-conscious matter in the universe and
 

2567
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,329
non-conscious matter in the universe and
then something happens for Consciousness

2568
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:32,339
then something happens for Consciousness
 

2569
00:50:32,339 --> 00:50:35,150
then something happens for Consciousness
to come into being or it's part of the

2570
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:35,160
to come into being or it's part of the
 

2571
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,309
to come into being or it's part of the
fundamental nature of reality

2572
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:37,319
fundamental nature of reality
 

2573
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:39,050
fundamental nature of reality
it's also

2574
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:39,060
it's also
 

2575
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,390
it's also
if Consciousness is a fundamental

2576
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:41,400
if Consciousness is a fundamental
 

2577
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:44,569
if Consciousness is a fundamental
property of reality it could also choose

2578
00:50:44,569 --> 00:50:44,579
property of reality it could also choose
 

2579
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,609
property of reality it could also choose
to not reveal itself until a certain

2580
00:50:46,609 --> 00:50:46,619
to not reveal itself until a certain
 

2581
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,829
to not reveal itself until a certain
complexity of organism

2582
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:48,839
complexity of organism
 

2583
00:50:48,839 --> 00:50:51,770
complexity of organism
I'm not sure what that means I'm not

2584
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:51,780
I'm not sure what that means I'm not
 

2585
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,270
I'm not sure what that means I'm not
sure what that means either like like

2586
00:50:53,270 --> 00:50:53,280
sure what that means either like like
 

2587
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,370
sure what that means either like like
the flame of Consciousness does not

2588
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:55,380
the flame of Consciousness does not
 

2589
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,329
the flame of Consciousness does not
start burning on until

2590
00:50:59,329 --> 00:50:59,339
start burning on until
 

2591
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:01,730
start burning on until
um a certain complexity of organisms

2592
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:01,740
um a certain complexity of organisms
 

2593
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,170
um a certain complexity of organisms
able to reveal I don't think we can look

2594
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:03,180
able to reveal I don't think we can look
 

2595
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,930
able to reveal I don't think we can look
at Consciousness that way I don't think

2596
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:05,940
at Consciousness that way I don't think
 

2597
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,849
at Consciousness that way I don't think
um I mean many people like to try to

2598
00:51:07,849 --> 00:51:07,859
um I mean many people like to try to
 

2599
00:51:07,859 --> 00:51:09,410
um I mean many people like to try to
make that argument that it's a spectrum

2600
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:09,420
make that argument that it's a spectrum
 

2601
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,210
make that argument that it's a spectrum
why do we have to say all or nothing

2602
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:11,220
why do we have to say all or nothing
 

2603
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:13,910
why do we have to say all or nothing
maybe and I agree that I actually think

2604
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:13,920
maybe and I agree that I actually think
 

2605
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,770
maybe and I agree that I actually think
it is a spectrum

2606
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:15,780
it is a spectrum
 

2607
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,349
it is a spectrum
um but it's a spectrum of content not of

2608
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:18,359
um but it's a spectrum of content not of
 

2609
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,569
um but it's a spectrum of content not of
Consciousness itself so

2610
00:51:20,569 --> 00:51:20,579
Consciousness itself so
 

2611
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,549
Consciousness itself so
um you know if a worm has some level of

2612
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
um you know if a worm has some level of
 

2613
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,130
um you know if a worm has some level of
conscious experience it is extremely

2614
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:25,140
conscious experience it is extremely
 

2615
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,170
conscious experience it is extremely
minimal something we could never imagine

2616
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:27,180
minimal something we could never imagine
 

2617
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:29,809
minimal something we could never imagine
being having the complex experience you

2618
00:51:29,809 --> 00:51:29,819
being having the complex experience you
 

2619
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:31,370
being having the complex experience you
and I have

2620
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:31,380
and I have
 

2621
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,250
and I have
um maybe some felt sensation of pressure

2622
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:34,260
um maybe some felt sensation of pressure
 

2623
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:37,010
um maybe some felt sensation of pressure
or heat or something super basic right

2624
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:37,020
or heat or something super basic right
 

2625
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:39,049
or heat or something super basic right
so there's there's this range or even if

2626
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:39,059
so there's there's this range or even if
 

2627
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:40,250
so there's there's this range or even if
you just think of an infant you know

2628
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,260
you just think of an infant you know
 

2629
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:41,870
you just think of an infant you know
like the first the moment an infant

2630
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:41,880
like the first the moment an infant
 

2631
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,329
like the first the moment an infant
becomes conscious what that there's a

2632
00:51:44,329 --> 00:51:44,339
becomes conscious what that there's a
 

2633
00:51:44,339 --> 00:51:46,490
becomes conscious what that there's a
very very minimal experience of inputs

2634
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:46,500
very very minimal experience of inputs
 

2635
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:49,970
very very minimal experience of inputs
of sound and light and whatever it is

2636
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:49,980
of sound and light and whatever it is
 

2637
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:51,530
of sound and light and whatever it is
um and so there's a spectrum of content

2638
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:51,540
um and so there's a spectrum of content
 

2639
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:54,410
um and so there's a spectrum of content
there's a spectrum of how much

2640
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:54,420
there's a spectrum of how much
 

2641
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,530
there's a spectrum of how much
um a system is consciously experiencing

2642
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:57,540
um a system is consciously experiencing
 

2643
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,829
um a system is consciously experiencing
but there's a moment at which you get on

2644
00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:00,839
but there's a moment at which you get on
 

2645
00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:03,170
but there's a moment at which you get on
the Spectrum and that's and I truly

2646
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:03,180
the Spectrum and that's and I truly
 

2647
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,270
the Spectrum and that's and I truly
believe that that piece of it is binary

2648
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
believe that that piece of it is binary
 

2649
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,630
believe that that piece of it is binary
so if there's no conscious experience

2650
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:08,640
so if there's no conscious experience
 

2651
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,609
so if there's no conscious experience
there is no consciousness you can't say

2652
00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:10,619
there is no consciousness you can't say
 

2653
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:11,990
there is no consciousness you can't say
Consciousness is there it just hasn't

2654
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,000
Consciousness is there it just hasn't
 

2655
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,910
Consciousness is there it just hasn't
lit its flame yet if Consciousness is

2656
00:52:13,910 --> 00:52:13,920
lit its flame yet if Consciousness is
 

2657
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,470
lit its flame yet if Consciousness is
there there's an experience there by

2658
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:15,480
there there's an experience there by
 

2659
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,690
there there's an experience there by
definition it has to Arise at some point

2660
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:17,700
definition it has to Arise at some point
 

2661
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,490
definition it has to Arise at some point
or it has to always be there is it

2662
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:19,500
or it has to always be there is it
 

2663
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:23,530
or it has to always be there is it
possible to make the case that that

2664
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:23,540
possible to make the case that that
 

2665
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:26,690
possible to make the case that that
arising happens first

2666
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:26,700
arising happens first
 

2667
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,329
arising happens first
for the first time ever with homo

2668
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:29,339
for the first time ever with homo
 

2669
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:30,770
for the first time ever with homo
sapiens

2670
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:30,780
sapiens
 

2671
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,890
sapiens
I think that is extremely unlikely what

2672
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:33,900
I think that is extremely unlikely what
 

2673
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,870
I think that is extremely unlikely what
I think is

2674
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:35,880
I think is
 

2675
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,030
I think is
more possible based on what we

2676
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:38,040
more possible based on what we
 

2677
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:43,190
more possible based on what we
understand about the brain is that it

2678
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
understand about the brain is that it
 

2679
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:48,349
understand about the brain is that it
arises in brains or nervous systems

2680
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:48,359
arises in brains or nervous systems
 

2681
00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,770
arises in brains or nervous systems
um and so then we're talking about flies

2682
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:51,780
um and so then we're talking about flies
 

2683
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,630
um and so then we're talking about flies
and bees and all kinds of things that

2684
00:52:53,630 --> 00:52:53,640
and bees and all kinds of things that
 

2685
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,329
and bees and all kinds of things that
kind of fall out of our

2686
00:52:56,329 --> 00:52:56,339
kind of fall out of our
 

2687
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,430
kind of fall out of our
our intuitions for whether they could be

2688
00:52:58,430 --> 00:52:58,440
our intuitions for whether they could be
 

2689
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,750
our intuitions for whether they could be
conscious or not but I think

2690
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:01,760
conscious or not but I think
 

2691
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,370
conscious or not but I think
especially once you talk about

2692
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:04,380
especially once you talk about
 

2693
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,190
especially once you talk about
more complex brains with many many more

2694
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:07,200
more complex brains with many many more
 

2695
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,990
more complex brains with many many more
neurons when you're talking about cats

2696
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:09,000
neurons when you're talking about cats
 

2697
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,390
neurons when you're talking about cats
and dogs and dolphins

2698
00:53:11,390 --> 00:53:11,400
and dogs and dolphins
 

2699
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,290
and dogs and dolphins
um it's very hard to see how there would

2700
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:15,300
um it's very hard to see how there would
 

2701
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,450
um it's very hard to see how there would
be a difference

2702
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:17,460
be a difference
 

2703
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:20,510
be a difference
between humans and other mammals in

2704
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:20,520
between humans and other mammals in
 

2705
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,710
between humans and other mammals in
terms of Consciousness was there

2706
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:21,720
terms of Consciousness was there
 

2707
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,930
terms of Consciousness was there
difference in terms of intelligence

2708
00:53:23,930 --> 00:53:23,940
difference in terms of intelligence
 

2709
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,450
difference in terms of intelligence
between humans and other mammals sure

2710
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:26,460
between humans and other mammals sure
 

2711
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:28,069
between humans and other mammals sure
not but like a fundamental leap in

2712
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:28,079
not but like a fundamental leap in
 

2713
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,870
not but like a fundamental leap in
intelligence it's hard to say

2714
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:29,880
intelligence it's hard to say
 

2715
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,870
intelligence it's hard to say
definitively I mean it depends on you

2716
00:53:32,870 --> 00:53:32,880
definitively I mean it depends on you
 

2717
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,130
definitively I mean it depends on you
know

2718
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:34,140
know
 

2719
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:36,829
know
how you define intelligence and all

2720
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:36,839
how you define intelligence and all
 

2721
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,750
how you define intelligence and all
kinds of things but obviously humans are

2722
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:38,760
kinds of things but obviously humans are
 

2723
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,609
kinds of things but obviously humans are
unique and capable of all kinds of

2724
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:40,619
unique and capable of all kinds of
 

2725
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,470
unique and capable of all kinds of
things that no other mammals are capable

2726
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:42,480
things that no other mammals are capable
 

2727
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,430
things that no other mammals are capable
of and there are important differences

2728
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
of and there are important differences
 

2729
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,430
of and there are important differences
and I don't think you need any magical

2730
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:49,440
and I don't think you need any magical
 

2731
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,470
and I don't think you need any magical
intervention of something outside of the

2732
00:53:51,470 --> 00:53:51,480
intervention of something outside of the
 

2733
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:54,290
intervention of something outside of the
physical world to explain it and the way

2734
00:53:54,290 --> 00:53:54,300
physical world to explain it and the way
 

2735
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,390
physical world to explain it and the way
I think about consciousness

2736
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
I think about consciousness
 

2737
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,849
I think about consciousness
I actually think it's part of the reason

2738
00:53:58,849 --> 00:53:58,859
I actually think it's part of the reason
 

2739
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:01,490
I actually think it's part of the reason
we're mistaken about consciousness

2740
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:01,500
we're mistaken about consciousness
 

2741
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,910
we're mistaken about consciousness
is because we are special in the ways

2742
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:04,920
is because we are special in the ways
 

2743
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:06,770
is because we are special in the ways
that we're special and because we're

2744
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:06,780
that we're special and because we're
 

2745
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,410
that we're special and because we're
complex creatures we have these complex

2746
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:09,420
complex creatures we have these complex
 

2747
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:11,750
complex creatures we have these complex
brains so I think we should probably get

2748
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:11,760
brains so I think we should probably get
 

2749
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,910
brains so I think we should probably get
into some of the details of why I think

2750
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:13,920
into some of the details of why I think
 

2751
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:14,990
into some of the details of why I think
um we're confused about what

2752
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:15,000
um we're confused about what
 

2753
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,210
um we're confused about what
Consciousness is yes but just to finish

2754
00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:17,220
Consciousness is yes but just to finish
 

2755
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,069
Consciousness is yes but just to finish
this point

2756
00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:19,079
this point
 

2757
00:54:19,079 --> 00:54:20,569
this point
I think

2758
00:54:20,569 --> 00:54:20,579
I think
 

2759
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:22,849
I think
that we don't actually have any evidence

2760
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:22,859
that we don't actually have any evidence
 

2761
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:25,010
that we don't actually have any evidence
that consciousness

2762
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:25,020
that consciousness
 

2763
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:27,950
that consciousness
is complex that it comes out of complex

2764
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:27,960
is complex that it comes out of complex
 

2765
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,530
is complex that it comes out of complex
processing that it's required for

2766
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:30,540
processing that it's required for
 

2767
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,630
processing that it's required for
complex processing and I think we've

2768
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
complex processing and I think we've
 

2769
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,930
complex processing and I think we've
made this anthropomorphic mistake

2770
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:35,940
made this anthropomorphic mistake
 

2771
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,690
made this anthropomorphic mistake
because we are conscious and it's very

2772
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:38,700
because we are conscious and it's very
 

2773
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,990
because we are conscious and it's very
hard to to get evidence it's one of the

2774
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
hard to to get evidence it's one of the
 

2775
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,210
hard to to get evidence it's one of the
things that makes Consciousness unique

2776
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:44,220
things that makes Consciousness unique
 

2777
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,770
things that makes Consciousness unique
and mysterious and why I'm fascinated

2778
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:45,780
and mysterious and why I'm fascinated
 

2779
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,530
and mysterious and why I'm fascinated
with it is it's the one thing in nature

2780
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:48,540
with it is it's the one thing in nature
 

2781
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:51,230
with it is it's the one thing in nature
that we can't get conclusive evidence of

2782
00:54:51,230 --> 00:54:51,240
that we can't get conclusive evidence of
 

2783
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,809
that we can't get conclusive evidence of
from the outside we can buy analogy you

2784
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:53,819
from the outside we can buy analogy you
 

2785
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:55,270
from the outside we can buy analogy you
know you're behaving

2786
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:55,280
know you're behaving
 

2787
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,770
know you're behaving
basically the same way I behave more or

2788
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:57,780
basically the same way I behave more or
 

2789
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,910
basically the same way I behave more or
less

2790
00:54:58,910 --> 00:54:58,920
less
 

2791
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,049
less
um you talk about your conscious

2792
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:00,059
um you talk about your conscious
 

2793
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:01,970
um you talk about your conscious
experiences and therefore I just

2794
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:01,980
experiences and therefore I just
 

2795
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,549
experiences and therefore I just
extrapolate from that that you're having

2796
00:55:04,549 --> 00:55:04,559
extrapolate from that that you're having
 

2797
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:06,650
extrapolate from that that you're having
a felt experience in the way I am and

2798
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:06,660
a felt experience in the way I am and
 

2799
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,329
a felt experience in the way I am and
and we can do that throughout nature

2800
00:55:08,329 --> 00:55:08,339
and we can do that throughout nature
 

2801
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,829
and we can do that throughout nature
well there's no physical evidence

2802
00:55:09,829 --> 00:55:09,839
well there's no physical evidence
 

2803
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,270
well there's no physical evidence
there's nothing we can observe from the

2804
00:55:11,270 --> 00:55:11,280
there's nothing we can observe from the
 

2805
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,130
there's nothing we can observe from the
outside that will give us conclusive

2806
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:13,140
outside that will give us conclusive
 

2807
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,069
outside that will give us conclusive
proof that Consciousness is there and so

2808
00:55:16,069 --> 00:55:16,079
proof that Consciousness is there and so
 

2809
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,309
proof that Consciousness is there and so
I think we've made this leap to

2810
00:55:19,309 --> 00:55:19,319
I think we've made this leap to
 

2811
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,530
I think we've made this leap to
because we're conscious and because

2812
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:21,540
because we're conscious and because
 

2813
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:25,190
because we're conscious and because
we're unique and special and

2814
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
we're unique and special and
 

2815
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,770
we're unique and special and
um complex and intelligent in the way

2816
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:27,780
um complex and intelligent in the way
 

2817
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,910
um complex and intelligent in the way
that we are and because we don't have an

2818
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:31,920
that we are and because we don't have an
 

2819
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:34,250
that we are and because we don't have an
intuition that anything else is

2820
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:34,260
intuition that anything else is
 

2821
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,530
intuition that anything else is
conscious or we have no feedback about

2822
00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:36,540
conscious or we have no feedback about
 

2823
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:40,010
conscious or we have no feedback about
it we've made this assumption that

2824
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:40,020
it we've made this assumption that
 

2825
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:42,410
it we've made this assumption that
Consciousness that those things aren't

2826
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:42,420
Consciousness that those things aren't
 

2827
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,510
Consciousness that those things aren't
conscious and felt experience does not

2828
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:44,520
conscious and felt experience does not
 

2829
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,990
conscious and felt experience does not
exist out there in in other atoms and

2830
00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:48,000
exist out there in in other atoms and
 

2831
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,790
exist out there in in other atoms and
and forms of life even but especially

2832
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:49,800
and forms of life even but especially
 

2833
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,250
and forms of life even but especially
not inanimate objects

2834
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:52,260
not inanimate objects
 

2835
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,730
not inanimate objects
um and therefore consciousness

2836
00:55:55,730 --> 00:55:55,740
um and therefore consciousness
 

2837
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:59,750
um and therefore consciousness
is somehow tied to these other things

2838
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
is somehow tied to these other things
 

2839
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,690
is somehow tied to these other things
that make us unique that consciousness

2840
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:04,700

 

2841
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,190

arises when there is this complex

2842
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,200
arises when there is this complex
 

2843
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,710
arises when there is this complex
processing when there is and there's we

2844
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:09,720
processing when there is and there's we
 

2845
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,970
processing when there is and there's we
can talk about the evolution argument

2846
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:10,980
can talk about the evolution argument
 

2847
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:12,230
can talk about the evolution argument
too which I think is super interesting

2848
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,240
too which I think is super interesting
 

2849
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,849
too which I think is super interesting
to get into and I'm hoping to talk to

2850
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:13,859
to get into and I'm hoping to talk to
 

2851
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,410
to get into and I'm hoping to talk to
Richard Dawkins

2852
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:15,420
Richard Dawkins
 

2853
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,790
Richard Dawkins
um about this verse why do you think

2854
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:16,800
um about this verse why do you think
 

2855
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,170
um about this verse why do you think
about consciousness

2856
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:18,180
about consciousness
 

2857
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,870
about consciousness
he's not interested

2858
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:19,880
he's not interested
 

2859
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,950
he's not interested
he's not interested in actually the

2860
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:21,960
he's not interested in actually the
 

2861
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,150
he's not interested in actually the
conversation I would have with him would

2862
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:23,160
conversation I would have with him would
 

2863
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:25,190
conversation I would have with him would
be very brief because he's he's just not

2864
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
be very brief because he's he's just not
 

2865
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,589
be very brief because he's he's just not
that interested in this topic but let's

2866
00:56:27,589 --> 00:56:27,599
that interested in this topic but let's
 

2867
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,210
that interested in this topic but let's
go back to the Richard Dawkins piece

2868
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:29,220
go back to the Richard Dawkins piece
 

2869
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,109
go back to the Richard Dawkins piece
because there's I feel like there's a

2870
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:30,119
because there's I feel like there's a
 

2871
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:31,730
because there's I feel like there's a
lot to talk about here in terms of our

2872
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:31,740
lot to talk about here in terms of our
 

2873
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:33,770
lot to talk about here in terms of our
intuitions about Consciousness what it's

2874
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:33,780
intuitions about Consciousness what it's
 

2875
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,069
intuitions about Consciousness what it's
doing why in my book and you know

2876
00:56:37,069 --> 00:56:37,079
doing why in my book and you know
 

2877
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:38,750
doing why in my book and you know
everywhere I talk about Consciousness I

2878
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:38,760
everywhere I talk about Consciousness I
 

2879
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,430
everywhere I talk about Consciousness I
bring it back to these two questions

2880
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:40,440
bring it back to these two questions
 

2881
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,230
bring it back to these two questions
that I think are at the heart of our

2882
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:42,240
that I think are at the heart of our
 

2883
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,089
that I think are at the heart of our
intuitions about Consciousness and so

2884
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:44,099
intuitions about Consciousness and so
 

2885
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:46,010
intuitions about Consciousness and so
your questions about whether human

2886
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:46,020
your questions about whether human
 

2887
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,750
your questions about whether human
beings are unique and special and all of

2888
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
beings are unique and special and all of
 

2889
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,970
beings are unique and special and all of
that I think are interesting questions

2890
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:49,980
that I think are interesting questions
 

2891
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,890
that I think are interesting questions
and something we could talk about I see

2892
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:51,900
and something we could talk about I see
 

2893
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,650
and something we could talk about I see
them as separate questions from the

2894
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:54,660
them as separate questions from the
 

2895
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,150
them as separate questions from the
Consciousness question so you see

2896
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:56,160
Consciousness question so you see
 

2897
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,849
Consciousness question so you see
Consciousness as giving a felt

2898
00:56:58,849 --> 00:56:58,859
Consciousness as giving a felt
 

2899
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:01,190
Consciousness as giving a felt
experience to our uniqueness as opposed

2900
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
experience to our uniqueness as opposed
 

2901
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,170
experience to our uniqueness as opposed
to the uniqueness giving birth to gosh

2902
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:03,180
to the uniqueness giving birth to gosh
 

2903
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:06,230
to the uniqueness giving birth to gosh
yes and that potentially there is felt

2904
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
yes and that potentially there is felt
 

2905
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:07,730
yes and that potentially there is felt
experience even though it sounds crazy

2906
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:07,740
experience even though it sounds crazy
 

2907
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,210
experience even though it sounds crazy
even to me that there is felt experience

2908
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:10,220
even to me that there is felt experience
 

2909
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:14,089
even to me that there is felt experience
in all matter and at this point in my

2910
00:57:14,089 --> 00:57:14,099
in all matter and at this point in my
 

2911
00:57:14,099 --> 00:57:15,650
in all matter and at this point in my
thinking and after a few conversations

2912
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:15,660
thinking and after a few conversations
 

2913
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:17,750
thinking and after a few conversations
with some physicists I think if

2914
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
with some physicists I think if
 

2915
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,790
with some physicists I think if
conscious business is fundamental the

2916
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:19,800
conscious business is fundamental the
 

2917
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,470
conscious business is fundamental the
only thing that actually makes sense is

2918
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:21,480
only thing that actually makes sense is
 

2919
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,030
only thing that actually makes sense is
that it is

2920
00:57:23,030 --> 00:57:23,040
that it is
 

2921
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,109
that it is
part of the most fundamental

2922
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:26,119
part of the most fundamental
 

2923
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:28,790
part of the most fundamental
that space-time and everything else

2924
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:28,800
that space-time and everything else
 

2925
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,309
that space-time and everything else
emerges out of out of Consciousness felt

2926
00:57:31,309 --> 00:57:31,319
emerges out of out of Consciousness felt
 

2927
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:33,950
emerges out of out of Consciousness felt
experience is is just part of the fabric

2928
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:33,960
experience is is just part of the fabric
 

2929
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,250
experience is is just part of the fabric
of reality so is it possible to Intuit

2930
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:37,260
of reality so is it possible to Intuit
 

2931
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,710
of reality so is it possible to Intuit
this can we start by thinking about dogs

2932
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:39,720
this can we start by thinking about dogs
 

2933
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,650
this can we start by thinking about dogs
and cats go to the plants and going all

2934
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:42,660
and cats go to the plants and going all
 

2935
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:44,150
and cats go to the plants and going all
the way to matter or is this going to be

2936
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:44,160
the way to matter or is this going to be
 

2937
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,829
the way to matter or is this going to be
like modern physics where it's just

2938
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:45,839
like modern physics where it's just
 

2939
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,470
like modern physics where it's just
going to be impossible to even uh in in

2940
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:48,480
going to be impossible to even uh in in
 

2941
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,049
going to be impossible to even uh in in
the through our reason alone like we're

2942
00:57:51,049 --> 00:57:51,059
the through our reason alone like we're
 

2943
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:53,150
the through our reason alone like we're
gonna have to have tools of some kind I

2944
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:53,160
gonna have to have tools of some kind I
 

2945
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,410
gonna have to have tools of some kind I
think it'll be a little bit of both I

2946
00:57:54,410 --> 00:57:54,420
think it'll be a little bit of both I
 

2947
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:56,630
think it'll be a little bit of both I
mean I think the science has a very long

2948
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:56,640
mean I think the science has a very long
 

2949
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,309
mean I think the science has a very long
way to go and the truth is I don't even

2950
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:58,319
way to go and the truth is I don't even
 

2951
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,290
way to go and the truth is I don't even
think we can get to the science yet

2952
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:00,300
think we can get to the science yet
 

2953
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:02,390
think we can get to the science yet
because we have to do this work and this

2954
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:02,400
because we have to do this work and this
 

2955
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,630
because we have to do this work and this
is why I'm so passionate about this work

2956
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:05,640
is why I'm so passionate about this work
 

2957
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,690
is why I'm so passionate about this work
um and it's really it's really taking

2958
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:08,700
um and it's really it's really taking
 

2959
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:11,390
um and it's really it's really taking
hold I mean there are scientists

2960
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:11,400
hold I mean there are scientists
 

2961
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:12,710
hold I mean there are scientists
neuroscientists and physicists

2962
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:12,720
neuroscientists and physicists
 

2963
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,530
neuroscientists and physicists
interested in Consciousness and kind of

2964
00:58:15,530 --> 00:58:15,540
interested in Consciousness and kind of
 

2965
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:19,030
interested in Consciousness and kind of
having gotten over the initial

2966
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:19,040
having gotten over the initial
 

2967
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,549
having gotten over the initial
Obstacle of wrestling with these

2968
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
Obstacle of wrestling with these
 

2969
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:25,250
Obstacle of wrestling with these
intuitions so that it's now being talked

2970
00:58:25,250 --> 00:58:25,260
intuitions so that it's now being talked
 

2971
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:26,930
intuitions so that it's now being talked
about in a serious way which was the

2972
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:26,940
about in a serious way which was the
 

2973
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,930
about in a serious way which was the
first huge hurdle but I think a lot more

2974
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:29,940
first huge hurdle but I think a lot more
 

2975
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,990
first huge hurdle but I think a lot more
of that has to happen a lot more of

2976
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:33,000
of that has to happen a lot more of
 

2977
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,690
of that has to happen a lot more of
the intuition breaking

2978
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:35,700
the intuition breaking
 

2979
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,210
the intuition breaking
from the science we already have I mean

2980
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:38,220
from the science we already have I mean
 

2981
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,829
from the science we already have I mean
I think we almost need to catch our

2982
00:58:39,829 --> 00:58:39,839
I think we almost need to catch our
 

2983
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,670
I think we almost need to catch our
intuitions up to what we we already know

2984
00:58:43,670 --> 00:58:43,680
intuitions up to what we we already know
 

2985
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:46,130
intuitions up to what we we already know
um and then continue to break through

2986
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:46,140
um and then continue to break through
 

2987
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,710
um and then continue to break through
these intuitions systematically so that

2988
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:48,720
these intuitions systematically so that
 

2989
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,569
these intuitions systematically so that
we can really think more clearly about

2990
00:58:50,569 --> 00:58:50,579
we can really think more clearly about
 

2991
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:52,490
we can really think more clearly about
Consciousness

2992
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:52,500
Consciousness
 

2993
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,849
Consciousness
um there are a couple of scientists now

2994
00:58:55,849 --> 00:58:55,859
um there are a couple of scientists now
 

2995
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:57,470
um there are a couple of scientists now
working on theories of Consciousness

2996
00:58:57,470 --> 00:58:57,480
working on theories of Consciousness
 

2997
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:00,410
working on theories of Consciousness
which do go they don't quite go to the

2998
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:00,420
which do go they don't quite go to the
 

2999
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:02,870
which do go they don't quite go to the
fundamental level but they go extremely

3000
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
fundamental level but they go extremely
 

3001
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,010
fundamental level but they go extremely
deep

3002
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:04,020
deep
 

3003
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,630
deep
um so that something like an electron

3004
00:59:05,630 --> 00:59:05,640
um so that something like an electron
 

3005
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:07,370
um so that something like an electron
might be conscious under their Theory

3006
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:07,380
might be conscious under their Theory
 

3007
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,750
might be conscious under their Theory
this is um

3008
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:08,760
this is um
 

3009
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,510
this is um
integrated information Theory IIT with

3010
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:11,520
integrated information Theory IIT with
 

3011
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,109
integrated information Theory IIT with
Christoph Coke and Julio tanoni

3012
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:15,119
Christoph Coke and Julio tanoni
 

3013
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,809
Christoph Coke and Julio tanoni
um I've spoken to to both of them I

3014
00:59:17,809 --> 00:59:17,819
um I've spoken to to both of them I
 

3015
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:21,710
um I've spoken to to both of them I
spoke to Christoph coke uh once or twice

3016
00:59:21,710 --> 00:59:21,720
spoke to Christoph coke uh once or twice
 

3017
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:24,589
spoke to Christoph coke uh once or twice
for this project I'm working on now

3018
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:24,599
for this project I'm working on now
 

3019
00:59:24,599 --> 00:59:26,450
for this project I'm working on now
um what they're working on is incredibly

3020
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:26,460
um what they're working on is incredibly
 

3021
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,010
um what they're working on is incredibly
interesting to me and I think very

3022
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:28,020
interesting to me and I think very
 

3023
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,930
interesting to me and I think very
important work

3024
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:29,940
important work
 

3025
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,210
important work
um however

3026
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:32,220
um however
 

3027
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:37,010
um however
I think they are also really led by some

3028
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:37,020
I think they are also really led by some
 

3029
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,710
I think they are also really led by some
false intuitions about self and Free

3030
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:39,720
false intuitions about self and Free
 

3031
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,750
false intuitions about self and Free
Will and I think that will be a limit to

3032
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:41,760
Will and I think that will be a limit to
 

3033
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,329
Will and I think that will be a limit to
their work so we can get into that but

3034
00:59:44,329 --> 00:59:44,339
their work so we can get into that but
 

3035
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:46,630
their work so we can get into that but
um let's go

3036
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:46,640
um let's go
 

3037
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,049
um let's go
it's awesome which is that

3038
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:51,059
it's awesome which is that
 

3039
00:59:51,059 --> 00:59:53,030
it's awesome which is that
what they're working on I think is the

3040
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:53,040
what they're working on I think is the
 

3041
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,130
what they're working on I think is the
most important next step forward which

3042
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,140
most important next step forward which
 

3043
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,589
most important next step forward which
is just even being open to the fact that

3044
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
is just even being open to the fact that
 

3045
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,049
is just even being open to the fact that
Consciousness goes as deep as particles

3046
01:00:00,049 --> 01:00:00,059
Consciousness goes as deep as particles
 

3047
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:03,470
Consciousness goes as deep as particles
and being rigorous but even their Theory

3048
01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:03,480
and being rigorous but even their Theory
 

3049
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,990
and being rigorous but even their Theory
isn't going as deep as I think we need

3050
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
isn't going as deep as I think we need
 

3051
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,309
isn't going as deep as I think we need
to go

3052
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:07,319
to go
 

3053
01:00:07,319 --> 01:00:09,170
to go
um and it's hard to say how we could

3054
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:09,180
um and it's hard to say how we could
 

3055
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:10,609
um and it's hard to say how we could
actually study this scientifically but

3056
01:00:10,609 --> 01:00:10,619
actually study this scientifically but
 

3057
01:00:10,619 --> 01:00:11,930
actually study this scientifically but
that's part of the reason why I'm such a

3058
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:11,940
that's part of the reason why I'm such a
 

3059
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,670
that's part of the reason why I'm such a
supporter of IIT and why I'm so

3060
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:13,680
supporter of IIT and why I'm so
 

3061
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:14,630
supporter of IIT and why I'm so
interested in what they're doing even

3062
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
interested in what they're doing even
 

3063
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,270
interested in what they're doing even
though I think they're wrong

3064
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,280
though I think they're wrong
 

3065
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,150
though I think they're wrong
um is because they're they're opening

3066
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:20,160
um is because they're they're opening
 

3067
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,349
um is because they're they're opening
this path there and I think they're

3068
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:21,359
this path there and I think they're
 

3069
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:22,910
this path there and I think they're
getting more people interested and I

3070
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:22,920
getting more people interested and I
 

3071
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,289
getting more people interested and I
think

3072
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:24,299
think
 

3073
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:26,690
think
um yeah it'll be it'll be it's hard for

3074
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:26,700
um yeah it'll be it'll be it's hard for
 

3075
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,910
um yeah it'll be it'll be it's hard for
me to imagine what the science will

3076
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:28,920
me to imagine what the science will
 

3077
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:31,010
me to imagine what the science will
actually look like but okay so your

3078
01:00:31,010 --> 01:00:31,020
actually look like but okay so your
 

3079
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,109
actually look like but okay so your
Intuition or at least the direction

3080
01:00:33,109 --> 01:00:33,119
Intuition or at least the direction
 

3081
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,910
Intuition or at least the direction
which you're pushing is that

3082
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:34,920
which you're pushing is that
 

3083
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:36,530
which you're pushing is that
consciousness

3084
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:36,540
consciousness
 

3085
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:39,049
consciousness
is the only fundamental thing in the

3086
01:00:39,049 --> 01:00:39,059
is the only fundamental thing in the
 

3087
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:40,549
is the only fundamental thing in the
universe that

3088
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
universe that
 

3089
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:44,210
universe that
everything else like time all those

3090
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:44,220
everything else like time all those
 

3091
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,430
everything else like time all those
kinds of things emerge from that

3092
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:46,440
kinds of things emerge from that
 

3093
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,250
kinds of things emerge from that
I will say that

3094
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:49,260
I will say that
 

3095
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,970
I will say that
what I believe at this point I I've been

3096
01:00:52,970 --> 01:00:52,980
what I believe at this point I I've been
 

3097
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,190
what I believe at this point I I've been
saying 50 50 for a long time I'd say now

3098
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:55,200
saying 50 50 for a long time I'd say now
 

3099
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,349
saying 50 50 for a long time I'd say now
it's like 51.49

3100
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:57,359
it's like 51.49
 

3101
01:00:57,359 --> 01:00:59,870
it's like 51.49
in terms of Consciousness being emergent

3102
01:00:59,870 --> 01:00:59,880
in terms of Consciousness being emergent
 

3103
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,410
in terms of Consciousness being emergent
versus fundamental so I I am not

3104
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:03,420
versus fundamental so I I am not
 

3105
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,510
versus fundamental so I I am not
convinced of this at all I'm not

3106
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:05,520
convinced of this at all I'm not
 

3107
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:06,589
convinced of this at all I'm not
convinced that Consciousness is

3108
01:01:06,589 --> 01:01:06,599
convinced that Consciousness is
 

3109
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:09,230
convinced that Consciousness is
fundamental what I think is there are

3110
01:01:09,230 --> 01:01:09,240
fundamental what I think is there are
 

3111
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:12,289
fundamental what I think is there are
very good reasons to think it could be

3112
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:12,299
very good reasons to think it could be
 

3113
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:14,089
very good reasons to think it could be
and

3114
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:14,099
and
 

3115
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,430
and
essentially all of science up to this

3116
01:01:16,430 --> 01:01:16,440
essentially all of science up to this
 

3117
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,109
essentially all of science up to this
point has

3118
01:01:18,109 --> 01:01:18,119
point has
 

3119
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,710
point has
been led by the other assumption by the

3120
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:21,720
been led by the other assumption by the
 

3121
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,089
been led by the other assumption by the
first assumption that Consciousness

3122
01:01:23,089 --> 01:01:23,099
first assumption that Consciousness
 

3123
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:25,670
first assumption that Consciousness
arises at some point namely in brains

3124
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:25,680
arises at some point namely in brains
 

3125
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,470
arises at some point namely in brains
and that's where all the science has

3126
01:01:27,470 --> 01:01:27,480
and that's where all the science has
 

3127
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,849
and that's where all the science has
gone and I think that's wonderful and I

3128
01:01:28,849 --> 01:01:28,859
gone and I think that's wonderful and I
 

3129
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,349
gone and I think that's wonderful and I
think it should keep on going and I

3130
01:01:30,349 --> 01:01:30,359
think it should keep on going and I
 

3131
01:01:30,359 --> 01:01:31,789
think it should keep on going and I
actually think that was a more important

3132
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:31,799
actually think that was a more important
 

3133
01:01:31,799 --> 01:01:34,309
actually think that was a more important
place to start but I think there's a

3134
01:01:34,309 --> 01:01:34,319
place to start but I think there's a
 

3135
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:36,410
place to start but I think there's a
possibility that the correct assumption

3136
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:36,420
possibility that the correct assumption
 

3137
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,450
possibility that the correct assumption
is that it's fundamental and so that's

3138
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:38,460
is that it's fundamental and so that's
 

3139
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,210
is that it's fundamental and so that's
the science I support that's the thing I

3140
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:41,220
the science I support that's the thing I
 

3141
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,710
the science I support that's the thing I
spend a lot of my time thinking about

3142
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:42,720
spend a lot of my time thinking about
 

3143
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,630
spend a lot of my time thinking about
and talking to scientists and

3144
01:01:44,630 --> 01:01:44,640
and talking to scientists and
 

3145
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,349
and talking to scientists and
philosophers about and so I I shouldn't

3146
01:01:48,349 --> 01:01:48,359
philosophers about and so I I shouldn't
 

3147
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:50,630
philosophers about and so I I shouldn't
give the idea that I actually have

3148
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:50,640
give the idea that I actually have
 

3149
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,370
give the idea that I actually have
crossed over into believing this is the

3150
01:01:52,370 --> 01:01:52,380
crossed over into believing this is the
 

3151
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,750
crossed over into believing this is the
case but it is

3152
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,760
case but it is
 

3153
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,970
case but it is
it's the Assumption I follow in my work

3154
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:55,980
it's the Assumption I follow in my work
 

3155
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:58,670
it's the Assumption I follow in my work
at this point it's a possibility an

3156
01:01:58,670 --> 01:01:58,680
at this point it's a possibility an
 

3157
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:00,829
at this point it's a possibility an
understudied possibility so it deserves

3158
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:00,839
understudied possibility so it deserves
 

3159
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,049
understudied possibility so it deserves
serious rigorous attention and there are

3160
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:03,059
serious rigorous attention and there are
 

3161
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,270
serious rigorous attention and there are
good reasons to start with that

3162
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:05,280
good reasons to start with that
 

3163
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,730
good reasons to start with that
assumption versus the other that I think

3164
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:07,740
assumption versus the other that I think
 

3165
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:10,490
assumption versus the other that I think
we're just now starting to realize so

3166
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:10,500
we're just now starting to realize so
 

3167
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,950
we're just now starting to realize so
just to clarify when we're talking about

3168
01:02:12,950 --> 01:02:12,960
just to clarify when we're talking about
 

3169
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,630
just to clarify when we're talking about
Consciousness we're talking about the

3170
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:14,640
Consciousness we're talking about the
 

3171
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,370
Consciousness we're talking about the
hard problem of Consciousness that it

3172
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:16,380
hard problem of Consciousness that it
 

3173
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,990
hard problem of Consciousness that it
feels like something to

3174
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:18,000
feels like something to
 

3175
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,490
feels like something to
you know there's a subjective experience

3176
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:22,500

 

3177
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,230

do we

3178
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:24,240
do we
 

3179
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,109
do we
you know if Consciousness permeates all

3180
01:02:27,109 --> 01:02:27,119
you know if Consciousness permeates all
 

3181
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:28,970
you know if Consciousness permeates all
matter is fundamental

3182
01:02:28,970 --> 01:02:28,980
matter is fundamental
 

3183
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,130
matter is fundamental
is that going to be somehow

3184
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:31,140
is that going to be somehow
 

3185
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:32,990
is that going to be somehow
is our current intuition about

3186
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:33,000
is our current intuition about
 

3187
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:36,410
is our current intuition about
Consciousness like

3188
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:36,420
Consciousness like
 

3189
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:38,690
Consciousness like
the very tiny subset of what

3190
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:38,700
the very tiny subset of what
 

3191
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,569
the very tiny subset of what
cautiousness actually is so like we have

3192
01:02:41,569 --> 01:02:41,579
cautiousness actually is so like we have
 

3193
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:43,309
cautiousness actually is so like we have
our intuitions about personal

3194
01:02:43,309 --> 01:02:43,319
our intuitions about personal
 

3195
01:02:43,319 --> 01:02:45,289
our intuitions about personal
experiences like what it feels like what

3196
01:02:45,289 --> 01:02:45,299
experiences like what it feels like what
 

3197
01:02:45,299 --> 01:02:47,150
experiences like what it feels like what
it takes to eat a cookie or something

3198
01:02:47,150 --> 01:02:47,160
it takes to eat a cookie or something
 

3199
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,609
it takes to eat a cookie or something
like that um

3200
01:02:49,609 --> 01:02:49,619
like that um
 

3201
01:02:49,619 --> 01:02:52,670
like that um
but

3202
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:52,680

 

3203
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,549

that seems like a very specific

3204
01:02:55,549 --> 01:02:55,559
that seems like a very specific
 

3205
01:02:55,559 --> 01:02:57,530
that seems like a very specific
implementation of Consciousness in an

3206
01:02:57,530 --> 01:02:57,540
implementation of Consciousness in an
 

3207
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,450
implementation of Consciousness in an
organism so how can we even reason about

3208
01:02:59,450 --> 01:02:59,460
organism so how can we even reason about
 

3209
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:01,670
organism so how can we even reason about
something that's if Consciousness is

3210
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
something that's if Consciousness is
 

3211
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,670
something that's if Consciousness is
fundamental how can we reason about that

3212
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:04,680
fundamental how can we reason about that
 

3213
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,770
fundamental how can we reason about that
like I'm not sure I'm understanding the

3214
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:06,780
like I'm not sure I'm understanding the
 

3215
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:09,230
like I'm not sure I'm understanding the
connection between those two things but

3216
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:09,240
connection between those two things but
 

3217
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,030
connection between those two things but
when you think about what it's like to

3218
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,040
when you think about what it's like to
 

3219
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:12,950
when you think about what it's like to
be a plant to experience a thing okay we

3220
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
be a plant to experience a thing okay we
 

3221
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,990
be a plant to experience a thing okay we
can kind of get that we can kind of

3222
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:15,000
can kind of get that we can kind of
 

3223
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,069
can kind of get that we can kind of
understand that there are a lot of

3224
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:16,079
understand that there are a lot of
 

3225
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:17,450
understand that there are a lot of
places we could go with this one is

3226
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:17,460
places we could go with this one is
 

3227
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,730
places we could go with this one is
there's actually work being done by

3228
01:03:19,730 --> 01:03:19,740
there's actually work being done by
 

3229
01:03:19,740 --> 01:03:21,289
there's actually work being done by
people like David Eagleman he's a

3230
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:21,299
people like David Eagleman he's a
 

3231
01:03:21,299 --> 01:03:22,430
people like David Eagleman he's a
neuroscientist I don't know if you know

3232
01:03:22,430 --> 01:03:22,440
neuroscientist I don't know if you know
 

3233
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,170
neuroscientist I don't know if you know
him you should talk to him for your

3234
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:24,180
him you should talk to him for your
 

3235
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:25,490
him you should talk to him for your
podcast if you haven't he's wonderful

3236
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:25,500
podcast if you haven't he's wonderful
 

3237
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:27,289
podcast if you haven't he's wonderful
great science Communicator he's someone

3238
01:03:27,289 --> 01:03:27,299
great science Communicator he's someone
 

3239
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:28,910
great science Communicator he's someone
I interviewed for my my current project

3240
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:28,920
I interviewed for my my current project
 

3241
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,990
I interviewed for my my current project
too

3242
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
too
 

3243
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,750
too
um so he he's done this actually okay

3244
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:32,760
um so he he's done this actually okay
 

3245
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,569
um so he he's done this actually okay
there are many places we can go one is

3246
01:03:35,569 --> 01:03:35,579
there are many places we can go one is
 

3247
01:03:35,579 --> 01:03:37,670
there are many places we can go one is
he does work with sensory addition

3248
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:37,680
he does work with sensory addition
 

3249
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,910
he does work with sensory addition
sensory substitution and this is

3250
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:40,920
sensory substitution and this is
 

3251
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,190
sensory substitution and this is
going in some very interest interesting

3252
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
going in some very interest interesting
 

3253
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,710
going in some very interest interesting
directions and and maybe partly answers

3254
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:45,720
directions and and maybe partly answers
 

3255
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,849
directions and and maybe partly answers
your question which is giving humans

3256
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:48,859
your question which is giving humans
 

3257
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:52,490
your question which is giving humans
qualia sensory experiences that we're

3258
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:52,500
qualia sensory experiences that we're
 

3259
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,109
qualia sensory experiences that we're
not wired for that human beings have

3260
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:54,119
not wired for that human beings have
 

3261
01:03:54,119 --> 01:03:55,789
not wired for that human beings have
never had before

3262
01:03:55,789 --> 01:03:55,799
never had before
 

3263
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,530
never had before
you let me know what you're most

3264
01:03:57,530 --> 01:03:57,540
you let me know what you're most
 

3265
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:58,789
you let me know what you're most
interested in hearing about but we could

3266
01:03:58,789 --> 01:03:58,799
interested in hearing about but we could
 

3267
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:02,030
interested in hearing about but we could
talk about things like the brain Port

3268
01:04:02,030 --> 01:04:02,040
talk about things like the brain Port
 

3269
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:04,010
talk about things like the brain Port
um there's actually a study done I just

3270
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:04,020
um there's actually a study done I just
 

3271
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,569
um there's actually a study done I just
talked to one of the participants in the

3272
01:04:05,569 --> 01:04:05,579
talked to one of the participants in the
 

3273
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:07,910
talked to one of the participants in the
study where they were seeing if they

3274
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:07,920
study where they were seeing if they
 

3275
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:09,950
study where they were seeing if they
could give human beings an experience of

3276
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:09,960
could give human beings an experience of
 

3277
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,170
could give human beings an experience of
magnetic north so other animals have

3278
01:04:12,170 --> 01:04:12,180
magnetic north so other animals have
 

3279
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,370
magnetic north so other animals have
this

3280
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:13,380
this
 

3281
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:13,910
this
um

3282
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:13,920
um
 

3283
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,890
um
this sense that that we don't have where

3284
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:15,900
this sense that that we don't have where
 

3285
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,049
this sense that that we don't have where
they can feel intuitively the way that

3286
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:18,059
they can feel intuitively the way that
 

3287
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:20,030
they can feel intuitively the way that
our eyes work to give us an intuitive

3288
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:20,040
our eyes work to give us an intuitive
 

3289
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:21,530
our eyes work to give us an intuitive
sense of our environment we don't have

3290
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:21,540
sense of our environment we don't have
 

3291
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:25,130
sense of our environment we don't have
to translate the information coming in

3292
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:25,140
to translate the information coming in
 

3293
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:27,289
to translate the information coming in
through our eyes we just have a map of

3294
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:27,299
through our eyes we just have a map of
 

3295
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:28,970
through our eyes we just have a map of
the external world and we can navigate

3296
01:04:28,970 --> 01:04:28,980
the external world and we can navigate
 

3297
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,930
the external world and we can navigate
it so many animals use a sense of

3298
01:04:32,930 --> 01:04:32,940
it so many animals use a sense of
 

3299
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:35,930
it so many animals use a sense of
magnetic north to to get around and it's

3300
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:35,940
magnetic north to to get around and it's
 

3301
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,210
magnetic north to to get around and it's
an intuitive sense so I spoke to someone

3302
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:38,220
an intuitive sense so I spoke to someone
 

3303
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:41,569
an intuitive sense so I spoke to someone
who was in this part of this experiment

3304
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:41,579
who was in this part of this experiment
 

3305
01:04:41,579 --> 01:04:44,829
who was in this part of this experiment
um and it was fascinating to hear him

3306
01:04:44,829 --> 01:04:44,839
um and it was fascinating to hear him
 

3307
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:48,170
um and it was fascinating to hear him
acquire a sense not only that he had

3308
01:04:48,170 --> 01:04:48,180
acquire a sense not only that he had
 

3309
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,849
acquire a sense not only that he had
never had but that no human being had

3310
01:04:49,849 --> 01:04:49,859
never had but that no human being had
 

3311
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:51,650
never had but that no human being had
ever had so when I asked him to describe

3312
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:51,660
ever had so when I asked him to describe
 

3313
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,030
ever had so when I asked him to describe
the experience

3314
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:53,040
the experience
 

3315
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,789
the experience
it was challenging for him and

3316
01:04:55,789 --> 01:04:55,799
it was challenging for him and
 

3317
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:57,589
it was challenging for him and
understandably so because it would be

3318
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
understandably so because it would be
 

3319
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,750
understandably so because it would be
like you describing sight to someone

3320
01:04:59,750 --> 01:04:59,760
like you describing sight to someone
 

3321
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:01,849
like you describing sight to someone
who's never seen

3322
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:01,859
who's never seen
 

3323
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:04,670
who's never seen
um but this is clearly possible and

3324
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:04,680
um but this is clearly possible and
 

3325
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:06,710
um but this is clearly possible and
scientists like David Eagleman and

3326
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:06,720
scientists like David Eagleman and
 

3327
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:10,789
scientists like David Eagleman and
others are working on these and so I do

3328
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:10,799
others are working on these and so I do
 

3329
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,609
others are working on these and so I do
think it's possible that this line that

3330
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:13,619
think it's possible that this line that
 

3331
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:15,109
think it's possible that this line that
this

3332
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
this
 

3333
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,349
this
these scientific advancements may

3334
01:05:18,349 --> 01:05:18,359
these scientific advancements may
 

3335
01:05:18,359 --> 01:05:21,970
these scientific advancements may
actually start to dovetail with

3336
01:05:21,970 --> 01:05:21,980
actually start to dovetail with
 

3337
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:25,370
actually start to dovetail with
the Consciousness research in terms of

3338
01:05:25,370 --> 01:05:25,380
the Consciousness research in terms of
 

3339
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,329
the Consciousness research in terms of
being able to

3340
01:05:28,329 --> 01:05:28,339
being able to
 

3341
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:30,289
being able to
experience things we've never

3342
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:30,299
experience things we've never
 

3343
01:05:30,299 --> 01:05:33,470
experience things we've never
experienced before but I do think that

3344
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:33,480
experienced before but I do think that
 

3345
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,990
experienced before but I do think that
at some level yes we're limited as human

3346
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:36,000
at some level yes we're limited as human
 

3347
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,030
at some level yes we're limited as human
beings

3348
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:37,040
beings
 

3349
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,670
beings
we may be able to find some proof or

3350
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:40,680
we may be able to find some proof or
 

3351
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:42,910
we may be able to find some proof or
enough proof to at least

3352
01:05:42,910 --> 01:05:42,920
enough proof to at least
 

3353
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:45,410
enough proof to at least
assume that Consciousness is fundamental

3354
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:45,420
assume that Consciousness is fundamental
 

3355
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:47,270
assume that Consciousness is fundamental
or you know who knows one day actually

3356
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:47,280
or you know who knows one day actually
 

3357
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,370
or you know who knows one day actually
believe that that's the correct

3358
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:49,380
believe that that's the correct
 

3359
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,670
believe that that's the correct
scientific view of things and not really

3360
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:52,680
scientific view of things and not really
 

3361
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,069
scientific view of things and not really
be able to get our minds around that or

3362
01:05:55,069 --> 01:05:55,079
be able to get our minds around that or
 

3363
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:56,750
be able to get our minds around that or
to understand what it means and and

3364
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:56,760
to understand what it means and and
 

3365
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,370
to understand what it means and and
certainly not

3366
01:05:58,370 --> 01:05:58,380
certainly not
 

3367
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,170
certainly not
to know what it feels like I mean we

3368
01:06:00,170 --> 01:06:00,180
to know what it feels like I mean we
 

3369
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,490
to know what it feels like I mean we
can't we don't even know what it feels

3370
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:01,500
can't we don't even know what it feels
 

3371
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,670
can't we don't even know what it feels
like to be other creatures maybe what

3372
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:04,680
like to be other creatures maybe what
 

3373
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:09,049
like to be other creatures maybe what
it's like to be you

3374
01:06:09,049 --> 01:06:09,059

 

3375
01:06:09,059 --> 01:06:09,710

um

3376
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:09,720
um
 

3377
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,930
um
yeah I mean I mean that's I guess that's

3378
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:11,940
yeah I mean I mean that's I guess that's
 

3379
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,730
yeah I mean I mean that's I guess that's
what empathy is about that's why I tried

3380
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:13,740
what empathy is about that's why I tried
 

3381
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:16,010
what empathy is about that's why I tried
to exercise is try to imagine what it's

3382
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:16,020
to exercise is try to imagine what it's
 

3383
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:17,870
to exercise is try to imagine what it's
like to be other people and then you

3384
01:06:17,870 --> 01:06:17,880
like to be other people and then you
 

3385
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,589
like to be other people and then you
you're doing that even farther with P10

3386
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:20,599
you're doing that even farther with P10
 

3387
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:24,109
you're doing that even farther with P10
but perhaps perhaps we can do that thing

3388
01:06:24,109 --> 01:06:24,119
but perhaps perhaps we can do that thing
 

3389
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,109
but perhaps perhaps we can do that thing
more rigorously by connecting different

3390
01:06:27,109 --> 01:06:27,119
more rigorously by connecting different
 

3391
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:29,750
more rigorously by connecting different
sensory mechanisms to the brain to do

3392
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:29,760
sensory mechanisms to the brain to do
 

3393
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,910
sensory mechanisms to the brain to do
that for all kinds of organisms on Earth

3394
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:31,920
that for all kinds of organisms on Earth
 

3395
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,789
that for all kinds of organisms on Earth
but they're similar to us in scale and

3396
01:06:34,789 --> 01:06:34,799
but they're similar to us in scale and
 

3397
01:06:34,799 --> 01:06:37,309
but they're similar to us in scale and
the time at which they function to time

3398
01:06:37,309 --> 01:06:37,319
the time at which they function to time
 

3399
01:06:37,319 --> 01:06:39,890
the time at which they function to time
scale and the spatial scale perhaps it's

3400
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:39,900
scale and the spatial scale perhaps it's
 

3401
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,630
scale and the spatial scale perhaps it's
much more difficult to do for electrons

3402
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:41,640
much more difficult to do for electrons
 

3403
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,849
much more difficult to do for electrons
and so on some of the intuitions I

3404
01:06:43,849 --> 01:06:43,859
and so on some of the intuitions I
 

3405
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:46,309
and so on some of the intuitions I
talked about I mean I just kind of I I'm

3406
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
talked about I mean I just kind of I I'm
 

3407
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,349
talked about I mean I just kind of I I'm
taking them for granted that you and

3408
01:06:48,349 --> 01:06:48,359
taking them for granted that you and
 

3409
01:06:48,359 --> 01:06:49,549
taking them for granted that you and
everyone knows what I'm talking about

3410
01:06:49,549 --> 01:06:49,559
everyone knows what I'm talking about
 

3411
01:06:49,559 --> 01:06:53,089
everyone knows what I'm talking about
but in terms of the science in terms of

3412
01:06:53,089 --> 01:06:53,099
but in terms of the science in terms of
 

3413
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:54,589
but in terms of the science in terms of
the studies

3414
01:06:54,589 --> 01:06:54,599
the studies
 

3415
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:56,089
the studies
um understanding things like binding

3416
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:56,099
um understanding things like binding
 

3417
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,970
um understanding things like binding
processes understanding just a little

3418
01:06:58,970 --> 01:06:58,980
processes understanding just a little
 

3419
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,329
processes understanding just a little
bit about how the brain works and as far

3420
01:07:02,329 --> 01:07:02,339
bit about how the brain works and as far
 

3421
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:05,029
bit about how the brain works and as far
as we understand and then there's just a

3422
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:05,039
as we understand and then there's just a
 

3423
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,430
as we understand and then there's just a
ton of evidence now to support that our

3424
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:07,440
ton of evidence now to support that our
 

3425
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,370
ton of evidence now to support that our
conscious experience is at the tail end

3426
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:10,380
conscious experience is at the tail end
 

3427
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:11,870
conscious experience is at the tail end
of a lot of

3428
01:07:11,870 --> 01:07:11,880
of a lot of
 

3429
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:15,069
of a lot of
um brain processing

3430
01:07:15,069 --> 01:07:15,079

 

3431
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:17,809

yeah so it's just a little bit I mean I

3432
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:17,819
yeah so it's just a little bit I mean I
 

3433
01:07:17,819 --> 01:07:20,329
yeah so it's just a little bit I mean I
give in the example in my book I I talk

3434
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:20,339
give in the example in my book I I talk
 

3435
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:23,089
give in the example in my book I I talk
about tennis and The Binding of the

3436
01:07:23,089 --> 01:07:23,099
about tennis and The Binding of the
 

3437
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,910
about tennis and The Binding of the
sights and sounds and felt experience of

3438
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
sights and sounds and felt experience of
 

3439
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:28,250
sights and sounds and felt experience of
hitting a tennis ball which in the world

3440
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:28,260
hitting a tennis ball which in the world
 

3441
01:07:28,260 --> 01:07:30,710
hitting a tennis ball which in the world
are happening at different times the the

3442
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:30,720
are happening at different times the the
 

3443
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:31,849
are happening at different times the the
rates

3444
01:07:31,849 --> 01:07:31,859
rates
 

3445
01:07:31,859 --> 01:07:34,430
rates
um it takes the sound waves and the

3446
01:07:34,430 --> 01:07:34,440
um it takes the sound waves and the
 

3447
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,770
um it takes the sound waves and the
light waves and the the felt sensation

3448
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:36,780
light waves and the the felt sensation
 

3449
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:38,690
light waves and the the felt sensation
to travel to my brain are different that

3450
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:38,700
to travel to my brain are different that
 

3451
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,809
to travel to my brain are different that
there are these binding processes

3452
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:41,819
there are these binding processes
 

3453
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:44,049
there are these binding processes
that happen

3454
01:07:44,049 --> 01:07:44,059
that happen
 

3455
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:47,630
that happen
prior to the conscious experience that

3456
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:47,640
prior to the conscious experience that
 

3457
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,329
prior to the conscious experience that
were essentially delivered to us by by

3458
01:07:50,329 --> 01:07:50,339
were essentially delivered to us by by
 

3459
01:07:50,339 --> 01:07:52,010
were essentially delivered to us by by
the brain

3460
01:07:52,010 --> 01:07:52,020
the brain
 

3461
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:54,470
the brain
um and so we can get we can get back in

3462
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:54,480
um and so we can get we can get back in
 

3463
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:56,569
um and so we can get we can get back in
into this I can answer your your bigger

3464
01:07:56,569 --> 01:07:56,579
into this I can answer your your bigger
 

3465
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:58,370
into this I can answer your your bigger
question first but I I feel like for for

3466
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:58,380
question first but I I feel like for for
 

3467
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,870
question first but I I feel like for for
a lot of people

3468
01:07:59,870 --> 01:07:59,880
a lot of people
 

3469
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:03,049
a lot of people
to understand some of these science that

3470
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:03,059
to understand some of these science that
 

3471
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:04,549
to understand some of these science that
already

3472
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:04,559
already
 

3473
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:06,770
already
is shattering some of our intuitions

3474
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:06,780
is shattering some of our intuitions
 

3475
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:08,809
is shattering some of our intuitions
about the role Consciousness plays I

3476
01:08:08,809 --> 01:08:08,819
about the role Consciousness plays I
 

3477
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:11,510
about the role Consciousness plays I
think is helpful in terms of being able

3478
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:11,520
think is helpful in terms of being able
 

3479
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,029
think is helpful in terms of being able
to be open to thinking about these other

3480
01:08:14,029 --> 01:08:14,039
to be open to thinking about these other
 

3481
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:16,669
to be open to thinking about these other
ideas let's go there where the heck does

3482
01:08:16,669 --> 01:08:16,679
ideas let's go there where the heck does
 

3483
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:18,650
ideas let's go there where the heck does
Consciousness happen in what we

3484
01:08:18,650 --> 01:08:18,660
Consciousness happen in what we
 

3485
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:20,990
Consciousness happen in what we
understand about the brain timing wise

3486
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:21,000
understand about the brain timing wise
 

3487
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,090
understand about the brain timing wise
uh I mean this connects to the conscious

3488
01:08:23,090 --> 01:08:23,100
uh I mean this connects to the conscious
 

3489
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,870
uh I mean this connects to the conscious
will to our experience of free will yeah

3490
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:25,880
will to our experience of free will yeah
 

3491
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,709
will to our experience of free will yeah
there is this period of time and it's

3492
01:08:29,709 --> 01:08:29,719
there is this period of time and it's
 

3493
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:32,090
there is this period of time and it's
depending on the situation and the

3494
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,100
depending on the situation and the
 

3495
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:33,110
depending on the situation and the
behavior

3496
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:33,120
behavior
 

3497
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,510
behavior
um it can be anywhere from it's

3498
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
um it can be anywhere from it's
 

3499
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,150
um it can be anywhere from it's
essentially half a second there's 200

3500
01:08:38,150 --> 01:08:38,160
essentially half a second there's 200
 

3501
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,950
essentially half a second there's 200
milliseconds I actually don't know I was

3502
01:08:39,950 --> 01:08:39,960
milliseconds I actually don't know I was
 

3503
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,390
milliseconds I actually don't know I was
going to compare it to the timing of

3504
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:41,400
going to compare it to the timing of
 

3505
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,430
going to compare it to the timing of
thinking film and sound I don't know if

3506
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:43,440
thinking film and sound I don't know if
 

3507
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,010
thinking film and sound I don't know if
you know this yeah and I know this very

3508
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:46,020
you know this yeah and I know this very
 

3509
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,590
you know this yeah and I know this very
well you do the the the film and sound

3510
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:48,600
well you do the the the film and sound
 

3511
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,470
well you do the the the film and sound
yeah like yes what how the time how the

3512
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:51,480
yeah like yes what how the time how the
 

3513
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:52,970
yeah like yes what how the time how the
timing has to work so that we conscious

3514
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:52,980
timing has to work so that we conscious
 

3515
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:55,070
timing has to work so that we conscious
so that our experiences of it happening

3516
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:55,080
so that our experiences of it happening
 

3517
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,390
so that our experiences of it happening
at the same time

3518
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
at the same time
 

3519
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:59,030
at the same time
let me just let me just sit in the in

3520
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,040
let me just let me just sit in the in
 

3521
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:01,729
let me just let me just sit in the in
the Silence of it there's been so much

3522
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:01,739
the Silence of it there's been so much
 

3523
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:04,189
the Silence of it there's been so much
pain on this one point

3524
01:09:04,189 --> 01:09:04,199
pain on this one point
 

3525
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:08,749
pain on this one point
so much we have no idea so I mean I yeah

3526
01:09:08,749 --> 01:09:08,759
so much we have no idea so I mean I yeah
 

3527
01:09:08,759 --> 01:09:11,030
so much we have no idea so I mean I yeah
I did a lot of algorithms on automatic

3528
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
I did a lot of algorithms on automatic
 

3529
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:13,309
I did a lot of algorithms on automatic
synchronization of audio and video and

3530
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:13,319
synchronization of audio and video and
 

3531
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,870
synchronization of audio and video and
all these kinds of things no I know this

3532
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:14,880
all these kinds of things no I know this
 

3533
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,510
all these kinds of things no I know this
well uh there's a lot of Science and

3534
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:17,520
well uh there's a lot of Science and
 

3535
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:18,769
well uh there's a lot of Science and
there's a lot of differences but it's

3536
01:09:18,769 --> 01:09:18,779
there's a lot of differences but it's
 

3537
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:20,150
there's a lot of differences but it's
about

3538
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:20,160
about
 

3539
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:22,550
about
and people claim it's about 100

3540
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
and people claim it's about 100
 

3541
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:23,809
and people claim it's about 100
milliseconds you can't tell the

3542
01:09:23,809 --> 01:09:23,819
milliseconds you can't tell the
 

3543
01:09:23,819 --> 01:09:25,970
milliseconds you can't tell the
difference but it's much more like 30 to

3544
01:09:25,970 --> 01:09:25,980
difference but it's much more like 30 to
 

3545
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:29,809
difference but it's much more like 30 to
50 milliseconds okay and it it Dr you

3546
01:09:29,809 --> 01:09:29,819
50 milliseconds okay and it it Dr you
 

3547
01:09:29,819 --> 01:09:31,849
50 milliseconds okay and it it Dr you
can go nuts trying to see if something

3548
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:31,859
can go nuts trying to see if something
 

3549
01:09:31,859 --> 01:09:34,370
can go nuts trying to see if something
is in sync or not yes is it in sync or

3550
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:34,380
is in sync or not yes is it in sync or
 

3551
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,470
is in sync or not yes is it in sync or
not well also am I out of sync right now

3552
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
not well also am I out of sync right now
 

3553
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,450
not well also am I out of sync right now
brain is constantly making adjustments

3554
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:38,460
brain is constantly making adjustments
 

3555
01:09:38,460 --> 01:09:41,630
brain is constantly making adjustments
yeah and so it can shift for you while

3556
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:41,640
yeah and so it can shift for you while
 

3557
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:42,950
yeah and so it can shift for you while
you're doing that which is probably part

3558
01:09:42,950 --> 01:09:42,960
you're doing that which is probably part
 

3559
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:45,530
you're doing that which is probably part
of the thing that's driving you crazy

3560
01:09:45,530 --> 01:09:45,540
of the thing that's driving you crazy
 

3561
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:47,510
of the thing that's driving you crazy
um okay so I'll start with binding

3562
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
um okay so I'll start with binding
 

3563
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,590
um okay so I'll start with binding
processes and then I'll just give a

3564
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:48,600
processes and then I'll just give a
 

3565
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,030
processes and then I'll just give a
couple examples

3566
01:09:50,030 --> 01:09:50,040
couple examples
 

3567
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:53,209
couple examples
um so yes there's this window

3568
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:53,219
um so yes there's this window
 

3569
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:56,229
um so yes there's this window
um where your brain is

3570
01:09:56,229 --> 01:09:56,239
um where your brain is
 

3571
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:58,669
um where your brain is
essentially putting all the information

3572
01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:58,679
essentially putting all the information
 

3573
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:01,910
essentially putting all the information
together to deliver you a present moment

3574
01:10:01,910 --> 01:10:01,920
together to deliver you a present moment
 

3575
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:04,010
together to deliver you a present moment
experience that is most useful for you

3576
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:04,020
experience that is most useful for you
 

3577
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,530
experience that is most useful for you
to navigate the world

3578
01:10:06,530 --> 01:10:06,540
to navigate the world
 

3579
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:07,310
to navigate the world
um

3580
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,320
um
 

3581
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,650
um
so as I said and you know I use this

3582
01:10:09,650 --> 01:10:09,660
so as I said and you know I use this
 

3583
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:11,689
so as I said and you know I use this
example of tennis in my book so the

3584
01:10:11,689 --> 01:10:11,699
example of tennis in my book so the
 

3585
01:10:11,699 --> 01:10:15,350
example of tennis in my book so the
sights and sounds are coming at us at

3586
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:15,360
sights and sounds are coming at us at
 

3587
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,910
sights and sounds are coming at us at
different rates

3588
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:16,920
different rates
 

3589
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,630
different rates
um it takes longer for a sensation in my

3590
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:20,640
um it takes longer for a sensation in my
 

3591
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,209
um it takes longer for a sensation in my
hand when I hit the ball with the racket

3592
01:10:23,209 --> 01:10:23,219
hand when I hit the ball with the racket
 

3593
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,910
hand when I hit the ball with the racket
to travel to my brain than it does for

3594
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
to travel to my brain than it does for
 

3595
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,149
to travel to my brain than it does for
the light waves to hit my retina and get

3596
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:29,159
the light waves to hit my retina and get
 

3597
01:10:29,159 --> 01:10:31,250
the light waves to hit my retina and get
processed by the brain so all these

3598
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:31,260
processed by the brain so all these
 

3599
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,810
processed by the brain so all these
these signals are coming in at different

3600
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:32,820
these signals are coming in at different
 

3601
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:35,510
these signals are coming in at different
times our brains go through this process

3602
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
times our brains go through this process
 

3603
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,030
times our brains go through this process
of binding to basically weave it all

3604
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,040
of binding to basically weave it all
 

3605
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:39,950
of binding to basically weave it all
together so that our our conscious

3606
01:10:39,950 --> 01:10:39,960
together so that our our conscious
 

3607
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,370
together so that our our conscious
experience of that is of seeing hearing

3608
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:43,380
experience of that is of seeing hearing
 

3609
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:45,229
experience of that is of seeing hearing
and feeling the ball hit the racket all

3610
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:45,239
and feeling the ball hit the racket all
 

3611
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:47,570
and feeling the ball hit the racket all
at the same time that's obviously most

3612
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:47,580
at the same time that's obviously most
 

3613
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,010
at the same time that's obviously most
useful to us

3614
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:49,020
useful to us
 

3615
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,709
useful to us
binding is is mostly about timing it can

3616
01:10:51,709 --> 01:10:51,719
binding is is mostly about timing it can
 

3617
01:10:51,719 --> 01:10:53,330
binding is is mostly about timing it can
be about other things but I was just

3618
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:53,340
be about other things but I was just
 

3619
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,890
be about other things but I was just
talking to David Eagleman who was

3620
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:54,900
talking to David Eagleman who was
 

3621
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:56,689
talking to David Eagleman who was
talking about a very simple experiment

3622
01:10:56,689 --> 01:10:56,699
talking about a very simple experiment
 

3623
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:59,750
talking about a very simple experiment
actually and this kind of shows how your

3624
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
actually and this kind of shows how your
 

3625
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,450
actually and this kind of shows how your
brain is basically always interacting

3626
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:02,460
brain is basically always interacting
 

3627
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:04,070
brain is basically always interacting
with the outside world and always making

3628
01:11:04,070 --> 01:11:04,080
with the outside world and always making
 

3629
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:07,370
with the outside world and always making
adjustments to make its best guess about

3630
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:07,380
adjustments to make its best guess about
 

3631
01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:10,370
adjustments to make its best guess about
the most useful present moment

3632
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:10,380
the most useful present moment
 

3633
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:12,530
the most useful present moment
experience to deliver

3634
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,540
experience to deliver
 

3635
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,630
experience to deliver
so this is a very simple experiment this

3636
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
so this is a very simple experiment this
 

3637
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,669
so this is a very simple experiment this
is from many many years ago

3638
01:11:16,669 --> 01:11:16,679
is from many many years ago
 

3639
01:11:16,679 --> 01:11:19,250
is from many many years ago
um and David David Eagleman was was

3640
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:19,260
um and David David Eagleman was was
 

3641
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:21,169
um and David David Eagleman was was
involved in this research where they had

3642
01:11:21,169 --> 01:11:21,179
involved in this research where they had
 

3643
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:23,630
involved in this research where they had
participants hit a button and that

3644
01:11:23,630 --> 01:11:23,640
participants hit a button and that
 

3645
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:30,050
participants hit a button and that
button caused a flash of light and

3646
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:30,060

 

3647
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:33,709

so our brains through binding the brain

3648
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:33,719
so our brains through binding the brain
 

3649
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:37,010
so our brains through binding the brain
it notices is is able to

3650
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:37,020
it notices is is able to
 

3651
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:39,470
it notices is is able to
kind of calibrate the experience you

3652
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:39,480
kind of calibrate the experience you
 

3653
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,990
kind of calibrate the experience you
have because the brain is aware that it

3654
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
have because the brain is aware that it
 

3655
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,149
have because the brain is aware that it
is its own hand that is causing the

3656
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
is its own hand that is causing the
 

3657
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,590
is its own hand that is causing the
light to flash that there's this cause

3658
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
light to flash that there's this cause
 

3659
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,070
light to flash that there's this cause
and effect going on and so you

3660
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:49,080
and effect going on and so you
 

3661
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,050
and effect going on and so you
have this experience of pushing the

3662
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:51,060
have this experience of pushing the
 

3663
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,550
have this experience of pushing the
button that causes the flash of Light

3664
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
button that causes the flash of Light
 

3665
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,189
button that causes the flash of Light
which is true and the light flashes

3666
01:11:55,189 --> 01:11:55,199
which is true and the light flashes
 

3667
01:11:55,199 --> 01:11:58,490
which is true and the light flashes
you can start to introduce longer pauses

3668
01:11:58,490 --> 01:11:58,500
you can start to introduce longer pauses
 

3669
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,310
you can start to introduce longer pauses
starting with 20 milliseconds 30

3670
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:01,320
starting with 20 milliseconds 30
 

3671
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,290
starting with 20 milliseconds 30
milliseconds going up to I think 100

3672
01:12:03,290 --> 01:12:03,300
milliseconds going up to I think 100
 

3673
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:06,470
milliseconds going up to I think 100
maybe even 200 milliseconds where if you

3674
01:12:06,470 --> 01:12:06,480
maybe even 200 milliseconds where if you
 

3675
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,570
maybe even 200 milliseconds where if you
do it gradually since your brain is

3676
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:08,580
do it gradually since your brain is
 

3677
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:10,850
do it gradually since your brain is
making the adjustment

3678
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:10,860
making the adjustment
 

3679
01:12:10,860 --> 01:12:12,890
making the adjustment
um you can introduce a delay I think

3680
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:12,900
um you can introduce a delay I think
 

3681
01:12:12,900 --> 01:12:15,590
um you can introduce a delay I think
it's up to 200 milliseconds if you do it

3682
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
it's up to 200 milliseconds if you do it
 

3683
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,470
it's up to 200 milliseconds if you do it
gradually you will still have the

3684
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:18,480
gradually you will still have the
 

3685
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,030
gradually you will still have the
experience even though there's now a

3686
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:20,040
experience even though there's now a
 

3687
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,470
experience even though there's now a
delay between when you hit the button

3688
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:21,480
delay between when you hit the button
 

3689
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,450
delay between when you hit the button
and the light flashes you will still

3690
01:12:23,450 --> 01:12:23,460
and the light flashes you will still
 

3691
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,189
and the light flashes you will still
have the exact same experience you had

3692
01:12:25,189 --> 01:12:25,199
have the exact same experience you had
 

3693
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:26,689
have the exact same experience you had
initially which is that the light

3694
01:12:26,689 --> 01:12:26,699
initially which is that the light
 

3695
01:12:26,699 --> 01:12:28,130
initially which is that the light
flashes right when you push the button

3696
01:12:28,130 --> 01:12:28,140
flashes right when you push the button
 

3697
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:31,250
flashes right when you push the button
in your experience nothing is changing

3698
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:31,260
in your experience nothing is changing
 

3699
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,689
in your experience nothing is changing
but then

3700
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:32,699
but then
 

3701
01:12:32,699 --> 01:12:36,709
but then
so they they gradually give a delay

3702
01:12:36,709 --> 01:12:36,719
so they they gradually give a delay
 

3703
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,870
so they they gradually give a delay
you've acclimated to that because it was

3704
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
you've acclimated to that because it was
 

3705
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,090
you've acclimated to that because it was
done gradually if they then go back to

3706
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:41,100
done gradually if they then go back to
 

3707
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,450
done gradually if they then go back to
the original instantaneous flash your

3708
01:12:44,450 --> 01:12:44,460
the original instantaneous flash your
 

3709
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,310
the original instantaneous flash your
brain doesn't have time to make the

3710
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
brain doesn't have time to make the
 

3711
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,390
brain doesn't have time to make the
adjustment

3712
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:47,400
adjustment
 

3713
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:50,570
adjustment
and you have the experience that the

3714
01:12:50,570 --> 01:12:50,580
and you have the experience that the
 

3715
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:52,550
and you have the experience that the
light flashed before you hit the button

3716
01:12:52,550 --> 01:12:52,560
light flashed before you hit the button
 

3717
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:54,470
light flashed before you hit the button
and that is your true experience it's

3718
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
and that is your true experience it's
 

3719
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,510
and that is your true experience it's
not like you're confused but that is

3720
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:56,520
not like you're confused but that is
 

3721
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:59,270
not like you're confused but that is
your brain didn't have time to to make

3722
01:12:59,270 --> 01:12:59,280
your brain didn't have time to to make
 

3723
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:00,770
your brain didn't have time to to make
that adjustment you think you're in the

3724
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:00,780
that adjustment you think you're in the
 

3725
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,030
that adjustment you think you're in the
same environment you're pushing the

3726
01:13:02,030 --> 01:13:02,040
same environment you're pushing the
 

3727
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:03,470
same environment you're pushing the
button it makes the light flash it's

3728
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:03,480
button it makes the light flash it's
 

3729
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,630
button it makes the light flash it's
kind of

3730
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:04,640
kind of
 

3731
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:07,550
kind of
calibrating all the time but then the

3732
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:07,560
calibrating all the time but then the
 

3733
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,830
calibrating all the time but then the
the participants are suddenly saying oh

3734
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:09,840
the participants are suddenly saying oh
 

3735
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,510
the participants are suddenly saying oh
wait that was so weird the light flashed

3736
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
wait that was so weird the light flashed
 

3737
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,490
wait that was so weird the light flashed
before I hit the button

3738
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:13,500
before I hit the button
 

3739
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:17,209
before I hit the button
and so these types that's crazy they

3740
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:17,219
and so these types that's crazy they
 

3741
01:13:17,219 --> 01:13:19,430
and so these types that's crazy they
built a

3742
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:19,440
built a
 

3743
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,149
built a
um Rochambeau rock paper scissors

computer game that was unbeatable based

3746
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:25,860
computer game that was unbeatable based
 

3747
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,729
computer game that was unbeatable based
on this glitch that you can present in

3748
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:28,739
on this glitch that you can present in
 

3749
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,950
on this glitch that you can present in
in binding by training someone if you

3750
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
in binding by training someone if you
 

3751
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,130
in binding by training someone if you
introduce a delay slowly enough then the

3752
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:34,140
introduce a delay slowly enough then the
 

3753
01:13:34,140 --> 01:13:36,830
introduce a delay slowly enough then the
computer can get the information

3754
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:36,840
computer can get the information
 

3755
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:40,250
computer can get the information
before it responds but you still have

3756
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:40,260
before it responds but you still have
 

3757
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,410
before it responds but you still have
the experience that you're both

3758
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:42,420
the experience that you're both
 

3759
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,350
the experience that you're both
throwing out your rock or paper scissors

3760
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
throwing out your rock or paper scissors
 

3761
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:48,290
throwing out your rock or paper scissors
at the same time but in actuality the

3762
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:48,300
at the same time but in actuality the
 

3763
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,450
at the same time but in actuality the
computer

3764
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:50,460
computer
 

3765
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,250
computer
saw your choice

3766
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:52,260
saw your choice
 

3767
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,590
saw your choice
before it makes its choice and it's in

3768
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:54,600
before it makes its choice and it's in
 

3769
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,030
before it makes its choice and it's in
this window of milliseconds where you

3770
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:56,040
this window of milliseconds where you
 

3771
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,410
this window of milliseconds where you
don't notice it

3772
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:57,420
don't notice it
 

3773
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,229
don't notice it
so that starts to help you build up an

3774
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:00,239
so that starts to help you build up an
 

3775
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:02,510
so that starts to help you build up an
intuition that this conscious experience

3776
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:02,520
intuition that this conscious experience
 

3777
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:05,209
intuition that this conscious experience
is an illusion constructed by the brain

3778
01:14:05,209 --> 01:14:05,219
is an illusion constructed by the brain
 

3779
01:14:05,219 --> 01:14:07,850
is an illusion constructed by the brain
after uh conscious will conscious will

3780
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:07,860
after uh conscious will conscious will
 

3781
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,250
after uh conscious will conscious will
yeah and and just in general that that

3782
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:10,260
yeah and and just in general that that
 

3783
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:13,790
yeah and and just in general that that
Consciousness is not the thing that we

3784
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:13,800
Consciousness is not the thing that we
 

3785
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,030
Consciousness is not the thing that we
feel it is which is driving the behavior

3786
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:17,040
feel it is which is driving the behavior
 

3787
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,729
feel it is which is driving the behavior
that is actually at the tail end of it

3788
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:19,739
that is actually at the tail end of it
 

3789
01:14:19,739 --> 01:14:20,870
that is actually at the tail end of it
and so a lot of decision-making

3790
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
and so a lot of decision-making
 

3791
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,790
and so a lot of decision-making
processes and they're studies that are

3792
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:22,800
processes and they're studies that are
 

3793
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,310
processes and they're studies that are
more controversial and I don't usually

3794
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:25,320
more controversial and I don't usually
 

3795
01:14:25,320 --> 01:14:26,510
more controversial and I don't usually
um like to cite them although if you

3796
01:14:26,510 --> 01:14:26,520
um like to cite them although if you
 

3797
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:27,649
um like to cite them although if you
want to talk about them we can they're

3798
01:14:27,649 --> 01:14:27,659
want to talk about them we can they're
 

3799
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:29,390
want to talk about them we can they're
super interesting and into intuition

3800
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:29,400
super interesting and into intuition
 

3801
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,250
super interesting and into intuition
shattering but they're they're now

3802
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:31,260
shattering but they're they're now
 

3803
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,350
shattering but they're they're now
studies specifically about free will to

3804
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
studies specifically about free will to
 

3805
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,169
studies specifically about free will to
see if there are markers at the level of

3806
01:14:36,169 --> 01:14:36,179
see if there are markers at the level of
 

3807
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,330
see if there are markers at the level of
the brain they can see what decision

3808
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:38,340
the brain they can see what decision
 

3809
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,890
the brain they can see what decision
you're going to make and when you make

3810
01:14:39,890 --> 01:14:39,900
you're going to make and when you make
 

3811
01:14:39,900 --> 01:14:43,130
you're going to make and when you make
that decision and I think this the

3812
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:43,140
that decision and I think this the
 

3813
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:44,990
that decision and I think this the
Neuroscience inevitably is just going to

3814
01:14:44,990 --> 01:14:45,000
Neuroscience inevitably is just going to
 

3815
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,330
Neuroscience inevitably is just going to
get better and so

3816
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:47,340
get better and so
 

3817
01:14:47,340 --> 01:14:49,250
get better and so
part of the reason I'm so passionate

3818
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:49,260
part of the reason I'm so passionate
 

3819
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,810
part of the reason I'm so passionate
about this I mean there's there's the

3820
01:14:50,810 --> 01:14:50,820
about this I mean there's there's the
 

3821
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,490
about this I mean there's there's the
science and there's just the Curiosity

3822
01:14:52,490 --> 01:14:52,500
science and there's just the Curiosity
 

3823
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,130
science and there's just the Curiosity
that that drives me of wanting to

3824
01:14:55,130 --> 01:14:55,140
that that drives me of wanting to
 

3825
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:57,830
that that drives me of wanting to
understand how the universe works but I

3826
01:14:57,830 --> 01:14:57,840
understand how the universe works but I
 

3827
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,649
understand how the universe works but I
actually see a lot of the Neuroscience

3828
01:15:00,649 --> 01:15:00,659
actually see a lot of the Neuroscience
 

3829
01:15:00,659 --> 01:15:04,310
actually see a lot of the Neuroscience
presenting us with truths that are going

3830
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:04,320
presenting us with truths that are going
 

3831
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,189
presenting us with truths that are going
to be difficult for us to accept

3832
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
to be difficult for us to accept
 

3833
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,410
to be difficult for us to accept
and I actually think there are really

3834
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:09,420
and I actually think there are really
 

3835
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,610
and I actually think there are really
positive ways to view these truths that

3836
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:13,620
positive ways to view these truths that
 

3837
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,250
positive ways to view these truths that
we're uncovering and even though they

3838
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:16,260
we're uncovering and even though they
 

3839
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:18,709
we're uncovering and even though they
can be initially kind of jarring and

3840
01:15:18,709 --> 01:15:18,719
can be initially kind of jarring and
 

3841
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:22,310
can be initially kind of jarring and
even destabilizing and creepy I think

3842
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:22,320
even destabilizing and creepy I think
 

3843
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,290
even destabilizing and creepy I think
ultimately

3844
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:24,300
ultimately
 

3845
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:27,290
ultimately
there's actually a lot

3846
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:27,300
there's actually a lot
 

3847
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:29,810
there's actually a lot
it can have a positive effect on human

3848
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:29,820
it can have a positive effect on human
 

3849
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:31,870
it can have a positive effect on human
psychology and a whole range of things

3850
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:31,880
psychology and a whole range of things
 

3851
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:34,850
psychology and a whole range of things
that I and others have have experienced

3852
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:34,860
that I and others have have experienced
 

3853
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,590
that I and others have have experienced
and that I think it's important for us

3854
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:36,600
and that I think it's important for us
 

3855
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,390
and that I think it's important for us
to talk about because

3856
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:38,400
to talk about because
 

3857
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,790
to talk about because
you can't hide from the truth especially

3858
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:40,800
you can't hide from the truth especially
 

3859
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,669
you can't hide from the truth especially
in science right like it just it will

3860
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:43,679
in science right like it just it will
 

3861
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:46,370
in science right like it just it will
reveal itself and if this is true I

3862
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:46,380
reveal itself and if this is true I
 

3863
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,590
reveal itself and if this is true I
think not only

3864
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:48,600
think not only
 

3865
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,990
think not only
for better understanding the universe

3866
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:51,000
for better understanding the universe
 

3867
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,030
for better understanding the universe
than nature which is kind of my my

3868
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:53,040
than nature which is kind of my my
 

3869
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,130

primary passion

3870
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:55,140
primary passion
 

3871
01:15:55,140 --> 01:16:00,370
primary passion
um it's important for us to

3872
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:00,380

 

3873
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:04,669

absorb these facts and realize that they

3874
01:16:04,669 --> 01:16:04,679
absorb these facts and realize that they
 

3875
01:16:04,679 --> 01:16:06,649
absorb these facts and realize that they
don't it doesn't necessarily take away

3876
01:16:06,649 --> 01:16:06,659
don't it doesn't necessarily take away
 

3877
01:16:06,659 --> 01:16:09,470
don't it doesn't necessarily take away
the things from us that we fear

3878
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:09,480
the things from us that we fear
 

3879
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:11,149
the things from us that we fear
um I you know I've heard people say this

3880
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:11,159
um I you know I've heard people say this
 

3881
01:16:11,159 --> 01:16:13,910
um I you know I've heard people say this
is talked about the common common point

3882
01:16:13,910 --> 01:16:13,920
is talked about the common common point
 

3883
01:16:13,920 --> 01:16:15,709
is talked about the common common point
to make or question to ask a scientist

3884
01:16:15,709 --> 01:16:15,719
to make or question to ask a scientist
 

3885
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:17,090
to make or question to ask a scientist
can you still

3886
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:17,100
can you still
 

3887
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:19,310
can you still
you know enjoy chocolate if you're a

3888
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:19,320
you know enjoy chocolate if you're a
 

3889
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:22,070
you know enjoy chocolate if you're a
molecular biologist and

3890
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:22,080
molecular biologist and
 

3891
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,870
molecular biologist and
um is in a molecular biologist that

3892
01:16:23,870 --> 01:16:23,880
um is in a molecular biologist that
 

3893
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:24,830
um is in a molecular biologist that
would be the one who would understand

3894
01:16:24,830 --> 01:16:24,840
would be the one who would understand
 

3895
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:28,030
would be the one who would understand
how we experience chocolate

3896
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:28,040
how we experience chocolate
 

3897
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:30,709
how we experience chocolate
yeah but anyway if you get the point

3898
01:16:30,709 --> 01:16:30,719
yeah but anyway if you get the point
 

3899
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:32,750
yeah but anyway if you get the point
stance if you're focused on the the

3900
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:32,760
stance if you're focused on the the
 

3901
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:35,630
stance if you're focused on the the
details of the you know the underlying

3902
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:35,640
details of the you know the underlying
 

3903
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:37,790
details of the you know the underlying
nature of reality does that take

3904
01:16:37,790 --> 01:16:37,800
nature of reality does that take
 

3905
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:42,110
nature of reality does that take
the joy and the pleasure and for lack of

3906
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,120
the joy and the pleasure and for lack of
 

3907
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,950
the joy and the pleasure and for lack of
a better word spirituality out of our

3908
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:45,960
a better word spirituality out of our
 

3909
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,570
a better word spirituality out of our
experience as human beings and I

3910
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:47,580
experience as human beings and I
 

3911
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,189
experience as human beings and I
actually think

3912
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
actually think
 

3913
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,410
actually think
um for these Illusions like Free Will

3914
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:51,420
um for these Illusions like Free Will
 

3915
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,570
um for these Illusions like Free Will
and self the reverse is true I actually

3916
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:53,580
and self the reverse is true I actually
 

3917
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,250
and self the reverse is true I actually
think they can give us

3918
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:55,260
think they can give us
 

3919
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,689
think they can give us
their reasons and bases for

3920
01:16:59,689 --> 01:16:59,699
their reasons and bases for
 

3921
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:02,510
their reasons and bases for
feeling more connected to each other and

3922
01:17:02,510 --> 01:17:02,520
feeling more connected to each other and
 

3923
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:05,689
feeling more connected to each other and
to the universe for Spiritual

3924
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:05,699
to the universe for Spiritual
 

3925
01:17:05,699 --> 01:17:08,990
to the universe for Spiritual
experiences for

3926
01:17:08,990 --> 01:17:09,000
experiences for
 

3927
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:09,950
experiences for
um

3928
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:09,960
um
 

3929
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:12,350
um
even just on a more basic level for

3930
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:12,360
even just on a more basic level for
 

3931
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,290
even just on a more basic level for
increasing our well-being just in terms

3932
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:15,300
increasing our well-being just in terms
 

3933
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:18,350
increasing our well-being just in terms
of our psychology of lowering rates of

3934
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:18,360
of our psychology of lowering rates of
 

3935
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,630
of our psychology of lowering rates of
depression and anxiety and

3936
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:20,640
depression and anxiety and
 

3937
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,830
depression and anxiety and
um actually I think these realizations

3938
01:17:21,830 --> 01:17:21,840
um actually I think these realizations
 

3939
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:25,070
um actually I think these realizations
can be extremely helpful to people

3940
01:17:25,070 --> 01:17:25,080
can be extremely helpful to people
 

3941
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:28,209
can be extremely helpful to people
well it's like uh realizing that the

3942
01:17:28,209 --> 01:17:28,219
well it's like uh realizing that the
 

3943
01:17:28,219 --> 01:17:30,530
well it's like uh realizing that the
universe doesn't rotate around Earth

3944
01:17:30,530 --> 01:17:30,540
universe doesn't rotate around Earth
 

3945
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,570
universe doesn't rotate around Earth
that the Earth is not the center the

3946
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:32,580

addiction so at the level of the brain I

4028
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:20,580
addiction so at the level of the brain I
 

4029
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:22,189
addiction so at the level of the brain I
think stop me if I'm repeating myself

mode Network
 

4035
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:30,229
mode Network
um and so we actually know that when the

4036
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:30,239
um and so we actually know that when the
 

4037
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,030
um and so we actually know that when the
default mode network is quieted down

4038
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:32,040
default mode network is quieted down
 

4039
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,250
default mode network is quieted down
when people lose a sense of self in

there is a feeling that people describe
 

4047
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,410
there is a feeling that people describe
of

4048

of
 

4049
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:45,770

connected to the rest of Nature and so
 

4053
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,450
connected to the rest of Nature and so
that's a piece of it that I think if you

4054
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:50,460
that's a piece of it that I think if you
 

4055
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:53,209
that's a piece of it that I think if you
haven't had the experience

you feel you are immediately your
 

4065
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:07,729
you feel you are immediately your
experiences are embedded in the universe

4066
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:07,739
experiences are embedded in the universe
 

4067
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:11,510
experiences are embedded in the universe
and you are a piece of everything and

you see that everything is
interconnected and so rather than

01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:15,480
interconnected and so rather than
 

4073
01:20:15,480 --> 01:20:18,470
interconnected and so rather than
feeling like a lonely eye in this bigger

we have to tell ourselves that isn't
true and the fact is we have these facts

um
 

4141
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,110
um
looking at the truth actually provides

4142
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:54,120
looking at the truth actually provides
 

4143
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:56,330
looking at the truth actually provides
us with that psychological feeling we're

us with that psychological feeling we're
 

4145
01:21:56,340 --> 01:21:57,649
us with that psychological feeling we're
searching for and I think that's

4146
01:21:57,649 --> 01:21:57,659
searching for and I think that's
 

4147
01:21:57,659 --> 01:22:00,590
searching for and I think that's
important to point out I think humans

4148
01:22:00,590 --> 01:22:00,600
important to point out I think humans
 

4149
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,110
important to point out I think humans
are

4150
01:22:02,110 --> 01:22:02,120
are
 

4151
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,870

through
 

4171
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,130
through
because

4172
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:31,140
because
 

4173
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,010
because
the parts on Free Will were so upsetting

4174
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:34,020
the parts on Free Will were so upsetting
 

4175
01:22:34,020 --> 01:22:35,630
the parts on Free Will were so upsetting
to them

01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,910
to them
and this is something I think about a

4178
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:37,920
and this is something I think about a
 

4179
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,649
and this is something I think about a
lot because of that

4180
01:22:39,649 --> 01:22:39,659
lot because of that
 

4181
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:43,250
lot because of that
kind of breaks my heart

4182
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:43,260
kind of breaks my heart
 

4183
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:45,410

um I don't
because I see this potential for these

4186
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
because I see this potential for these
 

4187
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,570
because I see this potential for these
realizations bringing

4188
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:53,580

 

4189
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,850

an initial
 

4199
01:23:06,840 --> 01:23:08,149
an initial
um

4200
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:08,159

fear or kind of spooky spooky quality
that can come out of these realizations

4204
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:13,140
that can come out of these realizations

and it took
 

4419
01:27:45,300 --> 01:27:49,550
and it took
taking all of that anxiety away to

4420
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:49,560
taking all of that anxiety away to
 

4421
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:52,310
taking all of that anxiety away to
recognize how much I had been

4422
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
recognize how much I had been
 

4423

emotionally abusive and I thought that
 

4515
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,290
emotionally abusive and I thought that
all of the ways I experienced the world

4516
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:39,300
all of the ways I experienced the world
 

4517

sensitivities
 

4521
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:45,590
sensitivities
um I thought almost all of that if not

4522
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:45,600
um I thought almost all of that if not
 

4523
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:47,570
um I thought almost all of that if not
all of that was because of these

4524
01:29:47,570 --> 01:29:47,580
all of that was because of these
 

4525
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,310
all of that was because of these
experiences I had growing up and Trauma

4526
01:29:49,310 --> 01:29:49,320
experiences I had growing up and Trauma
 

4527
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,649
experiences I had growing up and Trauma
that I experienced as a child and

4528
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:51,659
that I experienced as a child and
 

4529
01:29:51,659 --> 01:29:53,930
that I experienced as a child and
obviously those things play a part but

4530
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:53,940
obviously those things play a part but
 

4531
01:29:53,940 --> 01:29:56,330
obviously those things play a part but
what I realized

4532
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:56,340
what I realized
 

4533
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:58,129
what I realized
um after going through postpartum and

4534
01:29:58,129 --> 01:29:58,139
um after going through postpartum and
 

4535
01:29:58,139 --> 01:29:59,870
um after going through postpartum and
then the thing that was extremely

4536
01:29:59,870 --> 01:29:59,880
then the thing that was extremely
 

4537
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:01,669
then the thing that was extremely
informative to me was having my own

4538
01:30:01,669 --> 01:30:01,679
informative to me was having my own
 

4539
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:03,590
informative to me was having my own
children

4540
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,600
children
 

4541
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,610
children
um

4542
01:30:04,610 --> 01:30:04,620
um
 

4543
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:07,669
um
because they were basically living my

4544
01:30:07,669 --> 01:30:07,679
because they were basically living my
 

4545
01:30:07,679 --> 01:30:09,830
because they were basically living my
dream childhood they had none of the

4546
01:30:09,830 --> 01:30:09,840
dream childhood they had none of the
 

4547
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:12,110
dream childhood they had none of the
things that I thought were the cause of

4548
01:30:12,110 --> 01:30:12,120
things that I thought were the cause of
 

4549
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,030
things that I thought were the cause of
the psychological suffering that I

4550
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:14,040
the psychological suffering that I
 

4551
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:15,590
the psychological suffering that I
experienced

4552
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,600
experienced
 

4553
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:18,470
experienced
um there was none of that and they have

4554
01:30:18,470 --> 01:30:18,480
um there was none of that and they have
 

4555
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,629
um there was none of that and they have
a lot of the same

4556
01:30:20,629 --> 01:30:20,639
a lot of the same
 

4557
01:30:20,639 --> 01:30:22,070
a lot of the same
um they struggle with a lot of the same

4558
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:22,080
um they struggle with a lot of the same
 

4559
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,390
um they struggle with a lot of the same
anxiety and panic attacks and what I

4560
01:30:26,390 --> 01:30:26,400
anxiety and panic attacks and what I
 

4561
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:30,290
anxiety and panic attacks and what I
realized was

4562
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:30,300

 

4563
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:32,390

how much were kind of Born Into the

4564
01:30:32,390 --> 01:30:32,400
how much were kind of Born Into the
 

4565
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,490
how much were kind of Born Into the
world with these things that we that we

4566
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:34,500
world with these things that we that we
 

4567
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:35,990
world with these things that we that we
struggle with and with our strengths and

4568
01:30:35,990 --> 01:30:36,000
struggle with and with our strengths and
 

4569
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,390
struggle with and with our strengths and
with all of that and of course then if

4570
01:30:38,390 --> 01:30:38,400
with all of that and of course then if
 

4571
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,950
with all of that and of course then if
you have an abusive childhood if you're

4572
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:39,960
you have an abusive childhood if you're
 

4573
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,050
you have an abusive childhood if you're
if you're someone who

4574
01:30:42,050 --> 01:30:42,060
if you're someone who
 

4575
01:30:42,060 --> 01:30:44,629
if you're someone who
tends to be anxious and sensitive and

4576
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:44,639
tends to be anxious and sensitive and
 

4577
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,729
tends to be anxious and sensitive and
empathic and then you're you're born

4578
01:30:46,729 --> 01:30:46,739
empathic and then you're you're born
 

4579
01:30:46,739 --> 01:30:49,430
empathic and then you're you're born
into an abusive situation that's obvious

4580
01:30:49,430 --> 01:30:49,440
into an abusive situation that's obvious
 

4581
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,649
into an abusive situation that's obvious
terrible combination

4582
01:30:51,649 --> 01:30:51,659
terrible combination
 

4583
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:54,709
terrible combination
but I'd never acknowledged or realized

4584
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:54,719
but I'd never acknowledged or realized
 

4585
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,669
but I'd never acknowledged or realized
how strong just the the genetics and the

4586
01:30:58,669 --> 01:30:58,679
how strong just the the genetics and the
 

4587
01:30:58,679 --> 01:31:00,470
how strong just the the genetics and the
wiring

4588
01:31:00,470 --> 01:31:00,480

of accepting the challenges you're born

I think they're part of the same process

I think they're part of the same process
 

4601
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,209
I think they're part of the same process

4603
01:31:20,219 --> 01:31:24,050

it's kind of necessary to accept

it's kind of necessary to accept
 

4605
01:31:24,060 --> 01:31:26,990
it's kind of necessary to accept
what you're experiencing and what the

4606
01:31:26,990 --> 01:31:27,000
what you're experiencing and what the
 

4607

01:31:35,930 --> 01:31:35,940
thoughts and patterns you tend toward in
 

4615

01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:42,360
the same process could life have been

01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:44,450
the same process could life have been
any different I do regret certain

01:31:44,450 --> 01:31:44,460
any different I do regret certain

not by you I mean you know it depends
 

4627
01:31:50,520 --> 01:31:52,310

depends on what level we're talking I

4628
01:31:52,310 --> 01:31:52,320
depends on what level we're talking I
 

4629
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:54,290
depends on what level we're talking I

I don't believe anything could be

I don't believe anything could be
 

4633
01:31:55,980 --> 01:31:58,610
I don't believe anything could be
different are you able to think about at

4634
01:31:58,610 --> 01:31:58,620
different are you able to think about at
 

4635
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,770
different are you able to think about at
that level about your own life sure and

4636
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:00,780
that level about your own life sure and
 

4637
01:32:00,780 --> 01:32:01,910
that level about your own life sure and
that's actually that's part of what I

4638
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
that's actually that's part of what I
 

4639
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,189
that's actually that's part of what I
was when I wanted to kind of talk a

4640
01:32:04,189 --> 01:32:04,199
was when I wanted to kind of talk a
 

4641
01:32:04,199 --> 01:32:06,290
was when I wanted to kind of talk a
little bit about the

4642
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:06,300
little bit about the
 

4643
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:09,770
little bit about the
um levels of usefulness of being aware

4644
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:09,780
um levels of usefulness of being aware
 

4645
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:12,470
um levels of usefulness of being aware
of these different Illusions because I

4646
01:32:12,470 --> 01:32:12,480
of these different Illusions because I
 

4647
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:14,450
of these different Illusions because I
would say most of the time in our daily

4648
01:32:14,450 --> 01:32:14,460
would say most of the time in our daily
 

4649
01:32:14,460 --> 01:32:15,890
would say most of the time in our daily
lives

4650
01:32:15,890 --> 01:32:15,900
lives
 

4651
01:32:15,900 --> 01:32:17,330
lives
um the types of illusions that I'm

4652
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:17,340
um the types of illusions that I'm
 

4653
01:32:17,340 --> 01:32:19,790
um the types of illusions that I'm
interested in in shaking up are not

4654
01:32:19,790 --> 01:32:19,800
interested in in shaking up are not
 

4655
01:32:19,800 --> 01:32:22,370
interested in in shaking up are not
useful to remind ourselves of most of

4656
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:22,380
useful to remind ourselves of most of
 

4657
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:23,570
useful to remind ourselves of most of
the time

4658
01:32:23,570 --> 01:32:23,580
the time
 

4659
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,490
the time
I really think there are different

4660
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:25,500
I really think there are different
 

4661
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,790
I really think there are different
levels of usefulness to

4662
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:28,800
levels of usefulness to
 

4663
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:31,669
levels of usefulness to
thinking about and reminding ourselves

4664
01:32:31,669 --> 01:32:31,679
thinking about and reminding ourselves
 

4665
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,189
thinking about and reminding ourselves
of the places where we have false

4666
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:34,199
of the places where we have false
 

4667
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:37,370
of the places where we have false
intuitions and so I I often use

4668
01:32:37,370 --> 01:32:37,380
intuitions and so I I often use
 

4669
01:32:37,380 --> 01:32:38,330
intuitions and so I I often use
um

4670
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:38,340
um
 

4671
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:42,530
um
the analogy of living on a sphere

4672
01:32:42,530 --> 01:32:42,540
the analogy of living on a sphere
 

4673
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:44,270
the analogy of living on a sphere
um so

4674
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:44,280
um so
 

4675
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:46,850
um so
it still feels to most of us most of the

4676
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:46,860
it still feels to most of us most of the
 

4677
01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:48,290
it still feels to most of us most of the
time I mean in our intuitive sense we're

4678
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:48,300
time I mean in our intuitive sense we're
 

4679
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:50,209
time I mean in our intuitive sense we're
not thinking about whether the the Earth

4680
01:32:50,209 --> 01:32:50,219
not thinking about whether the the Earth
 

4681
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:53,570
not thinking about whether the the Earth
is flat or a sphere but we behave as if

4682
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:53,580
is flat or a sphere but we behave as if
 

4683
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,729
is flat or a sphere but we behave as if
it's flat and that makes the most sense

4684
01:32:55,729 --> 01:32:55,739
it's flat and that makes the most sense
 

4685
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:58,070
it's flat and that makes the most sense
and

4686
01:32:58,070 --> 01:32:58,080
and
 

4687
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,470
and
um it would be exhausting to keep

4688
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
um it would be exhausting to keep
 

4689
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:02,149
um it would be exhausting to keep
reminding ourselves as we walk down the

4690
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,159
reminding ourselves as we walk down the
 

4691
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:03,950
reminding ourselves as we walk down the
street like it feels flat but it's not

4692
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:03,960
street like it feels flat but it's not
 

4693
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,010
street like it feels flat but it's not
flat like there's just no reason to do

4694
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:07,020
flat like there's just no reason to do
 

4695
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,530
flat like there's just no reason to do
it's not useful in in that moment um if

4696
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:09,540
it's not useful in in that moment um if
 

4697
01:33:09,540 --> 01:33:10,850
it's not useful in in that moment um if
you're building a house you can build it

4698
01:33:10,850 --> 01:33:10,860
you're building a house you can build it
 

4699
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:12,709
you're building a house you can build it
as if the world is flat

4700
01:33:12,709 --> 01:33:12,719
as if the world is flat
 

4701
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:13,370
as if the world is flat
um

4702
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:13,380
um
 

4703
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:16,669
um
and but you know of course so that so

4704
01:33:16,669 --> 01:33:16,679
and but you know of course so that so
 

4705
01:33:16,679 --> 01:33:18,350
and but you know of course so that so
their psychological reasons to bring it

4706
01:33:18,350 --> 01:33:18,360
their psychological reasons to bring it
 

4707
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:20,510
their psychological reasons to bring it
into view and maybe even spiritual

4708
01:33:20,510 --> 01:33:20,520
into view and maybe even spiritual
 

4709
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:21,890
into view and maybe even spiritual
reasons to bring an interview and then

4710
01:33:21,890 --> 01:33:21,900
reasons to bring an interview and then
 

4711
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:24,530
reasons to bring an interview and then
there's just like usefulness so if

4712
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:24,540
there's just like usefulness so if
 

4713
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:26,990
there's just like usefulness so if
you're building a rocket to the moon you

4714
01:33:26,990 --> 01:33:27,000
you're building a rocket to the moon you
 

4715
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,390
you're building a rocket to the moon you
better understand

4716
01:33:28,390 --> 01:33:28,400
better understand
 

4717
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:31,370
better understand
the geometry of the earth

4718
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:31,380
the geometry of the earth
 

4719
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:32,870
the geometry of the earth
um even if you're flying an airplane if

4720
01:33:32,870 --> 01:33:32,880
um even if you're flying an airplane if
 

4721
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,189
um even if you're flying an airplane if
you're an airplane pilot you have you

4722
01:33:34,189 --> 01:33:34,199
you're an airplane pilot you have you
 

4723
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:36,050
you're an airplane pilot you have you
have to be aware of the truth of our

4724
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:36,060
have to be aware of the truth of our
 

4725
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:37,430
have to be aware of the truth of our
situation

4726
01:33:37,430 --> 01:33:37,440
situation
 

4727
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:38,450
situation
um and then I think there are other

4728
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:38,460
um and then I think there are other
 

4729
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:40,490
um and then I think there are other
places where it's interesting

4730
01:33:40,490 --> 01:33:40,500
places where it's interesting
 

4731
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:42,830
places where it's interesting
to remind ourselves is where I I start

4732
01:33:42,830 --> 01:33:42,840
to remind ourselves is where I I start
 

4733
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:44,270
to remind ourselves is where I I start
out my book

4734
01:33:44,270 --> 01:33:44,280
out my book
 

4735
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:45,830
out my book
um just

4736
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:45,840
um just
 

4737
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,729
um just
as a way to inspire awe and to get

4738
01:33:49,729 --> 01:33:49,739
as a way to inspire awe and to get
 

4739
01:33:49,739 --> 01:33:52,189
as a way to inspire awe and to get
yourself out of your everyday life and

4740
01:33:52,189 --> 01:33:52,199
yourself out of your everyday life and
 

4741
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:55,310
yourself out of your everyday life and
see the big picture which can be

4742
01:33:55,310 --> 01:33:55,320
see the big picture which can be
 

4743
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:58,550
see the big picture which can be
um just a relief but also helps you feel

4744
01:33:58,550 --> 01:33:58,560
um just a relief but also helps you feel
 

4745
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,129
um just a relief but also helps you feel
more connected to the universe into

4746
01:34:01,129 --> 01:34:01,139
more connected to the universe into
 

4747
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:04,729
more connected to the universe into
something larger than ourselves and so I

4748
01:34:04,729 --> 01:34:04,739
something larger than ourselves and so I
 

4749
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:07,550
something larger than ourselves and so I
see these intuitions

4750
01:34:07,550 --> 01:34:07,560
see these intuitions
 

4751
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,410
see these intuitions
um reminding ourselves that these

4752
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:09,420
um reminding ourselves that these
 

4753
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:11,570
um reminding ourselves that these
intuitions are Illusions in the same way

4754
01:34:11,570 --> 01:34:11,580
intuitions are Illusions in the same way
 

4755
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:14,090
intuitions are Illusions in the same way
that most of the time they're not useful

4756
01:34:14,090 --> 01:34:14,100
that most of the time they're not useful
 

4757
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,850
that most of the time they're not useful
they are useful if we want to think

4758
01:34:16,850 --> 01:34:16,860
they are useful if we want to think
 

4759
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,490
they are useful if we want to think
about a science of Consciousness they're

4760
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:19,500
about a science of Consciousness they're
 

4761
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:21,850
about a science of Consciousness they're
useful for a whole range of

4762
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:21,860
useful for a whole range of
 

4763
01:34:21,860 --> 01:34:24,470
useful for a whole range of
neuroscientific studies and I think they

4764
01:34:24,470 --> 01:34:24,480
neuroscientific studies and I think they
 

4765
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:27,649
neuroscientific studies and I think they
can be incredibly useful in the same way

4766
01:34:27,649 --> 01:34:27,659
can be incredibly useful in the same way
 

4767
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:31,610
can be incredibly useful in the same way
that lying on the ground and feeling the

4768
01:34:31,610 --> 01:34:31,620
that lying on the ground and feeling the
 

4769
01:34:31,620 --> 01:34:33,890
that lying on the ground and feeling the
gravity pushing you against a sphere and

4770
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:33,900
gravity pushing you against a sphere and
 

4771
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,750
gravity pushing you against a sphere and
realizing you're floating in the middle

4772
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:35,760
realizing you're floating in the middle
 

4773
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,090
realizing you're floating in the middle
of outer space

4774
01:34:37,090 --> 01:34:37,100
of outer space
 

4775
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:40,250
of outer space
it gives me the same feeling to realize

4776
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:40,260
it gives me the same feeling to realize
 

4777
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:41,450
it gives me the same feeling to realize
and so

4778
01:34:41,450 --> 01:34:41,460
and so
 

4779
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:44,570
and so
I have I mean there's so many levels to

4780
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:44,580
I have I mean there's so many levels to
 

4781
01:34:44,580 --> 01:34:47,750
I have I mean there's so many levels to
it but if I'm thinking about difficult

4782
01:34:47,750 --> 01:34:47,760
it but if I'm thinking about difficult
 

4783
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,970
it but if I'm thinking about difficult
things that I've experienced

4784
01:34:49,970 --> 01:34:49,980
things that I've experienced
 

4785
01:34:49,980 --> 01:34:53,090
things that I've experienced
um different traumas in my life when I

4786
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:53,100
um different traumas in my life when I
 

4787
01:34:53,100 --> 01:34:55,010
um different traumas in my life when I
take a step back and kind of get this

4788
01:34:55,010 --> 01:34:55,020
take a step back and kind of get this
 

4789
01:34:55,020 --> 01:34:56,750
take a step back and kind of get this
bird's eye view of

4790
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:56,760
bird's eye view of
 

4791
01:34:56,760 --> 01:34:59,390
bird's eye view of
kind of the mystery of this unfolding of

4792
01:34:59,390 --> 01:34:59,400
kind of the mystery of this unfolding of
 

4793
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:02,270
kind of the mystery of this unfolding of
the universe and the fact that

4794
01:35:02,270 --> 01:35:02,280
the universe and the fact that
 

4795
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,669
the universe and the fact that
um it happened the way it happened and

4796
01:35:04,669 --> 01:35:04,679
um it happened the way it happened and
 

4797
01:35:04,679 --> 01:35:05,810
um it happened the way it happened and
whether it could have happened another

4798
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:05,820
whether it could have happened another
 

4799
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:08,030
whether it could have happened another
way or there's no going back that is

4800
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:08,040
way or there's no going back that is
 

4801
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:11,450
way or there's no going back that is
that's the way it unfolded and being

4802
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:11,460
that's the way it unfolded and being
 

4803
01:35:11,460 --> 01:35:14,390
that's the way it unfolded and being
able to surrender to that I think

4804
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
able to surrender to that I think
 

4805
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,629
able to surrender to that I think
um is very psychologically healthy and

4806
01:35:17,629 --> 01:35:17,639
um is very psychologically healthy and
 

4807
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:19,430
um is very psychologically healthy and
and prevents us from I mean I think

4808
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,440
and prevents us from I mean I think
 

4809
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:23,750
and prevents us from I mean I think
regret is one of the most toxic Loops we

4810
01:35:23,750 --> 01:35:23,760
regret is one of the most toxic Loops we
 

4811
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,750
regret is one of the most toxic Loops we
can get into so this is this is a path

4812
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:26,760
can get into so this is this is a path
 

4813
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:30,470
can get into so this is this is a path
to acceptance oh absolutely yeah because

4814
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
to acceptance oh absolutely yeah because
 

4815
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,410
to acceptance oh absolutely yeah because
Free Will I mean I think part of what is

4816
01:35:33,410 --> 01:35:33,420
Free Will I mean I think part of what is
 

4817
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:36,649
Free Will I mean I think part of what is
the function of the experience of it is

4818
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:36,659
the function of the experience of it is
 

4819
01:35:36,659 --> 01:35:38,810
the function of the experience of it is
is learning um I mean I think we can

4820
01:35:38,810 --> 01:35:38,820
is learning um I mean I think we can
 

4821
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,490
is learning um I mean I think we can
still learn without being under the

4822
01:35:40,490 --> 01:35:40,500
still learn without being under the
 

4823
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,110
still learn without being under the
illusion that we that we have free will

4824
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:42,120
illusion that we that we have free will
 

4825
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:45,229
illusion that we that we have free will
so for some people depression

4826
01:35:45,229 --> 01:35:45,239
so for some people depression
 

4827
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:49,550
so for some people depression
can destroy them so how did how how can

4828
01:35:49,550 --> 01:35:49,560
can destroy them so how did how how can
 

4829
01:35:49,560 --> 01:35:52,450
can destroy them so how did how how can
you think about

4830
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:52,460

 

4831
01:35:52,460 --> 01:35:55,430

avoiding that yeah so one so I didn't

4832
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
avoiding that yeah so one so I didn't
 

4833
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:58,729
avoiding that yeah so one so I didn't

01:35:58,729 --> 01:35:58,739
totally answer your question first is um
 

4835
01:35:58,739 --> 01:36:00,129
totally answer your question first is um
therapy

4836
01:36:00,129 --> 01:36:00,139
therapy
 

4837
01:36:00,139 --> 01:36:03,709
therapy
ways that I have

4838
01:36:03,709 --> 01:36:03,719
ways that I have
 

4839
01:36:03,719 --> 01:36:06,169
ways that I have
have worked through anxiety and

uh an introvert and a deeply
 

4845
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:13,310
uh an introvert and a deeply
intellectual person therapy works for

4846
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:13,320
intellectual person therapy works for
 

4847
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:14,149
intellectual person therapy works for
you

4848
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:14,159
you
 

4849
01:36:14,159 --> 01:36:15,590
you
to a point

4850
01:36:15,590 --> 01:36:15,600
to a point
 

4851
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:18,229
to a point
it was very helpful

4852
01:36:18,229 --> 01:36:18,239
it was very helpful

um I mean I think talk therapy is one
tool and can be helpful

4856
01:36:23,209 --> 01:36:23,219
tool and can be helpful
 

4857
01:36:23,219 --> 01:36:25,970
tool and can be helpful
for I mean it depends on the therapist

4858
01:36:25,970 --> 01:36:25,980
for I mean it depends on the therapist
 

4859
01:36:25,980 --> 01:36:27,590
for I mean it depends on the therapist
it depends on the type of therapy but I

4860
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:27,600
it depends on the type of therapy but I
 

4861
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:28,850
it depends on the type of therapy but I
I found it

4862
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:28,860
I found it
 

4863
01:36:28,860 --> 01:36:32,930
I found it
to be one piece and probably not the

4864
01:36:32,930 --> 01:36:32,940
to be one piece and probably not the
 

4865
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,270
to be one piece and probably not the
biggest piece actually

4866
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:35,280
biggest piece actually
 

4867
01:36:35,280 --> 01:36:37,189
biggest piece actually
um but I think

4868
01:36:37,189 --> 01:36:37,199
um but I think
 

4869
01:36:37,199 --> 01:36:38,930
um but I think
Medicare I wish I had discovered

4870
01:36:38,930 --> 01:36:38,940
Medicare I wish I had discovered
 

4871
01:36:38,940 --> 01:36:41,330
Medicare I wish I had discovered
medication sooner that

4872
01:36:41,330 --> 01:36:41,340
medication sooner that
 

4873
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,010
medication sooner that
would have made a big difference in my

4874
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:43,020
would have made a big difference in my
 

4875
01:36:43,020 --> 01:36:45,530
would have made a big difference in my
life even just intellectually to realize

4876
01:36:45,530 --> 01:36:45,540
life even just intellectually to realize
 

4877
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,149
life even just intellectually to realize
that oh

4878
01:36:47,149 --> 01:36:47,159
that oh
 

4879
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:49,430
that oh
like I'm not life was a lot harder than

4880
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
like I'm not life was a lot harder than
 

4881
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,189
like I'm not life was a lot harder than
it needed to be yeah and it wasn't about

4882
01:36:52,189 --> 01:36:52,199
it needed to be yeah and it wasn't about
 

4883
01:36:52,199 --> 01:36:54,530
it needed to be yeah and it wasn't about
keeping everything just so

4884
01:36:54,530 --> 01:36:54,540
keeping everything just so
 

4885
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:56,750
keeping everything just so
um you know there's another state my

4886
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:56,760
um you know there's another state my
 

4887
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,330
um you know there's another state my
brain can be in where I don't have to

4888
01:36:59,330 --> 01:36:59,340
brain can be in where I don't have to
 

4889
01:36:59,340 --> 01:37:02,930
brain can be in where I don't have to
work so hard to be okay

4890
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:02,940

 

4891
01:37:02,940 --> 01:37:05,270

um meditation was probably the most

4892
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280
um meditation was probably the most
 

4893
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,689
um meditation was probably the most
meditation and psychedelic

4894
01:37:07,689 --> 01:37:07,699
meditation and psychedelic
 

4895
01:37:07,699 --> 01:37:09,890
meditation and psychedelic
experiences were probably the most

4896
01:37:09,890 --> 01:37:09,900
experiences were probably the most
 

4897
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,169
experiences were probably the most
transformative

4898
01:37:12,169 --> 01:37:12,179
transformative
 

4899
01:37:12,179 --> 01:37:13,189
transformative
um

4900
01:37:13,189 --> 01:37:13,199
um
 

4901
01:37:13,199 --> 01:37:16,129
um
but you know a lot of these things don't

4902
01:37:16,129 --> 01:37:16,139
but you know a lot of these things don't
 

4903
01:37:16,139 --> 01:37:20,270
but you know a lot of these things don't
you know I'm I'm lucky that I didn't my

4904
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:20,280
you know I'm I'm lucky that I didn't my
 

4905

got in the way of my living my life of
 

4909

got in the way of my living my life of
enjoying my life I mean there were

4910
01:37:28,129 --> 01:37:28,139
enjoying my life I mean there were

struggles that made life harder for me

4912
01:37:31,610 --> 01:37:31,620
struggles that made life harder for me
 

4913
01:37:31,620 --> 01:37:32,689
struggles that made life harder for me
um

4914
01:37:32,689 --> 01:37:32,699
um
 

4915
01:37:32,699 --> 01:37:35,390
um
but you know something like treatment

4916
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:35,400
but you know something like treatment
 

4917
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,010
but you know something like treatment
resistant depression

4918
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:37,020
resistant depression
 

4919
01:37:37,020 --> 01:37:40,250
resistant depression
or severe PTSD

4920
01:37:40,250 --> 01:37:40,260
or severe PTSD
 

4921
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,970
or severe PTSD
um these are things that

4922
01:37:43,970 --> 01:37:43,980
um these are things that
 

4923
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:45,709
um these are things that
you know at this point in time you know

4924
01:37:45,709 --> 01:37:45,719
you know at this point in time you know
 

4925
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:49,550
you know at this point in time you know
based on my understanding I think once

4926
01:37:49,550 --> 01:37:49,560
based on my understanding I think once
 

4927
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:52,070
based on my understanding I think once
you've tried and and the truth is that

4928
01:37:52,070 --> 01:37:52,080
you've tried and and the truth is that
 

4929
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,590
you've tried and and the truth is that
meditation is not is often not helpful

4930
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:54,600
meditation is not is often not helpful
 

4931
01:37:54,600 --> 01:37:55,910
meditation is not is often not helpful
for those things it can actually

4932
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:55,920
for those things it can actually
 

4933
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:58,250
for those things it can actually
exacerbate them

4934
01:37:58,250 --> 01:37:58,260
exacerbate them
 

4935
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:01,430
exacerbate them
um and the most promising thing that I

4936
01:38:01,430 --> 01:38:01,440
um and the most promising thing that I
 

4937
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,250
um and the most promising thing that I
have seen is this Research into

4938
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:03,260
have seen is this Research into
 

4939
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:06,530
have seen is this Research into
psychedelic therapy assisted psychedelic

4940
01:38:06,530 --> 01:38:06,540
psychedelic therapy assisted psychedelic
 

4941
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:07,970
psychedelic therapy assisted psychedelic
does that make sense to you that

4942
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:07,980
does that make sense to you that
 

4943
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:09,590
does that make sense to you that
psychedelics work so well for such

4944
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:09,600
psychedelics work so well for such
 

4945
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,570
psychedelics work so well for such
difficult cases what what is it about

4946
01:38:11,570 --> 01:38:11,580
difficult cases what what is it about
 

4947
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,490
difficult cases what what is it about
psychedelics and I've been following

4948
01:38:13,490 --> 01:38:13,500
psychedelics and I've been following
 

4949
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,350
psychedelics and I've been following
This research from the beginning when

4950
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:15,360
This research from the beginning when
 

4951
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:17,390
This research from the beginning when
they were doing end of life yeah they

4952
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:17,400
they were doing end of life yeah they
 

4953
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:19,129
they were doing end of life yeah they
started with end-of-life patients I

4954
01:38:19,129 --> 01:38:19,139
started with end-of-life patients I
 

4955
01:38:19,139 --> 01:38:21,290
started with end-of-life patients I
don't know maybe 20 years ago I met at a

4956
01:38:21,290 --> 01:38:21,300
don't know maybe 20 years ago I met at a
 

4957
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:23,390
don't know maybe 20 years ago I met at a
Ted conference I met one of the doctors

4958
01:38:23,390 --> 01:38:23,400
Ted conference I met one of the doctors
 

4959
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:25,970
Ted conference I met one of the doctors
who was who was doing this research it

4960
01:38:25,970 --> 01:38:25,980
who was who was doing this research it
 

4961
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:27,649
who was who was doing this research it
was the first time I became aware that

4962
01:38:27,649 --> 01:38:27,659
was the first time I became aware that
 

4963
01:38:27,659 --> 01:38:29,990
was the first time I became aware that
the research was happening and I'd

4964
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
the research was happening and I'd
 

4965
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,030
the research was happening and I'd
already had my own experiences before

4966
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:32,040
already had my own experiences before
 

4967
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,970
already had my own experiences before
that and so it made perfect sense to me

4968
01:38:34,970 --> 01:38:34,980
that and so it made perfect sense to me
 

4969
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:36,950
that and so it made perfect sense to me
that this would work it was still

4970
01:38:36,950 --> 01:38:36,960
that this would work it was still
 

4971
01:38:36,960 --> 01:38:39,110
that this would work it was still
astonishing to see the results to see

4972
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:39,120
astonishing to see the results to see
 

4973
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:41,570
astonishing to see the results to see
how successful

4974
01:38:41,570 --> 01:38:41,580
how successful
 

4975
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:44,629
how successful
um the work is so much of the time but

4976
01:38:44,629 --> 01:38:44,639
um the work is so much of the time but
 

4977
01:38:44,639 --> 01:38:46,310
um the work is so much of the time but
it doesn't surprise me it makes sense

4978
01:38:46,310 --> 01:38:46,320
it doesn't surprise me it makes sense
 

4979
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,870
it doesn't surprise me it makes sense
and it's actually in line with all these

4980
01:38:47,870 --> 01:38:47,880
and it's actually in line with all these
 

4981
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:50,629
and it's actually in line with all these
other things so quieting down

4982
01:38:50,629 --> 01:38:50,639
other things so quieting down
 

4983
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,270
other things so quieting down
the default mode Network

4984
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
the default mode Network
 

4985
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,830
the default mode Network
one of the things that's so

4986
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:54,840
one of the things that's so
 

4987
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:57,830
one of the things that's so
transformative about taking something

4988
01:38:57,830 --> 01:38:57,840
transformative about taking something
 

4989
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:00,169
transformative about taking something
like psilocybin and everyone's

4990
01:39:00,169 --> 01:39:00,179
like psilocybin and everyone's
 

4991
01:39:00,179 --> 01:39:01,790
like psilocybin and everyone's
experience is different it can vary each

4992
01:39:01,790 --> 01:39:01,800
experience is different it can vary each
 

4993
01:39:01,800 --> 01:39:04,070
experience is different it can vary each
time you take it even in a single person

4994
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:04,080
time you take it even in a single person
 

4995
01:39:04,080 --> 01:39:05,270
time you take it even in a single person
but

4996
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
but
 

4997
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,129
but
the experience I had and the experience

4998
01:39:07,129 --> 01:39:07,139
the experience I had and the experience
 

4999
01:39:07,139 --> 01:39:08,570
the experience I had and the experience
that many people have that is so

5000
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:08,580
that many people have that is so
 

5001
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:10,370
that many people have that is so
transformative is this feeling that's

5002
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:10,380
transformative is this feeling that's
 

5003
01:39:10,380 --> 01:39:12,530
transformative is this feeling that's
very hard to describe but it's a feeling

5004
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:12,540
very hard to describe but it's a feeling
 

5005
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:16,910
very hard to describe but it's a feeling
of being one with the universe and that

5006
01:39:16,910 --> 01:39:16,920
of being one with the universe and that
 

5007
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:19,010
of being one with the universe and that
comes with it's kind of all one feeling

5008
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:19,020
comes with it's kind of all one feeling
 

5009
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:21,169
comes with it's kind of all one feeling
that that is again hard to put into

5010
01:39:21,169 --> 01:39:21,179
that that is again hard to put into
 

5011
01:39:21,179 --> 01:39:22,910
that that is again hard to put into
words but there's this feeling that

5012
01:39:22,910 --> 01:39:22,920
words but there's this feeling that
 

5013
01:39:22,920 --> 01:39:26,750
words but there's this feeling that
everything is okay

5014
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:26,760

 

5015
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:28,490

um and I'd never had that feeling before

5016
01:39:28,490 --> 01:39:28,500
um and I'd never had that feeling before
 

5017
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:31,010
um and I'd never had that feeling before
in my life and when I took psychedelics

5018
01:39:31,010 --> 01:39:31,020
in my life and when I took psychedelics
 

5019
01:39:31,020 --> 01:39:33,050
in my life and when I took psychedelics
that feeling would stay with me for

5020
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:33,060
that feeling would stay with me for
 

5021
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:35,510
that feeling would stay with me for
months and I never understood why and it

5022
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:35,520
months and I never understood why and it
 

5023
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:36,890
months and I never understood why and it
was always fascinating to me but there

5024
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:36,900
was always fascinating to me but there
 

5025
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,169
was always fascinating to me but there
was it was as if I was glimpsing a

5026
01:39:39,169 --> 01:39:39,179
was it was as if I was glimpsing a
 

5027
01:39:39,179 --> 01:39:43,850
was it was as if I was glimpsing a
deeper truth of the world that

5028
01:39:43,850 --> 01:39:43,860

 

5029
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:48,169

it's all one thing we're all connected

5030
01:39:48,169 --> 01:39:48,179
it's all one thing we're all connected
 

5031
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:50,990
it's all one thing we're all connected
um there's no sense that there could

5032
01:39:50,990 --> 01:39:51,000
um there's no sense that there could
 

5033
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:53,330
um there's no sense that there could
even be a feeling of loneliness it was

5034
01:39:53,330 --> 01:39:53,340
even be a feeling of loneliness it was
 

5035
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,910
even be a feeling of loneliness it was
just this visceral sense of being one

5036
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
just this visceral sense of being one
 

5037
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:58,250
just this visceral sense of being one
with everything and that everything was

5038
01:39:58,250 --> 01:39:58,260
with everything and that everything was
 

5039
01:39:58,260 --> 01:39:59,870
with everything and that everything was
okay that all the things I was afraid of

5040
01:39:59,870 --> 01:39:59,880
okay that all the things I was afraid of
 

5041
01:39:59,880 --> 01:40:01,790
okay that all the things I was afraid of
even death

5042
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:01,800
even death
 

5043
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:03,169
even death
um

5044
01:40:03,169 --> 01:40:03,179
um
 

5045
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:05,689
um
that the Universe in a sense is just is

5046
01:40:05,689 --> 01:40:05,699
that the Universe in a sense is just is
 

5047
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:08,810
that the Universe in a sense is just is
is an endless Recycling and

5048
01:40:08,810 --> 01:40:08,820
is an endless Recycling and
 

5049
01:40:08,820 --> 01:40:12,050
is an endless Recycling and
I don't know it's hard to describe but

5050
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:12,060
I don't know it's hard to describe but
 

5051
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:14,270
I don't know it's hard to describe but
we also know on the other side that

5052
01:40:14,270 --> 01:40:14,280
we also know on the other side that
 

5053
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:15,950
we also know on the other side that
depression and anxiety

5054
01:40:15,950 --> 01:40:15,960
depression and anxiety
 

5055
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:18,169
depression and anxiety
in when people are experiencing those

5056
01:40:18,169 --> 01:40:18,179
in when people are experiencing those
 

5057
01:40:18,179 --> 01:40:21,649
in when people are experiencing those
things the default mode network is is

5058
01:40:21,649 --> 01:40:21,659
things the default mode network is is
 

5059
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:25,729
things the default mode network is is
more active yeah and so it's this this

5060
01:40:25,729 --> 01:40:25,739
more active yeah and so it's this this
 

5061
01:40:25,739 --> 01:40:27,890
more active yeah and so it's this this
cycling and this kind of obsessive

5062
01:40:27,890 --> 01:40:27,900
cycling and this kind of obsessive
 

5063
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:31,850
cycling and this kind of obsessive
cycles of thinking about one's self that

5064
01:40:31,850 --> 01:40:31,860
cycles of thinking about one's self that
 

5065
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:33,590
cycles of thinking about one's self that
is a huge part of the suffering in the

5066
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:33,600
is a huge part of the suffering in the
 

5067
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,709
is a huge part of the suffering in the
first place and so

5068
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:36,719
first place and so
 

5069
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:38,510
first place and so
the one thing that's surprising to me

5070
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:38,520
the one thing that's surprising to me
 

5071
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:41,149
the one thing that's surprising to me
about the research is that

5072
01:40:41,149 --> 01:40:41,159
about the research is that
 

5073
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:44,510
about the research is that
um I I may be fudging the the data but

5074
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:44,520
um I I may be fudging the the data but
 

5075
01:40:44,520 --> 01:40:48,410
um I I may be fudging the the data but
it's something like 80 of people who are

5076
01:40:48,410 --> 01:40:48,420
it's something like 80 of people who are
 

5077
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,669
it's something like 80 of people who are
treated for PTSD after one

5078
01:40:52,669 --> 01:40:52,679
treated for PTSD after one
 

5079
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:56,570
treated for PTSD after one
only one session are cured of their pts

5080
01:40:56,570 --> 01:40:56,580
only one session are cured of their pts
 

5081
01:40:56,580 --> 01:40:59,330
only one session are cured of their pts
yeah the the effect stays for prolonged

5082
01:40:59,330 --> 01:40:59,340
yeah the the effect stays for prolonged
 

5083
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:01,010
yeah the the effect stays for prolonged
periods of time yeah that's really

5084
01:41:01,010 --> 01:41:01,020
periods of time yeah that's really
 

5085
01:41:01,020 --> 01:41:02,750
periods of time yeah that's really
interesting an addiction as well which

5086
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:02,760
interesting an addiction as well which
 

5087
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,610
interesting an addiction as well which
is interesting that's not something I'm

5088
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:04,620
is interesting that's not something I'm
 

5089
01:41:04,620 --> 01:41:07,070
is interesting that's not something I'm
like personally personally familiar with

5090
01:41:07,070 --> 01:41:07,080
like personally personally familiar with
 

5091
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,530
like personally personally familiar with
so that was a surprise to me but yeah I

5092
01:41:09,530 --> 01:41:09,540
so that was a surprise to me but yeah I
 

5093
01:41:09,540 --> 01:41:11,510
so that was a surprise to me but yeah I
mean it's just wonderful that we

5094
01:41:11,510 --> 01:41:11,520
mean it's just wonderful that we
 

5095
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,970
mean it's just wonderful that we
yeah it's incredible I mean of course

5096
01:41:13,970 --> 01:41:13,980
yeah it's incredible I mean of course
 

5097
01:41:13,980 --> 01:41:15,950
yeah it's incredible I mean of course
it's also incredible for people who

5098
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:15,960
it's also incredible for people who
 

5099
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:18,770
it's also incredible for people who
don't uh suffer to see what psychedelics

5100
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:18,780
don't uh suffer to see what psychedelics
 

5101
01:41:18,780 --> 01:41:20,810
don't uh suffer to see what psychedelics
can do with the mind which is that kind

5102
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:20,820
can do with the mind which is that kind
 

5103
01:41:20,820 --> 01:41:22,490
can do with the mind which is that kind
of appreciation well and I think it's

5104
01:41:22,490 --> 01:41:22,500
of appreciation well and I think it's
 

5105
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:24,950
of appreciation well and I think it's
actually important for this work it's

5106
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
actually important for this work it's
 

5107
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,169
actually important for this work it's
one of the questions I ask everyone I

5108
01:41:27,169 --> 01:41:27,179
one of the questions I ask everyone I
 

5109
01:41:27,179 --> 01:41:28,490
one of the questions I ask everyone I
talk to

5110
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:28,500
talk to
 

5111
01:41:28,500 --> 01:41:30,830
talk to
for this series

5112
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:30,840
for this series
 

5113
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:32,689
for this series
um many of them you know I won't be able

5114
01:41:32,689 --> 01:41:32,699
um many of them you know I won't be able
 

5115
01:41:32,699 --> 01:41:33,970
um many of them you know I won't be able
to use that audio

5116
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:33,980
to use that audio
 

5117
01:41:33,980 --> 01:41:36,950
to use that audio
or a lot of them yes and what their

5118
01:41:36,950 --> 01:41:36,960
or a lot of them yes and what their
 

5119
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:38,330
or a lot of them yes and what their
experience wasn't if that's informed you

5120
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:38,340
experience wasn't if that's informed you
 

5121
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:41,330
experience wasn't if that's informed you
know actually initially in the 50s I

5122
01:41:41,330 --> 01:41:41,340
know actually initially in the 50s I
 

5123
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:42,590
know actually initially in the 50s I
want to do more research on this and

5124
01:41:42,590 --> 01:41:42,600
want to do more research on this and
 

5125
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,629
want to do more research on this and
look into it but in the 50s there were

5126
01:41:44,629 --> 01:41:44,639
look into it but in the 50s there were
 

5127
01:41:44,639 --> 01:41:47,090
look into it but in the 50s there were
some studies that were being done with

5128
01:41:47,090 --> 01:41:47,100
some studies that were being done with
 

5129
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:49,729
some studies that were being done with
Scientists who there were hundreds of

5130
01:41:49,729 --> 01:41:49,739
Scientists who there were hundreds of
 

5131
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:52,729
Scientists who there were hundreds of
scientists they put into the study where

5132
01:41:52,729 --> 01:41:52,739
scientists they put into the study where
 

5133
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:55,669
scientists they put into the study where
they were on the brink of some kind of

5134
01:41:55,669 --> 01:41:55,679
they were on the brink of some kind of
 

5135
01:41:55,679 --> 01:41:57,350
they were on the brink of some kind of
Discovery some where they were stuck so

5136
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:57,360
Discovery some where they were stuck so
 

5137
01:41:57,360 --> 01:41:59,209
Discovery some where they were stuck so
they had been doing research and they

5138
01:41:59,209 --> 01:41:59,219
they had been doing research and they
 

5139
01:41:59,219 --> 01:42:02,209
they had been doing research and they
were stuck and they used psychedelics to

5140
01:42:02,209 --> 01:42:02,219
were stuck and they used psychedelics to
 

5141
01:42:02,219 --> 01:42:04,250
were stuck and they used psychedelics to
come up with an answer to find a path

5142
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:04,260
come up with an answer to find a path
 

5143
01:42:04,260 --> 01:42:06,830
come up with an answer to find a path
forward and it was extremely useful for

5144
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:06,840
forward and it was extremely useful for
 

5145
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,050
forward and it was extremely useful for
that yeah I mean it's fascinating and

5146
01:42:09,050 --> 01:42:09,060
that yeah I mean it's fascinating and
 

5147
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:10,790
that yeah I mean it's fascinating and
then the nice thing about psychedelics

5148
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
then the nice thing about psychedelics
 

5149
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:13,010
then the nice thing about psychedelics
for my perception is that they don't

5150
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:13,020
for my perception is that they don't
 

5151
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:15,350
for my perception is that they don't
currently suffer from the taboo that

5152
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
currently suffer from the taboo that
 

5153
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,890
currently suffer from the taboo that
weed does

5154
01:42:17,890 --> 01:42:17,900
weed does
 

5155
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:22,030
weed does
I don't think so like um for example

5156
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:22,040
I don't think so like um for example
 

5157
01:42:22,040 --> 01:42:24,470
I don't think so like um for example
there's some kind of uh cultural

5158
01:42:24,470 --> 01:42:24,480
there's some kind of uh cultural
 

5159
01:42:24,480 --> 01:42:26,590
there's some kind of uh cultural
construct about a pothead

5160
01:42:26,590 --> 01:42:26,600
construct about a pothead
 

5161
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:30,350
construct about a pothead
that makes it so that you know like Elon

5162
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:30,360
that makes it so that you know like Elon
 

5163
01:42:30,360 --> 01:42:32,570
that makes it so that you know like Elon
got in trouble for smoking weed right he

5164
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:32,580
got in trouble for smoking weed right he
 

5165
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:33,470
got in trouble for smoking weed right he
would have gotten in trouble for taking

5166
01:42:33,470 --> 01:42:33,480
would have gotten in trouble for taking
 

5167
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:36,590
would have gotten in trouble for taking
mushrooms too I don't know really I

5168
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:36,600
mushrooms too I don't know really I
 

5169
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,270
mushrooms too I don't know really I
don't think so oh that's interesting I

5170
01:42:38,270 --> 01:42:38,280
don't think so oh that's interesting I
 

5171
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:39,350
don't think so oh that's interesting I
don't think that's a surprise to me

5172
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
don't think that's a surprise to me
 

5173
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:41,570
don't think that's a surprise to me
because mushrooms mushrooms to me seem

5174
01:42:41,570 --> 01:42:41,580
because mushrooms mushrooms to me seem
 

5175
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:44,810
because mushrooms mushrooms to me seem
like a journey like there's a perception

5176
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:44,820
like a journey like there's a perception
 

5177
01:42:44,820 --> 01:42:46,669
like a journey like there's a perception
that you don't take mushrooms all the

5178
01:42:46,669 --> 01:42:46,679
that you don't take mushrooms all the
 

5179
01:42:46,679 --> 01:42:48,109
that you don't take mushrooms all the
time it's not an addictive substance

5180
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:48,119
time it's not an addictive substance
 

5181
01:42:48,119 --> 01:42:50,450
time it's not an addictive substance
it's not a lifestyle it's uh it's like

5182
01:42:50,450 --> 01:42:50,460
it's not a lifestyle it's uh it's like
 

5183
01:42:50,460 --> 01:42:52,010
it's not a lifestyle it's uh it's like
going to burning man it's like a

5184
01:42:52,010 --> 01:42:52,020
going to burning man it's like a
 

5185
01:42:52,020 --> 01:42:53,750
going to burning man it's like a
experience that stays with you for a

5186
01:42:53,750 --> 01:42:53,760
experience that stays with you for a
 

5187
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,070
experience that stays with you for a
long time didn't realize that

5188
01:42:55,070 --> 01:42:55,080
long time didn't realize that
 

5189
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,930
long time didn't realize that
understanding had permeated into the

5190
01:42:56,930 --> 01:42:56,940
understanding had permeated into the
 

5191
01:42:56,940 --> 01:42:59,030
understanding had permeated into the
culture yeah it's a good question of how

5192
01:42:59,030 --> 01:42:59,040
culture yeah it's a good question of how
 

5193
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:01,850
culture yeah it's a good question of how
uh if it has or not because maybe I have

5194
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:01,860
uh if it has or not because maybe I have
 

5195
01:43:01,860 --> 01:43:04,129
uh if it has or not because maybe I have
a very narrow perspective these kinds of

5196
01:43:04,129 --> 01:43:04,139
a very narrow perspective these kinds of
 

5197
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:07,370
a very narrow perspective these kinds of
things but I think what has permeated is

5198
01:43:07,370 --> 01:43:07,380
things but I think what has permeated is
 

5199
01:43:07,380 --> 01:43:09,649
things but I think what has permeated is
through Hollywood ideas of what it means

5200
01:43:09,649 --> 01:43:09,659
through Hollywood ideas of what it means
 

5201
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:11,209
through Hollywood ideas of what it means
to be a person who smokes weed a lot

5202
01:43:11,209 --> 01:43:11,219
to be a person who smokes weed a lot
 

5203
01:43:11,219 --> 01:43:14,450
to be a person who smokes weed a lot
yeah and that and that has like has it

5204
01:43:14,450 --> 01:43:14,460
yeah and that and that has like has it
 

5205
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:17,209
yeah and that and that has like has it
has had its effect which is hilarious

5206
01:43:17,209 --> 01:43:17,219
has had its effect which is hilarious
 

5207
01:43:17,219 --> 01:43:19,370
has had its effect which is hilarious
given

5208
01:43:19,370 --> 01:43:19,380
given
 

5209
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:22,129
given
the the effects of weed versus alcohol

5210
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:22,139
the the effects of weed versus alcohol
 

5211
01:43:22,139 --> 01:43:25,910
the the effects of weed versus alcohol
but that's a whole nother story

5212
01:43:25,910 --> 01:43:25,920

 

5213
01:43:25,920 --> 01:43:27,290

and you've spoken

5214
01:43:27,290 --> 01:43:27,300
and you've spoken
 

5215
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:30,649
and you've spoken
spoken yeah yeah so well not not a lot I

really want to do a lot more I've taken
 

5219
01:43:32,940 --> 01:43:36,050
really want to do a lot more I've taken
uh mushrooms aspirations yeah I mean

5220
01:43:36,050 --> 01:43:36,060

um yeah no I I love the idea obviously
uh I love the idea I love that you know

5534
01:49:57,890 --> 01:49:57,900
uh I love the idea I love that you know
 

5535
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,689
uh I love the idea I love that you know
I fast I'm faster for three days I want

5536
01:49:59,689 --> 01:49:59,699
I fast I'm faster for three days I want
 

5537
01:49:59,699 --> 01:50:02,990
I fast I'm faster for three days I want
to fast for longer that's also yeah in a

5538
01:50:02,990 --> 01:50:03,000
to fast for longer that's also yeah in a
 

5539
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,850
to fast for longer that's also yeah in a
different way perhaps but it brings you

5540
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:04,860
different way perhaps but it brings you
 

5541
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:07,070
different way perhaps but it brings you
makes you more sensitive to the world

5542
01:50:07,070 --> 01:50:07,080
makes you more sensitive to the world
 

5543
01:50:07,080 --> 01:50:08,689
makes you more sensitive to the world
around you smile I'm not exactly sure

5544
01:50:08,689 --> 01:50:08,699
around you smile I'm not exactly sure
 

5545
01:50:08,699 --> 01:50:10,910
around you smile I'm not exactly sure
what the Yeah the chemistry of that is

5546
01:50:10,910 --> 01:50:10,920
what the Yeah the chemistry of that is
 

5547
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:12,770
what the Yeah the chemistry of that is
but obviously you're

5548
01:50:12,770 --> 01:50:12,780
but obviously you're
 

5549
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:14,390
but obviously you're
actually it's not obvious because you're

5550
01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:14,400
actually it's not obvious because you're
 

5551
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:16,910
actually it's not obvious because you're
not always that hungry uh but you're

5552
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:16,920
not always that hungry uh but you're
 

5553
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:19,790
not always that hungry uh but you're
more time slows down and you feel things

5554
01:50:19,790 --> 01:50:19,800
more time slows down and you feel things
 

5555
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:21,350
more time slows down and you feel things
you feel a breeze all this kind of stuff

5556
01:50:21,350 --> 01:50:21,360
you feel a breeze all this kind of stuff
 

5557
01:50:21,360 --> 01:50:24,169
you feel a breeze all this kind of stuff
right it's very interesting uh you've I

5558
01:50:24,169 --> 01:50:24,179
right it's very interesting uh you've I
 

5559
01:50:24,179 --> 01:50:25,910
right it's very interesting uh you've I
think a tweeted something about ideas

5560
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
think a tweeted something about ideas
 

5561
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,729
think a tweeted something about ideas
coming out from

5562
01:50:27,729 --> 01:50:27,739
coming out from
 

5563
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:30,890
coming out from
sometimes feeling about coming from

5564
01:50:30,890 --> 01:50:30,900
sometimes feeling about coming from
 

5565
01:50:30,900 --> 01:50:32,990
sometimes feeling about coming from
outside of you sometimes so you

5566
01:50:32,990 --> 01:50:33,000
outside of you sometimes so you
 

5567
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:34,910
outside of you sometimes so you
mentioned as you meditate

5568
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:34,920
mentioned as you meditate
 

5569
01:50:34,920 --> 01:50:37,129
mentioned as you meditate
you know you notice these ideas come in

5570
01:50:37,129 --> 01:50:37,139
you know you notice these ideas come in
 

5571
01:50:37,139 --> 01:50:38,530
you know you notice these ideas come in
so

5572
01:50:38,530 --> 01:50:38,540
so
 

5573
01:50:38,540 --> 01:50:42,770
so
thoughts ideas how did that connect

5574
01:50:42,770 --> 01:50:42,780
thoughts ideas how did that connect
 

5575
01:50:42,780 --> 01:50:45,530
thoughts ideas how did that connect
consciousness

5576
01:50:45,530 --> 01:50:45,540
consciousness
 

5577
01:50:45,540 --> 01:50:47,870
consciousness
so the thing I was responding to that

5578
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:47,880
so the thing I was responding to that
 

5579
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:50,390
so the thing I was responding to that
you wrote

5580
01:50:50,390 --> 01:50:50,400
you wrote
 

5581
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,530
you wrote
um

5582
01:50:51,530 --> 01:50:51,540
um
 

5583
01:50:51,540 --> 01:50:55,970
um
I think I was partly

5584
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:55,980

 

5585
01:50:55,980 --> 01:50:59,930

picking up on the part of you that would

5586
01:50:59,930 --> 01:50:59,940
picking up on the part of you that would
 

5587
01:50:59,940 --> 01:51:01,490
picking up on the part of you that would
really get a lot out of a Meditation

5588
01:51:01,490 --> 01:51:01,500
really get a lot out of a Meditation
 

5589
01:51:01,500 --> 01:51:02,689
really get a lot out of a Meditation
Retreat

5590
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:02,699
Retreat
 

5591
01:51:02,699 --> 01:51:04,609
Retreat
that was my way of beginning that

5592
01:51:04,609 --> 01:51:04,619
that was my way of beginning that
 

5593
01:51:04,619 --> 01:51:06,950
that was my way of beginning that
conversation

5594
01:51:06,950 --> 01:51:06,960
conversation
 

5595
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,990
conversation
um that experience you had of a thought

5596
01:51:11,990 --> 01:51:12,000
um that experience you had of a thought
 

5597
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,229
um that experience you had of a thought
coming from somewhere else

5598
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:14,239
coming from somewhere else
 

5599
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,629
coming from somewhere else
when you spend

5600
01:51:16,629 --> 01:51:16,639
when you spend
 

5601
01:51:16,639 --> 01:51:20,030
when you spend
an extended period of time paying close

5602
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:20,040
an extended period of time paying close
 

5603
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,470
an extended period of time paying close
attention to your moment-to-moment

5604
01:51:21,470 --> 01:51:21,480
attention to your moment-to-moment
 

5605
01:51:21,480 --> 01:51:23,870
attention to your moment-to-moment
experience that's how all of your

5606
01:51:23,870 --> 01:51:23,880
experience that's how all of your
 

5607
01:51:23,880 --> 01:51:24,890
experience that's how all of your
thoughts

5608
01:51:24,890 --> 01:51:24,900
thoughts
 

5609
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:27,050
thoughts
appear to you

5610
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:27,060
appear to you
 

5611
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:30,649
appear to you
and it's really beautiful because you're

5612
01:51:30,649 --> 01:51:30,659
and it's really beautiful because you're
 

5613
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:33,229
and it's really beautiful because you're
letting go just through the practice of

5614
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:33,239
letting go just through the practice of
 

5615
01:51:33,239 --> 01:51:35,270
letting go just through the practice of
meditation meditation you're quieting

5616
01:51:35,270 --> 01:51:35,280
meditation meditation you're quieting
 

5617
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:37,250
meditation meditation you're quieting
down your

5618
01:51:37,250 --> 01:51:37,260
down your
 

5619
01:51:37,260 --> 01:51:40,729
down your
um default mode Network and without

5620
01:51:40,729 --> 01:51:40,739
um default mode Network and without
 

5621
01:51:40,739 --> 01:51:43,370
um default mode Network and without
necessarily

5622
01:51:43,370 --> 01:51:43,380
necessarily
 

5623
01:51:43,380 --> 01:51:45,770
necessarily
um intellectually thinking yourself out

5624
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:45,780
um intellectually thinking yourself out
 

5625
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:48,350
um intellectually thinking yourself out
of free will it it naturally kind of

5626
01:51:48,350 --> 01:51:48,360
of free will it it naturally kind of
 

5627
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:50,750
of free will it it naturally kind of
drops away and so

5628
01:51:50,750 --> 01:51:50,760
drops away and so
 

5629
01:51:50,760 --> 01:51:53,030
drops away and so
when you're under the spell of this

5630
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:53,040
when you're under the spell of this
 

5631
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:55,070
when you're under the spell of this
illusion that you are the author of your

5632
01:51:55,070 --> 01:51:55,080
illusion that you are the author of your
 

5633
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:57,350
illusion that you are the author of your
thoughts and your conscious experience

5634
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:57,360
thoughts and your conscious experience
 

5635
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,090
thoughts and your conscious experience
is driving all of your behavior and

5636
01:51:59,090 --> 01:51:59,100
is driving all of your behavior and
 

5637
01:51:59,100 --> 01:52:01,370
is driving all of your behavior and
there's this eye that stands

5638
01:52:01,370 --> 01:52:01,380
there's this eye that stands
 

5639
01:52:01,380 --> 01:52:04,609
there's this eye that stands
somewhere near your brain but is not

5640
01:52:04,609 --> 01:52:04,619
somewhere near your brain but is not
 

5641
01:52:04,619 --> 01:52:06,770
somewhere near your brain but is not
your brain that stands free of the

5642
01:52:06,770 --> 01:52:06,780
your brain that stands free of the
 

5643
01:52:06,780 --> 01:52:08,450
your brain that stands free of the
physical world is is the thing

5644
01:52:08,450 --> 01:52:08,460
physical world is is the thing
 

5645
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,850
physical world is is the thing
generating the thoughts

5646
01:52:10,850 --> 01:52:10,860
generating the thoughts
 

5647
01:52:10,860 --> 01:52:12,229
generating the thoughts
um

5648
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239
um
 

5649
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:14,709
um
when you're meditating

5650
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
when you're meditating
 

5651
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,930
when you're meditating
that quiets down and can kind of quiet

5652
01:52:17,930 --> 01:52:17,940
that quiets down and can kind of quiet
 

5653
01:52:17,940 --> 01:52:20,149
that quiets down and can kind of quiet
down completely so that your experience

5654
01:52:20,149 --> 01:52:20,159
down completely so that your experience
 

5655
01:52:20,159 --> 01:52:23,510
down completely so that your experience
is just of the next thing arising in

5656
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:23,520
is just of the next thing arising in
 

5657
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,790
is just of the next thing arising in
your conscious awareness but it's the

5658
01:52:25,790 --> 01:52:25,800
your conscious awareness but it's the
 

5659
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:29,330
your conscious awareness but it's the
source of that is still this brain what

5660
01:52:29,330 --> 01:52:29,340
source of that is still this brain what
 

5661
01:52:29,340 --> 01:52:31,490
source of that is still this brain what
you realize is the source of it is not

5662
01:52:31,490 --> 01:52:31,500
you realize is the source of it is not
 

5663
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:34,850
you realize is the source of it is not
your conscious experience and that's the

5664
01:52:34,850 --> 01:52:34,860
your conscious experience and that's the
 

5665
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:37,189
your conscious experience and that's the
important insight

5666
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
important insight
 

5667
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:39,470
important insight
and that's the insight and so there are

5668
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:39,480
and that's the insight and so there are
 

5669
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:40,910
and that's the insight and so there are
many insights you can have in meditation

5670
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:40,920
many insights you can have in meditation
 

5671
01:52:40,920 --> 01:52:42,890
many insights you can have in meditation
that align with the science which is

5672
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:42,900
that align with the science which is
 

5673
01:52:42,900 --> 01:52:44,390
that align with the science which is
what's really fascinating because it

5674
01:52:44,390 --> 01:52:44,400
what's really fascinating because it
 

5675
01:52:44,400 --> 01:52:45,770
what's really fascinating because it
doesn't have to be that way like I can

5676
01:52:45,770 --> 01:52:45,780
doesn't have to be that way like I can
 

5677
01:52:45,780 --> 01:52:47,629
doesn't have to be that way like I can
imagine finding a meditation to be

5678
01:52:47,629 --> 01:52:47,639
imagine finding a meditation to be
 

5679
01:52:47,639 --> 01:52:49,490
imagine finding a meditation to be
extremely useful and helping me with

5680
01:52:49,490 --> 01:52:49,500
extremely useful and helping me with
 

5681
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:51,350
extremely useful and helping me with
anxiety and all the rest and having all

5682
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:51,360
anxiety and all the rest and having all
 

5683
01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:52,850
anxiety and all the rest and having all
kinds of insights that turn out to not

5684
01:52:52,850 --> 01:52:52,860
kinds of insights that turn out to not
 

5685
01:52:52,860 --> 01:52:53,810
kinds of insights that turn out to not
be true

5686
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:53,820
be true
 

5687
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:56,090
be true
but the interesting thing is that these

5688
01:52:56,090 --> 01:52:56,100
but the interesting thing is that these
 

5689
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:58,910
but the interesting thing is that these
insights actually turn out to be true

5690
01:52:58,910 --> 01:52:58,920
insights actually turn out to be true
 

5691
01:52:58,920 --> 01:53:01,189
insights actually turn out to be true
um and so that that is one of them is

5692
01:53:01,189 --> 01:53:01,199
um and so that that is one of them is
 

5693
01:53:01,199 --> 01:53:03,609
um and so that that is one of them is
the

5694
01:53:03,609 --> 01:53:03,619
the
 

5695
01:53:03,619 --> 01:53:06,950
the
when you're just watching what your

5696
01:53:06,950 --> 01:53:06,960
when you're just watching what your
 

5697
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:10,070
when you're just watching what your
conscious experience actually is you

5698
01:53:10,070 --> 01:53:10,080
conscious experience actually is you
 

5699
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:11,990
conscious experience actually is you
realize that it's not doing all the

5700
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:12,000
realize that it's not doing all the
 

5701
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,970
realize that it's not doing all the
things you usually feel like it's doing

5702
01:53:13,970 --> 01:53:13,980
things you usually feel like it's doing
 

5703
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:18,410
things you usually feel like it's doing
and so the thoughts really just arise

5704
01:53:18,410 --> 01:53:18,420
and so the thoughts really just arise
 

5705
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:23,149
and so the thoughts really just arise
in much the same way that a sound or a

5706
01:53:23,149 --> 01:53:23,159
in much the same way that a sound or a
 

5707
01:53:23,159 --> 01:53:25,189
in much the same way that a sound or a
sight or a feeling

5708
01:53:25,189 --> 01:53:25,199
sight or a feeling
 

5709
01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:26,629
sight or a feeling
um you know maybe your leg starts to

5710
01:53:26,629 --> 01:53:26,639
um you know maybe your leg starts to
 

5711
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:28,910
um you know maybe your leg starts to
hurt you when you're just watching

5712
01:53:28,910 --> 01:53:28,920
hurt you when you're just watching
 

5713
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:32,510
hurt you when you're just watching
Moment by Moment by moment pain arises a

5714
01:53:32,510 --> 01:53:32,520
Moment by Moment by moment pain arises a
 

5715
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,370
Moment by Moment by moment pain arises a
bird chirping arises

5716
01:53:34,370 --> 01:53:34,380
bird chirping arises
 

5717
01:53:34,380 --> 01:53:37,370
bird chirping arises
a thought arises a feeling arises

5718
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:37,380
a thought arises a feeling arises
 

5719
01:53:37,380 --> 01:53:40,430
a thought arises a feeling arises
you're just kind of watching watching it

5720
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:40,440
you're just kind of watching watching it
 

5721
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,410
you're just kind of watching watching it
all unfold and there's something really

5722
01:53:42,410 --> 01:53:42,420
all unfold and there's something really
 

5723
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,209
all unfold and there's something really
beautiful about that

5724
01:53:44,209 --> 01:53:44,219
beautiful about that
 

5725
01:53:44,219 --> 01:53:46,370
beautiful about that
yeah it's

5726
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:46,380
yeah it's
 

5727
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:49,250
yeah it's
the the the perspective you could take

5728
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:49,260
the the the perspective you could take
 

5729
01:53:49,260 --> 01:53:51,770
the the the perspective you could take
on is there's a connectedness to the

5730
01:53:51,770 --> 01:53:51,780
on is there's a connectedness to the
 

5731
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:54,530
on is there's a connectedness to the
entirety of the universe like to Nature

5732
01:53:54,530 --> 01:53:54,540
entirety of the universe like to Nature
 

5733
01:53:54,540 --> 01:53:56,209
entirety of the universe like to Nature
in general and that there's something so

5734
01:53:56,209 --> 01:53:56,219
in general and that there's something so
 

5735
01:53:56,219 --> 01:53:58,490
in general and that there's something so
beautiful about Consciousness about the

5736
01:53:58,490 --> 01:53:58,500
beautiful about Consciousness about the
 

5737
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,750
beautiful about Consciousness about the
fact that

5738
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
fact that
 

5739
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:03,290
fact that
it's not just a dead Universe with atoms

5740
01:54:03,290 --> 01:54:03,300
it's not just a dead Universe with atoms
 

5741
01:54:03,300 --> 01:54:05,450
it's not just a dead Universe with atoms
doing their thing that

5742
01:54:05,450 --> 01:54:05,460
doing their thing that
 

5743
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:08,870
doing their thing that
at least in this one instance there is a

5744
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:08,880
at least in this one instance there is a
 

5745
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:12,290
at least in this one instance there is a
felt experience of the universe

5746
01:54:12,290 --> 01:54:12,300
felt experience of the universe
 

5747
01:54:12,300 --> 01:54:14,629
felt experience of the universe
of the University it's not even I'm part

5748
01:54:14,629 --> 01:54:14,639
of the University it's not even I'm part
 

5749
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,390
of the University it's not even I'm part
of the universe yeah I'm there's a right

5750
01:54:17,390 --> 01:54:17,400
of the universe yeah I'm there's a right
 

5751
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:19,250
of the universe yeah I'm there's a right
here in this little point in space and

5752
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:19,260
here in this little point in space and
 

5753
01:54:19,260 --> 01:54:21,169
here in this little point in space and
time there is an experience of the

5754
01:54:21,169 --> 01:54:21,179
time there is an experience of the
 

5755
01:54:21,179 --> 01:54:22,910
time there is an experience of the
universe but it's still interesting to

5756
01:54:22,910 --> 01:54:22,920
universe but it's still interesting to
 

5757
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,729
universe but it's still interesting to
think about where those ideas

5758
01:54:25,729 --> 01:54:25,739
think about where those ideas
 

5759
01:54:25,739 --> 01:54:27,770
think about where those ideas
if those ideas are solely a construction

5760
01:54:27,770 --> 01:54:27,780
if those ideas are solely a construction
 

5761
01:54:27,780 --> 01:54:29,870
if those ideas are solely a construction
of the brain or is there some kind of

5762
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:29,880
of the brain or is there some kind of
 

5763
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,090
of the brain or is there some kind of
mechanism of joint collective

5764
01:54:32,090 --> 01:54:32,100
mechanism of joint collective
 

5765
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:34,250
mechanism of joint collective
intelligence of humans as social

5766
01:54:34,250 --> 01:54:34,260
intelligence of humans as social
 

5767
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:38,030
intelligence of humans as social
organisms where that those like

5768
01:54:38,030 --> 01:54:38,040
organisms where that those like
 

5769
01:54:38,040 --> 01:54:40,910
organisms where that those like
like how much of it is

5770
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:40,920
like how much of it is
 

5771
01:54:40,920 --> 01:54:43,129
like how much of it is
me training when you're on network and

5772
01:54:43,129 --> 01:54:43,139
me training when you're on network and
 

5773
01:54:43,139 --> 01:54:45,050
me training when you're on network and
the ideas of tens of thousands of other

5774
01:54:45,050 --> 01:54:45,060
the ideas of tens of thousands of other
 

5775
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,810
the ideas of tens of thousands of other
people and how much is it myself talking

5776
01:54:47,810 --> 01:54:47,820
people and how much is it myself talking
 

5777
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:49,790
people and how much is it myself talking
like in terms of psychic phenomena and

5778
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:49,800
like in terms of psychic phenomena and
 

5779
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:51,050
like in terms of psychic phenomena and
you're talking in terms of just

5780
01:54:51,050 --> 01:54:51,060
you're talking in terms of just
 

5781
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:54,229
you're talking in terms of just
absorbing the information of the past

5782
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:54,239
absorbing the information of the past
 

5783
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:56,450
absorbing the information of the past
and education and

5784
01:54:56,450 --> 01:54:56,460
and education and
 

5785
01:54:56,460 --> 01:54:58,609
and education and
well um just kind of our Collective

5786
01:54:58,609 --> 01:54:58,619
well um just kind of our Collective
 

5787
01:54:58,619 --> 01:55:00,950
well um just kind of our Collective
human project that gets in throughout

5788
01:55:00,950 --> 01:55:00,960
human project that gets in throughout
 

5789
01:55:00,960 --> 01:55:02,570
human project that gets in throughout
our lives I don't know much about

5790
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:02,580
our lives I don't know much about
 

5791
01:55:02,580 --> 01:55:04,970
our lives I don't know much about
psychic phenomena but I also want to be

5792
01:55:04,970 --> 01:55:04,980
psychic phenomena but I also want to be
 

5793
01:55:04,980 --> 01:55:06,830
psychic phenomena but I also want to be
open-minded in the way we speak about

5794
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:06,840
open-minded in the way we speak about
 

5795
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:08,209
open-minded in the way we speak about
collective intelligence because it's

5796
01:55:08,209 --> 01:55:08,219
collective intelligence because it's
 

5797
01:55:08,219 --> 01:55:10,729
collective intelligence because it's
very easy to simplify to it's a neural

5798
01:55:10,729 --> 01:55:10,739
very easy to simplify to it's a neural
 

5799
01:55:10,739 --> 01:55:13,850
very easy to simplify to it's a neural
network trained on knowledge developed

5800
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:13,860
network trained on knowledge developed
 

5801
01:55:13,860 --> 01:55:17,209
network trained on knowledge developed
over generations and so on it it does

5802
01:55:17,209 --> 01:55:17,219
over generations and so on it it does
 

5803
01:55:17,219 --> 01:55:18,709
over generations and so on it it does
feel

5804
01:55:18,709 --> 01:55:18,719
feel
 

5805
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:21,229
feel
like intelligence is stored in some kind

5806
01:55:21,229 --> 01:55:21,239
like intelligence is stored in some kind
 

5807
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:23,030
like intelligence is stored in some kind
of distributed fashion

5808
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:23,040
of distributed fashion
 

5809
01:55:23,040 --> 01:55:27,229
of distributed fashion
across humans like if you take one out

5810
01:55:27,229 --> 01:55:27,239
across humans like if you take one out
 

5811
01:55:27,239 --> 01:55:29,930
across humans like if you take one out
I I think that intelligence quickly goes

5812
01:55:29,930 --> 01:55:29,940
I I think that intelligence quickly goes
 

5813
01:55:29,940 --> 01:55:30,649
I I think that intelligence quickly goes
down

5814
01:55:30,649 --> 01:55:30,659
down
 

5815
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:32,209
down
I don't know how quickly it goes down if

5816
01:55:32,209 --> 01:55:32,219
I don't know how quickly it goes down if
 

5817
01:55:32,219 --> 01:55:33,709
I don't know how quickly it goes down if
you just take one out and depends on

5818
01:55:33,709 --> 01:55:33,719
you just take one out and depends on
 

5819
01:55:33,719 --> 01:55:36,649
you just take one out and depends on
which one I think I half agree and half

5820
01:55:36,649 --> 01:55:36,659
which one I think I half agree and half
 

5821
01:55:36,659 --> 01:55:38,450
which one I think I half agree and half
disagree with what you're saying but

5822
01:55:38,450 --> 01:55:38,460
disagree with what you're saying but
 

5823
01:55:38,460 --> 01:55:41,090
disagree with what you're saying but
yeah I mean the other thing you notice

5824
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:41,100
yeah I mean the other thing you notice
 

5825
01:55:41,100 --> 01:55:43,010
yeah I mean the other thing you notice
when you spend a lot of time in

5826
01:55:43,010 --> 01:55:43,020
when you spend a lot of time in
 

5827
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:44,629
when you spend a lot of time in
meditation and when you spend a lot of

5828
01:55:44,629 --> 01:55:44,639
meditation and when you spend a lot of
 

5829
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:46,189
meditation and when you spend a lot of
time kind of shaking up the these

5830
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:46,199
time kind of shaking up the these
 

5831
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:47,750
time kind of shaking up the these
intuitions that I think get in the way

5832
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:47,760
intuitions that I think get in the way
 

5833
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,430
intuitions that I think get in the way
of of clearly

5834
01:55:49,430 --> 01:55:49,440
of of clearly
 

5835
01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:51,410
of of clearly
okay

5836
01:55:51,410 --> 01:55:51,420
okay
 

5837
01:55:51,420 --> 01:55:54,649
okay
thinking about what Consciousness is

5838
01:55:54,649 --> 01:55:54,659
thinking about what Consciousness is
 

5839
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:55,490
thinking about what Consciousness is
um

5840
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:55,500
um
 

5841
01:55:55,500 --> 01:55:58,729
um
is that we are these systems in nature

5842
01:55:58,729 --> 01:55:58,739
is that we are these systems in nature
 

5843
01:55:58,739 --> 01:56:01,550
is that we are these systems in nature
that are not at all isolated and there

5844
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:01,560
that are not at all isolated and there
 

5845
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,530
that are not at all isolated and there
are the obvious ways like if I just stop

5846
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:03,540
are the obvious ways like if I just stop
 

5847
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:06,770
are the obvious ways like if I just stop
drinking water you know that's going to

5848
01:56:06,770 --> 01:56:06,780
drinking water you know that's going to
 

5849
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:09,410
drinking water you know that's going to
change the system very drastically right

5850
01:56:09,410 --> 01:56:09,420
change the system very drastically right
 

5851
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:11,209
change the system very drastically right
so there's just you know the the energy

5852
01:56:11,209 --> 01:56:11,219
so there's just you know the the energy
 

5853
01:56:11,219 --> 01:56:14,510
so there's just you know the the energy
consumption but the fact that we

5854
01:56:14,510 --> 01:56:14,520
consumption but the fact that we
 

5855
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:18,350
consumption but the fact that we
exchange ideas is

5856
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:18,360
exchange ideas is
 

5857
01:56:18,360 --> 01:56:22,010
exchange ideas is
um we part of who I am is everyone I've

5858
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:22,020
um we part of who I am is everyone I've
 

5859
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:23,510
um we part of who I am is everyone I've
interacted with and of course the people

5860
01:56:23,510 --> 01:56:23,520
interacted with and of course the people
 

5861
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:25,970
interacted with and of course the people
that interact more with have sculpted me

5862
01:56:25,970 --> 01:56:25,980
that interact more with have sculpted me
 

5863
01:56:25,980 --> 01:56:28,550
that interact more with have sculpted me
more but we our brains are sculpted

5864
01:56:28,550 --> 01:56:28,560
more but we our brains are sculpted
 

5865
01:56:28,560 --> 01:56:30,830
more but we our brains are sculpted
through our interactions with each other

5866
01:56:30,830 --> 01:56:30,840
through our interactions with each other
 

5867
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:31,910
through our interactions with each other
as well

5868
01:56:31,910 --> 01:56:31,920
as well
 

5869
01:56:31,920 --> 01:56:35,810
as well
yes but I wonder if it's a more correct

5870
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:35,820
yes but I wonder if it's a more correct
 

5871
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:38,090
yes but I wonder if it's a more correct
and useful perspective to take

5872
01:56:38,090 --> 01:56:38,100
and useful perspective to take
 

5873
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:40,609
and useful perspective to take
that those interactions are the

5874
01:56:40,609 --> 01:56:40,619
that those interactions are the
 

5875
01:56:40,619 --> 01:56:43,490
that those interactions are the
organisms

5876
01:56:43,490 --> 01:56:43,500

 

5877
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:45,890

like you're you're saying you're still

5878
01:56:45,890 --> 01:56:45,900
like you're you're saying you're still
 

5879
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,990
like you're you're saying you're still
making the brain the primary

5880
01:56:47,990 --> 01:56:48,000
making the brain the primary
 

5881
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,930
making the brain the primary
there could be like

5882
01:56:50,930 --> 01:56:50,940
there could be like
 

5883
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:55,010
there could be like
uh that the brain is what it is because

5884
01:56:55,010 --> 01:56:55,020
uh that the brain is what it is because
 

5885
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:58,669
uh that the brain is what it is because
of the social interactions and the

5886
01:56:58,669 --> 01:56:58,679
of the social interactions and the
 

5887
01:56:58,679 --> 01:57:00,229
of the social interactions and the
social interactions are the living

5888
01:57:00,229 --> 01:57:00,239
social interactions are the living
 

5889
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:05,030
social interactions are the living
organism like that's a weird perspective

5890
01:57:05,030 --> 01:57:05,040
organism like that's a weird perspective
 

5891
01:57:05,040 --> 01:57:06,410
organism like that's a weird perspective
because it's I don't I don't actually

5892
01:57:06,410 --> 01:57:06,420
because it's I don't I don't actually
 

5893
01:57:06,420 --> 01:57:08,750
because it's I don't I don't actually
think it's one or the other

5894
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:08,760
think it's one or the other
 

5895
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:10,370
think it's one or the other
they're both yeah they're both both

5896
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:10,380
they're both yeah they're both both
 

5897
01:57:10,380 --> 01:57:14,450
they're both yeah they're both both
living yeah it's like cats and dogs

5898
01:57:14,450 --> 01:57:14,460
living yeah it's like cats and dogs
 

5899
01:57:14,460 --> 01:57:16,430
living yeah it's like cats and dogs
yeah I mean it's a little bit like you

5900
01:57:16,430 --> 01:57:16,440
yeah I mean it's a little bit like you
 

5901
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:18,530
yeah I mean it's a little bit like you
know I I have two children and a lot of

5902
01:57:18,530 --> 01:57:18,540
know I I have two children and a lot of
 

5903
01:57:18,540 --> 01:57:20,330
know I I have two children and a lot of
people with two children will say like

5904
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:20,340
people with two children will say like
 

5905
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,370
people with two children will say like
when when you're preparing to have the

5906
01:57:22,370 --> 01:57:22,380
when when you're preparing to have the
 

5907
01:57:22,380 --> 01:57:24,410
when when you're preparing to have the
second one and soon after you've had the

5908
01:57:24,410 --> 01:57:24,420
second one and soon after you've had the
 

5909
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:27,350
second one and soon after you've had the
second one that having two is kind of

5910
01:57:27,350 --> 01:57:27,360
second one that having two is kind of
 

5911
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:31,430
second one that having two is kind of
like having three because you are

5912
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:31,440
like having three because you are
 

5913
01:57:31,440 --> 01:57:34,010

overseeing each individual life but then
 

5917
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:39,770
overseeing each individual life but then
there's the sibling relationship which

5918
01:57:39,770 --> 01:57:39,780
there's the sibling relationship which
 

5919
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:41,689
there's the sibling relationship which
is almost another

5920
01:57:41,689 --> 01:57:41,699
is almost another

to discuss ideas I would love to be a
 

5945
01:58:07,500 --> 01:58:09,470
to discuss ideas I would love to be a
fly in the wall of those discussions but

5946
01:58:09,470 --> 01:58:09,480
fly in the wall of those discussions but
 

5947
01:58:09,480 --> 01:58:11,510
fly in the wall of those discussions but
he wrote a book case against reality

5948
01:58:11,510 --> 01:58:11,520
he wrote a book case against reality
 

5949
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:14,450
he wrote a book case against reality
yeah makes the case that our perception

5950
01:58:14,450 --> 01:58:14,460
yeah makes the case that our perception
 

5951
01:58:14,460 --> 01:58:17,149
yeah makes the case that our perception
is completely detached from objective

5952
01:58:17,149 --> 01:58:17,159
is completely detached from objective
 

5953
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:18,470
is completely detached from objective
reality

5954
01:58:18,470 --> 01:58:18,480
reality
 

5955
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:22,910
reality
can you explain his perspective and let

5956
01:58:22,910 --> 01:58:22,920
can you explain his perspective and let
 

5957
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:25,550
can you explain his perspective and let
us know well no no maybe not fully but

5958
01:58:25,550 --> 01:58:25,560
us know well no no maybe not fully but
 

5959
01:58:25,560 --> 01:58:27,709
us know well no no maybe not fully but
to which degree you

5960
01:58:27,709 --> 01:58:27,719
to which degree you
 

5961
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,709
to which degree you
agree and don't so this is much more

5962
01:58:30,709 --> 01:58:30,719
agree and don't so this is much more
 

5963
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:32,990
agree and don't so this is much more
focused I guess you guys have an

5964
01:58:32,990 --> 01:58:33,000
focused I guess you guys have an
 

5965
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,970
focused I guess you guys have an
agreement that Consciousness is somehow

5966
01:58:34,970 --> 01:58:34,980
agreement that Consciousness is somehow
 

5967
01:58:34,980 --> 01:58:37,790
agreement that Consciousness is somehow
fundamental yeah I mean I think we both

5968
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:37,800
fundamental yeah I mean I think we both
 

5969
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:40,430
fundamental yeah I mean I think we both
think we might be wrong

5970
01:58:40,430 --> 01:58:40,440
think we might be wrong
 

5971
01:58:40,440 --> 01:58:42,050
think we might be wrong
um about the Consciousness they're about

5972
01:58:42,050 --> 01:58:42,060
um about the Consciousness they're about
 

5973
01:58:42,060 --> 01:58:44,089
um about the Consciousness they're about
about it being fundamental but I think

5974
01:58:44,089 --> 01:58:44,099
about it being fundamental but I think
 

5975
01:58:44,099 --> 01:58:47,270
about it being fundamental but I think
we're both just we both agree that this

5976
01:58:47,270 --> 01:58:47,280
we're both just we both agree that this
 

5977
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,370
we're both just we both agree that this
is a legitimate

5978
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:49,380
is a legitimate
 

5979
01:58:49,380 --> 01:58:51,589
is a legitimate
um question to ask at this point in

5980
01:58:51,589 --> 01:58:51,599
um question to ask at this point in
 

5981
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:53,810
um question to ask at this point in
science is consciousness fundamental and

5982
01:58:53,810 --> 01:58:53,820
science is consciousness fundamental and
 

5983
01:58:53,820 --> 01:58:56,089
science is consciousness fundamental and
I really see it as a question and I

5984
01:58:56,089 --> 01:58:56,099
I really see it as a question and I
 

5985
01:58:56,099 --> 01:58:58,729
I really see it as a question and I
think he does too but he goes hard on

5986
01:58:58,729 --> 01:58:58,739
think he does too but he goes hard on
 

5987
01:58:58,739 --> 01:59:01,450
think he does too but he goes hard on
reality yes

5988
01:59:01,450 --> 01:59:01,460
reality yes
 

5989
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:03,470
reality yes
I you know

5990
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:03,480
I you know
 

5991
01:59:03,480 --> 01:59:05,030
I you know
especially so I actually now have

5992
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,040
especially so I actually now have
 

5993
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:06,890
especially so I actually now have
recorded three conversations with him

5994
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:06,900
recorded three conversations with him
 

5995
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:11,450
recorded three conversations with him
for this project I'm working on yeah and

5996
01:59:11,450 --> 01:59:11,460
for this project I'm working on yeah and
 

5997
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:13,609
for this project I'm working on yeah and
in every conversation we have we seem to

5998
01:59:13,609 --> 01:59:13,619
in every conversation we have we seem to
 

5999
01:59:13,619 --> 01:59:15,050
in every conversation we have we seem to
land on the same place but this last

6000
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:15,060
land on the same place but this last
 

6001
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:17,450
land on the same place but this last
conversation we had it seemed to be even

6002
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:17,460
conversation we had it seemed to be even
 

6003
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:19,310
conversation we had it seemed to be even
more clear that

6004
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:19,320
more clear that
 

6005
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,649
more clear that
the semantics really get in the way when

6006
01:59:21,649 --> 01:59:21,659
the semantics really get in the way when
 

6007
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:23,689
the semantics really get in the way when
you get into the weeds in these

6008
01:59:23,689 --> 01:59:23,699
you get into the weeds in these
 

6009
01:59:23,699 --> 01:59:25,129
you get into the weeds in these
conversations

6010
01:59:25,129 --> 01:59:25,139
conversations
 

6011
01:59:25,139 --> 01:59:28,189
conversations
we it's almost like we need some new

6012
01:59:28,189 --> 01:59:28,199
we it's almost like we need some new
 

6013
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:31,669
we it's almost like we need some new
terminology because it's hard to know

6014
01:59:31,669 --> 01:59:31,679
terminology because it's hard to know
 

6015
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:33,410
terminology because it's hard to know
sometimes whether we're talking about

6016
01:59:33,410 --> 01:59:33,420
sometimes whether we're talking about
 

6017
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:35,510
sometimes whether we're talking about
the same thing

6018
01:59:35,510 --> 01:59:35,520
the same thing
 

6019
01:59:35,520 --> 01:59:38,589
the same thing
um I have issues with his terminology

6020
01:59:38,589 --> 01:59:38,599
um I have issues with his terminology
 

6021
01:59:38,599 --> 01:59:43,310
um I have issues with his terminology
that when we talk about what his

6022
01:59:43,310 --> 01:59:43,320
that when we talk about what his
 

6023
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,589
that when we talk about what his
terminology represents it seems like we

6024
01:59:45,589 --> 01:59:45,599
terminology represents it seems like we
 

6025
01:59:45,599 --> 01:59:48,709
terminology represents it seems like we
completely agree but the conclusions you

6026
01:59:48,709 --> 01:59:48,719
completely agree but the conclusions you
 

6027
01:59:48,719 --> 01:59:49,609
completely agree but the conclusions you
don't

6028
01:59:49,609 --> 01:59:49,619
don't
 

6029
01:59:49,619 --> 01:59:52,790
don't
it's possible we have a very similar

6030
01:59:52,790 --> 01:59:52,800
it's possible we have a very similar
 

6031
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,669
it's possible we have a very similar
view of the universe if Consciousness is

6032
01:59:55,669 --> 01:59:55,679
view of the universe if Consciousness is
 

6033
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:57,830
view of the universe if Consciousness is
fundamental it may be an identical view

6034
01:59:57,830 --> 01:59:57,840
fundamental it may be an identical view
 

6035
01:59:57,840 --> 02:00:00,589
fundamental it may be an identical view
it's hard for me to know because I

6036
02:00:00,589 --> 02:00:00,599
it's hard for me to know because I
 

6037
02:00:00,599 --> 02:00:02,270
it's hard for me to know because I
disagree with a lot of his terminology

6038
02:00:02,270 --> 02:00:02,280
disagree with a lot of his terminology
 

6039
02:00:02,280 --> 02:00:05,510
disagree with a lot of his terminology
okay but our four-dimension reality he

6040
02:00:05,510 --> 02:00:05,520
okay but our four-dimension reality he
 

6041
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,609
okay but our four-dimension reality he
says that's like a complete

6042
02:00:07,609 --> 02:00:07,619
says that's like a complete
 

6043
02:00:07,619 --> 02:00:10,550
says that's like a complete
construct space time is a complete weird

6044
02:00:10,550 --> 02:00:10,560
construct space time is a complete weird
 

6045
02:00:10,560 --> 02:00:13,609
construct space time is a complete weird
construction that yeah well I mean the

6046
02:00:13,609 --> 02:00:13,619
construction that yeah well I mean the
 

6047
02:00:13,619 --> 02:00:16,010
construction that yeah well I mean the
truth is that I mean if you talk to a

6048
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:16,020
truth is that I mean if you talk to a
 

6049
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:18,770
truth is that I mean if you talk to a
neuroscientist like Anil Seth and I

6050
02:00:18,770 --> 02:00:18,780
neuroscientist like Anil Seth and I
 

6051
02:00:18,780 --> 02:00:20,330
neuroscientist like Anil Seth and I
would say most neuroscientists but he's

6052
02:00:20,330 --> 02:00:20,340
would say most neuroscientists but he's
 

6053
02:00:20,340 --> 02:00:22,310
would say most neuroscientists but he's
he's really good on this subject and and

6054
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:22,320
he's really good on this subject and and
 

6055
02:00:22,320 --> 02:00:23,470
he's really good on this subject and and
his

6056
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:23,480
his
 

6057
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:25,970
his
expertise and his area of focus is in

6058
02:00:25,970 --> 02:00:25,980
expertise and his area of focus is in
 

6059
02:00:25,980 --> 02:00:28,970
expertise and his area of focus is in
perception so he talks a lot about how

6060
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:28,980
perception so he talks a lot about how
 

6061
02:00:28,980 --> 02:00:31,370
perception so he talks a lot about how
our perceptions give us an experience of

6062
02:00:31,370 --> 02:00:31,380
our perceptions give us an experience of
 

6063
02:00:31,380 --> 02:00:33,649
our perceptions give us an experience of
the world and he calls it a controlled

6064
02:00:33,649 --> 02:00:33,659
the world and he calls it a controlled
 

6065
02:00:33,659 --> 02:00:36,050
the world and he calls it a controlled
hallucination

6066
02:00:36,050 --> 02:00:36,060
hallucination
 

6067
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:37,729
hallucination
um I'm sorry he probably got I think he

6068
02:00:37,729 --> 02:00:37,739
um I'm sorry he probably got I think he
 

6069
02:00:37,739 --> 02:00:39,589
um I'm sorry he probably got I think he
says that he got that term from someone

6070
02:00:39,589 --> 02:00:39,599
says that he got that term from someone
 

6071
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:41,089
says that he got that term from someone
else but that that's the that's the term

6072
02:00:41,089 --> 02:00:41,099
else but that that's the that's the term
 

6073
02:00:41,099 --> 02:00:43,609
else but that that's the that's the term
he used we got every term from somewhere

6074
02:00:43,609 --> 02:00:43,619
he used we got every term from somewhere
 

6075
02:00:43,619 --> 02:00:45,350
he used we got every term from somewhere
right that's true everything there's no

6076
02:00:45,350 --> 02:00:45,360
right that's true everything there's no
 

6077
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,850
right that's true everything there's no
new ideas all right

6078
02:00:46,850 --> 02:00:46,860
new ideas all right
 

6079
02:00:46,860 --> 02:00:49,669
new ideas all right
there's a sense in which what Hoffman is

6080
02:00:49,669 --> 02:00:49,679
there's a sense in which what Hoffman is
 

6081
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,189
there's a sense in which what Hoffman is
saying is already we already know to be

6082
02:00:52,189 --> 02:00:52,199
saying is already we already know to be
 

6083
02:00:52,199 --> 02:00:55,250
saying is already we already know to be
the case so our brains are creating this

6084
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:55,260
the case so our brains are creating this
 

6085
02:00:55,260 --> 02:00:57,169
the case so our brains are creating this
conscious experience

6086
02:00:57,169 --> 02:00:57,179
conscious experience
 

6087
02:00:57,179 --> 02:00:59,990
conscious experience
um based on these interactions with the

6088
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,000
um based on these interactions with the
 

6089
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,229
um based on these interactions with the
outside world it is in some sense all a

6090
02:01:03,229 --> 02:01:03,239
outside world it is in some sense all a
 

6091
02:01:03,239 --> 02:01:05,570
outside world it is in some sense all a
controlled hallucination

6092
02:01:05,570 --> 02:01:05,580
controlled hallucination
 

6093
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:07,729
controlled hallucination
and someone like Anil Sessa from the

6094
02:01:07,729 --> 02:01:07,739
and someone like Anil Sessa from the
 

6095
02:01:07,739 --> 02:01:09,530
and someone like Anil Sessa from the
neuroscientific point of view I actually

6096
02:01:09,530 --> 02:01:09,540
neuroscientific point of view I actually
 

6097
02:01:09,540 --> 02:01:11,390
neuroscientific point of view I actually
have a quote here somewhere if you if

6098
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:11,400
have a quote here somewhere if you if
 

6099
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:12,890
have a quote here somewhere if you if
you have any interest in hearing the

6100
02:01:12,890 --> 02:01:12,900
you have any interest in hearing the
 

6101
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:13,850
you have any interest in hearing the
quote

6102
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:13,860
quote
 

6103
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:16,189
quote
um but he's essentially saying

6104
02:01:16,189 --> 02:01:16,199
um but he's essentially saying
 

6105
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:19,870
um but he's essentially saying
everything we experience as a perception

6106
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:19,880
everything we experience as a perception
 

6107
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:23,030
everything we experience as a perception
including our experience of time and

6108
02:01:23,030 --> 02:01:23,040
including our experience of time and
 

6109
02:01:23,040 --> 02:01:27,350
including our experience of time and
space so we still don't really know what

6110
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360
space so we still don't really know what
 

6111
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:31,010
space so we still don't really know what
our experience of space represents out

6112
02:01:31,010 --> 02:01:31,020
our experience of space represents out
 

6113
02:01:31,020 --> 02:01:33,050
our experience of space represents out
there in the world and then of course

6114
02:01:33,050 --> 02:01:33,060
there in the world and then of course
 

6115
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:34,729
there in the world and then of course
when you talk to physicists about the

6116
02:01:34,729 --> 02:01:34,739
when you talk to physicists about the
 

6117
02:01:34,739 --> 02:01:36,050
when you talk to physicists about the
different interpretations of quantum

6118
02:01:36,050 --> 02:01:36,060
different interpretations of quantum
 

6119
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,970
different interpretations of quantum
mechanics I mean where physics is is

6120
02:01:37,970 --> 02:01:37,980
mechanics I mean where physics is is
 

6121
02:01:37,980 --> 02:01:40,850
mechanics I mean where physics is is
seems to be headed across the board at

6122
02:01:40,850 --> 02:01:40,860
seems to be headed across the board at
 

6123
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:43,189
seems to be headed across the board at
this point is that space and time are

6124
02:01:43,189 --> 02:01:43,199
this point is that space and time are
 

6125
02:01:43,199 --> 02:01:46,250
this point is that space and time are
emergent that they're not part of the

6126
02:01:46,250 --> 02:01:46,260
emergent that they're not part of the
 

6127
02:01:46,260 --> 02:01:50,330
emergent that they're not part of the
fundamental fabric of reality and so

6128
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:50,340
fundamental fabric of reality and so
 

6129
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:52,910
fundamental fabric of reality and so
there are some ways in which

6130
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:52,920
there are some ways in which
 

6131
02:01:52,920 --> 02:01:56,570
there are some ways in which
Dawn is saying things that is he being

6132
02:01:56,570 --> 02:01:56,580
Dawn is saying things that is he being
 

6133
02:01:56,580 --> 02:01:59,089
Dawn is saying things that is he being
too poetic about it is that is that the

6134
02:01:59,089 --> 02:01:59,099
too poetic about it is that is that the
 

6135
02:01:59,099 --> 02:02:01,070
too poetic about it is that is that the
right way to to phrase it because like

6136
02:02:01,070 --> 02:02:01,080
right way to to phrase it because like
 

6137
02:02:01,080 --> 02:02:04,070
right way to to phrase it because like
no go ahead he says like

6138
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,080
no go ahead he says like
 

6139
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:06,530
no go ahead he says like
it's not that our perception is a con

6140
02:02:06,530 --> 02:02:06,540
it's not that our perception is a con
 

6141
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:09,770
it's not that our perception is a con
just a controlled hallucination well no

6142
02:02:09,770 --> 02:02:09,780
just a controlled hallucination well no
 

6143
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:11,209
just a controlled hallucination well no
it's not he's saying something more than

6144
02:02:11,209 --> 02:02:11,219
it's not he's saying something more than
 

6145
02:02:11,219 --> 02:02:14,689
it's not he's saying something more than
that I mean it but my point is that a

6146
02:02:14,689 --> 02:02:14,699
that I mean it but my point is that a
 

6147
02:02:14,699 --> 02:02:16,370
that I mean it but my point is that a
lot of what he's already saying on some

6148
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:16,380
lot of what he's already saying on some
 

6149
02:02:16,380 --> 02:02:17,750
lot of what he's already saying on some
level we kind of science is already

6150
02:02:17,750 --> 02:02:17,760
level we kind of science is already
 

6151
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:22,189
level we kind of science is already
there and could agree with yeah but not

6152
02:02:22,189 --> 02:02:22,199
there and could agree with yeah but not
 

6153
02:02:22,199 --> 02:02:24,649
there and could agree with yeah but not
all the way yeah because he's saying

6154
02:02:24,649 --> 02:02:24,659
all the way yeah because he's saying
 

6155
02:02:24,659 --> 02:02:29,390
all the way yeah because he's saying
like well that we don't even we've like

6156
02:02:29,390 --> 02:02:29,400
like well that we don't even we've like
 

6157
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:33,229
like well that we don't even we've like
The evolutionary process yeah has

6158
02:02:33,229 --> 02:02:33,239
The evolutionary process yeah has
 

6159
02:02:33,239 --> 02:02:35,450
The evolutionary process yeah has
constructed our brain mechanisms in such

6160
02:02:35,450 --> 02:02:35,460
constructed our brain mechanisms in such
 

6161
02:02:35,460 --> 02:02:37,970
constructed our brain mechanisms in such
a way that we're really far from having

6162
02:02:37,970 --> 02:02:37,980
a way that we're really far from having
 

6163
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:39,430
a way that we're really far from having
access to

6164
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
access to
 

6165
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:41,870
access to
objective reality although I think we

6166
02:02:41,870 --> 02:02:41,880
objective reality although I think we
 

6167
02:02:41,880 --> 02:02:44,149
objective reality although I think we
already know that as well I mean if any

6168
02:02:44,149 --> 02:02:44,159
already know that as well I mean if any
 

6169
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,550
already know that as well I mean if any
version of string theory is correct and

6170
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
version of string theory is correct and
 

6171
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,750
version of string theory is correct and
you know of course we don't know yet

6172
02:02:47,750 --> 02:02:47,760
you know of course we don't know yet
 

6173
02:02:47,760 --> 02:02:49,430
you know of course we don't know yet
it's all up for grabs but the truth is

6174
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,440
it's all up for grabs but the truth is
 

6175
02:02:49,440 --> 02:02:51,470
it's all up for grabs but the truth is
each theory is more weirder than the

6176
02:02:51,470 --> 02:02:51,480
each theory is more weirder than the
 

6177
02:02:51,480 --> 02:02:52,970
each theory is more weirder than the
last

6178
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:52,980
last
 

6179
02:02:52,980 --> 02:02:53,629
last
um

6180
02:02:53,629 --> 02:02:53,639
um
 

6181
02:02:53,639 --> 02:02:57,770
um
if there are 15 dimensions of space we

6182
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:57,780
if there are 15 dimensions of space we
 

6183
02:02:57,780 --> 02:02:59,810
if there are 15 dimensions of space we
are just not

6184
02:02:59,810 --> 02:02:59,820
are just not
 

6185
02:02:59,820 --> 02:03:03,649
are just not
we're not wired but to be able to

6186
02:03:03,649 --> 02:03:03,659
we're not wired but to be able to
 

6187
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:06,169
we're not wired but to be able to
understand the fundamental reality right

6188
02:03:06,169 --> 02:03:06,179
understand the fundamental reality right
 

6189
02:03:06,179 --> 02:03:09,530
understand the fundamental reality right
but but I think we have a consistent

6190
02:03:09,530 --> 02:03:09,540
but but I think we have a consistent
 

6191
02:03:09,540 --> 02:03:12,830
but but I think we have a consistent
abstraction that seems to be reliable

6192
02:03:12,830 --> 02:03:12,840
abstraction that seems to be reliable
 

6193
02:03:12,840 --> 02:03:15,830
abstraction that seems to be reliable
yeah like uh like a blockchain yes and

6194
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:15,840
yeah like uh like a blockchain yes and
 

6195
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:17,629
yeah like uh like a blockchain yes and
he's not just saying that we really only

6196
02:03:17,629 --> 02:03:17,639
he's not just saying that we really only
 

6197
02:03:17,639 --> 02:03:19,910
he's not just saying that we really only
have this tiny window onto reality he's

6198
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
have this tiny window onto reality he's
 

6199
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:22,669
have this tiny window onto reality he's
saying that that window onto reality is

6200
02:03:22,669 --> 02:03:22,679
saying that that window onto reality is
 

6201
02:03:22,679 --> 02:03:24,229
saying that that window onto reality is
giving us a lot of false information

6202
02:03:24,229 --> 02:03:24,239
giving us a lot of false information
 

6203
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:27,410
giving us a lot of false information
it's not just an abstraction it's false

6204
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:27,420
it's not just an abstraction it's false
 

6205
02:03:27,420 --> 02:03:29,390
it's not just an abstraction it's false
yeah because he's saying there's no

6206
02:03:29,390 --> 02:03:29,400
yeah because he's saying there's no
 

6207
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,250
yeah because he's saying there's no
reason it needs to be true

6208
02:03:31,250 --> 02:03:31,260
reason it needs to be true
 

6209
02:03:31,260 --> 02:03:33,229
reason it needs to be true
like there's no

6210
02:03:33,229 --> 02:03:33,239
like there's no
 

6211
02:03:33,239 --> 02:03:36,890
like there's no
uh it does it's not required to be true

6212
02:03:36,890 --> 02:03:36,900
uh it does it's not required to be true
 

6213
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:40,010
uh it does it's not required to be true
yeah and in fact there's through natural

6214
02:03:40,010 --> 02:03:40,020
yeah and in fact there's through natural
 

6215
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:43,070
yeah and in fact there's through natural
selection it's very possible to uh

6216
02:03:43,070 --> 02:03:43,080
selection it's very possible to uh
 

6217
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,050
selection it's very possible to uh
imagine or it's likely to imagine that

6218
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:45,060
imagine or it's likely to imagine that
 

6219
02:03:45,060 --> 02:03:47,470
imagine or it's likely to imagine that
organisms will evolve in such a way that

6220
02:03:47,470 --> 02:03:47,480
organisms will evolve in such a way that
 

6221
02:03:47,480 --> 02:03:51,169
organisms will evolve in such a way that
you're going to just be lying to

6222
02:03:51,169 --> 02:03:51,179
you're going to just be lying to
 

6223
02:03:51,179 --> 02:03:53,930
you're going to just be lying to
yourself completely and but the question

6224
02:03:53,930 --> 02:03:53,940
yourself completely and but the question
 

6225
02:03:53,940 --> 02:03:55,550
yourself completely and but the question
there is if that's the case it's a

6226
02:03:55,550 --> 02:03:55,560
there is if that's the case it's a
 

6227
02:03:55,560 --> 02:03:56,870
there is if that's the case it's a
really interesting thing to think about

6228
02:03:56,870 --> 02:03:56,880
really interesting thing to think about
 

6229
02:03:56,880 --> 02:03:59,089
really interesting thing to think about
I think yeah the regular which he

6230
02:03:59,089 --> 02:03:59,099
I think yeah the regular which he
 

6231
02:03:59,099 --> 02:04:01,490
I think yeah the regular which he
approaches it is really

6232
02:04:01,490 --> 02:04:01,500
approaches it is really
 

6233
02:04:01,500 --> 02:04:03,350
approaches it is really
um admirable I mean I do think it's

6234
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:03,360
um admirable I mean I do think it's
 

6235
02:04:03,360 --> 02:04:06,790
um admirable I mean I do think it's
scientific uh but

6236
02:04:06,790 --> 02:04:06,800
scientific uh but
 

6237
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:10,669
scientific uh but
it's uh the question for me is why is it

6238
02:04:10,669 --> 02:04:10,679
it's uh the question for me is why is it
 

6239
02:04:10,679 --> 02:04:12,649
it's uh the question for me is why is it
so consistent across all of these

6240
02:04:12,649 --> 02:04:12,659
so consistent across all of these
 

6241
02:04:12,659 --> 02:04:16,010
so consistent across all of these
organisms we all seem to see the table

6242
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:16,020
organisms we all seem to see the table
 

6243
02:04:16,020 --> 02:04:19,129
organisms we all seem to see the table
like and feel and yeah so what he will

6244
02:04:19,129 --> 02:04:19,139
like and feel and yeah so what he will
 

6245
02:04:19,139 --> 02:04:20,570
like and feel and yeah so what he will
agree so what I would say to that and

6246
02:04:20,570 --> 02:04:20,580
agree so what I would say to that and
 

6247
02:04:20,580 --> 02:04:22,370
agree so what I would say to that and
when I post this to him I really don't

6248
02:04:22,370 --> 02:04:22,380
when I post this to him I really don't
 

6249
02:04:22,380 --> 02:04:25,070
when I post this to him I really don't
want to speak for him but I'll I'll

6250
02:04:25,070 --> 02:04:25,080
want to speak for him but I'll I'll
 

6251
02:04:25,080 --> 02:04:27,530
want to speak for him but I'll I'll
answer it myself and say that I believe

6252
02:04:27,530 --> 02:04:27,540
answer it myself and say that I believe
 

6253
02:04:27,540 --> 02:04:30,350
answer it myself and say that I believe
he agrees with what I'm about to say

6254
02:04:30,350 --> 02:04:30,360
he agrees with what I'm about to say
 

6255
02:04:30,360 --> 02:04:32,750
he agrees with what I'm about to say
which is that

6256
02:04:32,750 --> 02:04:32,760
which is that
 

6257
02:04:32,760 --> 02:04:36,290
which is that
the things we perceive

6258
02:04:36,290 --> 02:04:36,300
the things we perceive
 

6259
02:04:36,300 --> 02:04:38,629
the things we perceive
are connected to the structure of

6260
02:04:38,629 --> 02:04:38,639
are connected to the structure of
 

6261
02:04:38,639 --> 02:04:41,149
are connected to the structure of
reality it's just that the structure of

6262
02:04:41,149 --> 02:04:41,159
reality it's just that the structure of
 

6263
02:04:41,159 --> 02:04:43,370
reality it's just that the structure of
reality is made of something completely

6264
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:43,380
reality is made of something completely
 

6265
02:04:43,380 --> 02:04:44,570
reality is made of something completely
different than the thing we're

6266
02:04:44,570 --> 02:04:44,580
different than the thing we're
 

6267
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:45,890
different than the thing we're
experiencing

6268
02:04:45,890 --> 02:04:45,900
experiencing
 

6269
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:48,350
experiencing
so imagine if you just go with the the

6270
02:04:48,350 --> 02:04:48,360
so imagine if you just go with the the
 

6271
02:04:48,360 --> 02:04:50,570
so imagine if you just go with the the
holographic principle

6272
02:04:50,570 --> 02:04:50,580
holographic principle
 

6273
02:04:50,580 --> 02:04:53,689
holographic principle
um you know Loosely uh and actually the

6274
02:04:53,689 --> 02:04:53,699
um you know Loosely uh and actually the
 

6275
02:04:53,699 --> 02:04:55,430
um you know Loosely uh and actually the
holographic principle applies to black

6276
02:04:55,430 --> 02:04:55,440
holographic principle applies to black
 

6277
02:04:55,440 --> 02:04:59,470
holographic principle applies to black
holes only um so there's ads CFT Duality

6278
02:04:59,470 --> 02:04:59,480
holes only um so there's ads CFT Duality
 

6279
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:02,510
holes only um so there's ads CFT Duality
anti-decider space and conformal field

6280
02:05:02,510 --> 02:05:02,520
anti-decider space and conformal field
 

6281
02:05:02,520 --> 02:05:04,129
anti-decider space and conformal field
Theory am I getting all these terms

6282
02:05:04,129 --> 02:05:04,139
Theory am I getting all these terms
 

6283
02:05:04,139 --> 02:05:04,930
Theory am I getting all these terms
right

6284
02:05:04,930 --> 02:05:04,940
right
 

6285
02:05:04,940 --> 02:05:07,250
right
but I can't believe we're going there

6286
02:05:07,250 --> 02:05:07,260
but I can't believe we're going there
 

6287
02:05:07,260 --> 02:05:09,770
but I can't believe we're going there
well I mean this is where I've in all of

6288
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:09,780
well I mean this is where I've in all of
 

6289
02:05:09,780 --> 02:05:10,910
well I mean this is where I've in all of
my conversations but this is this

6290
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:10,920
my conversations but this is this
 

6291
02:05:10,920 --> 02:05:13,550
my conversations but this is this
because the idea is so so if we just if

6292
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:13,560
because the idea is so so if we just if
 

6293
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,030
because the idea is so so if we just if
we just have the basic principle that

6294
02:05:16,030 --> 02:05:16,040
we just have the basic principle that
 

6295
02:05:16,040 --> 02:05:19,070
we just have the basic principle that
reality and all the information can be

6296
02:05:19,070 --> 02:05:19,080
reality and all the information can be
 

6297
02:05:19,080 --> 02:05:21,470
reality and all the information can be
contained or is is actually in a

6298
02:05:21,470 --> 02:05:21,480
contained or is is actually in a
 

6299
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:24,290
contained or is is actually in a
two-dimensional space that gets

6300
02:05:24,290 --> 02:05:24,300
two-dimensional space that gets
 

6301
02:05:24,300 --> 02:05:25,609
two-dimensional space that gets
projected this is something that you

6302
02:05:25,609 --> 02:05:25,619
projected this is something that you
 

6303
02:05:25,619 --> 02:05:27,770
projected this is something that you
don't buy based on the look on your face

6304
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:27,780
don't buy based on the look on your face
 

6305
02:05:27,780 --> 02:05:30,109
don't buy based on the look on your face
no no no I'm I'm actually freaking out

6306
02:05:30,109 --> 02:05:30,119
no no no I'm I'm actually freaking out
 

6307
02:05:30,119 --> 02:05:33,370
no no no I'm I'm actually freaking out
because yes any theory of modern physics

6308
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:33,380
because yes any theory of modern physics
 

6309
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:36,470
because yes any theory of modern physics
gives inkling that reality is very weird

6310
02:05:36,470 --> 02:05:36,480
gives inkling that reality is very weird
 

6311
02:05:36,480 --> 02:05:39,050
gives inkling that reality is very weird
right and completely different from how

6312
02:05:39,050 --> 02:05:39,060
right and completely different from how
 

6313
02:05:39,060 --> 02:05:40,490
right and completely different from how
we experience that's one example which

6314
02:05:40,490 --> 02:05:40,500
we experience that's one example which
 

6315
02:05:40,500 --> 02:05:42,830
we experience that's one example which
is so so this is an intuition that for

6316
02:05:42,830 --> 02:05:42,840
is so so this is an intuition that for
 

6317
02:05:42,840 --> 02:05:45,770
is so so this is an intuition that for
whatever reason has has always felt true

6318
02:05:45,770 --> 02:05:45,780
whatever reason has has always felt true
 

6319
02:05:45,780 --> 02:05:47,390
whatever reason has has always felt true
to me this is this is the way I thought

6320
02:05:47,390 --> 02:05:47,400
to me this is this is the way I thought
 

6321
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,129
to me this is this is the way I thought
about things as a child I've met other

6322
02:05:49,129 --> 02:05:49,139
about things as a child I've met other
 

6323
02:05:49,139 --> 02:05:51,050
about things as a child I've met other
people that felt this way when I've had

6324
02:05:51,050 --> 02:05:51,060
people that felt this way when I've had
 

6325
02:05:51,060 --> 02:05:52,729
people that felt this way when I've had
experiences in psychedelics and this is

6326
02:05:52,729 --> 02:05:52,739
experiences in psychedelics and this is
 

6327
02:05:52,739 --> 02:05:55,250
experiences in psychedelics and this is
where I start to sound crazy to but

6328
02:05:55,250 --> 02:05:55,260
where I start to sound crazy to but
 

6329
02:05:55,260 --> 02:05:58,750
where I start to sound crazy to but
nope but um everybody else is crazy

6330
02:05:58,750 --> 02:05:58,760
nope but um everybody else is crazy
 

6331
02:05:58,760 --> 02:06:02,510
nope but um everybody else is crazy
except it does but

6332
02:06:02,510 --> 02:06:02,520
except it does but
 

6333
02:06:02,520 --> 02:06:04,790
except it does but
that has always seemed right to me and

6334
02:06:04,790 --> 02:06:04,800
that has always seemed right to me and
 

6335
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,830
that has always seemed right to me and
that's always the thing that I feel like

6336
02:06:06,830 --> 02:06:06,840
that's always the thing that I feel like
 

6337
02:06:06,840 --> 02:06:09,530
that's always the thing that I feel like
I'm looking for that it's funny recently

6338
02:06:09,530 --> 02:06:09,540
I'm looking for that it's funny recently
 

6339
02:06:09,540 --> 02:06:12,470
I'm looking for that it's funny recently
I was thinking that it's it's as if I

6340
02:06:12,470 --> 02:06:12,480
I was thinking that it's it's as if I
 

6341
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:15,290
I was thinking that it's it's as if I
feel like I'm and it was more how I was

6342
02:06:15,290 --> 02:06:15,300
feel like I'm and it was more how I was
 

6343
02:06:15,300 --> 02:06:17,689
feel like I'm and it was more how I was
thinking of how I felt as a child but

6344
02:06:17,689 --> 02:06:17,699
thinking of how I felt as a child but
 

6345
02:06:17,699 --> 02:06:19,790
thinking of how I felt as a child but
um I feel this way a lot as an adult too

6346
02:06:19,790 --> 02:06:19,800
um I feel this way a lot as an adult too
 

6347
02:06:19,800 --> 02:06:23,030
um I feel this way a lot as an adult too
that the uh the image is one of a snow

6348
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:23,040
that the uh the image is one of a snow
 

6349
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:25,910
that the uh the image is one of a snow
globe that I that I that I'm confined to

6350
02:06:25,910 --> 02:06:25,920
globe that I that I that I'm confined to
 

6351
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:27,890
globe that I that I that I'm confined to
the snow globe based on my human

6352
02:06:27,890 --> 02:06:27,900
the snow globe based on my human
 

6353
02:06:27,900 --> 02:06:30,770
the snow globe based on my human
perceptions and the truth of reality is

6354
02:06:30,770 --> 02:06:30,780
perceptions and the truth of reality is
 

6355
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:33,229
perceptions and the truth of reality is
is out there and it's actually why I'm

6356
02:06:33,229 --> 02:06:33,239
is out there and it's actually why I'm
 

6357
02:06:33,239 --> 02:06:34,910
is out there and it's actually why I'm
so drawn to shaking intuitions I feel

6358
02:06:34,910 --> 02:06:34,920
so drawn to shaking intuitions I feel
 

6359
02:06:34,920 --> 02:06:36,410
so drawn to shaking intuitions I feel
like every time we shake up an intuition

6360
02:06:36,410 --> 02:06:36,420
like every time we shake up an intuition
 

6361
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:38,270
like every time we shake up an intuition
it's like an opportunity to leave the

6362
02:06:38,270 --> 02:06:38,280
it's like an opportunity to leave the
 

6363
02:06:38,280 --> 02:06:40,669
it's like an opportunity to leave the
snow globe for for a moment

6364
02:06:40,669 --> 02:06:40,679
snow globe for for a moment
 

6365
02:06:40,679 --> 02:06:41,810
snow globe for for a moment
um you know it's like smashing the

6366
02:06:41,810 --> 02:06:41,820
um you know it's like smashing the
 

6367
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:43,970
um you know it's like smashing the
marbles and seeing Oh it's not liquid in

6368
02:06:43,970 --> 02:06:43,980
marbles and seeing Oh it's not liquid in
 

6369
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:45,530
marbles and seeing Oh it's not liquid in
there like I thought it's it's it's

6370
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:45,540
there like I thought it's it's it's
 

6371
02:06:45,540 --> 02:06:48,229
there like I thought it's it's it's
getting this glimpse of something truer

6372
02:06:48,229 --> 02:06:48,239
getting this glimpse of something truer
 

6373
02:06:48,239 --> 02:06:50,510
getting this glimpse of something truer
than what we typically experience

6374
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:50,520
than what we typically experience
 

6375
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:52,550
than what we typically experience
I feel like as though it's for a long

6376
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:52,560
I feel like as though it's for a long
 

6377
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:54,649
I feel like as though it's for a long
time going to be snow globes inside snow

6378
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:54,659
time going to be snow globes inside snow
 

6379
02:06:54,659 --> 02:06:56,930
time going to be snow globes inside snow
globes inside snow globes but the larger

6380
02:06:56,930 --> 02:06:56,940
globes inside snow globes but the larger
 

6381
02:06:56,940 --> 02:06:59,149
globes inside snow globes but the larger
point is that yes whatever is true about

6382
02:06:59,149 --> 02:06:59,159
point is that yes whatever is true about
 

6383
02:06:59,159 --> 02:07:01,250
point is that yes whatever is true about
the fundamental nature of reality is not

6384
02:07:01,250 --> 02:07:01,260
the fundamental nature of reality is not
 

6385
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:04,790
the fundamental nature of reality is not
something we're experiencing however it

6386
02:07:04,790 --> 02:07:04,800
something we're experiencing however it
 

6387
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:07,550
something we're experiencing however it
is linked and give us gives us Clues to

6388
02:07:07,550 --> 02:07:07,560
is linked and give us gives us Clues to
 

6389
02:07:07,560 --> 02:07:09,470
is linked and give us gives us Clues to
it so so one image I've been I came up

6390
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:09,480
it so so one image I've been I came up
 

6391
02:07:09,480 --> 02:07:11,270
it so so one image I've been I came up
with recently I actually wrote about

6392
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:11,280
with recently I actually wrote about
 

6393
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,189
with recently I actually wrote about
this I have an article in Nautilus about

6394
02:07:13,189 --> 02:07:13,199
this I have an article in Nautilus about
 

6395
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:14,629
this I have an article in Nautilus about
time

6396
02:07:14,629 --> 02:07:14,639
time
 

6397
02:07:14,639 --> 02:07:16,609
time
um because I was as I spend time

6398
02:07:16,609 --> 02:07:16,619
um because I was as I spend time
 

6399
02:07:16,619 --> 02:07:18,290
um because I was as I spend time
thinking about what it would mean for

6400
02:07:18,290 --> 02:07:18,300
thinking about what it would mean for
 

6401
02:07:18,300 --> 02:07:20,810
thinking about what it would mean for
Consciousness to be fundamental

6402
02:07:20,810 --> 02:07:20,820
Consciousness to be fundamental
 

6403
02:07:20,820 --> 02:07:23,149
Consciousness to be fundamental
um and at the same time I'm talking to

6404
02:07:23,149 --> 02:07:23,159
um and at the same time I'm talking to
 

6405
02:07:23,159 --> 02:07:24,669
um and at the same time I'm talking to
physicists about

6406
02:07:24,669 --> 02:07:24,679
physicists about
 

6407
02:07:24,679 --> 02:07:26,870
physicists about
different interpretations of quantum

6408
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:26,880
different interpretations of quantum
 

6409
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,689
different interpretations of quantum
mechanics and the and the fact that the

6410
02:07:29,689 --> 02:07:29,699
mechanics and the and the fact that the
 

6411
02:07:29,699 --> 02:07:31,490
mechanics and the and the fact that the
ones I'm talking to believe that space

6412
02:07:31,490 --> 02:07:31,500
ones I'm talking to believe that space
 

6413
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:33,950
ones I'm talking to believe that space
and time are are emergent and are not

6414
02:07:33,950 --> 02:07:33,960
and time are are emergent and are not
 

6415
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,410
and time are are emergent and are not
part of the fundamental story

6416
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:36,420
part of the fundamental story
 

6417
02:07:36,420 --> 02:07:41,689
part of the fundamental story
um I was thinking about what is it

6418
02:07:41,689 --> 02:07:41,699

 

6419
02:07:41,699 --> 02:07:45,169

what could time be if it's not the way

6420
02:07:45,169 --> 02:07:45,179
what could time be if it's not the way
 

6421
02:07:45,179 --> 02:07:47,209
what could time be if it's not the way
we experience it what could it be

6422
02:07:47,209 --> 02:07:47,219
we experience it what could it be
 

6423
02:07:47,219 --> 02:07:49,310
we experience it what could it be
pointing to

6424
02:07:49,310 --> 02:07:49,320
pointing to
 

6425
02:07:49,320 --> 02:07:50,629
pointing to
um and you know I'm not the first person

6426
02:07:50,629 --> 02:07:50,639
um and you know I'm not the first person
 

6427
02:07:50,639 --> 02:07:54,169
um and you know I'm not the first person
to think like this many people have have

6428
02:07:54,169 --> 02:07:54,179
to think like this many people have have
 

6429
02:07:54,179 --> 02:07:55,550
to think like this many people have have
um you know developed different thought

6430
02:07:55,550 --> 02:07:55,560
um you know developed different thought
 

6431
02:07:55,560 --> 02:07:57,709
um you know developed different thought
experiments around this but

6432
02:07:57,709 --> 02:07:57,719
experiments around this but
 

6433
02:07:57,719 --> 02:07:58,970
experiments around this but
um and this is I'm not saying this is

6434
02:07:58,970 --> 02:07:58,980
um and this is I'm not saying this is
 

6435
02:07:58,980 --> 02:08:01,250
um and this is I'm not saying this is
the way things are but this is just one

6436
02:08:01,250 --> 02:08:01,260
the way things are but this is just one
 

6437
02:08:01,260 --> 02:08:07,370
the way things are but this is just one
solution is that time and causality

6438
02:08:07,370 --> 02:08:07,380

 

6439
02:08:07,380 --> 02:08:09,470

um appear to us the way they do because

6440
02:08:09,470 --> 02:08:09,480
um appear to us the way they do because
 

6441
02:08:09,480 --> 02:08:11,570
um appear to us the way they do because
for whatever reason we're only

6442
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:11,580
for whatever reason we're only
 

6443
02:08:11,580 --> 02:08:14,629
for whatever reason we're only
perceiving one moment at a time

6444
02:08:14,629 --> 02:08:14,639
perceiving one moment at a time
 

6445
02:08:14,639 --> 02:08:17,709
perceiving one moment at a time
and

6446
02:08:17,709 --> 02:08:17,719

 

6447
02:08:17,719 --> 02:08:21,350

these connections between events that we

6448
02:08:21,350 --> 02:08:21,360
these connections between events that we
 

6449
02:08:21,360 --> 02:08:24,830
these connections between events that we
perceive as time are actually just part

6450
02:08:24,830 --> 02:08:24,840
perceive as time are actually just part
 

6451
02:08:24,840 --> 02:08:26,390
perceive as time are actually just part
of the fabric of reality there's some

6452
02:08:26,390 --> 02:08:26,400
of the fabric of reality there's some
 

6453
02:08:26,400 --> 02:08:27,830
of the fabric of reality there's some
structure to

6454
02:08:27,830 --> 02:08:27,840
structure to
 

6455
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:30,830
structure to
reality at a deeper level

6456
02:08:30,830 --> 02:08:30,840
reality at a deeper level
 

6457
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:32,750
reality at a deeper level
um where you know it's like shining a

6458
02:08:32,750 --> 02:08:32,760
um where you know it's like shining a
 

6459
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:34,310
um where you know it's like shining a
flashlight on the structure of reality

6460
02:08:34,310 --> 02:08:34,320
flashlight on the structure of reality
 

6461
02:08:34,320 --> 02:08:36,589
flashlight on the structure of reality
where for us for whatever reason

6462
02:08:36,589 --> 02:08:36,599
where for us for whatever reason
 

6463
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:38,570
where for us for whatever reason
everything else disappears and the only

6464
02:08:38,570 --> 02:08:38,580
everything else disappears and the only
 

6465
02:08:38,580 --> 02:08:40,510
everything else disappears and the only
thing that exists is is

6466
02:08:40,510 --> 02:08:40,520
thing that exists is is
 

6467
02:08:40,520 --> 02:08:43,370
thing that exists is is
that single pin

6468
02:08:43,370 --> 02:08:43,380
that single pin
 

6469
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:46,250
that single pin
pinprick of light that we happen to be

6470
02:08:46,250 --> 02:08:46,260
pinprick of light that we happen to be
 

6471
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:48,290
pinprick of light that we happen to be
inhabiting or that we can perceive but

6472
02:08:48,290 --> 02:08:48,300
inhabiting or that we can perceive but
 

6473
02:08:48,300 --> 02:08:50,209
inhabiting or that we can perceive but
that the rest of it is there and so that

6474
02:08:50,209 --> 02:08:50,219
that the rest of it is there and so that
 

6475
02:08:50,219 --> 02:08:52,850
that the rest of it is there and so that
even though time would be an illusion

6476
02:08:52,850 --> 02:08:52,860
even though time would be an illusion
 

6477
02:08:52,860 --> 02:08:54,950
even though time would be an illusion
and and the causality in the way we

6478
02:08:54,950 --> 02:08:54,960
and and the causality in the way we
 

6479
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:58,430
and and the causality in the way we
experience it is an illusion

6480
02:08:58,430 --> 02:08:58,440
experience it is an illusion
 

6481
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,050
experience it is an illusion
um or it doesn't mean what we think it

6482
02:09:00,050 --> 02:09:00,060
um or it doesn't mean what we think it
 

6483
02:09:00,060 --> 02:09:02,209
um or it doesn't mean what we think it
means it's still pointing to a deeper

6484
02:09:02,209 --> 02:09:02,219
means it's still pointing to a deeper
 

6485
02:09:02,219 --> 02:09:03,470
means it's still pointing to a deeper
structure there's something that it

6486
02:09:03,470 --> 02:09:03,480
structure there's something that it
 

6487
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,870
structure there's something that it
corresponds to in the fundamental nature

6488
02:09:05,870 --> 02:09:05,880
corresponds to in the fundamental nature
 

6489
02:09:05,880 --> 02:09:07,850
corresponds to in the fundamental nature
of reality and I've had many enough

6490
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:07,860
of reality and I've had many enough
 

6491
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:11,149
of reality and I've had many enough
conversations with Don I think

6492
02:09:11,149 --> 02:09:11,159
conversations with Don I think
 

6493
02:09:11,159 --> 02:09:14,510
conversations with Don I think
to know that he

6494
02:09:14,510 --> 02:09:14,520
to know that he
 

6495
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:16,370
to know that he
he would agree with that that our

6496
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:16,380
he would agree with that that our
 

6497
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:19,430
he would agree with that that our
perceptions

6498
02:09:19,430 --> 02:09:19,440

 

6499
02:09:19,440 --> 02:09:21,350

map onto something

6500
02:09:21,350 --> 02:09:21,360
map onto something
 

6501
02:09:21,360 --> 02:09:23,950
map onto something
it's just not

6502
02:09:23,950 --> 02:09:23,960
it's just not
 

6503
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:26,390
it's just not
the experience of it that we're having

6504
02:09:26,390 --> 02:09:26,400
the experience of it that we're having
 

6505
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,870
the experience of it that we're having
so so to go back to

6506
02:09:29,870 --> 02:09:29,880
so so to go back to
 

6507
02:09:29,880 --> 02:09:33,410
so so to go back to
um you uh the idea that all of reality

6508
02:09:33,410 --> 02:09:33,420
um you uh the idea that all of reality
 

6509
02:09:33,420 --> 02:09:34,450
um you uh the idea that all of reality
could be

6510
02:09:34,450 --> 02:09:34,460
could be
 

6511
02:09:34,460 --> 02:09:36,770
could be
contained in two dimensions and there's

6512
02:09:36,770 --> 02:09:36,780
contained in two dimensions and there's
 

6513
02:09:36,780 --> 02:09:38,270
contained in two dimensions and there's
something about the the interaction

6514
02:09:38,270 --> 02:09:38,280
something about the the interaction
 

6515
02:09:38,280 --> 02:09:40,609
something about the the interaction
between different points

6516
02:09:40,609 --> 02:09:40,619
between different points
 

6517
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:42,589
between different points
um that cause this

6518
02:09:42,589 --> 02:09:42,599
um that cause this
 

6519
02:09:42,599 --> 02:09:44,689
um that cause this
a holograph so that it seems like

6520
02:09:44,689 --> 02:09:44,699
a holograph so that it seems like
 

6521
02:09:44,699 --> 02:09:46,070
a holograph so that it seems like
there's a three-dimensional world when

6522
02:09:46,070 --> 02:09:46,080
there's a three-dimensional world when
 

6523
02:09:46,080 --> 02:09:48,290
there's a three-dimensional world when
in fact that it's it's a projection of

6524
02:09:48,290 --> 02:09:48,300
in fact that it's it's a projection of
 

6525
02:09:48,300 --> 02:09:50,689
in fact that it's it's a projection of
this two-dimensional surface

6526
02:09:50,689 --> 02:09:50,699
this two-dimensional surface
 

6527
02:09:50,699 --> 02:09:53,149
this two-dimensional surface
um

6528
02:09:53,149 --> 02:09:53,159

 

6529
02:09:53,159 --> 02:09:58,790

what we experience as space still

6530
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:58,800

 

6531
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:01,550

references something

6532
02:10:01,550 --> 02:10:01,560
references something
 

6533
02:10:01,560 --> 02:10:03,890
references something
at the fundamental level it's just that

6534
02:10:03,890 --> 02:10:03,900
at the fundamental level it's just that
 

6535
02:10:03,900 --> 02:10:05,510
at the fundamental level it's just that
it's not space

6536
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:05,520
it's not space
 

6537
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:07,669
it's not space
and that is something that makes a lot

6538
02:10:07,669 --> 02:10:07,679
and that is something that makes a lot
 

6539
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:09,350
and that is something that makes a lot
of sense to me I also I posted an

02:10:09,350 --> 02:10:09,360
of sense to me I also I posted an
 

6541
02:10:09,360 --> 02:10:12,350
of sense to me I also I posted an

um and he talks about he's he's a great
science writer and he talks about

02:10:22,450 --> 02:10:22,460
science writer and he talks about
 

6549
02:10:22,460 --> 02:10:26,330
science writer and he talks about
ways to kind of absorb what this would

mean this ads CFT Duality and he talks

6552
02:10:30,050 --> 02:10:30,060
mean this ads CFT Duality and he talks
 

6553
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:32,510
mean this ads CFT Duality and he talks
about he gives an example of

6554
02:10:32,510 --> 02:10:32,520
about he gives an example of

different notes can exist in three

6558
02:10:37,729 --> 02:10:37,739
different notes can exist in three
 

6559
02:10:37,739 --> 02:10:40,189
different notes can exist in three

because of the frequency of the sound
 

6563
02:10:43,679 --> 02:10:46,129
because of the frequency of the sound
waves and that in another way you can

6564
02:10:46,129 --> 02:10:46,139
waves and that in another way you can
 

6565
02:10:46,139 --> 02:10:49,129
waves and that in another way you can
think of the sound waves existing in

6566
02:10:49,129 --> 02:10:49,139
think of the sound waves existing in
 

6567
02:10:49,139 --> 02:10:50,689
think of the sound waves existing in
different dimensions

6568
02:10:50,689 --> 02:10:50,699
different dimensions
 

6569
02:10:50,699 --> 02:10:52,129

thank you

6570
02:10:52,129 --> 02:10:52,139
thank you
 

6571
02:10:52,139 --> 02:10:54,890
thank you
I don't know if that's i i i i yeah

6572
02:10:54,890 --> 02:10:54,900
I don't know if that's i i i i yeah
 

6573
02:10:54,900 --> 02:10:56,390
I don't know if that's i i i i yeah
that's really interesting so I don't

6574
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
that's really interesting so I don't
 

6575
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:58,850
that's really interesting so I don't
speak as well as I write so

6576
02:10:58,850 --> 02:10:58,860
speak as well as I write so
 

6577
02:10:58,860 --> 02:11:01,250
speak as well as I write so
I've written about this in a way that I

6578
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:01,260
I've written about this in a way that I
 

6579
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:03,410
I've written about this in a way that I
think is is easier to absorb than the

6580
02:11:03,410 --> 02:11:03,420
think is is easier to absorb than the
 

6581
02:11:03,420 --> 02:11:04,790
think is is easier to absorb than the
way I just described it but I think

6582
02:11:04,790 --> 02:11:04,800
way I just described it but I think
 

6583
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,490
way I just described it but I think
causality is a trickier trickiest one

6584
02:11:07,490 --> 02:11:07,500
causality is a trickier trickiest one
 

6585
02:11:07,500 --> 02:11:10,310
causality is a trickier trickiest one
trickier one time it's a trick you want

6586
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,320
trickier one time it's a trick you want
 

6587
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:12,109
trickier one time it's a trick you want
to like yeah

6588
02:11:12,109 --> 02:11:12,119
to like yeah
 

6589
02:11:12,119 --> 02:11:14,149
to like yeah
oh boy and there are physicists who

6590
02:11:14,149 --> 02:11:14,159
oh boy and there are physicists who
 

6591
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:16,250
oh boy and there are physicists who
think that space is emergent but time is

6592
02:11:16,250 --> 02:11:16,260
think that space is emergent but time is
 

6593
02:11:16,260 --> 02:11:18,169
think that space is emergent but time is
still fundamental and Lee smolen is one

6594
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:18,179
still fundamental and Lee smolen is one
 

6595
02:11:18,179 --> 02:11:20,390
still fundamental and Lee smolen is one
of those scientists and it's really

6596
02:11:20,390 --> 02:11:20,400
of those scientists and it's really
 

6597
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:22,250
of those scientists and it's really
interesting to talk to him about this

6598
02:11:22,250 --> 02:11:22,260
interesting to talk to him about this
 

6599
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:26,689
interesting to talk to him about this
but yeah but time being emergent

6600
02:11:26,689 --> 02:11:26,699

 

6601
02:11:26,699 --> 02:11:28,729

um is a really trip you want to think

6602
02:11:28,729 --> 02:11:28,739
um is a really trip you want to think
 

6603
02:11:28,739 --> 02:11:31,790
um is a really trip you want to think
about yeah also I I wonder if it's

6604
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:31,800
about yeah also I I wonder if it's
 

6605
02:11:31,800 --> 02:11:35,330
about yeah also I I wonder if it's
possible at which point this the

6606
02:11:35,330 --> 02:11:35,340
possible at which point this the
 

6607
02:11:35,340 --> 02:11:37,850
possible at which point this the
experience of time

6608
02:11:37,850 --> 02:11:37,860
experience of time
 

6609
02:11:37,860 --> 02:11:40,490
experience of time
start becoming a part of the conscious

6610
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:40,500
start becoming a part of the conscious
 

6611
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,310
start becoming a part of the conscious
experience of living organisms so is it

6612
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:43,320
experience of living organisms so is it
 

6613
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:45,649
experience of living organisms so is it
something that evolved on Earth yeah

6614
02:11:45,649 --> 02:11:45,659
something that evolved on Earth yeah
 

6615
02:11:45,659 --> 02:11:48,169
something that evolved on Earth yeah
only or is it it's also very hard to

6616
02:11:48,169 --> 02:11:48,179
only or is it it's also very hard to
 

6617
02:11:48,179 --> 02:11:50,510
only or is it it's also very hard to
think about Consciousness without time

6618
02:11:50,510 --> 02:11:50,520
think about Consciousness without time
 

6619
02:11:50,520 --> 02:11:51,770
think about Consciousness without time
and that's something that's really

6620
02:11:51,770 --> 02:11:51,780
and that's something that's really
 

6621
02:11:51,780 --> 02:11:54,050
and that's something that's really
interesting for me to think about too

6622
02:11:54,050 --> 02:11:54,060
interesting for me to think about too
 

6623
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:57,169
interesting for me to think about too
um although not that this is scientific

6624
02:11:57,169 --> 02:11:57,179
um although not that this is scientific
 

6625
02:11:57,179 --> 02:11:59,750
um although not that this is scientific
evidence of anything but I and many

6626
02:11:59,750 --> 02:11:59,760
evidence of anything but I and many
 

6627
02:11:59,760 --> 02:12:02,089
evidence of anything but I and many
others have had the experience a

6628
02:12:02,089 --> 02:12:02,099
others have had the experience a
 

6629
02:12:02,099 --> 02:12:05,089
others have had the experience a
Timeless spaceless experience

6630
02:12:05,089 --> 02:12:05,099
Timeless spaceless experience
 

6631
02:12:05,099 --> 02:12:07,310
Timeless spaceless experience
um in certain states of meditation and

6632
02:12:07,310 --> 02:12:07,320
um in certain states of meditation and
 

6633
02:12:07,320 --> 02:12:10,250
um in certain states of meditation and
on under the internet conscious

6634
02:12:10,250 --> 02:12:10,260
on under the internet conscious
 

6635
02:12:10,260 --> 02:12:11,950
on under the internet conscious
experience would you say yeah absolutely

6636
02:12:11,950 --> 02:12:11,960
experience would you say yeah absolutely
 

6637
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,109
experience would you say yeah absolutely
but didn't you say that some aspect of

6638
02:12:15,109 --> 02:12:15,119
but didn't you say that some aspect of
 

6639
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:18,229
but didn't you say that some aspect of
conscious experience is memory it seems

6640
02:12:18,229 --> 02:12:18,239
conscious experience is memory it seems
 

6641
02:12:18,239 --> 02:12:21,350
conscious experience is memory it seems
like that too no no so I I said an

6642
02:12:21,350 --> 02:12:21,360
like that too no no so I I said an
 

6643
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:23,330
like that too no no so I I said an
experience of being a self is due to

6644
02:12:23,330 --> 02:12:23,340
experience of being a self is due to
 

6645
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:24,950
experience of being a self is due to
memory

6646
02:12:24,950 --> 02:12:24,960
memory
 

6647
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:27,709
memory
um it seems that Consciousness and time

6648
02:12:27,709 --> 02:12:27,719
um it seems that Consciousness and time
 

6649
02:12:27,719 --> 02:12:30,410
um it seems that Consciousness and time
are inextricably linked but I I think

6650
02:12:30,410 --> 02:12:30,420
are inextricably linked but I I think
 

6651
02:12:30,420 --> 02:12:33,770
are inextricably linked but I I think
that may be an illusion also and when I

6652
02:12:33,770 --> 02:12:33,780
that may be an illusion also and when I
 

6653
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:35,270
that may be an illusion also and when I
think about Consciousness being

6654
02:12:35,270 --> 02:12:35,280
think about Consciousness being
 

6655
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:38,330
think about Consciousness being
fundamental and you know someone oops

6656
02:12:38,330 --> 02:12:38,340
fundamental and you know someone oops
 

6657
02:12:38,340 --> 02:12:40,250
fundamental and you know someone oops
someone like Max tegmark I don't know

6658
02:12:40,250 --> 02:12:40,260
someone like Max tegmark I don't know
 

6659
02:12:40,260 --> 02:12:41,990
someone like Max tegmark I don't know
who if there are other mathematicians

6660
02:12:41,990 --> 02:12:42,000
who if there are other mathematicians
 

6661
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:43,669
who if there are other mathematicians
I'm sure there are he's the only one I

6662
02:12:43,669 --> 02:12:43,679
I'm sure there are he's the only one I
 

6663
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:46,030
I'm sure there are he's the only one I
know of who will talk about

6664
02:12:46,030 --> 02:12:46,040
know of who will talk about
 

6665
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:50,450
know of who will talk about
mathematical forms and shapes as not

6666
02:12:50,450 --> 02:12:50,460
mathematical forms and shapes as not
 

6667
02:12:50,460 --> 02:12:53,750
mathematical forms and shapes as not
just being he talks about them as being

6668
02:12:53,750 --> 02:12:53,760
just being he talks about them as being
 

6669
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:56,709
just being he talks about them as being
actual

6670
02:12:56,709 --> 02:12:56,719

 

6671
02:12:56,719 --> 02:13:00,229

objects in nature that that exist that

6672
02:13:00,229 --> 02:13:00,239
objects in nature that that exist that
 

6673
02:13:00,239 --> 02:13:02,810
objects in nature that that exist that
are not just mathematical structures

6674
02:13:02,810 --> 02:13:02,820
are not just mathematical structures
 

6675
02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:04,330
are not just mathematical structures
that we can think about

6676
02:13:04,330 --> 02:13:04,340
that we can think about
 

6677
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,910
that we can think about
but any mathematical structure that

6678
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:07,920
but any mathematical structure that
 

6679
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:10,669
but any mathematical structure that
comes out of the math actually exists in

6680
02:13:10,669 --> 02:13:10,679
comes out of the math actually exists in
 

6681
02:13:10,679 --> 02:13:13,370
comes out of the math actually exists in
reality yeah and so when I think about

6682
02:13:13,370 --> 02:13:13,380
reality yeah and so when I think about
 

6683
02:13:13,380 --> 02:13:17,510
reality yeah and so when I think about
Consciousness being fundamental

6684
02:13:17,510 --> 02:13:17,520

 

6685
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:19,330

I think about

6686
02:13:19,330 --> 02:13:19,340
I think about
 

6687
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:22,790
I think about
physics and Mathematics being a

6688
02:13:22,790 --> 02:13:22,800
physics and Mathematics being a
 

6689
02:13:22,800 --> 02:13:25,910
physics and Mathematics being a
description of the structure of it

6690
02:13:25,910 --> 02:13:25,920
description of the structure of it
 

6691
02:13:25,920 --> 02:13:28,729
description of the structure of it
and that when mathematicians say things

6692
02:13:28,729 --> 02:13:28,739
and that when mathematicians say things
 

6693
02:13:28,739 --> 02:13:30,470
and that when mathematicians say things
like that or physicists say things like

6694
02:13:30,470 --> 02:13:30,480
like that or physicists say things like
 

6695
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:31,970
like that or physicists say things like
that

6696
02:13:31,970 --> 02:13:31,980
that
 

6697
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:34,430
that
um it makes sense

6698
02:13:34,430 --> 02:13:34,440
um it makes sense
 

6699
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:37,250
um it makes sense
if we're talking about

6700
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:37,260
if we're talking about
 

6701
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:40,850
if we're talking about
a conscious experience of some sort yeah

6702
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:40,860
a conscious experience of some sort yeah
 

6703
02:13:40,860 --> 02:13:42,169
a conscious experience of some sort yeah
that's really interesting I mean first

6704
02:13:42,169 --> 02:13:42,179
that's really interesting I mean first
 

6705
02:13:42,179 --> 02:13:44,290
that's really interesting I mean first
of all Max is great as

6706
02:13:44,290 --> 02:13:44,300
of all Max is great as
 

6707
02:13:44,300 --> 02:13:46,790
of all Max is great as
man this is really interesting to think

6708
02:13:46,790 --> 02:13:46,800
man this is really interesting to think
 

6709
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:48,470
man this is really interesting to think
about like how

6710
02:13:48,470 --> 02:13:48,480
about like how
 

6711
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:51,050
about like how
what is fundamental yeah it's a good

6712
02:13:51,050 --> 02:13:51,060
what is fundamental yeah it's a good
 

6713
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:53,330
what is fundamental yeah it's a good
exercise to do in general yeah like that

6714
02:13:53,330 --> 02:13:53,340
exercise to do in general yeah like that
 

6715
02:13:53,340 --> 02:13:55,069
exercise to do in general yeah like that
to truly think through it I mean

6716
02:13:55,069 --> 02:13:55,079
to truly think through it I mean
 

6717
02:13:55,079 --> 02:13:56,569
to truly think through it I mean
ultimately it's a very humbling process

6718
02:13:56,569 --> 02:13:56,579
ultimately it's a very humbling process
 

6719
02:13:56,579 --> 02:13:58,370
ultimately it's a very humbling process
because we're probably in the very early

6720
02:13:58,370 --> 02:13:58,380
because we're probably in the very early
 

6721
02:13:58,380 --> 02:14:00,770
because we're probably in the very early
days of uh well we can't no currently

6722
02:14:00,770 --> 02:14:00,780
days of uh well we can't no currently
 

6723
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:02,750
days of uh well we can't no currently
right right

6724
02:14:02,750 --> 02:14:02,760
right right
 

6725
02:14:02,760 --> 02:14:05,510
right right
me I mean maybe permanently but

6726
02:14:05,510 --> 02:14:05,520
me I mean maybe permanently but
 

6727
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:07,990
me I mean maybe permanently but
I I remain optimistic

6728
02:14:07,990 --> 02:14:08,000
I I remain optimistic
 

6729
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:10,970
I I remain optimistic
right uh well to jump around a little

6730
02:14:10,970 --> 02:14:10,980
right uh well to jump around a little
 

6731
02:14:10,980 --> 02:14:14,930
right uh well to jump around a little
bit the Google AI engineer

6732
02:14:14,930 --> 02:14:14,940
bit the Google AI engineer
 

6733
02:14:14,940 --> 02:14:17,149
bit the Google AI engineer
I'm using the terms from the Press it's

6734
02:14:17,149 --> 02:14:17,159
I'm using the terms from the Press it's
 

6735
02:14:17,159 --> 02:14:19,750
I'm using the terms from the Press it's
kind of hilarious

6736
02:14:19,750 --> 02:14:19,760
kind of hilarious
 

6737
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:23,209
kind of hilarious
but it's a friend of yours no it's not

6738
02:14:23,209 --> 02:14:23,219
but it's a friend of yours no it's not
 

6739
02:14:23,219 --> 02:14:26,930
but it's a friend of yours no it's not
no no uh but just you know the term AI

6740
02:14:26,930 --> 02:14:26,940
no no uh but just you know the term AI
 

6741
02:14:26,940 --> 02:14:28,609
no no uh but just you know the term AI
is really not used amongst machine

6742
02:14:28,609 --> 02:14:28,619
is really not used amongst machine
 

6743
02:14:28,619 --> 02:14:30,530
is really not used amongst machine
learning people oh I see okay so like

6744
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:30,540
learning people oh I see okay so like
 

6745
02:14:30,540 --> 02:14:32,930
learning people oh I see okay so like
I'm using kind of right Google AI

6746
02:14:32,930 --> 02:14:32,940
I'm using kind of right Google AI
 

6747
02:14:32,940 --> 02:14:35,569
I'm using kind of right Google AI
engineer and just like sentience and

6748
02:14:35,569 --> 02:14:35,579
engineer and just like sentience and
 

6749
02:14:35,579 --> 02:14:38,149
engineer and just like sentience and
chatbot and like none of those words are

6750
02:14:38,149 --> 02:14:38,159
chatbot and like none of those words are
 

6751
02:14:38,159 --> 02:14:40,669
chatbot and like none of those words are
really used in one by the people that

6752
02:14:40,669 --> 02:14:40,679
really used in one by the people that
 

6753
02:14:40,679 --> 02:14:42,530
really used in one by the people that
actually build them you know you're much

6754
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:42,540
actually build them you know you're much
 

6755
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:45,010
actually build them you know you're much
more likely to use language model versus

6756
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:45,020
more likely to use language model versus
 

6757
02:14:45,020 --> 02:14:48,890
more likely to use language model versus
chatbot or uh like natural language

6758
02:14:48,890 --> 02:14:48,900
chatbot or uh like natural language
 

6759
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:51,830
chatbot or uh like natural language
dialogue versus chatbot or whatever and

6760
02:14:51,830 --> 02:14:51,840
dialogue versus chatbot or whatever and
 

6761
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:54,109
dialogue versus chatbot or whatever and
certainly not sentience but that's the

6762
02:14:54,109 --> 02:14:54,119
certainly not sentience but that's the
 

6763
02:14:54,119 --> 02:14:55,790
certainly not sentience but that's the
point I mean sometimes the difference

6764
02:14:55,790 --> 02:14:55,800
point I mean sometimes the difference
 

6765
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:59,030
point I mean sometimes the difference
between the public discourse and the

6766
02:14:59,030 --> 02:14:59,040
between the public discourse and the
 

6767
02:14:59,040 --> 02:15:00,410
between the public discourse and the
engineering is actually really important

6768
02:15:00,410 --> 02:15:00,420
engineering is actually really important
 

6769
02:15:00,420 --> 02:15:02,390
engineering is actually really important
because engineering tends to want to

6770
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:02,400
because engineering tends to want to
 

6771
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:05,330
because engineering tends to want to
ignore the magic they don't

6772
02:15:05,330 --> 02:15:05,340
ignore the magic they don't
 

6773
02:15:05,340 --> 02:15:08,390
ignore the magic they don't
notice the magic anyway the Google AI

6774
02:15:08,390 --> 02:15:08,400
notice the magic anyway the Google AI
 

6775
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:14,089
notice the magic anyway the Google AI
engineer uh believes that uh the Lambda

6776
02:15:14,089 --> 02:15:14,099
engineer uh believes that uh the Lambda
 

6777
02:15:14,099 --> 02:15:17,209
engineer uh believes that uh the Lambda
1 language

6778
02:15:17,209 --> 02:15:17,219
1 language
 

6779
02:15:17,219 --> 02:15:18,910
1 language
natural language system

6780
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:18,920
natural language system
 

6781
02:15:18,920 --> 02:15:21,169
natural language system
achieved sentience I don't know if you

6782
02:15:21,169 --> 02:15:21,179
achieved sentience I don't know if you
 

6783
02:15:21,179 --> 02:15:23,089
achieved sentience I don't know if you
paid attention to that I didn't you

6784
02:15:23,089 --> 02:15:23,099
paid attention to that I didn't you
 

6785
02:15:23,099 --> 02:15:26,290
paid attention to that I didn't you
didn't but the the general question is

6786
02:15:26,290 --> 02:15:26,300
didn't but the the general question is
 

6787
02:15:26,300 --> 02:15:28,850
didn't but the the general question is
do you think a chatbot do you think a

6788
02:15:28,850 --> 02:15:28,860
do you think a chatbot do you think a
 

6789
02:15:28,860 --> 02:15:31,010
do you think a chatbot do you think a
robot could be conscious

6790
02:15:31,010 --> 02:15:31,020
robot could be conscious
 

6791
02:15:31,020 --> 02:15:33,229
robot could be conscious
so I mean this answer is slightly

6792
02:15:33,229 --> 02:15:33,239
so I mean this answer is slightly
 

6793
02:15:33,239 --> 02:15:35,450
so I mean this answer is slightly
different or very different depending on

6794
02:15:35,450 --> 02:15:35,460
different or very different depending on
 

6795
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,790
different or very different depending on
whether I kind of follow the assumption

6796
02:15:37,790 --> 02:15:37,800
whether I kind of follow the assumption
 

6797
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:40,729
whether I kind of follow the assumption
that Consciousness emerges at some point

6798
02:15:40,729 --> 02:15:40,739
that Consciousness emerges at some point
 

6799
02:15:40,739 --> 02:15:42,890
that Consciousness emerges at some point
in physical processing or whether it's

6800
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:42,900
in physical processing or whether it's
 

6801
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,750
in physical processing or whether it's
fundamental

6802
02:15:44,750 --> 02:15:44,760
fundamental
 

6803
02:15:44,760 --> 02:15:48,109
fundamental
um since I've just chosen to stay on the

6804
02:15:48,109 --> 02:15:48,119
um since I've just chosen to stay on the
 

6805
02:15:48,119 --> 02:15:50,689
um since I've just chosen to stay on the
fundamental Channel

6806
02:15:50,689 --> 02:15:50,699
fundamental Channel
 

6807
02:15:50,699 --> 02:15:51,350
fundamental Channel
um

6808
02:15:51,350 --> 02:15:51,360
um
 

6809
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,229
um
I mean then then it's kind of a silly

6810
02:15:54,229 --> 02:15:54,239
I mean then then it's kind of a silly
 

6811
02:15:54,239 --> 02:15:55,970
I mean then then it's kind of a silly
answer because if Consciousness is

6812
02:15:55,970 --> 02:15:55,980
answer because if Consciousness is
 

6813
02:15:55,980 --> 02:15:58,189
answer because if Consciousness is
fundamental in in the way I currently

6814
02:15:58,189 --> 02:15:58,199
fundamental in in the way I currently
 

6815
02:15:58,199 --> 02:16:01,010
fundamental in in the way I currently
think about it the only way I imagine it

6816
02:16:01,010 --> 02:16:01,020
think about it the only way I imagine it
 

6817
02:16:01,020 --> 02:16:02,629
think about it the only way I imagine it
working

6818
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
working
 

6819
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:04,209
working
um

6820
02:16:04,209 --> 02:16:04,219
um
 

6821
02:16:04,219 --> 02:16:08,990
um
every physical thing we perceive is the

6822
02:16:08,990 --> 02:16:09,000
every physical thing we perceive is the
 

6823
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,910
every physical thing we perceive is the
representation of a conscious experience

6824
02:16:10,910 --> 02:16:10,920
representation of a conscious experience
 

6825
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,850
representation of a conscious experience
so I mean yes that's true true of

6826
02:16:13,850 --> 02:16:13,860
so I mean yes that's true true of
 

6827
02:16:13,860 --> 02:16:15,350
so I mean yes that's true true of
everything in the world

6828
02:16:15,350 --> 02:16:15,360
everything in the world
 

6829
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,209
everything in the world
um however I would say if that's the

6830
02:16:17,209 --> 02:16:17,219
um however I would say if that's the
 

6831
02:16:17,219 --> 02:16:19,669
um however I would say if that's the
case

6832
02:16:19,669 --> 02:16:19,679

 

6833
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:22,550

even though there's a way in which it's

6834
02:16:22,550 --> 02:16:22,560
even though there's a way in which it's
 

6835
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,709
even though there's a way in which it's
behaving in similar ways to a human

6836
02:16:24,709 --> 02:16:24,719
behaving in similar ways to a human
 

6837
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:25,490
behaving in similar ways to a human
being

6838
02:16:25,490 --> 02:16:25,500
being
 

6839
02:16:25,500 --> 02:16:28,550
being
the way it's constructed what it is

6840
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:28,560
the way it's constructed what it is
 

6841
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,129
the way it's constructed what it is
actually made of and the physics of it

6842
02:16:31,129 --> 02:16:31,139
actually made of and the physics of it
 

6843
02:16:31,139 --> 02:16:34,009
actually made of and the physics of it
is so different that I would expect it

6844
02:16:34,009 --> 02:16:34,019
is so different that I would expect it
 

6845
02:16:34,019 --> 02:16:35,690
is so different that I would expect it
to have

6846
02:16:35,690 --> 02:16:35,700
to have
 

6847
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:38,870
to have
an entirely completely non-human

6848
02:16:38,870 --> 02:16:38,880
an entirely completely non-human
 

6849
02:16:38,880 --> 02:16:40,610
an entirely completely non-human
conscious experience

6850
02:16:40,610 --> 02:16:40,620
conscious experience
 

6851
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:44,570
conscious experience
and whether it even feels like a self I

6852
02:16:44,570 --> 02:16:44,580
and whether it even feels like a self I
 

6853
02:16:44,580 --> 02:16:46,250
and whether it even feels like a self I
think would be

6854
02:16:46,250 --> 02:16:46,260
think would be
 

6855
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:48,349
think would be
a big question mark well there's

6856
02:16:48,349 --> 02:16:48,359
a big question mark well there's
 

6857
02:16:48,359 --> 02:16:51,230
a big question mark well there's
questions of ethics and yeah is it

6858
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:51,240
questions of ethics and yeah is it
 

6859
02:16:51,240 --> 02:16:54,250
questions of ethics and yeah is it
capable of suffering is suffering

6860
02:16:54,250 --> 02:16:54,260
capable of suffering is suffering
 

6861
02:16:54,260 --> 02:16:57,469
capable of suffering is suffering
connected to Consciousness Consciousness

6862
02:16:57,469 --> 02:16:57,479
connected to Consciousness Consciousness
 

6863
02:16:57,479 --> 02:16:59,629
connected to Consciousness Consciousness
I mean obviously it is it's the it's the

6864
02:16:59,629 --> 02:16:59,639
I mean obviously it is it's the it's the
 

6865
02:16:59,639 --> 02:17:01,270
I mean obviously it is it's the it's the
only way you can suffer is

6866
02:17:01,270 --> 02:17:01,280
only way you can suffer is
 

6867
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:03,830
only way you can suffer is
well maybe maybe it's not maybe it's not

6868
02:17:03,830 --> 02:17:03,840
well maybe maybe it's not maybe it's not
 

6869
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:08,169
well maybe maybe it's not maybe it's not
maybe it's more connected to self

6870
02:17:08,169 --> 02:17:08,179

 

6871
02:17:08,179 --> 02:17:11,750

I would say I mean just on my own use of

6872
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:11,760
I would say I mean just on my own use of
 

6873
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,450
I would say I mean just on my own use of
these words suffering is only something

6874
02:17:14,450 --> 02:17:14,460
these words suffering is only something
 

6875
02:17:14,460 --> 02:17:16,190
these words suffering is only something
that can happen in a conscious

6876
02:17:16,190 --> 02:17:16,200
that can happen in a conscious
 

6877
02:17:16,200 --> 02:17:19,610
that can happen in a conscious
experience right so can robots suffer

6878
02:17:19,610 --> 02:17:19,620
experience right so can robots suffer
 

6879
02:17:19,620 --> 02:17:22,070
experience right so can robots suffer
if they have a car anything that has a

6880
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:22,080
if they have a car anything that has a
 

6881
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,770
if they have a car anything that has a
conscious experience can experience

6882
02:17:24,770 --> 02:17:24,780
conscious experience can experience
 

6883
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:29,030
conscious experience can experience
suffering but do plants suffer in the

6884
02:17:29,030 --> 02:17:29,040
suffering but do plants suffer in the
 

6885
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:31,669
suffering but do plants suffer in the
same so is there some level

6886
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:31,679
same so is there some level
 

6887
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:34,129
same so is there some level
where when we construct

6888
02:17:34,129 --> 02:17:34,139
where when we construct
 

6889
02:17:34,139 --> 02:17:36,849
where when we construct
our morals and ethics

6890
02:17:36,849 --> 02:17:36,859
our morals and ethics
 

6891
02:17:36,859 --> 02:17:41,089
our morals and ethics
that is there a class of conscious

6892
02:17:41,089 --> 02:17:41,099
that is there a class of conscious
 

6893
02:17:41,099 --> 02:17:43,549
that is there a class of conscious
experiences or organisms that are

6894
02:17:43,549 --> 02:17:43,559
experiences or organisms that are
 

6895
02:17:43,559 --> 02:17:45,589
experiences or organisms that are
capable of conscious experience

6896
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
capable of conscious experience
 

6897
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:47,690
capable of conscious experience
that we can anthropomorphize

6898
02:17:47,690 --> 02:17:47,700
that we can anthropomorphize
 

6899
02:17:47,700 --> 02:17:49,549
that we can anthropomorphize
sufficiently such that we give them

6900
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:49,559
sufficiently such that we give them
 

6901
02:17:49,559 --> 02:17:51,530
sufficiently such that we give them
rights

6902
02:17:51,530 --> 02:17:51,540
rights
 

6903
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:54,889
rights
yeah I mean this is not an area

6904
02:17:54,889 --> 02:17:54,899
yeah I mean this is not an area
 

6905
02:17:54,899 --> 02:17:58,450
yeah I mean this is not an area
that for physics I have spent for me

6906
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:58,460
that for physics I have spent for me
 

6907
02:17:58,460 --> 02:18:01,250
that for physics I have spent for me
I have not spent a lot of time thinking

6908
02:18:01,250 --> 02:18:01,260
I have not spent a lot of time thinking
 

6909
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:03,530
I have not spent a lot of time thinking
about this most people expect that I

6910
02:18:03,530 --> 02:18:03,540
about this most people expect that I
 

6911
02:18:03,540 --> 02:18:05,570
about this most people expect that I
have it's interesting these types of

6912
02:18:05,570 --> 02:18:05,580
have it's interesting these types of
 

6913
02:18:05,580 --> 02:18:07,669
have it's interesting these types of
questions are much less interesting to

6914
02:18:07,669 --> 02:18:07,679
questions are much less interesting to
 

6915
02:18:07,679 --> 02:18:09,410
questions are much less interesting to
me than the other questions and I think

6916
02:18:09,410 --> 02:18:09,420
me than the other questions and I think
 

6917
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:11,690
me than the other questions and I think
it's because I'm interested in the

6918
02:18:11,690 --> 02:18:11,700
it's because I'm interested in the
 

6919
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:14,030
it's because I'm interested in the
physics of things sure I'm I'm somewhat

6920
02:18:14,030 --> 02:18:14,040
physics of things sure I'm I'm somewhat
 

6921
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:15,709
physics of things sure I'm I'm somewhat
interested I'm definitely interested in

6922
02:18:15,709 --> 02:18:15,719
interested I'm definitely interested in
 

6923
02:18:15,719 --> 02:18:18,469
interested I'm definitely interested in
in ethical questions for human beings

6924
02:18:18,469 --> 02:18:18,479
in ethical questions for human beings
 

6925
02:18:18,479 --> 02:18:20,810
in ethical questions for human beings
but I have spent very little time

6926
02:18:20,810 --> 02:18:20,820
but I have spent very little time
 

6927
02:18:20,820 --> 02:18:22,730
but I have spent very little time
thinking about the implications for

6928
02:18:22,730 --> 02:18:22,740
thinking about the implications for
 

6929
02:18:22,740 --> 02:18:25,370
thinking about the implications for
other types of intelligence

6930
02:18:25,370 --> 02:18:25,380
other types of intelligence
 

6931
02:18:25,380 --> 02:18:28,849
other types of intelligence
um I will say that I think the capacity

6932
02:18:28,849 --> 02:18:28,859
um I will say that I think the capacity
 

6933
02:18:28,859 --> 02:18:30,589
um I will say that I think the capacity
for suffering

6934
02:18:30,589 --> 02:18:30,599
for suffering
 

6935
02:18:30,599 --> 02:18:34,490
for suffering
of con of the capacity for suffering of

6936
02:18:34,490 --> 02:18:34,500
of con of the capacity for suffering of
 

6937
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:37,549
of con of the capacity for suffering of
a of a conscious system

6938
02:18:37,549 --> 02:18:37,559
a of a conscious system
 

6939
02:18:37,559 --> 02:18:42,049
a of a conscious system
um goes up with memory and with a sense

6940
02:18:42,049 --> 02:18:42,059
um goes up with memory and with a sense
 

6941
02:18:42,059 --> 02:18:43,790
um goes up with memory and with a sense
of self

6942
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:43,800
of self
 

6943
02:18:43,800 --> 02:18:46,610
of self
so if you take if

6944
02:18:46,610 --> 02:18:46,620
so if you take if
 

6945
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:49,509
so if you take if
if anesthesia only erased your memory

6946
02:18:49,509 --> 02:18:49,519
if anesthesia only erased your memory
 

6947
02:18:49,519 --> 02:18:52,429
if anesthesia only erased your memory
and it didn't actually make you

6948
02:18:52,429 --> 02:18:52,439
and it didn't actually make you
 

6949
02:18:52,439 --> 02:18:55,250
and it didn't actually make you
unconscious you actually experienced

6950
02:18:55,250 --> 02:18:55,260
unconscious you actually experienced
 

6951
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,530
unconscious you actually experienced
horrifically experienced some surgical

6952
02:18:57,530 --> 02:18:57,540
horrifically experienced some surgical
 

6953
02:18:57,540 --> 02:19:00,110
horrifically experienced some surgical
procedure but we could completely wipe

6954
02:19:00,110 --> 02:19:00,120
procedure but we could completely wipe
 

6955
02:19:00,120 --> 02:19:01,790
procedure but we could completely wipe
out your memory of it

6956
02:19:01,790 --> 02:19:01,800
out your memory of it
 

6957
02:19:01,800 --> 02:19:03,310
out your memory of it
as

6958
02:19:03,310 --> 02:19:03,320
as
 

6959
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:05,570
as
nightmarishes that scenario scenario is

6960
02:19:05,570 --> 02:19:05,580
nightmarishes that scenario scenario is
 

6961
02:19:05,580 --> 02:19:07,610
nightmarishes that scenario scenario is
and I'm not suggesting we should ever do

6962
02:19:07,610 --> 02:19:07,620
and I'm not suggesting we should ever do
 

6963
02:19:07,620 --> 02:19:10,129
and I'm not suggesting we should ever do
this I would say

6964
02:19:10,129 --> 02:19:10,139
this I would say
 

6965
02:19:10,139 --> 02:19:12,349
this I would say
if our only option were to erase your

6966
02:19:12,349 --> 02:19:12,359
if our only option were to erase your
 

6967
02:19:12,359 --> 02:19:14,810
if our only option were to erase your
memory of it that would be the more

6968
02:19:14,810 --> 02:19:14,820
memory of it that would be the more
 

6969
02:19:14,820 --> 02:19:18,049
memory of it that would be the more
ethical thing to do than

6970
02:19:18,049 --> 02:19:18,059
ethical thing to do than
 

6971
02:19:18,059 --> 02:19:20,450
ethical thing to do than
to have you maintain that memory because

6972
02:19:20,450 --> 02:19:20,460
to have you maintain that memory because
 

6973
02:19:20,460 --> 02:19:24,650
to have you maintain that memory because
the suffering is then carried

6974
02:19:24,650 --> 02:19:24,660

 

6975
02:19:24,660 --> 02:19:27,709

across a longer distance through time

6976
02:19:27,709 --> 02:19:27,719
across a longer distance through time
 

6977
02:19:27,719 --> 02:19:29,629
across a longer distance through time
that's presuming that suffering is

6978
02:19:29,629 --> 02:19:29,639
that's presuming that suffering is
 

6979
02:19:29,639 --> 02:19:31,490
that's presuming that suffering is
unethical

6980
02:19:31,490 --> 02:19:31,500
unethical
 

6981
02:19:31,500 --> 02:19:33,049
unethical
well isn't that what ethics is all about

6982
02:19:33,049 --> 02:19:33,059
well isn't that what ethics is all about
 

6983
02:19:33,059 --> 02:19:35,270
well isn't that what ethics is all about
it's about suffering

6984
02:19:35,270 --> 02:19:35,280
it's about suffering
 

6985
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:37,610
it's about suffering
I mean I think to me ethics is all about

6986
02:19:37,610 --> 02:19:37,620
I mean I think to me ethics is all about
 

6987
02:19:37,620 --> 02:19:39,950
I mean I think to me ethics is all about
suffering and well-being and I don't

6988
02:19:39,950 --> 02:19:39,960
suffering and well-being and I don't
 

6989
02:19:39,960 --> 02:19:42,410
suffering and well-being and I don't
know what ethics is without that uh

6990
02:19:42,410 --> 02:19:42,420
know what ethics is without that uh
 

6991
02:19:42,420 --> 02:19:43,730
know what ethics is without that uh
there's different measures of suffering

6992
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:43,740
there's different measures of suffering
 

6993
02:19:43,740 --> 02:19:47,509
there's different measures of suffering
so having one traumatic event May if you

6994
02:19:47,509 --> 02:19:47,519
so having one traumatic event May if you
 

6995
02:19:47,519 --> 02:19:49,130
so having one traumatic event May if you
erase that one traumatic event that

6996
02:19:49,130 --> 02:19:49,140
erase that one traumatic event that
 

6997
02:19:49,140 --> 02:19:51,469
erase that one traumatic event that
potentially might have

6998
02:19:51,469 --> 02:19:51,479
potentially might have
 

6999
02:19:51,479 --> 02:19:54,530
potentially might have
um negative on net consequences for the

7000
02:19:54,530 --> 02:19:54,540
um negative on net consequences for the
 

7001
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,630
um negative on net consequences for the
growth so that yeah so then it's a

7002
02:19:56,630 --> 02:19:56,640
growth so that yeah so then it's a
 

7003
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:57,889
growth so that yeah so then it's a
different it's a different question but

7004
02:19:57,889 --> 02:19:57,899
different it's a different question but
 

7005
02:19:57,899 --> 02:19:58,730
different it's a different question but
I would

7006
02:19:58,730 --> 02:19:58,740
I would
 

7007
02:19:58,740 --> 02:20:04,610
I would
say that memory increases suffering

7008
02:20:04,610 --> 02:20:04,620
say that memory increases suffering
 

7009
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:06,410
say that memory increases suffering
globally

7010
02:20:06,410 --> 02:20:06,420
globally
 

7011
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:10,550
globally
so that if any moment of suffering

7012
02:20:10,550 --> 02:20:10,560
so that if any moment of suffering
 

7013
02:20:10,560 --> 02:20:13,130
so that if any moment of suffering
only existed for itself in the present

7014
02:20:13,130 --> 02:20:13,140
only existed for itself in the present
 

7015
02:20:13,140 --> 02:20:15,490
only existed for itself in the present
moment

7016
02:20:15,490 --> 02:20:15,500
moment
 

7017
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:19,010
moment
that is a lesser kind of suffering

7018
02:20:19,010 --> 02:20:19,020
that is a lesser kind of suffering
 

7019
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:20,570
that is a lesser kind of suffering
than

7020
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:20,580
than
 

7021
02:20:20,580 --> 02:20:22,730
than
a suffering that is drawn out over time

7022
02:20:22,730 --> 02:20:22,740
a suffering that is drawn out over time
 

7023
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:25,250
a suffering that is drawn out over time
through memory so hard to think about

7024
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:25,260
through memory so hard to think about
 

7025
02:20:25,260 --> 02:20:28,670
through memory so hard to think about
and so yeah I mean in terms of AI

7026
02:20:28,670 --> 02:20:28,680
and so yeah I mean in terms of AI
 

7027
02:20:28,680 --> 02:20:30,830
and so yeah I mean in terms of AI
if they're conscious and there's a sense

7028
02:20:30,830 --> 02:20:30,840
if they're conscious and there's a sense
 

7029
02:20:30,840 --> 02:20:33,170
if they're conscious and there's a sense
of self and memory which I think I

7030
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:33,180
of self and memory which I think I
 

7031
02:20:33,180 --> 02:20:35,330
of self and memory which I think I
actually think you need memory to have a

7032
02:20:35,330 --> 02:20:35,340
actually think you need memory to have a
 

7033
02:20:35,340 --> 02:20:37,310
actually think you need memory to have a
sense of self

7034
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:37,320
sense of self
 

7035
02:20:37,320 --> 02:20:39,410
sense of self
um actually sorry I take that back I

7036
02:20:39,410 --> 02:20:39,420
um actually sorry I take that back I
 

7037
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:41,030
um actually sorry I take that back I
actually think you can have a really

7038
02:20:41,030 --> 02:20:41,040
actually think you can have a really
 

7039
02:20:41,040 --> 02:20:44,330
actually think you can have a really
primitive sense of self without memory

7040
02:20:44,330 --> 02:20:44,340
primitive sense of self without memory
 

7041
02:20:44,340 --> 02:20:47,809
primitive sense of self without memory
um but an AI that is conscious that has

7042
02:20:47,809 --> 02:20:47,819
um but an AI that is conscious that has
 

7043
02:20:47,819 --> 02:20:50,990
um but an AI that is conscious that has
memory and a sense of self

7044
02:20:50,990 --> 02:20:51,000
memory and a sense of self
 

7045
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,809
memory and a sense of self
um yeah that's capable of suffering

7046
02:20:53,809 --> 02:20:53,819
um yeah that's capable of suffering
 

7047
02:20:53,819 --> 02:20:55,610
um yeah that's capable of suffering
absolutely well one of the things

7048
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:55,620
absolutely well one of the things
 

7049
02:20:55,620 --> 02:20:56,570
absolutely well one of the things
because

7050
02:20:56,570 --> 02:20:56,580
because
 

7051
02:20:56,580 --> 02:20:58,370
because
you said you haven't really looked into

7052
02:20:58,370 --> 02:20:58,380
you said you haven't really looked into
 

7053
02:20:58,380 --> 02:21:00,650
you said you haven't really looked into
this area

7054
02:21:00,650 --> 02:21:00,660
this area
 

7055
02:21:00,660 --> 02:21:02,870
this area
um because there's so many interesting

7056
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:02,880
um because there's so many interesting
 

7057
02:21:02,880 --> 02:21:04,190
um because there's so many interesting
things to look into and you're really

7058
02:21:04,190 --> 02:21:04,200
things to look into and you're really
 

7059
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:06,710
things to look into and you're really
focused on the physics side to me the

7060
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:06,720
focused on the physics side to me the
 

7061
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:08,929
focused on the physics side to me the
the the Neuroscience experiments that

7062
02:21:08,929 --> 02:21:08,939
the the Neuroscience experiments that
 

7063
02:21:08,939 --> 02:21:10,429
the the Neuroscience experiments that
you mentioned where there's a difference

7064
02:21:10,429 --> 02:21:10,439
you mentioned where there's a difference
 

7065
02:21:10,439 --> 02:21:12,230
you mentioned where there's a difference
between the timing of things that kind

7066
02:21:12,230 --> 02:21:12,240
between the timing of things that kind
 

7067
02:21:12,240 --> 02:21:14,270
between the timing of things that kind
of reveal there's something here yeah to

7068
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:14,280
of reveal there's something here yeah to
 

7069
02:21:14,280 --> 02:21:16,910
of reveal there's something here yeah to
me working with robots I have robots

7070
02:21:16,910 --> 02:21:16,920
me working with robots I have robots
 

7071
02:21:16,920 --> 02:21:19,790
me working with robots I have robots
that are moving around my home in in

7072
02:21:19,790 --> 02:21:19,800
that are moving around my home in in
 

7073
02:21:19,800 --> 02:21:24,670
that are moving around my home in in
Austin I know I it's a very good

7074
02:21:24,670 --> 02:21:24,680
Austin I know I it's a very good
 

7075
02:21:24,680 --> 02:21:27,590
Austin I know I it's a very good
embodied thought experiment but here's

7076
02:21:27,590 --> 02:21:27,600
embodied thought experiment but here's
 

7077
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:28,429
embodied thought experiment but here's
the thing

7078
02:21:28,429 --> 02:21:28,439
the thing
 

7079
02:21:28,439 --> 02:21:30,889
the thing
that

7080
02:21:30,889 --> 02:21:30,899
that
 

7081
02:21:30,899 --> 02:21:34,190
that
looks like he has a free will

7082
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:34,200
looks like he has a free will
 

7083
02:21:34,200 --> 02:21:36,410
looks like he has a free will
it it looks like it has conscious

7084
02:21:36,410 --> 02:21:36,420
it it looks like it has conscious
 

7085
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:37,550
it it looks like it has conscious
experiences

7086
02:21:37,550 --> 02:21:37,560
experiences
 

7087
02:21:37,560 --> 02:21:39,530
experiences
and uh and then I know how it's

7088
02:21:39,530 --> 02:21:39,540
and uh and then I know how it's
 

7089
02:21:39,540 --> 02:21:42,170
and uh and then I know how it's
programmed and so like I have to go back

7090
02:21:42,170 --> 02:21:42,180
programmed and so like I have to go back
 

7091
02:21:42,180 --> 02:21:43,610
programmed and so like I have to go back
and forth

7092
02:21:43,610 --> 02:21:43,620
and forth
 

7093
02:21:43,620 --> 02:21:47,230
and forth
and it's you know this is what I do

7094
02:21:47,230 --> 02:21:47,240
and it's you know this is what I do
 

7095
02:21:47,240 --> 02:21:49,490
and it's you know this is what I do
you lay on the ground looking up at the

7096
02:21:49,490 --> 02:21:49,500
you lay on the ground looking up at the
 

7097
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:52,190
you lay on the ground looking up at the
stars thinking about plants and I and I

7098
02:21:52,190 --> 02:21:52,200
stars thinking about plants and I and I
 

7099
02:21:52,200 --> 02:21:54,469
stars thinking about plants and I and I
look at like a robot like well you can

7100
02:21:54,469 --> 02:21:54,479
look at like a robot like well you can
 

7101
02:21:54,479 --> 02:21:55,910
look at like a robot like well you can
do this with plants too I mean there's

7102
02:21:55,910 --> 02:21:55,920
do this with plants too I mean there's
 

7103
02:21:55,920 --> 02:21:59,690
do this with plants too I mean there's
some complex enough behavior that looks

7104
02:21:59,690 --> 02:21:59,700
some complex enough behavior that looks
 

7105
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:02,210
some complex enough behavior that looks
like Free Will from a certain angle and

7106
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:02,220
like Free Will from a certain angle and
 

7107
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:04,130
like Free Will from a certain angle and
it makes you wonder it makes you wonder

7108
02:22:04,130 --> 02:22:04,140
it makes you wonder it makes you wonder
 

7109
02:22:04,140 --> 02:22:06,710
it makes you wonder it makes you wonder
two things one is there Consciousness

7110
02:22:06,710 --> 02:22:06,720
two things one is there Consciousness
 

7111
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:09,889
two things one is there Consciousness
associated with that processing

7112
02:22:09,889 --> 02:22:09,899
associated with that processing
 

7113
02:22:09,899 --> 02:22:13,969
associated with that processing
um and two if there isn't

7114
02:22:13,969 --> 02:22:13,979

 

7115
02:22:13,979 --> 02:22:17,270

what does that say about our experience

7116
02:22:17,270 --> 02:22:17,280
what does that say about our experience
 

7117
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:20,570
what does that say about our experience
and

7118
02:22:20,570 --> 02:22:20,580

 

7119
02:22:20,580 --> 02:22:23,570

both are our circumstance in nature what

7120
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:23,580
both are our circumstance in nature what
 

7121
02:22:23,580 --> 02:22:25,670
both are our circumstance in nature what
does that say yeah

7122
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:25,680
does that say yeah
 

7123
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,349
does that say yeah
um but yeah I do I do that with plants

7124
02:22:27,349 --> 02:22:27,359
um but yeah I do I do that with plants
 

7125
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:29,750
um but yeah I do I do that with plants
all the time I go back and forth but the

7126
02:22:29,750 --> 02:22:29,760
all the time I go back and forth but the
 

7127
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:32,570
all the time I go back and forth but the
zombie thought experiment now

7128
02:22:32,570 --> 02:22:32,580
zombie thought experiment now
 

7129
02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:35,150
zombie thought experiment now
um at least for me is often presented as

7130
02:22:35,150 --> 02:22:35,160
um at least for me is often presented as
 

7131
02:22:35,160 --> 02:22:37,610
um at least for me is often presented as
AI because now that's easier as a robot

7132
02:22:37,610 --> 02:22:37,620
AI because now that's easier as a robot
 

7133
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:40,550
AI because now that's easier as a robot
because that's easier

7134
02:22:40,550 --> 02:22:40,560
because that's easier
 

7135
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:41,630
because that's easier
um

7136
02:22:41,630 --> 02:22:41,640
um
 

7137
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:43,130
um
I don't know if it's just because it's

7138
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:43,140
I don't know if it's just because it's
 

7139
02:22:43,140 --> 02:22:45,530
I don't know if it's just because it's
in it's in pop culture now in the form

7140
02:22:45,530 --> 02:22:45,540
in it's in pop culture now in the form
 

7141
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:47,330
in it's in pop culture now in the form
of films and television shows but it's

7142
02:22:47,330 --> 02:22:47,340
of films and television shows but it's
 

7143
02:22:47,340 --> 02:22:48,710
of films and television shows but it's
it's easier

7144
02:22:48,710 --> 02:22:48,720
it's easier
 

7145
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:49,630
it's easier
to

7146
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:49,640
to
 

7147
02:22:49,640 --> 02:22:54,410
to
get to that point of um contemplation I

7148
02:22:54,410 --> 02:22:54,420
get to that point of um contemplation I
 

7149
02:22:54,420 --> 02:22:57,110
get to that point of um contemplation I
think by imagining

7150
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:57,120
think by imagining
 

7151
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:00,050
think by imagining
a robot I don't know why exactly I'm

7152
02:23:00,050 --> 02:23:00,060
a robot I don't know why exactly I'm
 

7153
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:01,969
a robot I don't know why exactly I'm
bothered by philosophers talking about

7154
02:23:01,969 --> 02:23:01,979
bothered by philosophers talking about
 

7155
02:23:01,979 --> 02:23:03,170
bothered by philosophers talking about
zombies

7156
02:23:03,170 --> 02:23:03,180
zombies
 

7157
02:23:03,180 --> 02:23:05,090
zombies
because

7158
02:23:05,090 --> 02:23:05,100
because
 

7159
02:23:05,100 --> 02:23:07,130
because
it feels like they're missing it's like

7160
02:23:07,130 --> 02:23:07,140
it feels like they're missing it's like
 

7161

it feels like they're missing it's like
talking about

7162
02:23:09,590 --> 02:23:09,600
talking about
 

7163
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:11,690
talking about
it's reducing

7164
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:11,700
it's reducing
 

7165
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:16,309
it's reducing
a a joyful experience so like uh

7166
02:23:16,309 --> 02:23:16,319
a a joyful experience so like uh
 

7167
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:18,889
a a joyful experience so like uh
that's like talking about listen when

7168
02:23:18,889 --> 02:23:18,899
that's like talking about listen when
 

7169
02:23:18,899 --> 02:23:20,690
that's like talking about listen when
you fall in love with somebody yeah the

7170
02:23:20,690 --> 02:23:20,700
you fall in love with somebody yeah the
 

7171
02:23:20,700 --> 02:23:22,550
you fall in love with somebody yeah the
other person is a zombie you don't you

7172
02:23:22,550 --> 02:23:22,560
other person is a zombie you don't you
 

7173
02:23:22,560 --> 02:23:23,750
other person is a zombie you don't you
don't know if they're conscious or not

7174
02:23:23,750 --> 02:23:23,760
don't know if they're conscious or not
 

7175
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:25,250
don't know if they're conscious or not
you're just making presumptions and so

7176
02:23:25,250 --> 02:23:25,260
you're just making presumptions and so
 

7177
02:23:25,260 --> 02:23:27,650
you're just making presumptions and so
on it's like it says philosophers will

7178
02:23:27,650 --> 02:23:27,660
on it's like it says philosophers will
 

7179
02:23:27,660 --> 02:23:29,450
on it's like it says philosophers will
do this kind of things they might as

7180
02:23:29,450 --> 02:23:29,460
do this kind of things they might as
 

7181
02:23:29,460 --> 02:23:31,190
do this kind of things they might as
well be a zombie or you know there's no

7182
02:23:31,190 --> 02:23:31,200
well be a zombie or you know there's no
 

7183
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:34,070
well be a zombie or you know there's no
such thing as love it's just a mutual

7184
02:23:34,070 --> 02:23:34,080
such thing as love it's just a mutual
 

7185
02:23:34,080 --> 02:23:36,050
such thing as love it's just a mutual
Catholic Economist will reduce love to

7186
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:36,060
Catholic Economist will reduce love to
 

7187
02:23:36,060 --> 02:23:37,910
Catholic Economist will reduce love to
some kind of mutual calculation that

7188
02:23:37,910 --> 02:23:37,920
some kind of mutual calculation that
 

7189
02:23:37,920 --> 02:23:40,309
some kind of mutual calculation that
minimizes risk and stability over time

7190
02:23:40,309 --> 02:23:40,319
minimizes risk and stability over time
 

7191
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:43,610
minimizes risk and stability over time
right it's like all right what I want to

7192
02:23:43,610 --> 02:23:43,620
right it's like all right what I want to
 

7193
02:23:43,620 --> 02:23:46,670
right it's like all right what I want to
do with each of those people yeah is I

7194
02:23:46,670 --> 02:23:46,680
do with each of those people yeah is I
 

7195
02:23:46,680 --> 02:23:48,230
do with each of those people yeah is I
want to take I want to find every one of

7196
02:23:48,230 --> 02:23:48,240
want to take I want to find every one of
 

7197
02:23:48,240 --> 02:23:50,210
want to take I want to find every one of
those philosophers to talk about zombies

7198
02:23:50,210 --> 02:23:50,220
those philosophers to talk about zombies
 

7199
02:23:50,220 --> 02:23:52,130
those philosophers to talk about zombies
and eventually give them one of those

7200
02:23:52,130 --> 02:23:52,140
and eventually give them one of those
 

7201
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:54,650
and eventually give them one of those
robots and watch them fall in love and

7202
02:23:54,650 --> 02:23:54,660
robots and watch them fall in love and
 

7203
02:23:54,660 --> 02:23:56,690
robots and watch them fall in love and
then and see right how their

7204
02:23:56,690 --> 02:23:56,700
then and see right how their
 

7205
02:23:56,700 --> 02:24:00,230
then and see right how their
understanding of how humbled they are by

7206
02:24:00,230 --> 02:24:00,240
understanding of how humbled they are by
 

7207
02:24:00,240 --> 02:24:03,050
understanding of how humbled they are by
how little we understand that's the

7208
02:24:03,050 --> 02:24:03,060
how little we understand that's the
 

7209
02:24:03,060 --> 02:24:04,370
how little we understand that's the
point of the zombie experiment I mean

7210
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:04,380
point of the zombie experiment I mean
 

7211
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:06,230
point of the zombie experiment I mean
sure maybe the zombie God experience

7212
02:24:06,230 --> 02:24:06,240
sure maybe the zombie God experience
 

7213
02:24:06,240 --> 02:24:09,170
sure maybe the zombie God experience
that I mean I I can't think of zombies

7214
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:09,180
that I mean I I can't think of zombies
 

7215
02:24:09,180 --> 02:24:11,570
that I mean I I can't think of zombies
is that the thought is that no so for me

7216
02:24:11,570 --> 02:24:11,580
is that the thought is that no so for me
 

7217
02:24:11,580 --> 02:24:13,370
is that the thought is that no so for me
I mean I don't like spending much time

7218
02:24:13,370 --> 02:24:13,380
I mean I don't like spending much time
 

7219
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:15,469
I mean I don't like spending much time
on it I think it has limited use for

7220
02:24:15,469 --> 02:24:15,479
on it I think it has limited use for
 

7221
02:24:15,479 --> 02:24:17,570
on it I think it has limited use for
sure and I under understand your your

7222
02:24:17,570 --> 02:24:17,580
sure and I under understand your your
 

7223
02:24:17,580 --> 02:24:20,270
sure and I under understand your your
annoyance with it but for me what's so

7224
02:24:20,270 --> 02:24:20,280
annoyance with it but for me what's so
 

7225
02:24:20,280 --> 02:24:22,910
annoyance with it but for me what's so
useful about it is it gets you to ask

7226
02:24:22,910 --> 02:24:22,920
useful about it is it gets you to ask
 

7227
02:24:22,920 --> 02:24:24,889
useful about it is it gets you to ask
the same questions you're asking when

7228
02:24:24,889 --> 02:24:24,899
the same questions you're asking when
 

7229
02:24:24,899 --> 02:24:26,530
the same questions you're asking when
you're looking at robots

7230
02:24:26,530 --> 02:24:26,540
you're looking at robots
 

7231
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:29,270
you're looking at robots
if you just run the experiment and you

7232
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,280
if you just run the experiment and you
 

7233
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:31,190
if you just run the experiment and you
say okay you know I'm sitting here with

7234
02:24:31,190 --> 02:24:31,200
say okay you know I'm sitting here with
 

7235
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,010
say okay you know I'm sitting here with
Lex what if I try to trick myself

7236
02:24:34,010 --> 02:24:34,020
Lex what if I try to trick myself
 

7237
02:24:34,020 --> 02:24:37,070
Lex what if I try to trick myself
what's different about the world if

7238
02:24:37,070 --> 02:24:37,080
what's different about the world if
 

7239
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:39,950
what's different about the world if
someone tells me actually he's a robot

7240
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:39,960
someone tells me actually he's a robot
 

7241
02:24:39,960 --> 02:24:41,450
someone tells me actually he's a robot
is essentially what the zombie

7242
02:24:41,450 --> 02:24:41,460
is essentially what the zombie
 

7243
02:24:41,460 --> 02:24:43,849
is essentially what the zombie
experiment is he's over there he has no

7244
02:24:43,849 --> 02:24:43,859
experiment is he's over there he has no
 

7245
02:24:43,859 --> 02:24:45,349
experiment is he's over there he has no
conscious experience he's acting

7246
02:24:45,349 --> 02:24:45,359
conscious experience he's acting
 

7247
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:47,389
conscious experience he's acting
officias but there's no experience there

7248
02:24:47,389 --> 02:24:47,399
officias but there's no experience there
 

7249
02:24:47,399 --> 02:24:49,429
officias but there's no experience there
so it gets you to ask some interesting

7250
02:24:49,429 --> 02:24:49,439
so it gets you to ask some interesting
 

7251
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:50,990
so it gets you to ask some interesting
questions one is

7252
02:24:50,990 --> 02:24:51,000
questions one is
 

7253
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:53,150
questions one is
okay when it seems impossible I just

7254
02:24:53,150 --> 02:24:53,160
okay when it seems impossible I just
 

7255
02:24:53,160 --> 02:24:54,889
okay when it seems impossible I just
think no that's that makes no sense I I

7256
02:24:54,889 --> 02:24:54,899
think no that's that makes no sense I I
 

7257
02:24:54,899 --> 02:24:56,929
think no that's that makes no sense I I
can't I can't even imagine that okay

7258
02:24:56,929 --> 02:24:56,939
can't I can't even imagine that okay
 

7259
02:24:56,939 --> 02:24:59,330
can't I can't even imagine that okay
what do I think Consciousness is

7260
02:24:59,330 --> 02:24:59,340
what do I think Consciousness is
 

7261
02:24:59,340 --> 02:25:01,370
what do I think Consciousness is
responsible for what is consciousness

7262
02:25:01,370 --> 02:25:01,380
responsible for what is consciousness
 

7263
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:04,490
responsible for what is consciousness
doing in that in that human over there

7264
02:25:04,490 --> 02:25:04,500
doing in that in that human over there
 

7265
02:25:04,500 --> 02:25:08,389
doing in that in that human over there
that is Lex that I can't

7266
02:25:08,389 --> 02:25:08,399
that is Lex that I can't
 

7267
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:10,010
that is Lex that I can't
fathom

7268
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:10,020
fathom
 

7269
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:12,349
fathom
all of your behavior and everything that

7270
02:25:12,349 --> 02:25:12,359
all of your behavior and everything that
 

7271
02:25:12,359 --> 02:25:14,150
all of your behavior and everything that
you're you're doing and about without

7272
02:25:14,150 --> 02:25:14,160
you're you're doing and about without
 

7273
02:25:14,160 --> 02:25:15,830
you're you're doing and about without
Consciousness so it gets you to ask this

7274
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:15,840
Consciousness so it gets you to ask this
 

7275
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:17,150
Consciousness so it gets you to ask this
question and these are this is these are

7276
02:25:17,150 --> 02:25:17,160
question and these are this is these are
 

7277
02:25:17,160 --> 02:25:19,670
question and these are this is these are
the questions I begin my book with

7278
02:25:19,670 --> 02:25:19,680
the questions I begin my book with
 

7279
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:22,309
the questions I begin my book with
um what is consciousness doing it gets

7280
02:25:22,309 --> 02:25:22,319
um what is consciousness doing it gets
 

7281
02:25:22,319 --> 02:25:25,130
um what is consciousness doing it gets
you to ask that question in a deeper way

7282
02:25:25,130 --> 02:25:25,140
you to ask that question in a deeper way
 

7283
02:25:25,140 --> 02:25:27,170
you to ask that question in a deeper way
and then I kind of found this alternate

7284
02:25:27,170 --> 02:25:27,180
and then I kind of found this alternate
 

7285
02:25:27,180 --> 02:25:28,309
and then I kind of found this alternate
I don't know if other people have done

7286
02:25:28,309 --> 02:25:28,319
I don't know if other people have done
 

7287
02:25:28,319 --> 02:25:29,389
I don't know if other people have done
this but

7288
02:25:29,389 --> 02:25:29,399
this but
 

7289
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:31,490
this but
I found this alternate use for it which

7290
02:25:31,490 --> 02:25:31,500
I found this alternate use for it which
 

7291
02:25:31,500 --> 02:25:34,550
I found this alternate use for it which
is even more useful to me which is I'm

7292
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:34,560
is even more useful to me which is I'm
 

7293
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:37,010
is even more useful to me which is I'm
able to do it sometimes I'm able to just

7294
02:25:37,010 --> 02:25:37,020
able to do it sometimes I'm able to just
 

7295
02:25:37,020 --> 02:25:40,250
able to do it sometimes I'm able to just
sit with someone and and you know get my

7296
02:25:40,250 --> 02:25:40,260
sit with someone and and you know get my
 

7297
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:43,250
sit with someone and and you know get my
imagination going and imagine

7298
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:43,260
imagination going and imagine
 

7299
02:25:43,260 --> 02:25:45,290
imagination going and imagine
there really is no conscious experience

7300
02:25:45,290 --> 02:25:45,300
there really is no conscious experience
 

7301
02:25:45,300 --> 02:25:47,210
there really is no conscious experience
there in that person

7302
02:25:47,210 --> 02:25:47,220
there in that person
 

7303
02:25:47,220 --> 02:25:49,309
there in that person
and what happened for me the first few

7304
02:25:49,309 --> 02:25:49,319
and what happened for me the first few
 

7305
02:25:49,319 --> 02:25:51,710
and what happened for me the first few
times I was able to do this is it

7306
02:25:51,710 --> 02:25:51,720
times I was able to do this is it
 

7307
02:25:51,720 --> 02:25:55,070
times I was able to do this is it
reminded me exactly of how I feel when I

7308
02:25:55,070 --> 02:25:55,080
reminded me exactly of how I feel when I
 

7309
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:58,070
reminded me exactly of how I feel when I
look at complex plant behavior and other

7310
02:25:58,070 --> 02:25:58,080
look at complex plant behavior and other
 

7311
02:25:58,080 --> 02:26:00,230
look at complex plant behavior and other
behaviors in nature where I assume

7312
02:26:00,230 --> 02:26:00,240
behaviors in nature where I assume
 

7313
02:26:00,240 --> 02:26:02,630
behaviors in nature where I assume
there's no conscious experience

7314
02:26:02,630 --> 02:26:02,640
there's no conscious experience
 

7315
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:04,370
there's no conscious experience
and

7316
02:26:04,370 --> 02:26:04,380
and
 

7317
02:26:04,380 --> 02:26:06,230
and
to me it just flips everything it just

7318
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:06,240
to me it just flips everything it just
 

7319
02:26:06,240 --> 02:26:07,969
to me it just flips everything it just
flips everything on its head it just

7320
02:26:07,969 --> 02:26:07,979
flips everything on its head it just
 

7321
02:26:07,979 --> 02:26:10,429
flips everything on its head it just
gets you to be able it gets you to be

7322
02:26:10,429 --> 02:26:10,439
gets you to be able it gets you to be
 

7323
02:26:10,439 --> 02:26:12,770
gets you to be able it gets you to be
open to possibilities that you were

7324
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:12,780
open to possibilities that you were
 

7325
02:26:12,780 --> 02:26:15,290
open to possibilities that you were
closed to before and I think that's

7326
02:26:15,290 --> 02:26:15,300
closed to before and I think that's
 

7327
02:26:15,300 --> 02:26:19,429
closed to before and I think that's
useful does it enhance or

7328
02:26:19,429 --> 02:26:19,439
useful does it enhance or
 

7329
02:26:19,439 --> 02:26:20,330
useful does it enhance or
um

7330
02:26:20,330 --> 02:26:20,340
um
 

7331
02:26:20,340 --> 02:26:22,910
um
dissipate your capacity for love of

7332
02:26:22,910 --> 02:26:22,920
dissipate your capacity for love of
 

7333
02:26:22,920 --> 02:26:25,610
dissipate your capacity for love of
other human beings what role does Love

7334
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:25,620
other human beings what role does Love
 

7335
02:26:25,620 --> 02:26:28,270
other human beings what role does Love
play in The Human Condition

7336
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:28,280
play in The Human Condition
 

7337
02:26:28,280 --> 02:26:30,590
play in The Human Condition
I mean in so many ways it's the most

7338
02:26:30,590 --> 02:26:30,600
I mean in so many ways it's the most
 

7339
02:26:30,600 --> 02:26:31,910
I mean in so many ways it's the most
important role

7340
02:26:31,910 --> 02:26:31,920
important role
 

7341
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:38,389
important role
I don't think any of these realizations

7342
02:26:38,389 --> 02:26:38,399

 

7343
02:26:38,399 --> 02:26:40,849

I mean if if anything I think it

7344
02:26:40,849 --> 02:26:40,859
I mean if if anything I think it
 

7345
02:26:40,859 --> 02:26:44,690
I mean if if anything I think it
enhances it

7346
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:44,700

 

7347
02:26:44,700 --> 02:26:47,570

but I don't think they I mean it's it

7348
02:26:47,570 --> 02:26:47,580
but I don't think they I mean it's it
 

7349
02:26:47,580 --> 02:26:49,309
but I don't think they I mean it's it
kind of goes back to the levels of

7350
02:26:49,309 --> 02:26:49,319
kind of goes back to the levels of
 

7351
02:26:49,319 --> 02:26:50,389
kind of goes back to the levels of
usefulness

7352
02:26:50,389 --> 02:26:50,399
usefulness
 

7353
02:26:50,399 --> 02:26:52,250
usefulness
sometimes you want to picture your

7354
02:26:52,250 --> 02:26:52,260
sometimes you want to picture your
 

7355
02:26:52,260 --> 02:26:55,910
sometimes you want to picture your
friends as a plant it's helpful

7356
02:26:55,910 --> 02:26:55,920
friends as a plant it's helpful
 

7357
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:58,070
friends as a plant it's helpful
it's helpful to to appreciate the beauty

7358
02:26:58,070 --> 02:26:58,080
it's helpful to to appreciate the beauty
 

7359
02:26:58,080 --> 02:27:00,530
it's helpful to to appreciate the beauty
that they are as an organism yeah I mean

7360
02:27:00,530 --> 02:27:00,540
that they are as an organism yeah I mean
 

7361
02:27:00,540 --> 02:27:04,309
that they are as an organism yeah I mean
I don't know for for me the more time I

7362
02:27:04,309 --> 02:27:04,319
I don't know for for me the more time I
 

7363
02:27:04,319 --> 02:27:05,750
I don't know for for me the more time I
spend

7364
02:27:05,750 --> 02:27:05,760
spend
 

7365
02:27:05,760 --> 02:27:09,050
spend
um practicing meditation being seeing

7366
02:27:09,050 --> 02:27:09,060
um practicing meditation being seeing
 

7367
02:27:09,060 --> 02:27:11,630
um practicing meditation being seeing
through these illusions

7368
02:27:11,630 --> 02:27:11,640
through these illusions
 

7369
02:27:11,640 --> 02:27:14,330
through these illusions
um the more poignant

7370
02:27:14,330 --> 02:27:14,340
um the more poignant
 

7371
02:27:14,340 --> 02:27:18,530
um the more poignant
my conscious experience becomes and love

7372
02:27:18,530 --> 02:27:18,540
my conscious experience becomes and love
 

7373
02:27:18,540 --> 02:27:20,929
my conscious experience becomes and love
is obviously one of the most powerful

7374
02:27:20,929 --> 02:27:20,939
is obviously one of the most powerful
 

7375
02:27:20,939 --> 02:27:23,450

and one of the most positive experiences
 

7377
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:26,270
and one of the most positive experiences
we have and I don't know there's just

7378
02:27:26,270 --> 02:27:26,280
we have and I don't know there's just
 

7379
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:28,730
we have and I don't know there's just
there's whatever its cause is there's

7380
02:27:28,730 --> 02:27:28,740
there's whatever its cause is there's
 

7381
02:27:28,740 --> 02:27:31,190
there's whatever its cause is there's
just something miraculous about it

7382
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:31,200
just something miraculous about it
 

7383
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,190
just something miraculous about it
in and of itself and for itself

7384
02:27:34,190 --> 02:27:34,200
in and of itself and for itself
 

7385

scientific collaborations are like this

7398
02:27:48,950 --> 02:27:48,960
scientific collaborations are like this
 

7399
02:27:48,960 --> 02:27:50,630
scientific collaborations are like this
too uh

um um well I just started working
without a clear

7450
02:28:40,630 --> 02:28:40,640
without a clear
 

7451
02:28:40,640 --> 02:28:44,270
without a clear
a clear image of the end result although

7452
02:28:44,270 --> 02:28:44,280
a clear image of the end result although
 

7453
02:28:44,280 --> 02:28:46,849
a clear image of the end result although
it started with an idea for a film

7454
02:28:46,849 --> 02:28:46,859
it started with an idea for a film
 

7455
02:28:46,859 --> 02:28:48,889
it started with an idea for a film
um I don't know I guess I have a feeling

7456
02:28:48,889 --> 02:28:48,899
um I don't know I guess I have a feeling
 

7457
02:28:48,899 --> 02:28:50,809
um I don't know I guess I have a feeling
I was thinking wondering if I talked

didn't hear that thought that's that's I
mean we were mentioning this offline as

7474
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:05,760
mean we were mentioning this offline as
 

7475
02:29:05,760 --> 02:29:07,370
mean we were mentioning this offline as
a small attention there's a cool dynamic

7476
02:29:07,370 --> 02:29:07,380
a small attention there's a cool dynamic
 

7477
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:09,830
a small attention there's a cool dynamic
in how we get to become really close

7478
02:29:09,830 --> 02:29:09,840
in how we get to become really close
 

7479
02:29:09,840 --> 02:29:12,110
in how we get to become really close
friends without never having met never

7480
02:29:12,110 --> 02:29:12,120
friends without never having met never
 

7481
02:29:12,120 --> 02:29:14,570
friends without never having met never
having talked one way but it could be

7482
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:14,580
having talked one way but it could be
 

7483
02:29:14,580 --> 02:29:16,790
having talked one way but it could be
one-way friendships that form it's a

7484
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:16,800
one-way friendships that form it's a
 

7485
02:29:16,800 --> 02:29:19,250
one-way friendships that form it's a
beautiful thing I I think I don't know

7486
02:29:19,250 --> 02:29:19,260
beautiful thing I I think I don't know
 

7487
02:29:19,260 --> 02:29:21,650
beautiful thing I I think I don't know
that that makes me feel like we're all

7488
02:29:21,650 --> 02:29:21,660
that that makes me feel like we're all
 

7489
02:29:21,660 --> 02:29:23,030
that that makes me feel like we're all
connected yeah and you're almost like

7490
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:23,040
connected yeah and you're almost like
 

7491
02:29:23,040 --> 02:29:25,130
connected yeah and you're almost like
plugging into some kind of weird yeah

7492
02:29:25,130 --> 02:29:25,140
plugging into some kind of weird yeah
 

7493
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:27,010
plugging into some kind of weird yeah
thing yeah

7494
02:29:27,010 --> 02:29:27,020
thing yeah
 

7495
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,969
thing yeah
there's so many things I want to say now

7496
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:28,979
there's so many things I want to say now
 

7497
02:29:28,979 --> 02:29:31,910
there's so many things I want to say now
but here's one thing is the way I think

7498
02:29:31,910 --> 02:29:31,920
but here's one thing is the way I think
 

7499
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:35,690
but here's one thing is the way I think
about Consciousness if it's fundamental

7500
02:29:35,690 --> 02:29:35,700
about Consciousness if it's fundamental
 

7501
02:29:35,700 --> 02:29:38,270
about Consciousness if it's fundamental
um is analogous to a pot of boiling

7502
02:29:38,270 --> 02:29:38,280
um is analogous to a pot of boiling
 

7503
02:29:38,280 --> 02:29:40,010
um is analogous to a pot of boiling
water where the water is the

7504
02:29:40,010 --> 02:29:40,020
water where the water is the
 

7505
02:29:40,020 --> 02:29:42,290
water where the water is the
Consciousness and the bubbles are the

7506
02:29:42,290 --> 02:29:42,300
Consciousness and the bubbles are the
 

7507
02:29:42,300 --> 02:29:45,050
Consciousness and the bubbles are the
conscious experiences and so

7508
02:29:45,050 --> 02:29:45,060
conscious experiences and so
 

7509
02:29:45,060 --> 02:29:47,690
conscious experiences and so
it is all one thing and then there are

7510
02:29:47,690 --> 02:29:47,700
it is all one thing and then there are
 

7511
02:29:47,700 --> 02:29:50,510
it is all one thing and then there are
these shapes that take form and they

7512
02:29:50,510 --> 02:29:50,520
these shapes that take form and they
 

7513
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:52,370
these shapes that take form and they
there's a felt experience right it's all

7514
02:29:52,370 --> 02:29:52,380
there's a felt experience right it's all
 

7515
02:29:52,380 --> 02:29:55,370
there's a felt experience right it's all
felt experience and so when we're able

7516
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:55,380
felt experience and so when we're able
 

7517
02:29:55,380 --> 02:29:58,969
felt experience and so when we're able
to let go of this sense of self or this

7518
02:29:58,969 --> 02:29:58,979
to let go of this sense of self or this
 

7519
02:29:58,979 --> 02:30:00,830
to let go of this sense of self or this
illusion of self

7520
02:30:00,830 --> 02:30:00,840
illusion of self
 

7521
02:30:00,840 --> 02:30:03,530
illusion of self
um the idea that experiences are

7522
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:03,540
um the idea that experiences are
 

7523
02:30:03,540 --> 02:30:06,050
um the idea that experiences are
happening to something or to someone

7524
02:30:06,050 --> 02:30:06,060
happening to something or to someone
 

7525
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:08,630
happening to something or to someone
drops out and what you get is just

7526
02:30:08,630 --> 02:30:08,640
drops out and what you get is just
 

7527
02:30:08,640 --> 02:30:12,290
drops out and what you get is just
experiences arising so there's the

7528
02:30:12,290 --> 02:30:12,300
experiences arising so there's the
 

7529
02:30:12,300 --> 02:30:13,969
experiences arising so there's the
fundamental nature of the universe which

7530
02:30:13,969 --> 02:30:13,979
fundamental nature of the universe which
 

7531
02:30:13,979 --> 02:30:16,429
fundamental nature of the universe which
obviously has a structure and obeys laws

7532
02:30:16,429 --> 02:30:16,439
obviously has a structure and obeys laws
 

7533
02:30:16,439 --> 02:30:19,389
obviously has a structure and obeys laws
but what you get out of that are

7534
02:30:19,389 --> 02:30:19,399
but what you get out of that are
 

7535
02:30:19,399 --> 02:30:21,770
but what you get out of that are
appearances of different conscious

7536
02:30:21,770 --> 02:30:21,780
appearances of different conscious
 

7537
02:30:21,780 --> 02:30:24,170
appearances of different conscious
experiences they're they're just

7538
02:30:24,170 --> 02:30:24,180
experiences they're they're just
 

7539
02:30:24,180 --> 02:30:27,590
experiences they're they're just
coming into being right and so

7540
02:30:27,590 --> 02:30:27,600
coming into being right and so
 

7541
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:30,290
coming into being right and so
there is under that view I mean there

7542
02:30:30,290 --> 02:30:30,300
there is under that view I mean there
 

7543
02:30:30,300 --> 02:30:31,610
there is under that view I mean there
are different ways to look at the

7544
02:30:31,610 --> 02:30:31,620
are different ways to look at the
 

7545
02:30:31,620 --> 02:30:32,929
are different ways to look at the
fundamental nature of reality without

7546
02:30:32,929 --> 02:30:32,939
fundamental nature of reality without
 

7547
02:30:32,939 --> 02:30:34,550
fundamental nature of reality without
Consciousness and kind of come up with a

7548
02:30:34,550 --> 02:30:34,560
Consciousness and kind of come up with a
 

7549
02:30:34,560 --> 02:30:36,349
Consciousness and kind of come up with a
similar view but

7550
02:30:36,349 --> 02:30:36,359
similar view but
 

7551
02:30:36,359 --> 02:30:39,410
similar view but
in that view it is just kind of one it's

7552
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:39,420
in that view it is just kind of one it's
 

7553
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:42,550
in that view it is just kind of one it's
one thing with different experiences

7554
02:30:42,550 --> 02:30:42,560
one thing with different experiences
 

7555
02:30:42,560 --> 02:30:46,090
one thing with different experiences
and in that Boiling Pot is a lobster

7556
02:30:46,090 --> 02:30:46,100
and in that Boiling Pot is a lobster
 

7557
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:49,010
and in that Boiling Pot is a lobster
which represents the Human Condition the

7558
02:30:49,010 --> 02:30:49,020
which represents the Human Condition the
 

7559
02:30:49,020 --> 02:30:51,830
which represents the Human Condition the
devil because it's because life is

7560
02:30:51,830 --> 02:30:51,840
devil because it's because life is
 

7561
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:52,969
devil because it's because life is
suffering I don't know if you've read

7562
02:30:52,969 --> 02:30:52,979
suffering I don't know if you've read
 

7563
02:30:52,979 --> 02:30:55,550
suffering I don't know if you've read
Pastor Wallace consider the lobster I

7564
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:55,560
Pastor Wallace consider the lobster I
 

7565
02:30:55,560 --> 02:30:58,070
Pastor Wallace consider the lobster I
mean it's no I think the stuff that due

mean it's no I think the stuff that due
 

7567
02:30:58,080 --> 02:31:00,610
mean it's no I think the stuff that due
to lobsters is fascinatingly

7568
02:31:00,610 --> 02:31:00,620
to lobsters is fascinatingly
 

7569
02:31:00,620 --> 02:31:03,530
to lobsters is fascinatingly
but oh yeah no I mean that that was my

7570

my first rejection of many worlds just
my psychological rejection of it was

7574
02:31:09,590 --> 02:31:09,600
my psychological rejection of it was
 

7575
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:12,889
my psychological rejection of it was
just imagining the multiplication of all

7576
02:31:12,889 --> 02:31:12,899
just imagining the multiplication of all
 

7577
02:31:12,899 --> 02:31:15,530
just imagining the multiplication of all

um thinking about consumed by and trying
 

7583
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:24,590
um thinking about consumed by and trying
not to be overwhelmed by the depth of

7584
02:31:24,590 --> 02:31:24,600
not to be overwhelmed by the depth of
 

7585
02:31:24,600 --> 02:31:27,349
not to be overwhelmed by the depth of
human suffering to imagine many worlds

7586
02:31:27,349 --> 02:31:27,359
human suffering to imagine many worlds
 

7587
02:31:27,359 --> 02:31:29,630
human suffering to imagine many worlds
with his just infinite suffering oh my

you spent too much on Twitter is focused
 

7593
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:36,710

7602
02:31:47,510 --> 02:31:47,520
memory as you said uh the suffering is
 

7603

memory as you said uh the suffering is
Multiplied it's it's uh it's an

7604

Multiplied it's it's uh it's an
 

7605
02:31:50,819 --> 02:31:54,469
Multiplied it's it's uh it's an
interesting thought but with memory

7606
02:31:54,469 --> 02:31:54,479
interesting thought but with memory
 

7607
02:31:54,479 --> 02:31:56,090
interesting thought but with memory
um

7608
02:31:56,090 --> 02:31:56,100
um
 

7609
02:31:56,100 --> 02:31:58,250
um
beauty is Multiplied as well so it's

7610
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:58,260
beauty is Multiplied as well so it's
 

7611
02:31:58,260 --> 02:32:02,030
beauty is Multiplied as well so it's
like yes where I stand with it and I'm

7612
02:32:02,030 --> 02:32:02,040
like yes where I stand with it and I'm
 

7613
02:32:02,040 --> 02:32:04,550
like yes where I stand with it and I'm
for some reason still optimistic that we

7614
02:32:04,550 --> 02:32:04,560
for some reason still optimistic that we
 

7615
02:32:04,560 --> 02:32:07,790
for some reason still optimistic that we
can get ourselves to a different place

7616
02:32:07,790 --> 02:32:07,800
can get ourselves to a different place
 

7617
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:11,570
can get ourselves to a different place
but the way things currently are

7618
02:32:11,570 --> 02:32:11,580
but the way things currently are
 

7619
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:13,010
but the way things currently are
um or the way things have always been

7620
02:32:13,010 --> 02:32:13,020
um or the way things have always been
 

7621
02:32:13,020 --> 02:32:15,889
um or the way things have always been
for for animals and humans and I think

7622
02:32:15,889 --> 02:32:15,899
for for animals and humans and I think
 

7623
02:32:15,899 --> 02:32:19,670
for for animals and humans and I think
any any conscious life form is

7624
02:32:19,670 --> 02:32:19,680
any any conscious life form is
 

7625
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:20,690
any any conscious life form is
um

7626
02:32:20,690 --> 02:32:20,700
um
 

7627
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:24,610
um
to me the suffering seems so much

7628
02:32:24,610 --> 02:32:24,620
to me the suffering seems so much
 

7629
02:32:24,620 --> 02:32:30,230
to me the suffering seems so much
more impactful and powerful than any

7630
02:32:30,230 --> 02:32:30,240
more impactful and powerful than any
 

7631
02:32:30,240 --> 02:32:32,090
more impactful and powerful than any
happy for lack of a better word

7632
02:32:32,090 --> 02:32:32,100
happy for lack of a better word
 

7633
02:32:32,100 --> 02:32:34,670
happy for lack of a better word
experience that

7634
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:34,680
experience that
 

7635
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:38,389
experience that
no happy experience is worth

7636
02:32:38,389 --> 02:32:38,399
no happy experience is worth
 

7637
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:41,030
no happy experience is worth
it's equivalent

7638
02:32:41,030 --> 02:32:41,040
it's equivalent
 

7639
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:44,630
it's equivalent
experience of suffering

7640
02:32:44,630 --> 02:32:44,640

 

7641
02:32:44,640 --> 02:32:47,330

that's certainly how I feel as well but

7642
02:32:47,330 --> 02:32:47,340
that's certainly how I feel as well but
 

7643
02:32:47,340 --> 02:32:49,730
that's certainly how I feel as well but
I I've learned not to trust my feelings

suffering or those kinds of questions I
think

7660
02:33:06,590 --> 02:33:06,600
think
 

7661
02:33:06,600 --> 02:33:10,250
think
I think

7662
02:33:10,250 --> 02:33:10,260

 

7663
02:33:10,260 --> 02:33:14,450

7665
02:33:14,460 --> 02:33:17,030

it does seem that suffering is a deep

7666
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:17,040
it does seem that suffering is a deep
 

7667
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,130
it does seem that suffering is a deep
part of human history

02:33:19,130 --> 02:33:19,140
part of human history
 

7669
02:33:19,140 --> 02:33:22,070
part of human history
and uh if the if to really think about

and uh if the if to really think about
that part of nature it means part of

7672
02:33:24,469 --> 02:33:24,479
that part of nature it means part of
 

7673
02:33:24,479 --> 02:33:25,790
that part of nature it means part of
nature if

7674
02:33:25,790 --> 02:33:25,800
nature if
 

7675
02:33:25,800 --> 02:33:28,670
nature if
feeling good is surviving and thriving

7676

02:33:39,950 --> 02:33:39,960
end and only uh
 

7685
02:33:39,960 --> 02:33:41,990
end and only uh
it's kind of hilarious to then think

7686
02:33:41,990 --> 02:33:42,000
it's kind of hilarious to then think
 

7687
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,910
it's kind of hilarious to then think
about most of Nature and the cruelty and

7688
02:33:43,910 --> 02:33:43,920
about most of Nature and the cruelty and
 

7689
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:46,610

7704
02:34:04,849 --> 02:34:04,859
and so on you also have to consider the
 

7705
02:34:04,859 --> 02:34:07,370
and so on you also have to consider the
Suffering The Animals we try to imagine

7706
02:34:07,370 --> 02:34:07,380
Suffering The Animals we try to imagine
 

7707

happy time notes like you have to really
 

7711
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,730
happy time notes like you have to really
consider if you really asked an animal

7712
02:34:13,730 --> 02:34:13,740
consider if you really asked an animal
 

7713
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:16,510
consider if you really asked an animal

7773
02:35:30,359 --> 02:35:32,090
um I'm gonna get it wrong but it's
something like

7774
02:35:32,090 --> 02:35:32,100
something like
 

7775
02:35:32,100 --> 02:35:35,330
something like
um we're here to awaken from our

7776
02:35:35,330 --> 02:35:35,340

illusion of separateness
and I don't really see that as an answer
