00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,110
drill it 50 times you know with
resistance in big groups you know doing

1280
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
resistance in big groups you know doing
 

1281
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,830
resistance in big groups you know doing
drills over and over again picking apart

1282
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:15,840
drills over and over again picking apart
 

1283
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,430
drills over and over again picking apart
the details of the technique and what

1284
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:17,440
the details of the technique and what
 

1285
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,950
the details of the technique and what
they're doing wrong showing them how to

1286
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:18,960
they're doing wrong showing them how to
 

1287
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,190
they're doing wrong showing them how to
fix it but now we've done it so much

1288
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:21,200
fix it but now we've done it so much
 

1289
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,190
fix it but now we've done it so much
that now we can do a whole drill session

1290
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
that now we can do a whole drill session
 

1291
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,310
that now we can do a whole drill session
with them where they know all the

1292
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
with them where they know all the
 

1293
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,390
with them where they know all the
different techniques inside and out and

1294
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:26,400
different techniques inside and out and
 

1295
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,310
different techniques inside and out and
they can move from position to position

1296
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:28,320
they can move from position to position
 

1297
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,870
they can move from position to position
really quickly do they do it for uh a

1298
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:30,880
really quickly do they do it for uh a
 

1299
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,110
really quickly do they do it for uh a
period of time like two minutes five

1300
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:33,120
period of time like two minutes five
 

1301
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,830
period of time like two minutes five
minutes or is it like one do they're

1302
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:35,840
minutes or is it like one do they're
 

1303
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,549
minutes or is it like one do they're
actually counting no sometimes it's both

1304
00:22:38,549 --> 00:22:38,559
actually counting no sometimes it's both
 

1305
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,470
actually counting no sometimes it's both
so sometimes we do it for reps sometimes

1306
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:40,480
so sometimes we do it for reps sometimes
 

1307
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,830
so sometimes we do it for reps sometimes
we do it for time

1308
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:41,840
we do it for time
 

1309
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,990
we do it for time
yeah so sometimes it might be as many as

1310
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,000
yeah so sometimes it might be as many as
 

1311
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,230
yeah so sometimes it might be as many as
they can do in in 60 seconds or as many

then when you go to europe and you try

1542
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
then when you go to europe and you try
 

1543
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,149
then when you go to europe and you try
to do rounds with the europeans they are

1544
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
to do rounds with the europeans they are
 

1545
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,110
to do rounds with the europeans they are
very physical they don't have that same

1546
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,120
very physical they don't have that same
 

1547
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,350
very physical they don't have that same
finesse in their training that they do

1548
00:26:59,350 --> 00:26:59,360
finesse in their training that they do
 

1549
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,510
finesse in their training that they do
in japan and in europe you'd be

1550
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:01,520
in japan and in europe you'd be
 

1551
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,110
in japan and in europe you'd be
hard-pressed to do eight rounds of

1552
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,120
hard-pressed to do eight rounds of
 

1553
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,669
hard-pressed to do eight rounds of
randori in a night it's so physically

1554
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:05,679
randori in a night it's so physically
 

1555
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,070
randori in a night it's so physically
exhausting because so much effort is

1556
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:08,080
exhausting because so much effort is
 

1557
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,149
exhausting because so much effort is
going into just fighting and fending off

1558
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
going into just fighting and fending off
 

1559
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,470
going into just fighting and fending off
the gripping system and the power of

1560
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:12,480
the gripping system and the power of
 

1561
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,950
the gripping system and the power of
your opponent you're physically drained

1562
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
your opponent you're physically drained
 

1563
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,549
your opponent you're physically drained
after eight rounds of randori so it's a

1564
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
after eight rounds of randori so it's a
 

1565
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,510
after eight rounds of randori so it's a
much different feel when you say europe

1566
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
much different feel when you say europe
 

1567
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,310
much different feel when you say europe

russia is there a lot so
 

1571
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,230
russia is there a lot so
there's a kind of

1572
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:26,240
there's a kind of
 

1573
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,070
there's a kind of
similarity to all of those kinds of

1574
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,080
similarity to all of those kinds of
 

1575
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,590
similarity to all of those kinds of
approaches the only difference would be

1576
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:29,600
approaches the only difference would be
 

1577
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,230
approaches the only difference would be
russia that they do a lot more active

1578
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,240
russia that they do a lot more active
 

1579
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,870
russia that they do a lot more active
drilling a lot more sequential movement

1580
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:34,880
drilling a lot more sequential movement
 

1581
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,029
drilling a lot more sequential movement
training they don't focus as much on

1582
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:37,039
training they don't focus as much on
 

1583
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,909
training they don't focus as much on
randori you'll do much fewer rounds in

1584
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:39,919
randori you'll do much fewer rounds in
 

1585
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,950
randori you'll do much fewer rounds in
russia

1586

russia
 

1587
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,110
russia
during training camps than you would in

1588
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:43,120
during training camps than you would in
 

1589
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,470
during training camps than you would in

you know so we know the same guy four
 

1667
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,269
you know so we know the same guy four
times those two people four you know two

1668
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
times those two people four you know two
 

1669

pushed to the limit so we train

1674
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
pushed to the limit so we train
 

1675
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,350
pushed to the limit so we train
differently

1676
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,360
differently
 

1677
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,350

people maybe four of them are travis's
 

1697
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,870
people maybe four of them are travis's
size you know maybe there's only one

1698
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:34,880
size you know maybe there's only one

1701
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,070
girl in the room for kayla she's got to
train with guys and then the other ones

1702
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,080
train with guys and then the other ones
 

1703
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,070
train with guys and then the other ones
are teenagers that are too weak to train

1704
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,080
are teenagers that are too weak to train
 

1705
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,909
are teenagers that are too weak to train
with either one of them so what we would

1706
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:41,919
with either one of them so what we would
 

1707
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,669
with either one of them so what we would
do is just put together four or five

1708
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
do is just put together four or five
 

1709
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,590
do is just put together four or five
people that could you know give them a

1710
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
people that could you know give them a
 

1711
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,510
people that could you know give them a
challenge and we'd line them up and they

1712
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:47,520
challenge and we'd line them up and they
 

1713
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,190
challenge and we'd line them up and they
would do a minute a minute a minute a

1714
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:49,200
would do a minute a minute a minute a
 

1715
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,029
would do a minute a minute a minute a
minute and then do five minutes in a row

1716
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:51,039
minute and then do five minutes in a row
 

1717
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,389
minute and then do five minutes in a row
as hard as they can

1718
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:52,399
as hard as they can
 

1719
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,230
as hard as they can
that person can go hard for a minute

1720
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,240
that person can go hard for a minute
 

1721
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,149
that person can go hard for a minute
with travis or kayla they can't go five

1722
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:56,159
with travis or kayla they can't go five
 

1723
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,669
with travis or kayla they can't go five
minutes hard but they can go one minute

1724
00:29:57,669 --> 00:29:57,679
minutes hard but they can go one minute
 

1725
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,389
minutes hard but they can go one minute
hard so it made their training much

1726
00:30:00,389 --> 00:30:00,399
hard so it made their training much
 

1727
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,549
hard so it made their training much
much more intense much more physically

1728
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:02,559
much more intense much more physically
 

1729
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:05,430
much more intense much more physically
demanding and then rinse and repeat that

1730
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:05,440
demanding and then rinse and repeat that
 

1731
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,830
demanding and then rinse and repeat that
six times or eight times in a night

1732
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
six times or eight times in a night
 

1733
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,269
six times or eight times in a night
you know they just got 40 minutes of

1734
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
you know they just got 40 minutes of
 

1735
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,269
you know they just got 40 minutes of
intense randori the person that was

1736
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,279
intense randori the person that was
 

1737

intense randori the person that was
training with them that wasn't as good

1738
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
training with them that wasn't as good
 

1739
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,549
training with them that wasn't as good
only had to do six or eight minutes of

what like when i when we were talking

5246
01:29:43,189 --> 01:29:43,199
what like when i when we were talking

injuries themselves as the problem

5252
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
injuries themselves as the problem
 

5253

like because i asked them something like
 

5273
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,870

do you regret sort of pushing your body
to

5276
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:11,920
to
 

5277
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,750
to
all of those places that resulted in

5278
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:13,760
all of those places that resulted in
 

5279
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,030
all of those places that resulted in
those injuries

5280
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,040
those injuries
 

5281
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,830
those injuries
he was his response was like no i'm

5282
01:30:17,830 --> 01:30:17,840
he was his response was like no i'm
 

5283
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,430
he was his response was like no i'm
stronger now

5284
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:19,440

01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:21,760
so i don't know if that's justification
 

5287
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:23,990
so i don't know if that's justification

and that was presumably not so difficult
 

5415
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:38,790
and that was presumably not so difficult
but later in his career

5416
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:38,800
but later in his career
 

5417

5650
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
but part of the challenge is because the
 

5651
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,030

5655
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,350
and more i mean just smaller
is um

5656
01:36:45,350 --> 01:36:45,360
is um
 

5657
01:36:45,360 --> 01:36:47,590
is um
you know all the different places you go

5658
01:36:47,590 --> 01:36:47,600
you know all the different places you go
 

5659
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,109
you know all the different places you go
for to do the weight cut to do the diet

5660
01:36:51,109 --> 01:36:51,119
for to do the weight cut to do the diet
 

5661
01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,390
for to do the weight cut to do the diet
to do the preparation or the recovery

5662
01:36:54,390 --> 01:36:54,400
to do the preparation or the recovery
 

5663
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,189

there's like that process changes

5664
01:36:57,189 --> 01:36:57,199
there's like that process changes
 

5665
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:58,870
there's like that process changes
every time

5666
01:36:58,870 --> 01:36:58,880
every time
 

5667
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:00,470
every time
so it's you're basically have to

5668
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:00,480
so it's you're basically have to
 

5669
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,470
so it's you're basically have to
improvise a lot oh yeah you show up to a

5670
01:37:02,470 --> 01:37:02,480
improvise a lot oh yeah you show up to a
 

5671
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,669
improvise a lot oh yeah you show up to a
hotel

5672
01:37:03,669 --> 01:37:03,679
hotel
 

5673
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:05,270
hotel
and how you do the weight cut you don't

5674
01:37:05,270 --> 01:37:05,280

times a week but it's not a system a
 

7649
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:25,910
times a week but it's not a system a
dojo uh

7650
02:10:25,910 --> 02:10:25,920

not
the problem with most judo dojos right

7658
02:10:33,510 --> 02:10:33,520
the problem with most judo dojos right
 

7659
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:34,950
the problem with most judo dojos right
now is that

7660
02:10:34,950 --> 02:10:34,960
now is that
 

7661
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,550
now is that
most of them cater towards the

7662
02:10:36,550 --> 02:10:36,560
most of them cater towards the
 

7663
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:39,030
most of them cater towards the
competitive side

7664
02:10:39,030 --> 02:10:39,040
competitive side
 

7665
02:10:39,040 --> 02:10:41,430
competitive side
also a lot of them do it recreationally

7666
02:10:41,430 --> 02:10:41,440
also a lot of them do it recreationally
 

7667
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:42,790
also a lot of them do it recreationally
meaning this isn't how they make a

7668
02:10:42,790 --> 02:10:42,800
meaning this isn't how they make a
 

7669
02:10:42,800 --> 02:10:44,390
meaning this isn't how they make a
living so they're there three nights a

7670
02:10:44,390 --> 02:10:44,400
living so they're there three nights a
 

7671
02:10:44,400 --> 02:10:45,990
living so they're there three nights a
week or they're there five even if

7672
02:10:45,990 --> 02:10:46,000
week or they're there five even if
 

7673
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:47,350
week or they're there five even if
they're there five nights a week it's

7674
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:47,360
they're there five nights a week it's
 

7675
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:49,030
they're there five nights a week it's
still only

7676
02:10:49,030 --> 02:10:49,040
still only
 

7677
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:50,870
still only
one junior class and one senior class

7678
02:10:50,870 --> 02:10:50,880
one junior class and one senior class
 

7679
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,189
one junior class and one senior class
and that's it and it's one size fits all

7680
02:10:53,189 --> 02:10:53,199
and that's it and it's one size fits all
 

7681
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,629
and that's it and it's one size fits all
doesn't matter what level you're at it's

7682
02:10:54,629 --> 02:10:54,639
doesn't matter what level you're at it's
 

7683
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:56,470
doesn't matter what level you're at it's
one size fits all so

7684
02:10:56,470 --> 02:10:56,480
one size fits all so
 

7685
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,149
one size fits all so
you can't get out of the training what

7686
02:10:58,149 --> 02:10:58,159
you can't get out of the training what
 

7687
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:59,270
you can't get out of the training what
you're looking to get out of the

7688
02:10:59,270 --> 02:10:59,280
you're looking to get out of the
 

7689
02:10:59,280 --> 02:11:00,790
you're looking to get out of the
training it's whatever the instructor's

7690
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:00,800
training it's whatever the instructor's
 

7691
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,430
training it's whatever the instructor's
teaching you know

7692
02:11:03,430 --> 02:11:03,440
teaching you know
 

7693
02:11:03,440 --> 02:11:04,870
teaching you know
and you can't learn because it's not at

7694
02:11:04,870 --> 02:11:04,880
and you can't learn because it's not at
 

7695
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:06,470
and you can't learn because it's not at
the appropriate level for you and

7696
02:11:06,470 --> 02:11:06,480
the appropriate level for you and
 

7697
02:11:06,480 --> 02:11:08,229
the appropriate level for you and
usually you're pushed into doing randori

7698
02:11:08,229 --> 02:11:08,239
usually you're pushed into doing randori
 

7699
02:11:08,239 --> 02:11:09,589
usually you're pushed into doing randori
where you have no choice but to do the

7700
02:11:09,589 --> 02:11:09,599
where you have no choice but to do the
 

7701
02:11:09,599 --> 02:11:11,589
where you have no choice but to do the
randori part of the training

7702
02:11:11,589 --> 02:11:11,599
randori part of the training
 

7703
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:12,950
randori part of the training
um

7704
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:12,960
um
 

7705
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:14,709
um
so it's it's a challenge to go learn and

7706
02:11:14,709 --> 02:11:14,719
so it's it's a challenge to go learn and
 

7707
02:11:14,719 --> 02:11:16,790
so it's it's a challenge to go learn and
then a lot of times the the schools are

7708
02:11:16,790 --> 02:11:16,800
then a lot of times the the schools are
 

7709
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:17,990
then a lot of times the the schools are
old school

7710
02:11:17,990 --> 02:11:18,000
old school
 

7711
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,830
old school

7712
02:11:19,830 --> 02:11:19,840
so they go make you do falls for a half
